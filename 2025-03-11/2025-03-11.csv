White House officials say the US will impose 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, rather than the 50% Donald Trump announced earlier

The rollback comes after the Canadian province of Ontario said it would temporarily suspend its plan to charge a 25% tariff on electricity it sends to northern US states

That reversal came after US President Trump had said he would double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium from 25% to 50% in retaliation to the Ontario threat 

According to the province's Premier Doug Ford, negotiations between his province and the Trump administration are ongoing, with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick inviting Ford to Washington

As a reminder: Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. The companies that bring the goods into the country pay the tax to the government

Trump said the tariffs will begin on Wednesday, adding that he'll declare ""a national emergency on electricity"" in those states

Doug Ford suspends electricity surcharge until meeting with US

Edited by Caitlin Wilson and Alys Davies

Alex LedermanUS reporter

It seems the day will end as it began on the tariffs front - with the US planning to impose a 25% surcharge on steel and aluminium imported from Canada, as well from everywhere else in the world, starting at midnight. 

But in the intervening hours, economic threats and then rollbacks have flown back and forth across the US-Canadian border all day.

Just a few days ago, I was in the room as Canada's Liberal Party gathered to elect its next leader on Sunday. With the US president's warnings from across the border, the anti-Trump feeling in the room was palpable.

The red maple leaf Canadian flag hung everywhere in sight. 

Canadians - usually stereotyped for being so polite - were ready for a fight. 

 A once-dejected Liberal Party felt rejuvenated. With a trade war looming and a widespread feeling that Canadian sovereignty could be under threat, the party had a newfound sense of purpose. 

""In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win,"" the newly selected party leader Mark Carney told a roaring crowd.

Polls showed a huge bounce back from near-certain defeat to the Conservatives in the coming general election. 

 Just hours before, hundreds of ordinary Canadians made their voices heard outside Parliament.

“We are not for sale!"" one sign read. ""Not a 51st anything,"" another poster said, held high.

""If there's anybody out there threatening my home, I want to be a part of the fight against that,"" one woman told us. 

The entire political landscape has changed in Canada. With Donald Trump's tariffs and threats, Canadians have rallied around their flag.



It's been a hectic Tuesday for North American trade, with threats of fees on imported goods flying back and forth between the US and Canada like a ping pong ball.  

Yesterday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a 25% surcharge on electricity sent from the province to the US, threatening to ""shut off electricity completely"" if the US were to further escalate the ongoing trade war. Trump retaliated by doubling the US's upcoming 25% global steel and aluminium tariffs to 50% for Canada. 

But then by this afternoon, both parties had stepped back from these vows.

Head spun? Here's an approximate timeline of how it all went down, in Eastern Daylight Time: 

10:30 am Trump announces an additional 25% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminium in retaliation to Doug Ford's Monday electricity surcharge threat, bringing the import fee to 50%

12:25 pm When asked why Mexico wasn't facing the same fees, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum responded: ""We're respectful"" 

12:40 pm Ford says he will meet with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, adding that shutting off electricity to various northern US states is the “last thing” he wants to do 

13:45 pm White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calls Ontario's threat to shut down electricity imports to the US ""egregious and insulting"". When asked if the US still considers Canada a close ally, she says they ""might be a competitor now""

13:55 pm Canada's next Prime Minister Mark Carney posts on social media, calling the new tariff hike ""an attack”, saying his government will ""ensure our response has maximum impact in the US and minimal impact here in Canada"" 

14.05 pm The Canadian Chamber of Commerce says that without its country's exports, ""the US won't have enough of either metal to satisfy the needs of its demanding economy"", suggesting Trump's promised ""golden era"" would therefore not be possible 

14:50 pm Ford says he will suspend the electricity surcharge after Lutnick reached out to him in a phone call with an ""olive branch"", adding that he will be headed to Washington on Thursday to negotiate with the US trade secretary and is ""pretty confident"" Trump will back down on the additional tariff hikes 

15:35 pm Trump says he's ""looking at"" walking back the additional hikes and ""could make a different decision"" 

16:50 pm White House officials Lutnick and Peter Navarro confirm Trump has reversed his plans to double the steel and aluminium tariffs to Canada to 50%, and say the 25% tariff will go into effect as scheduled at midnight for Ottawa and the rest of the world

Much of today's tariff discussion was centred around Canadian energy imports to the United States.

President Donald Trump blamed the province of Ontario's now-rescinded move to place a 25% surcharge on electricity heading into the US as the reason for his now-cancelled decision to double steel and aluminium tariffs.

But how much electricity does the US import from Canada ?

When Ontario's leader Doug Ford announced the 25% surcharge on electricity exports, he suggested that the measure would impact 1.5 million homes and businesses across the northern states of Minnesota, Michigan and New York. 

Canadian Minister Stephen Lecce has also claimed that Canada sells 12,000 megawatts of power into the US market each day, and is a “30 times net exporter” to the US - “they need our power”, he says.

According to Electricity Canada, external, a trade association for Canadian energy suppliers, the US imports electricity from its neighbour because it makes sense for affordability.

The trade association says that cross-border trade in electricity works by allowing regions to coordinate with neighbours to draw on each other's surplus supplies when excess electricity isn't being used, therefore keeping costs down and avoiding overbuilding. 

For instance, it says, Canadians tend to use more electricity during winter for heating, while demand in the US is higher during the summer, when it is needed for cooling.

The White House says Donald Trump has delivered ""a win for the American people"", after Ontario Premier Doug Ford dropped his threat to impose a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the US.

In response, Trump had also threatened to double the rate of aluminium and steel tariffs on Canada from 25% to 50%. He has also since walked back on this threat.

""President Trump has once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world,"" the statement says.

The White House says Trump's plans for a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium will still take effect on Wednesday - ""with no exceptions or exemptions"". 

Jessica MurphyReporting from Toronto

Marty Warren, the national director for the union representing steelworkers in Canada, tells the BBC the on-again-off-again threats of tariffs from the US on his industry are ""reckless"" and have been a cause of major anxiety for workers.

""Our members are scared,"" Warren of the United Steelworkers tells the BBC. Earlier on Tuesday, the union said the tariffs would be an ""industry killer"" that would lead to job losses.

Warren says that his union has been in discussions with its US counterpart to send a message that these tariffs stand to hurt both American and Canadian workers.

""We're relying on allies. Some won't speak up,"" he acknowledges. ""Some will, but we're trying to work closely and lobby the people that we think we can get a message through.""

He adds his union members are not only concerned about tariffs, but also the sovereignty of Canada as US President Donald Trump repeats his desire to make Canada ""the 51st state.""

Warren notes that this second Trump administration is different from his first, which also imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium back in 2018. They were rolled back the following year.

""Trump said he would take Canada through economic means,"" he says. ""This constant threat, this constant disrespect for Canadians and Canada's sovereignty is what makes it different.""

Charging some of its closest allies and trade partners more to import goods might seem counterintuitive for the US.  

But by making imports more expensive, Trump is hoping to stoke demand for US-made goods, helping to boost domestic manufacturing.  

Trump has also said he wants to raise money for the government through the fees. 

Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News the president's “goal is to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the out outsiders pay” - a proposal the president has dubbed the “External Revenue Service”. 

If trade dries up though, it's not clear how much revenue tariffs will raise. 

Before the media left the room, Trump made some wide-ranging opening remarks at the business roundtable event, covering everything from ceasefire negotiations regarding the war in Ukraine to the success of Doge.

He spoke briefly about tariffs, saying they're having a ""tremendously positive impact"".

He claimed car companies have relocated their manufacturing from Mexico to the US. He also accused China of owning the plants being built in Mexico, adding that tariffs had put a stop to that now. 

The relocation of industry to the US is a ""bigger win"" than the money being brought in by the tariffs, he said.

After President Trump entered the roundtable event and made his opening remarks, the media present appear to have been asked to leave shortly after he began answering questions.

Our feed has been cut. Online feeds run by other outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and Fox, have also been turned off.

President Trump is now meeting the CEOs of America's largest companies for a roundtable discussion, where the current economic situation is sure to be top of the agenda.

Around 100 business leaders are expected to be in attendance at the regular meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, DC. Those in the room will include the CEOs of Apple, JPMorgan Chase and Walmart.

The meeting comes as US stock markets plummeted in response to Trump's threats of tariffs on neighbouring Canada and Mexico, as well as other nations.

The market drop signals anxiety on the part of investors, who worry that the tariffs could trigger an economic slowdown or cause a recession. 

Trump himself declined to rule out the possibility of a recession in an interview with Fox News last week, saying: ""I hate to predict things like that"" after acknowledging that his policies will bring about a period of transition. 

In addition to senior US trade adviser Peter Navarro, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has now also confirmed that the White House will no longer impose 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium, according to the BBC's US media partner, CBS news. 

Trump had earlier suggested a reversion to 25% tariffs could happen today. 

The original 25% tariffs will still go into effect on Wednesday, Lutnick says. 

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

Senior White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has confirmed that the administration has reversed plans to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium.

Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Navarro says the change happened after Ontario's Premier Doug Ford backed down from his electricity surcharge, which Navarro described as ""sounding ominous"".

""I think he [Doug Ford] kind of understood that this was not going to be a fight,"" Navarro says. ""I've encouraged our friends in Canada to keep the rhetoric down."" 

The 25% tariffs on aluminium and steel will still be enforced. 

Earlier, Navarro said Ford was a ""politician in Canada"" rather than an economist. 

Additionally, while Navarro said the transition to ""Trumponomics"" could be a ""little bumpy"", he said the administration was confident. 

""If you're a stock market investor and you understand Trumponomics, you will be bullish, and you won't fall prey to daily volatility and get fleeced by day traders,"" Navarro added. 

While President Donald Trump has hinted he might consider cutting back on the 50% tariffs he's announced on Canadian steel and aluminium, plans are currently still in place to bring in 25% tariffs on these materials from midnight on Wednesday for several countries.

US steel and aluminium imports from a number of countries, including Canada, its biggest steel supplier, will be taxed at a minimum of 25%.

The other countries listed in his executive order, external signed in February include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, EU countries, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and the UK. 

The order revokes exemptions for tariffs Trump had made for those countries during his first term, in 2018. It also increases aluminium tariffs from 10% to 25%.

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

It's rare to see a White House news conference in any administration where a US ally is spoken about in the tone used today with regard to Canada, even in periods when officials in Washington have clearly been exasperated with their partners abroad.

At one point, Leavitt recited statistics on the cost of living in major Canadian cities, saying their residents would be “better served” if, as Trump has suggested, Canada becomes the 51st state of the US.

The White House posture towards Canada is starkly different to the stance on Mexico, which has also faced the threat of tariffs. 

Just recently, for example, Trump said he had a “great relationship” with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, whom the Washington Post this week dubbed “the world's greatest Trump whisperer”.

Nadine YousifReporting from Toronto

We just heard from Ontario's leader Doug Ford, who announced at the top of his news conference that he has agreed to temporarily pause a 25% surcharge to electricity his province sends to 1.5 million American homes, after US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick extended an ""olive branch"".

Earlier today, President Trump threatened to double tariffs he planned to impose tomorrow on Canadian steel and aluminium in response to Ontario's electricity hike. This afternoon, after Ford spoke, Trump said he could cut back on import duties.

All eyes will now be on a meeting that is set to take place between Ford and Lutnick. That will happen on Thursday in Washington, according to Lutnick. Among those in attendance will be Canada's Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc.

Ford cautioned that Ontario still has electricity as a bargaining chip. But he said that he would not deny an opportunity to sit down with the Americans and let ""cooler heads prevail"".

Trump to 'probably' cut Canada tariffs after Doug Ford's reversal

We've just heard a response from Donald Trump following Doug Ford's reversal on imposing a 25% tariff on electricity flowing from his province to northern US states. 

The president tells reporters at the White House that he's now considering cutting back on the 50% tariffs he announced earlier on Tuesday.

Trump said he's ""looking at it"" and could ""make a different decision"".

Trump then confirmed that the ""strong man in Canada"" - referring to Ford, who also earlier threatened to cut off electricity exports to the US - has suspended his own tariff plans.

""I respect that,"" Trump said. 

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said ""I'm glad they listened"" in a post on social media, after Canada's Doug Ford announced a pause on plans to end his territory's energy exports to some US states. 

Tensions quickly flared between Ford and Trump on Tuesday, after Ford said he would ""not hesitate"" to stop supplying the US with electricity in response to Trump's tariffs, and Trump in turn said Canada would pay a price ""so big it will be read about in history books for years to come"".

Lutnick announced that he and Ford have agreed to meet in Washington on Thursday ahead of Trump's 2 April deadline for reciprocal tariffs.

In response, Ontario agreed to suspend its 25% surcharge on exports of electricity to Michigan, New York and Minnesota, Lutnick said. 

Ontario Premier Doug Ford has just finished speaking to the press in Toronto after a back and forth over tariffs between the US and Canada.  

Here's what you need to know:  

One other notable soundbite from that news conference with Ontario Premier Ford.

He told reporters: ""You can't attack your number one customer, Canada, and not expect a response.""

He said the country had responded to US tariffs and the next step was to negotiate.  

Calling himself a “businessperson”, he said he wanted to find a solution to “stop the bleeding”. 

Ford added that China was sitting back and laughing at the US and Canada's trade spat. 

Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent

As President Trump escalated his trade war with
Canada and US stocks rode a rollercoaster, White House press
secretary Karoline Leavitt painted an upbeat picture earlier today.

Setbacks are only “temporary”. 

Economic warning
signs are just a “snapshot in time”. 

Manufacturing job numbers are strong, and
foreign investments are up. 

And to whatever extent there are problems with the
US economy, it is because of Trump's predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden.

American voters tend to have short memories,
however, and blaming current conditions on a president who left office in
January is unlikely to fly for long – particularly when economic uncertainty
has been exacerbated by Trump's own actions.

That short memory ultimately may end up helping
Trump and his team, however, if their trade and government-slashing plans do
eventually lead to the kind of growth they have promised. 

Congressional
elections aren't until November 2026, and this is still early in Trump's second
term.

There is plenty of time to bounce back. But
every day on this current trajectory means the political hole the president is
digging gets deeper, whether Leavitt acknowledges that from the White House
podium or not.

Ford says that when someone extends an ""olive branch"", he would thank them for the opporutnity.

""All you folks have seen how President Trump has changed things on a daily basis,"" Ford said. ""I don't want to wait until April 2,"" when Trump said reciprocal tariffs would kick in, Ford said.

""God only knows"" what would happen between now and that deadline, he said.

Just before 09:00, police on their radios were given the all-clear to begin removing the cordons.

Officers stationed at one of the many entrances to Old Market Square, which had been closed to members of the public, began wrapping up the reams of police tape tied around lamp-posts and strung across entrances to streets - blocking the path of trams and the public. 

There were more than a dozen police vehicles dotted around the scene, a fire engine parked on Old Market Square and the bomb disposal unit to the entrance of Friar Lane.

David Conway, director of operations at Nottingham City Transport (NCT), spoke to BBC Radio Nottingham this morning.

He said the package that police responded to had been reported outside the former Debenhams store in Long Row, along Old Market Square.

The market square in Nottingham is usually a convenient cut-through for people to get to their workplaces. But this morning, a cordon seals off all entrances after the suspicious package was found.

Schoolchildren, business workers, a window cleaner and a police officer walk by at the entrance to Long Row, where one of the cordons blocks off the tramlines which wrap their way around the market place. 

People are understanding of the potential seriousness of the situation but are having to find alternative bus stops or ways to get to their final destination. 

The mood is one of uncertainty but police say they expect the matter to be over within a couple of hours.

The US has unblocked military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine, while the latter has agreed to a proposed “immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire” with Russia, the two nations announced on Tuesday after talks in Saudi Arabia. Kiev has also agreed to conclude a comprehensive agreement on Ukraine's critical resources with Washington “as soon as possible.”

“Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the US proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation,” the joint statement reads. Washington has said it will communicate the proposal to Russia shortly.

The US will now “immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.” Washington and Kiev have also discussed “humanitarian relief efforts,” including potential prisoner of war swaps, “release of civilian detainees” and other actions.

During the meeting, the delegations discussed long-term security guarantees for Ukraine, US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said without providing further detail. Kiev has agreed to work on a critical resources deal with the US and pledged to sign it “as soon as possible.”

Thus far, Moscow has not provided any official reaction to the statements made following the US-Ukraine talks in Jeddah. The Russian leadership has previously signaled that any temporary ceasefire deal was unacceptable and would only benefit Kiev and its Western backers.

“The goal should not be a short truce, not some kind of respite for regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing the conflict, but a long-term peace based on respect for the legitimate interests of all people, all nations living in this region,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in January.

US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has announced that he will get in touch with his “Russian counterpart” in the coming days to discuss a potential settlement to the Ukraine conflict.

The official made the remark following negotiations with a Ukrainian delegation, who reportedly agreed to Washington's proposal for an interim ceasefire.

At a press conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia late on Tuesday, Waltz said that the Ukrainian delegation had made it clear that “they share President [Donald] Trump's vision for peace” and “his determination to end the fighting.” The official added that Kiev's representatives had “made concrete steps and concrete proposals.”

“I will talk to my Russian counterpart in the coming days,” Waltz added.

According to the US national security advisor, “as a result of this positive step forward, the president has decided to lift the pause on aid and on our security assistance to Ukraine going forward and that's effective immediately.”

The official was referring to the suspension of assistance that had followed a heated altercation between Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky and President Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance at the White House late last month.

Rubio, in turn, stated that the Ukrainian delegation had expressed readiness to enter into a ceasefire and into immediate negotiations with Russia. The secretary of state added that the “ball is now in [Moscow's] court,” saying he is hopeful Russia will “say yes to peace.”

When asked if the ceasefire is partial or comprehensive, the secretary of state reiterated that the “offer is to stop the shooting,” stressing that halting hostilities is essential for further peace negotiations.

“Obviously now that'll be delivered to the Russians… through our diplomatic channels,” the diplomat clarified. He said that Washington seeks a permanent resolution to the conflict “in a way that's acceptable and enduring for both sides.”

Replying to a question as to whether Washington has set any “deadline” for Moscow to respond, Rubio said that the US hopes “the Russians will answer… yes as quickly as possible, so we can get to the second phase of this which is real negotiations, not never-ending dialogue.”

He argued that the “best goodwill gesture the Russians can provide” is to agree to an immediate cessation of the fighting.

Since before his inauguration in January, President Trump has promised to quickly end the Ukraine conflict. Recently, he pressured Kiev to abandon its demand for the restoration of pre-conflict borders and compromise with Russia. After his confrontation with Zelensky last month, Trump concluded that Ukraine was not ready for peace and warned that continued resistance could lead the US to cut off aid.

The Kremlin has expressed its readiness to engage in dialogue with Ukraine, provided that Ukraine acknowledges the “reality on the ground.” President Putin has previously advocated a comprehensive solution to the conflict's root causes rather than just a temporary truce.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would impose an even higher levy on Canadian imports, doubling steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%. He also reiterated that he wants to annex the world's second largest country, stating that the only way to resolve the tariffs standoff would be for Canada to become the “cherished” 51st state of the US.

Trump announced the move in a post on his platform Truth Social, explaining that the hike in tariffs was in response to the 25% retaliatory surcharge on electricity exports to the US imposed on Monday by Ontario, Canada's most populous province.

“I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,” Trump wrote, adding that the hike would come into effect on Wednesday.

The president also demanded Canada drop what he had described as “anti-american farmer tariff of 250% to 390% on various US dairy products,” as well as other “egregious” levies. A failure to comply will result in further action, namely the targeting of Canadian car production using measures set to “essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business,” Trump warned.

Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada early in February, but delayed them for a month, until last Tuesday. Exemptions were granted to Canadian automakers and goods covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) until April. Ottawa responded by imposing tariffs on $30 billion worth of American products, with an additional $125 billion in duties set for next month.

Trump also repeated his claims that the US has been “subsidizing” Canada by more than $200 billion a year, but suggested joining the United States as “our cherished Fifty First State” would be the best way to fix the outstanding issues between the two nations, and that both of them would greatly benefit from it.

Starting in December 2024, Trump and his close circle repeatedly expressed support for the idea of taking over Canada. The idea has been rejected by Canadian leaders and the population alike. A recent YouGov poll suggested that up to 77% of Canadians firmly oppose annexation, while only some 15% are in favor of it.

Incoming Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has vowed to fight and win the trade war with Washington, admitting however, that “this victory will not be easy.” Carney also rejected ceding sovereignty to the US, stating on Sunday that “Canada never, ever will be part of America in any way, shape, or form.”

US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would likely hold phone talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin this week, expressing hope Moscow would agree to a proposed 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine.

Trump made the remarks to reporters shortly after Ukrainian and American delegations met in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where Kiev agreed to Washington's proposal for a ceasefire with Moscow. The US president said striking such an agreement would greatly aid in reaching a final deal to end the conflict.

“So, hopefully, [Putin will] also agree. And I really think that would be 75 percent of the way. The rest is getting it documented. You know, negotiating land positions, etc,” Trump stated.

Should Russia not agree to the ceasefire, “we just keep going on,” the US president said, warning that “lots of people” would be killed. Russian and US officials are expected to hold a meeting “today and tomorrow” to negotiate, he said.

Shortly after Trump delivered his remarks, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that contacts between Moscow and Washington in the coming days could not be ruled out. According to a reporter with the Kremlin pool, Dmitry Smirnov, a phone conversation between the US and Russian presidents will be held on Friday.

Thus far, Moscow has not provided any official reaction to the statements made following the conclusion of US-Ukraine talks in Jeddah. Previously, top Russian officials have stated that a temporary truce is not a solution to the Ukrainian conflict, and that the root problems must be addressed instead.

A pause in the hostilities will be only used by Kiev and its backers to rearm and get ready for a new round of fighting, Moscow has suggested.

US electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla saw its value slashed by some 15% on Monday, as part of a massive US stock market sell-off on March 10 that came after President Donald Trump refused to rule out a recession.

Several major indexes slumped, with big tech emerging as the biggest loser.

For Elon Musk's EV brainchild, Monday's bloodbath marked its biggest loss in a single day since 2020. Tesla's woes, however, did not start overnight. The automaker's share has slid by 50% - representing more than $800 billion in market value - since its December peak.

Speaking to Bloomberg, Michael Rosen, chief investment officer of Angeles Investment Advisors, attributed the market turmoil to Trump's efforts to “break the international economic regime, presumably with a plan to fix and replace it with something better.”

“Absent a clear idea of what ‘better' is, investors are just left with the detritus of the broken global economic framework. Unless and until we see what replaces it, investors will be cautious, at best,” he predicted.

Trump refused to explicitly rule out that the US economy is headed for a recession, during an interview with Fox News over the weekend, saying that “there is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big.”

However, he official expressed confidence that in the end, “it should be great for us.”

Last month Trump announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with 10% duties on Chinese goods. While Trump has since granted several reprieves, Ottawa has nevertheless retaliated with tariffs of its own, as has Beijing.

As for Tesla, aside from the continuous slump in value, it has recently become the target of multiple protests, and even arson attacks on its dealerships.

In a post on X on Monday, Musk pointed the finger at ActBlue, a major Democratic fundraising platform funded by billionaire George Soros among other sponsors.

Trump posted a message in support of the electric car manufacturer on his TruthSocial platform on Tuesday, accusing “Radical Left Lunatics” of “trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla.”

“I'm going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk,” the US president wrote.

The Western media is rife with rumors and falsehoods regarding Russia's stance on a potential peace settlement with Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. He urged journalists and the wider population to rely on official sources of information.

Peskov's remarks come as the US continues to push for a peace deal between Moscow and Kiev. AFP reported on Monday that Ukrainian officials plan to propose an air and naval truce during talks with US representatives in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Bloomberg earlier cited unnamed sources in Moscow as claiming that Russia was open to discussing a temporary truce if progress was made toward a final settlement.

The Kremlin spokesman, however, dismissed the claim on Tuesday, saying Western media was filled with “incorrect information” and “rumors that do not correspond to reality.”

The Kremlin spokesperson warned journalists against using unnamed sources, urging them to rely solely on “official sources of information and on specific statements by specific people.”

Multiple media outlets, including Reuters and Bloomberg, have also reported that US President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, will visit Moscow this week to meet President Vladimir Putin. Bloomberg said the trip is timed to coincide with the US-Ukraine talks in Riyadh.

Peskov declined to confirm Witkoff's visit, saying the public would be “informed in due course.”

Last month, the White House initiated efforts to broker a ceasefire in the Ukraine conflict. Since taking office in January, Trump has pushed for closer ties with Moscow and indicated on Sunday that “big meetings” were planned with both Russia and Ukraine. The approach contrasts with the more confrontational stance toward the Kremlin that was adopted by the administration of Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden.

US-made F-16 fighter jets supplied to Ukraine by Western nations cannot fully compete with Russia's Su-35 multirole fighter in aerial combat, Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson Yuri Ignat has said.

Washington approved F-16 deliveries to Kiev in mid-2023, allowing NATO allies to send jets and train Ukrainian pilots.

Speaking to Ukrainian TV channel Novosti.Live on Tuesday, Ignat pointed out “the modifications that Ukraine has cannot compete one-on-one in an air battle. We need a comprehensive approach as the [Russian] Su-35 is a relatively new jet…” he said. “This includes ground-based air defense, electronic warfare systems, and ideally, an airborne radar. Also crucial are onboard radars for our aircraft and air-to-air missiles.” 

Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway have pledged to supply Ukraine with 80 F-16s, though most will take years to arrive. In 2024, Ukraine received about 18 aircraft, but one F-16 was lost in August when a veteran pilot was killed in a crash. The cause remains unclear, with speculation about friendly fire from a Western-provided Patriot missile. Following the incident, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky dismissed the commander of the Air Force.

Kiev expected the F-16s to be a potential game-changer on the battlefield, but outdated radar systems and the absence of the Link 16 tactical network have limited their effectiveness.

Moscow has condemned Western arms shipments to Ukraine, saying they prolong the war without altering its course. It has also called F-16 deliveries an escalation. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the jets would not shift the battlefield situation and said Moscow would consider them legitimate targets if launched from third-country airfields.

US President Donald Trump has announced that an American delegation will meet with their Russian counterparts “today or tomorrow” (March 11-12), Reuters reported on Tuesday. 

The statement follows the conclusion of negotiations between the American and Ukrainian delegations in Saudi Arabia, during which Kiev agreed to a 30-day ceasefire and Washington committed to resuming intelligence sharing with Ukraine.

“That's a total ceasefire,” Trump told reporters outside the White House on Tuesday after the talks. “Ukraine has agreed to it. And hopefully Russia will agree to it.”

Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel to Moscow in the coming days to discuss the Ukraine conflict with Russian President Vladirmir Putin. But neither US nor Russian officials have publicly confirmed the trip or its exact date so far.

“We're going to meet with them [the Russians] later on today and tomorrow and hopefully we'll be able to [work] out a deal,” Trump continued. “I think the ceasefire is very important. If we can get Russia to do it, that'll be great. If we can't we just keep going on and people are gonna get killed, lots of people.”

Russia has yet to issue an official response to the statements following the US-Ukraine talks in Jeddah. Moscow has previously indicated that any temporary ceasefire deal is unacceptable, arguing it would only allow Kiev to regroup and rearm. Putin stated in January that Russia is seeking a long-term peace based on respect and the legitimate interests of all people living in the region.

Armed militants have seized a train in Pakistan's Balochistan province and are holding 450 passengers hostage, according to AFP news agency.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that its fighters struck the railway track with explosives before taking control of the train in the remote Sibi district, the news agency wrote, citing a statement issued by the group.

A senior railway official in Quetta, the capital of the province, has confirmed the seizure of hostages, according to AFP. The train driver is said to have been injured.

In a purported BLA statement circulating on social media, the group claims that 11 military personnel have been killed. The militants have reportedly threatened to kill all the hostages if the Pakistani authorities launch an operation to free them.

The group claims to have released women, children, and Baloch passengers from the train, and says it has kept 100 hostages who are active-duty personnel of the Pakistani military, police, the country's anti-terrorism force and intelligence officers.

BLA has also claimed that it has repelled a Pakistani military ground assault, but helicopters and drones continue to conduct airstrikes. It has demanded an immediate halt to the air bombardment, warning that otherwise the hostages will be executed within an hour.

BLA is an armed separatist group that has long sought independence for the Balochistan province from the central government in Islamabad. It has been designated as a terrorist organization by Pakistan and two other countries: the United Kingdom and the United States.

Balochistan is Pakistan's largest but least populated province; it is home to key mining projects and the ethnic Baloch minority.

The insurgents frequently target police and military forces in the region, as well as foreigners, particularly Chinese nationals assisting in the construction of Pakistan's infrastructure projects as part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative. Apart from the separatists, Islamist militants are known to operate in the area.

The train in question is reported to be the Jaffar Express, a passenger train operated daily by Pakistan Railways between Quetta and Peshawar.

Pakistan has repeatedly accused neighboring Afghanistan of providing a safe haven for BLA fighters, particularly before the Taliban took control of the country. However, there is no evidence that the new government in Kabul is cracking down on the separatists.

The pursuit and arrest of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant proves that the Hague-based court is a “weapon of Western influence,” Duane Dizon, a geopolitical and regional economy expert has told RT.

Duterte, 79 was arrested at Manila's international airport on Tuesday and taken into custody by police on orders from the ICC. Duterte is accused of crimes against humanity linked to a ‘war on drugs' during his presidency.

Speaking to RT Dizon said that the ICC's actions were “more about asserting clout than accountability.”

“The ICC has consistently shown a pattern of targeting leaders from developing nations while giving powerful Western countries a free pass” to control “weaker” nations, he said, adding that this could drive a “deeper wedge” between Southeast Asia and the West.

Human rights advocates have condemned the arrest as unlawful, pointing out that the Philippines formally withdrew from the ICC in 2019 under Duterte's directive.

The ICC claims it can retain jurisdiction over alleged crimes that may have taken place while the country was a signatory to the court.

The court launched a preliminary probe into Duterte's anti-drug campaign in 2018. Duterte has denied wrongdoing but admitted the crackdown was not bloodless. Official reports indicate that around 6,200 people were killed during police operations though observers suggest that the figure could be much higher.

On Sunday, Duterte told his supporters “if that's my fate, that's fine I will accept it. We can't do anything if I'm arrested or imprisoned.”

According to Dizon, the former president's arrest proves that the court exists to “undermine independent leadership,” prompting other nations to seek stronger ties with non-Western powers like China and Russia.

Established to prosecute grave crimes, the ICC has faced persistent criticism for its disproportionate focus on developing nations, particularly, on Africa, with many accusing it of neo-colonialism and selective justice, serving Western interests rather than impartial law.

The ICC's authority is also compromised by the absence of major powers such as the US, Russia, and China from its jurisdiction.

Recent US decisions on Ukraine should not be viewed through “rose-colored glasses,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said, cautioning against excessive optimism about a change in the conflict.

His statement comes after US President Donald Trump paused military aid and intelligence sharing with Kiev. Some EU nations, though, have continued to provide military data. 

While Moscow has welcomed Washington's suspension of assistance and expressed hope that it could push Kiev towards peace, Peskov has advised against blind optimism that such moves will have a significant or immediate effect.

Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Peskov stated that “there is no need to rush to put on rose-colored glasses now,” and that one should always “hope for the best and prepare for the worst.”

“Many are now rushing to say that the Americans will stop, or have already stopped, delivering weapons and that Musk will shut off his communications systems and everything will work out for us. Everything has been working out for us even without this,” Peskov said.

He also pointed out that even with a complete halt to US weapons shipments to Ukraine, Kiev has already received enough arms to continue fighting for many months. The Ukrainians could also quickly find an alternative to Starlink if needed, the spokesman added.

Last week, Trump ordered an indefinite halt to US military aid to Ukraine, suspending over $1 billion in arms and ammunition following a heated exchange with Vladimir Zelensky at the White House. During the meeting, Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of ingratitude and “gambling with World War III” by refusing to seek peace. Reports have indicated that Zelensky was then asked to leave the Oval Office and told to return only when ready for serious negotiations.

On Monday, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff stated that Zelensky had sent a letter to Trump apologizing for the incident. The US president has also confirmed receiving an “important” letter from the Ukrainian leader expressing readiness to negotiate.

The Ukrainian General Staff has confirmed that one of the targets of Tuesday's mass drone attacks was Russia's Druzhba oil pipeline system, a key delivery route to EU countries, according to a statement on its official Telegram channel.

Druzhba is one of the world's longest networks, transporting crude some 4,000km from Russia to refineries in the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia

“Ukraine's security services carried out the operation, reporting explosions near the linear production dispatching station ‘Stalnoi Kon' (Steel Horse) in Russia's Oryol region, which manages the pipeline's operations,” the statement read.

Hungary, which relies on oil shipments through the system, has called the attack “unacceptable” and accused Ukraine of threatening its sovereignty. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto announced that crude shipments via the pipeline had been temporarily halted, but later resumed. Szijjarto criticized the European Commission, arguing that assurances it had offered regarding the safety of Hungary's energy infrastructure had been repeatedly violated.

According to media reports, three Ukrainian fixed-wing drones struck the Druzhba terminal in Russia's Bryansk Region. The attack was part of a wider assault involving more than 340 UAVs hitting civilian targets across Russian territory, killing at least 3 people and injuring over 20 and causing a fire at a Rosneft oil depot in Bryansk.

Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Russian energy infrastructure throughout the conflict, despite resulting supply disruptions for Kiev's European allies.

In January, Ukrainian forces attempted to attack a compressor station of the TurkStream pipeline, which supplies natural gas to Turkish customers and several European countries, including Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Greece.

In March 2024, Ukrainian drones struck an oil refinery in the Krasnodar region, causing a fire and temporary shutdown. Similarly, in January of that year, a drone attack hit a fuel depot in St. Petersburg, reportedly damaging storage tanks.

The most notable attack on Russian energy infrastructure during the conflict was the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines in September 2022. The explosions, which severely damaged Nord Stream 1 and 2—key conduits for Russian gas exports to EU—sparked international speculation about the perpetrators. While various theories have emerged, no definitive culprit has been identified.

Moscow has condemned attacks on its civilian energy infrastructure, labeling them acts of terrorism.

Romania's Constitutional Court has rejected an appeal by presidential hopeful Calin Georgescu against the Central Electoral Bureau's (BEC) decision to bar him from taking part in a new election in May, according to the Associated Press.

On Tuesday, the court upheld BEC's ruling, confirming the invalidation of Georgescu's candidacy. The electoral body had dismissed his bid on Sunday, citing over 1,000 challenges. Georgescu was the clear favorite for the election rerun, polling between 40% and 45% in most recent surveys.

According to media reports, a crowd of supporters gathered outside the court in Bucharest, shouting “traitors” and “we are going nowhere.” They also chanted “Calin Georgescu is president” and “freedom,” with one woman holding a sign that read ‘Stop dictatorship.'

Georgescu scored an unexpected win in November's presidential election first round, receiving 23% of the vote. The result, however, was promptly annulled by the Constitutional Court over alleged “irregularities” in the campaign. The politician is known as an outspoken critic of NATO and the EU, and a staunch opponent of supporting Ukraine.

Preliminary findings of an investigation into the elections scandal, reported by media early this year, indicated the campaign “irregularities” likely were the result of actions of a consulting firm associated with the pro-Western National Liberal Party (PNL). The firm presumably tried to derail another candidate, but inadvertently boosted Georgescu instead.

Last month, Georgescu was briefly arrested and charged with “promoting fascist, racist, or xenophobic ideologies” and plotting “anti-constitutional acts.”

The politician has dismissed all the accusations as politically motivated, claiming that was being targeted by the Romanian “deep state,” and asked US President Donald Trump for help. Billionaire Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump, then reacted to Romania's election turmoil, calling the decision to bar Georgescu “crazy.”

ndian state-owned corporations are seeking tie-ups with international oil companies once the government has approved legislation which aims to bring investment and advanced technology to oil and gas exploration projects. 

Oil India Limited chairman and managing director Ranjit Rath told Moneycontrol on Monday that the industry is waiting for the approval of the Oilfields Regulation and Development (ORD) Amendment Bill, which was cleared by India's upper house of parliament in December and is set to be signed off by the lower house. 

Oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri earlier stated that India's growing economy would rely on oil and gas for another two decades, stressing the importance of securing long-term availability of energy resources. “We need to bring this legislation here to provide a win-win confidence not only to our own operators but also to foreign investors so that they can come and do business here with a view to benefit everyone,” he said.

The development comes as India is ramping up efforts to strengthen its energy security. Last month, the country launched its largest round of oil and gas blocks auctions, offering 25 blocks covering 191,986 square kilometers, mostly in offshore regions, according to a PTI report. It was the tenth round of bidding, with over 150 blocks auctioned since 2017.

While India is aiming to boost domestic exploration, the country has already emerged as the biggest exporter of refined oil products to the EU. Indian refiners have ramped up output in the past two years, after New Delhi opted to purchase discounted Russian oil despite Western pressure. In a report last year, the Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said India's fuel exports to Europe have soared. “In the first three quarters of 2024, exports to the EU from the Jamnagar, Vadinar and new Mangalore refinery – which are increasingly reliant on Russian crude – saw a 58% year-on-year rise,” the report said. 

India has navigated a delicate diplomatic balance in the Ukraine conflict, managing its close relationships with the US and Europe while simultaneously strengthening its strategic ties with Russia, which has become India's largest oil supplier. 

Moscow has made the largest foreign investment in India's refining sector to date, with a consortium led by Russian state-owned Rosneft Group buying a 98% stake in Essar Oil, one of India's largest refineries, for $12.9 billion in 2017. Subsequently, it was restructured as Nayara Energy, in which Rosneft has a 49.13% stake. The company now oversees the country's second-largest single-site refinery in the western state of Gujarat, with an annual capacity of 20 million tons.

In December last year, Indian privately-owned Reliance Group, operating the largest refinery in Gujarat, inked a ten-year deal with Rosneft for the shipment of 500,000 barrels per day of various crude grades. Worth roughly $13 billion a year at current prices, the energy deal is the biggest-ever between Moscow and New Delhi.

The Russian Defense Ministry has announced the liberation of 12 villages across Kursk Region, reporting a rapid advance against Ukraine's invasion force in the area.

Over the past 24 hours, Russian troops have recaptured more than 100 square kilometers of land, the ministry said in its daily briefing on Tuesday. The liberated locations named by the military include the villages of Agronom, Bogdanovka, Bondarevka, Dmitryukov, Zazulevka, Ivashkovsky, Kolmakov, Kubatkin, Martynovka, Mikhailovka, Pravda, and Yuzhny.

The development suggests that Russian troops are advancing on the town of Sudzha from the north, east, and southeast, while Ukrainian forces are apparently fleeing southwest across the river of the same name. According to media reports, Moscow's forces have already entered the town, which remains the largest settlement in Kursk Region under Kiev's control.

Over the past week, things have rapidly deteriorated for the Ukrainian force in Kursk Region, with its northern flank effectively collapsing. It remains unclear whether Kiev's troops will try to make a stand in Sudzha or retreat altogether.

The invasion force has long been experiencing logistics troubles, as the Russian military has gradually been cutting off its supply routes. Now, the remnants of the Ukrainian force are dependent on a single major cross-border road, which has been coming under constant drone and artillery strikes.

Kiev invaded Kursk Region last August, capturing Sudzha and multiple villages in its vicinity in a matter of days. The Ukrainian zone of control, however, has gradually been shrinking ever since, with the invasion force now having lost more than two-thirds of its initial gains.

The attack on Kursk Region has taken an extreme toll on the Ukrainian military, with the invasion force reporting up to 66,550 casualties during the operation, the latest estimates by the Russian Defense Ministry suggest. Nearly 400 Ukrainian tanks, more than 300 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), 272 armored personnel carriers (APCs), and over 2,000 other armored vehicles were destroyed or captured in the hostilities in the area.

Russian agricultural exports to African nations surpassed $7 billion in 2024, marking a 19% increase from the previous year, the export department of the Russian Ministry of Agriculture reported on Monday.

Russian food products were exported to 45 African countries last year, with Egypt remaining the largest importer of Russian wheat. Additionally, Russia exported sunflower and soybean oil, legumes, flax seeds, yeast, and other products to the country.

Algeria ranked second in terms of Russian food imports. It was followed by Libya, Kenya, and Tunisia, according to data from Agroexport.

Cereals – mainly wheat, barley, and corn – accounted for 87% of all food shipments to the continent. Dairy product exports also saw significant growth last year.

“In the 2023/2024 season, African countries imported 21.2 million tons of wheat, accounting for 38% of Russia's total wheat exports and setting a record high. For comparison, 17.6 million tons were imported in the 2022/2023 season, and 10.6 million tons in the 2021/2022 season. Over the past five years, Africa's share has remained steady at around 40%, except for the 2022/2023 season, when it dropped to 35%,” said Igor Pavensky, head of the analysis department at Rusagrotrans, a railway infrastructure operator company.

African countries already account for more than 50% of Russia's total wheat exports in the current season, with 18 million tons being shipped from July to February. The increase is driven by rising exports to Egypt, Algeria, Libya, and Morocco, as well as Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, Mozambique, Ethiopia, and other countries, Pavensky noted.

In January, Eduard Zernin, chairman of the Russian Union of Grain Exporters, highlighted Africa's rising demand for Russian grain, attributing it to high quality and competitive pricing.

“In the current 2024-25 season, [Russian] exports to Morocco and Nigeria have already increased significantly. Kenya, which is already one of the main importers of Russian grain, is also expanding its volumes,” he reported.

By the end of last year, Russia had overtaken France as Morocco's top grain supplier due to competitive pricing and France's limited supply, according to Ruslan Khasanov, head of the Center of Grain Quality Assurance, Russia's grain quality watchdog. Omar Yacoubi, head of the Moroccan National Federation of Grain and Legume Traders, told Reuters in October that France lacks sufficient supply, while Russia's competitive pricing has positioned it as the key “market maker.”

In April, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a 50% increase in agricultural exports by 2030 compared to 2021 levels, which totaled $37 billion.

The death toll from a major multi-wave Ukrainian drone attack on civilian sites in the area of the Russian capital has risen to three, after a 43-year-old man succumbed to his injuries in the hospital, Moscow Region Governor Andrey Vorobyov reported on Tuesday.

According to the Russian Defense Ministry, a total of 337 Ukrainian drones were neutralized on Tuesday night, with 91 of them intercepted over Moscow Region.

In a Telegram post, Vorobyov stated that the deceased man suffered a stomach wound, a broken shoulder, and a shin injury from shrapnel after drone debris fell into a parking lot. “Doctors fought for his life until the very end,” he wrote.

The man is survived by his wife and five-year-old son. “We will make sure the family is well taken care of,” Vorobyov said.

Like the other two victims of the drone attack, he was an employee of the Russian company Miratorg. A security guard was killed instantly, while two other men succumbed to their wounds in the hospital.

Moscow was hit by the largest-ever wave of Ukrainian kamikaze drones on Tuesday night. Russian air defenses intercepted hundreds of UAVs, according to officials.

At least one residential high-rise in the capital sustained damage from falling debris, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin confirmed. Outside the city, multiple buildings were also damaged, according to Vorobyov.

The Russian Investigative Committee has officially classified the Ukrainian operation as an act of terrorism. Moscow claims Kiev has resorted to such tactics due to setbacks on the battlefield.

First Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee Aleksey Zhuravlev told RIA Novosti that the “Kiev regime is close to its death throes” and will increasingly desperately attack Russia to escalate the conflict.

The attack came just hours before high-level discussions between US and Ukrainian officials are set to start in Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration has accused Vladimir Zelensky of stalling Washington's efforts to broker a truce with Moscow by refusing to compromise.

Moscow should employ its new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile system in response to a major Ukrainian drone attack targeting residential areas and civilian infrastructure inside Russia, a top MP has stated.

A total of 337 Ukrainian UAVs were shot down above Russian territory overnight, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said on Tuesday morning. Russian media described it as the largest drone raid by Kiev since the escalation between Russia and Ukraine in February 2022. In Moscow Region, three civilians were killed and more than a dozen wounded as a result of the attack, according to Governor Andrey Vorobyev.

When asked by journalists on Tuesday if Russia should strike Ukrainian targets with the Oreshnik in retaliation, the head of the Russian State Duma Defense Committee chairman Andrey Kartapolov replied that “the decision is up to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief [Russian President Vladimir Putin].”

“But I think it would be appropriate [to launch the Oreshnik], and it would be even better if it is more than one missile,” added the MP, who is a former deputy defense minister and holds the rank of colonel-general.

The Oreshnik missile, which was developed in secrecy, made its battlefield debut in November 2024 when it struck Ukraine's Yuzhmash military industrial facility in the city of Dnepr. According to Moscow, the state-of-the-art system was deployed in response to Kiev's attacks deep inside Russia with Western-supplied long-range weapons.

Putin said that the Oreshnik's multiple warheads travel at ten times the speed of sound and cannot be intercepted by any existing air defense. Following the successful strike, Russia announced the launch of serial production of Oreshnik missiles.

In a separate interview with RIA Novosti, Kartapolov insisted that the Ukrainian drone raid was a PR stunt by Kiev that “did not pursue any military goals.”

“This is purely a propaganda move aimed at showing the public, primarily the Americans, that they can still do something. But as usual, they can do nothing but wage war on the elderly, children, women and civilians,” he said.

The MP suggested that the UAV attack on Russia could be linked to the negotiations between US and Ukrainian delegations taking place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.

Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova noted that the raid came on the day when the head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Feridun Sinirlioglu, was visiting Moscow.

Moscow faced its largest-ever wave of Ukrainian kamikaze drones on Tuesday night, with Russian air defenses successfully intercepting hundreds of the incoming UAVs, according to officials.

Later in the day, senior Ukrainian and US officials are set to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss potential peace negotiations – a process President Donald Trump is pushing both Kiev and Moscow to embrace.

According to the Russian Defense Ministry, a total of 337 Ukrainian drones were neutralized overnight.

The ministry's statement detailed that 126 of these were intercepted over Kursk Region, which is adjacent to the Ukrainian border and well-covered by Russian air defenses; 91 were brought down over Moscow Region, which surrounds the capital.

Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin described the Ukrainian attack as the most extensive to have targeted the city, with at least 74 drones aimed directly at the capital. However, he only reported minor damage; the roof of an apartment complex was struck.

Moscow Region, however, sustained more serious consequences. Governor Andrey Vorobyov detailed casualties across three municipalities, with the most devastating incident occurring in Domodedovo. A disabled drone struck a parking lot at a food factory, killing a night guard instantly. Another worker suffered severe head injuries and died shortly after being hospitalized.

Two other victims remain in critical condition, Vorobyov stated, while Children's Ombudsman Maria Lvova-Belova has reported that three children have suffered minor injuries. Hours later Domodedovo head Evgenia Khrustalyova announced the death of another patient who had been admitted with injuries sustained in the attack.



The Russian Investigative Committee has officially classified the Ukrainian operation as an act of terrorism. Moscow claims Kiev has resorted to such tactics due to setbacks on the battlefield.

Russian MP Leonid Slutsky alleged that some of the intercepted drones were aimed at the Kursk nuclear power plant, calling it an act of “nuclear blackmail.”

Meanwhile, a resident of Sapornovo, whose home was damaged by a drone, reported discovering ball bearings — components often used in explosive payloads in order to maximize casualties.

The attack came just hours before high-level discussions between US and Ukrainian officials are set to start in Saudi Arabia. The Trump administration has accused Vladimir Zelensky of stalling Washington's efforts to broker a truce with Moscow by refusing to compromise.

In response to US criticism, Zelensky proposed a limited ceasefire that would halt long-range strikes from both sides, arguing that such a measure could facilitate negotiations. The Russian military has been destroying Ukrainian energy infrastructure, maintaining that these strikes cripple Kiev's ability to produce weapons and transport military assets.

Ukrainian forces have been launching kamikaze drones at high-value Russian sites, including oil refineries and gas pipelines, such as a key Black Sea fuel supply route to Türkiye.

Andrey Kovalenko, head of Kiev's Center for Countering Disinformation, directly linked the attack with the talks in Jeddah, calling it a signal to Moscow that Ukraine can cause “panic” among civilians, unless Zelensky's proposal is accepted.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called the outcome of the raid a testament to the capability of Russian air defenses, urging the media to direct questions about its timing to Kiev.

Andrey Kartapolov, a general-turned-MP who chairs the State Duma Defense Committee, suggested deploying Oreshnik medium-range missiles in retaliation. Speaking to a journalist, he called for multiple precision strikes using these advanced ballistic weapons.

Rodion Miroshnik, a senior Russian diplomat monitoring Ukrainian war crimes, described the attack as a strategic show of force orchestrated by Kiev and its European backers, particularly the UK, and other actors who oppose the emerging thaw in US-Russian relations.

London and Brussels have criticized Trump's decision to suspend new arms shipments to Ukraine in an effort to pressure Zelensky.

Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has suggested that the raid could serve as proof of Ukraine's “terrorist nature” for Feridun Sinirlioglu, Secretary General of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), who is visiting Moscow this week.

Hungary has accused Ukraine of threatening its sovereignty after Kiev launched a drone strike on the Druzhba oil pipeline on Tuesday. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has said shipments of Russian crude via the pipeline have been temporarily halted following the attack on a metering station.

In a video posted on Facebook, Szijjarto stressed that the Druzhba pipeline is a critical component of Hungary's energy infrastructure, pointing out that if it ceases to function, oil deliveries to Hungary and Slovakia would be “physically impossible.”

“We consider these attacks against our energy infrastructure targeting Hungary to be unacceptable,” the foreign minister said. “Hungary's energy supply is a matter of sovereignty and we expect everyone to respect this,” he added. 

Szijjarto noted that he had spoken to Russia's deputy energy minister, who has assured him that crude oil deliveries will likely be resumed within the next 24 hours.

The diplomat recalled that Budapest had repeatedly raised the issue of the safety of its energy infrastructure multiple times in Brussels, and had been given assurances by the European Commission that there would be no attacks on such facilities. “Unfortunately, this is already the umpteenth time when the EC's guarantee is violated,” Szijjarto pointed out. 

According to media reports, three Ukrainian fixed-wing drones attacked the Druzhba terminal in Bryansk Region on Tuesday night. No injuries were reported. The attack was part of a larger raid on Russia, which reportedly involved more than 340 UAVs, nearly a hundred of which were brought down near Moscow. The falling debris from the destroyed drones near the capital reportedly caused the death of at least three people, while over 20 civilians have been injured.

Ghanaian President John Dramani Mahama has paid visits to Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger for bilateral talks as part of efforts to convince the leaders of the three neighboring countries to reconsider their exit from the West African regional bloc.

The tour, which began on Saturday, came just days after Mahama announced during a visit to Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) that he will be a “bridge” between the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the breakaway member states.

“We've discussed issues of mutual interest. We've discussed the issue of AES [the Alliance of Sahel States] and ECOWAS. I've got new perspectives about the concern that the three countries have in respect of their relationship with ECOWAS,” he said on Monday, wrapping up his trip at a joint press conference with Burkinabe transitional leader Capt. Ibrahim Traore.

“I think there is a breakdown of trust among the leadership. It will take time to rebuild it but we have to work on it so that we restore trust and confidence in each other so that we can work together,” Mahama added.

Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger officially left ECOWAS on January 29 after military coups strained their relations with the grouping. They accused the regional authority of posing a threat to their sovereignty by serving as a tool for foreign powers, particularly France.

The bloc, home to more than 400 million people, had threatened to send a French-backed military force into Niger to restore democratic order after Nigerien President Mohamed Bazoum was overthrown in July 2023. The military-ruled landlocked states have severed defense ties with Paris, citing meddling and the failure of its soldiers to quell jihadist violence in the Sahel.

Togolese President Faure Gnassingbe and his Senegalese counterpart, Bassirou Diomaye Faye, had been tasked with negotiating the return of Bamako, Niamey, and Ouagadougou to ECOWAS. However, the three former French colonies have insisted that their decision is irreversible. They have now formed a new group, the AES, and invited other West African neighbors to join.

On Monday, Ghana's president said he would report back to ECOWAS on the outcomes of his meetings with the interim leaders of Bamako, Ouagadougou, and Niamey.

Moscow has repelled a major multi-wave Ukrainian drone attack, in which at least one residential high-rise in the capital has been damaged by falling debris, according to Mayor Sergey Sobyanin. Outside the Russian capital, at least one person has been killed and multiple buildings have been damaged, Moscow Region Governor Andrey Vorobyev has confirmed.

At least 69 incoming UAVs were shot down early Tuesday by air defenses southeast of the capital, Sobyanin wrote in a series of Telegram posts. According to the mayor, most of the drones were intercepted outside Moscow, and only one residential building in the city sustained damage, with no injuries reported.

“At the moment, the roof of a house in Moscow is slightly damaged by falling debris from a downed UAV on Domodedovo Street,” Sobyanin wrote, adding that emergency services were working at the scene.

However, at least three more residential buildings were damaged in the suburbs of Domodedovo, Vidnoye, and Ramenskoye, according to Vorobyev. He confirmed that one person was killed and three others were injured in those incidents.

“The debris of a drone hit an apartment building in Ramenskoye, damaging at least seven apartments on the 19th to 22nd floors,” Vorobyev said, confirming previous eyewitness accounts and videos circulating on social media.

Moscow's Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo, Vnukovo and Zhukovsky international airports have suspended operations in response to the drone raid.

Kiev last attempted to launch a major drone attack on Moscow in November, when as many as 32 UAVs were shot down or intercepted over several Russian regions while heading toward the capital.

Meanwhile, the Russian regions of Belgorod, Kursk, Kherson, and Bryansk, as well as Russia's Donetsk People's Republic – all of which border Ukraine – have suffered the most from Kiev's shelling and drone attacks. On Monday, at least four people were killed in a missile strike on a shopping center in Kursk; another three civilians died in an attack on a market in Kherson Region the day before.

Kiev is increasingly resorting to terrorist tactics, the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Aleksandr Bortnikov, warned last month. Ukraine will attempt to carry out strikes deep into Russian territory using drones and Western-supplied weapons, with the goal of “inflicting maximum economic damage and intimidating the population,” the top security official said.

Ukraine launched a large-scale drone attack on Russia to specifically coincide with a visit to Moscow by the head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said.

A total of 337 Ukrainian UAVs were shot down above Russian territory overnight, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said on Tuesday morning. Most of the drones were intercepted in Kursk and Moscow Regions, where 129 and 91 UAVs were downed respectively. In Moscow Region, three civilians were killed and more than a dozen wounded as a result of the raid, according to governor Andrey Vorobyev.

Zakharova wrote on Telegram on Tuesday that it was no coincidence that “the Kiev regime sent UAVs towards the capital when it was visited by OSCE Secretary General [Feridun Sinirlioglu].”

“This is not the first time that a trip to Moscow by a high-ranking foreign delegation is being accompanied by a Ukrainian drone attack,” she stressed.

The spokeswoman also expressed regret that during the conflict between Russia and Ukraine the OSCE “has been reduced to merely a talking shop, deprived of its original purpose of ensuring security and cooperation in Europe, by the sponsors of [Ukrainian leader Vladimir] Zelensky.”

According to an earlier statement, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will be holding a meeting with Sinirlioglu in Moscow on Tuesday.

A wide range of topics connected to Russia's interactions with the OSCE and its leadership will be discussed during the talks, the statement read. Moscow also intends to raise the issue of the safety of journalists and ways to increase the effectiveness of the organization's work in this area, it added.

Zakharova said on Monday that the OSCE continues to be in the “deepest existential and institutional crisis,” but expressed hope that there will be “a constructive, comprehensive exchange of opinions” between Lavrov and Sinirlioglu.

The last time the secretary general of the OSCE visited Moscow was in June 2021, more than half a year before the escalation between Russia and Ukraine. At the time, the organization was headed by Helga Schmid.

Moscow has accused the OSCE of multiple failings throughout the Ukraine conflict, including a lack of objectivity.

Last year, Russia criticized the OSCE for failing to denounce the killings of Russian civilians by Ukrainian forces during their raids in border regions. It also accused the organization of covering up irregularities in the Moldovan presidential election, which was won pro-Western President Maia Sandu.

Earlier this month, former Greek ambassador to Ukraine Vasilios Bornovas claimed that OSCE observers who had been working in Donbass between 2014 and 2022 secretly shared intelligence with Kiev.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has strongly condemned what it described as a “barbaric” and “cowardly” attack by Kiev on multiple Russian regions, including Moscow, in the early hours of Tuesday, just ahead of US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia.

The assault, involving a record-large number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), some reportedly loaded with shrapnel to maximize casualties, resulted in three civilian deaths and multiple injuries in the Moscow Region. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, a total of 337 Ukrainian drones were neutralized overnight, including 91 near Moscow and 126 over Kursk Region.

“The neo-Nazi Kiev junta has once again proven its terrorist nature,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday evening, suggesting the attack was deliberately timed to coincide with diplomatic discussions in Saudi Arabia and a visit by the OSCE Secretary General to Moscow.

“Without a doubt, this drone attack was planned in advance and timed to coincide with today's US-Ukraine contacts on conflict resolution held in Saudi Arabia. It was also a message to new OSCE Secretary General Feridun Sinirlioglu,” Moscow said, accusing the “Kiev clique, which is suffering daily defeats on the battlefield,” of attempting to show its ability to negotiate “from a position of strength.”

Following the talks in Saudi Arabia, Kiev agreed to a US-proposed “immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire” with Russia, while Washington lifted restrictions on military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine. Russia has yet to issue an official response to the developments in Jeddah.

“The Zelensky regime, which has lost its grip on reality, has clearly shown a glaring lack of political will for achieving peace and a negotiated settlement of the conflict. It remains obsessed with the idea of defeating Russia, widely using cynical methods of terror and seeking to draw its backers into its aggressive actions,” the ministry stated before the Jeddah talks concluded.

US President Donald Trump indicated on Tuesday that he would likely hold phone talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin soon, expressing hope that Moscow would agree to the proposed 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine.

Moscow has previously indicated that any temporary ceasefire deal is unacceptable, arguing it would only allow Kiev to regroup and rearm, insisting on a permanent, legally binding solution that addresses the core causes of the conflict. Putin stated in January that Russia is seeking a long-term peace based on respect and the legitimate interests of all people living in the region.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The European Union has a message for the Trump administration: It will continue supporting Ukraine against Russia's illegal invasion, step up humanitarian aid when others pull back, and boost global teamwork to address the world's challenges.

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas never mentioned the United States in her speech to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday. But her points were clearly aimed at President Donald Trump 's dismissive language about Europe, his massive cutbacks in aid to poor and conflict-torn countries, and his administration's reluctance to acknowledge that Russia invaded Ukraine.

Following talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, the Trump administration said it was lifting its suspension of military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine, and Kyiv signaled that it was open to a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia. The U.S.-Ukraine deal is now pending Moscow's agreement. 

Looking at the world 80 years after the U.N. was founded on the ashes of World War II, Kallas said its foundations are facing “unprecedented pressure.” She cited blatant violations of the U.N. Charter, “attempts to replace the rule of law by the rule of force,” and universal principles promoting peace, human rights and development “under heavy fire.”

At a news conference afterward, she said, “The world is more dangerous now than it has ever been since the Cold War.”




Kallas told the council, “The EU will remain the U.N.'s reliable partner of choice” and will defend the U.N. Charter, which says every country must respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations.

That's why it has supported Ukraine's right to self-defense and stands with Kyiv “for a just and lasting peace in line with the Charter,” she said, stressing that Russia must lose its “colonial war.”

The EU will always support rising humanitarian needs, with almost 2 billion euros this year, she said, a dig at the Trump administration, which dismantled the U.S. aid agency and is eliminating 83% of its programs.

Kallas also stressed the need to boost multilateralism and engage with partners, which “is the only way forward in solving issues.”

She was asked afterward about a Trump comment that the EU was created to destroy the U.S. when it comes to trade and was asked whether the 27-nation bloc could overcome that antagonism.

Surrounded by diplomats from all EU member nations, Kallas replied that the EU is “a peace project” created to ensure there would be no more wars among its members.

Right now, “our relations with third parties around the world show that everybody is looking at us because we are the reliable, predictable partner,” she said. “So, I really see the possibility to grow Europe's geopolitical presence.”

The EU came under attack from Russia during the Security Council meeting.

After Kallas pledged to continue EU support to Ukraine, Russia's U.N. ambassador blasted the European bloc for what it called a long history of anti-Russian sentiment.

“This sensible club aimed at integration, which used to promote cooperation with Russia, has today definitively turned into a fossilized, aggressive Russophobia bloc, which has staked its energy, economic, social and financial wellbeing on a pointless confrontation with its eastern neighbor,” Vassily Nebenzia said.

“Today, more than ever, it's clear that the EU is seriously losing in this confrontation,” he said.

Kallas retorted that Nebenzia's comments were a good example of rewriting history and how “misinformation and disinformation” and “lies” must be fought.

She said countries are afraid of Russia because of the countries it has attacked, “and these fears are not ungrounded.”

LONDON (AP) — A 16th-century painting stolen more than 50 years ago has been found — and is now at the center of a custody battle between a widow in England and a small Italian museum.

“Madonna and Child” by Antonio Solario was taken in 1973 from the civic museum in the town of Belluno in the Dolomite mountains of northern Italy. Sometime later it was bought by Baron de Dozsa and taken to his Tudor manor house in eastern England, according to Christopher Marinello, a lawyer who specializes in recovering stolen and looted artworks. 

It is now in the possession of Barbara de Dozsa, the late baron's ex-wife, though it remains on the database of stolen art maintained by the international police organization Interpol.

Marinello has vowed to return the painting to Belluno, where his family has roots.

“I have a family connection to this region, and I decided I was going to stick my 2 cents' in and interfere,” said Marinello, whose company Art Recovery International has helped track down works by artists including Henri Matisse and Henry Moore and return them to their rightful owners.

But in this quest, he has so far been frustrated. Marinello said Tuesday that de Dozsa has declined to give up the painting, despite telling him “she never really liked it.”

“She doesn't hang it – it reminds her of her ex-husband,” he said.

De Dozsa did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.




Marinello said the painting's rediscovery began when Barbara de Dozsa tried to sell it through an auction house in England a few years ago, and it was recognized as a stolen artwork.

The local police force, Norfolk Constabulary, was called in but eventually returned the painting to de Dozsa.

The force told the AP it had been advised by U.K. judicial authorities to give the artwork back because “several years have passed and there has been no response from Italian authorities in relation to the investigation.”

Norfolk police said they are not currently investigating the case.

Paintings by Solario, who worked across Italy in the early 16th century, have sold at auction for several hundred thousand dollars. Marinello said the “Madonna and Child” is probably worth less than 100,000 pounds ($128,000).

“It's not a Rembrandt,” he said, but added: “It has a value beyond its monetary value.

LONDON (AP) — A former British soldier who used a crossbow and a knife to murder his ex-girlfriend, her sister and their mother at their family home north of London was sentenced Tuesday to a whole-life order, meaning that he would never be released from prison. 

Kyle Clifford, 26, had pleaded guilty in January to murdering Louise Hunt, 25, and her 28-year-old sister Hannah Hunt with a crossbow and their mother, Carol Hunt, 61, with a knife on July 9, 2024. He was convicted of three counts of murder, one of false imprisonment and two counts of possession of offensive weapons.

He was also found guilty of raping Louise during the “carefully planned” attack on the family.

Sentencing Clifford, Justice Joel Bennathan said he was “a jealous man soaked in self-pity — a man who holds women in utter contempt.” 

Clifford refused to turn up for the sentencing.

Prosecutors said he planned the murders for days, ordering the crossbow, knife, an air pistol and other items after becoming enraged when an increasingly concerned Louise ended their 18-month relationship.

During the case, the jury was shown evidence that Clifford gained access to the family home in the quiet residential neighborhood of Bushey, northeast of the capital, by deceiving the mother on the pretext he was returning Louise's belongings, before brutally stabbing her to death.

Clifford “lay in wait” for an hour for Louise to enter the house, before restraining, raping and ultimately murdering her with a crossbow. He then fatally shot her sister, Hannah, when she returned to the property after work.




Prosecutors said that less than 24 hours before he carried out the attacks, Clifford had searched for the podcast of the self-styled misogynist influencer Andrew Tate. They said the “violent misogyny” promoted by Tate “fueled” Clifford's attacks.

Following the murders, police launched a manhunt for the suspect before he was found injured the following day in a cemetery in Enfield, north London. Clifford had shot himself in the chest with the crossbow. He remains in a wheelchair, having been paralyzed from the chest downwards.

The three women were the wife and two of the daughters of BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt, who was in court throughout the trial and the verdict, along with his one remaining daughter, 31-year-old Amy.

Reading an emotional statement in court Tuesday, John called Clifford a psychopath who disguised himself as an ordinary human being. 

He said Louise had left Clifford after saying “enough is enough.”

“I hope women round the world will take Louise's bravery as a shining beacon for their lives,” he said. “If you feel enough is enough, then it is.”

Polls have opened in Greenland for early parliamentary elections Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks control of the strategic Arctic island.

The self-governing region of Denmark is home to 56,000 people, most from Indigenous Inuit backgrounds, and occupies a strategic North Atlantic location. It also contains rare earth minerals key to driving the global economy.

Unofficial election results should be available soon after polls close at 2200 GMT Tuesday, but they won't be certified for weeks as ballot papers make their way to the capital from remote settlements by boat, plane and helicopter. 

While the island has been on a path toward independence since at least 2009, a break from Denmark isn't on the ballot even though it's on everyone's mind. Voters on Tuesday will instead elect 31 lawmakers who will shape the island's debate on when and if to declare independence in the future.

British officials were concerned about possible environmental damage Tuesday and looking for answers a day after a cargo ship carrying a toxic chemical hit a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military off eastern England, setting both vessels ablaze.

A cargo ship collided with a tanker carrying jet fuel for the US military off eastern England on Monday, setting both vessels ablaze and sending fuel pouring into the North Sea.

LONDON (AP) — British police on Tuesday arrested the captain of a cargo ship on suspicion of manslaughter as they searched for answers about why it hit a tanker transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military off eastern England, setting both vessels ablaze. One sailor was presumed dead in the collision, which sparked fears of significant environmental damage.

Humberside Police said the 59-year-old was detained “on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter in connection with the collision.” He wasn't named by the police and has not been charged.




The owner of the container carrier, shipping company Ernst Russ, said the arrested man was the ship's master. It said he “and our entire team are actively assisting with the investigations.”

The government said the cause of the collision was being investigated, but there was no indication of foul play.

U.K. officials were watching for damage to birds and sea life after jet fuel poured into the North Sea when the Portugal-registered Solong broadsided the U.S.-flagged tanker MV Stena Immaculate on Monday. The collision sparked explosions and fires that burned for more than 24 hours. 

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports British officials are concerned about environmental damage after a cargo ship carrying a toxic chemical hit a tanker transporting jet fuel off eastern England.

Footage filmed from a helicopter on Tuesday morning showed the fire appeared to largely be out on the tanker, which had a large gash on its port side.

The U.K. coast guard agency said Tuesday that the Solong was still alight. It said the cargo ship, whose front end was crushed and blackened, was drifting south, away from the tanker, and a 1 kilometer (around a ½ mile) exclusion zone had been put in place around both ships. 




“No sign of pollution from vessels is observed at this time,” Transport Minister Mike Kane told lawmakers in the House of Commons. 

The government said air quality readings were normal and the risk to public health onshore was “very low.”

Kane initially said the Solong was expected to sink, but the government said later that both vessels were likely to stay afloat.

The collision triggered a major rescue operation by lifeboats, coast guard aircraft and commercial vessels in the foggy North Sea.

All but one of the 37 crew members from the two vessels were brought safely ashore in the port of Grimsby, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of London, with no major injuries. One crew member was missing, and the coast guards called off the search late Monday.

“Our working assumption is that, very sadly, the sailor is deceased,” Kane said.

The U.K. Marine Accident Investigation Branch has begun gathering evidence of what caused the Solong, bound from Grangemouth, Scotland, to Rotterdam, Netherlands, to hit the stationary tanker, which was anchored about 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the English coast.

The investigation will be led by the U.S. and Portugal, the countries where the vessels are flagged.

The 183-meter (596-foot) Stena Immaculate was operating as part of the U.S. government's Tanker Security Program, a group of commercial vessels that can be contracted to carry fuel for the military when needed. Its operator, U.S.-based maritime management firm Crowley, said that it was carrying 220,000 barrels of Jet-A1 fuel in 16 tanks, at least one of which was ruptured. 

The company said it was unclear how much fuel had leaked into the sea.

The owner of the Solong said that contrary to earlier reports, the vessel wasn't carrying containers of sodium cyanide, which can produce harmful gas when combined with water. It said that four empty containers had previously contained the chemical.

“Our team is actively engaged with all local authorities, and we will work with cleanup teams to ensure every effort is made to mitigate further impacts on the marine environment,” the company said in a statement.

Greenpeace U.K. said it was too early to assess the extent of any environmental damage from the collision, which took place near busy fishing grounds and major seabird colonies.

Environmentalists said that oil and chemicals posed a risk to sea life, including whales and dolphins and to birds, including puffins, gannets and guillemots that live on coastal cliffs.

Tom Webb, senior lecturer in marine ecology and conservation at the University of Sheffield, said that wildlife along that stretch of coast “is of immense biological, cultural and economic importance.”

Alex Lukyanov, who models oil spills at the University of Reading, said the environmental impact would depend on multiple factors, including “the size of the spill, weather conditions, sea currents, water waves, wind patterns and the type of oil involved.”

“This particular incident is troubling because it appears to involve persistent oil, which breaks up slowly in water,” he said. “The environmental toll could be severe.”

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — A bus lost control and flipped on a highway early Tuesday near Johannesburg's international airport, killing 16 as some were thrown from the vehicle, the transport ministry said.

Ministry spokesman Collen Msibi said 12 people died at the scene and four at a hospital. Msibi said reports indicated that 11 passengers were critically injured and 24 had moderate to serious injuries.

“On arrival we found patients lying across the road,” said William Ntladi, an emergency management spokesperson for the Ekurhuleni municipality.

Two bodies were trapped in the wreckage, Ntladi said. Handbags, a lunch box and a water bottle were scattered among the debris.

The crash occurred near Johannesburg's O.R. Tambo International Airport. No other vehicle was involved, and officials weren't yet able to determine the cause.

The bus had been transporting people from the township of Katlehong, east of Johannesburg, and was a short distance from exiting the highway, officials said.

“We are lost for words. This is a disaster,” said Andile Mngwevu, a city councilor. “To see so many bodies lying around is quite saddening, and the city really feels for the families who would have expected to see their loved ones return home later today.”

South African Transport Minister Barbra Creecy said she was “extremely concerned” since this was the third serious bus accident in the past week. She has instructed the Road Traffic Management Corporation to meet with all bus operators in the coming week to discuss ways to improve passenger safety.

This version corrects the spokesman's name to Ntladi.

Israeli fire has killed eight Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and three more in the occupied West Bank over the past 24 hours, Palestinian officials said Tuesday, even as a fragile ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza has largely held since late January. Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians in Gaza during the ceasefire who the military says had approached its troops or entered unauthorized areas.

Hamas says a new round of ceasefire talks have started Tuesday. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Hamas instead wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, in which the remaining hostages would be released and Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza. Hamas is believed to have 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.

Israel is trying to force Hamas to accept its plan by cutting off all electricity, food, medicine and other goods to Gaza's more than 2 million Palestinians. The United Nations and other humanitarian aid providers say Israel is violating international law.

Here's the latest:

The United Nations says the Israeli ban on food, fuel, electricity and other humanitarian aid entering Gaza for the last 10 days is reversing progress in getting supplies to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the six weeks of ceasefire.

The U.N. humanitarian office is reporting that fuel for backup generators at water and health facilities is running low, cooking gas prices are rising, and distribution of flour, fresh produce and tents and other shelter materials have been disrupted, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.

The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, is warning that severe water shortages have reached critical levels, with only one in 10 people in Gaza able to access safe drinking water.

The Iran-backed rebels' secretive leader had warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels would resume within four days if Israel didn't let aid into Gaza. As the deadline passed Tuesday, the Houthis said they were again banning Israeli vessels from the waters off Yemen.

Although no attacks were reported, the warning has put shippers on edge. The rebels targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors.

This time, the Yemeni rebels only mentioned targeting Israeli ships. Before the ceasefire in Gaza, the Houthis had said they attacked ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked had little or no connection to the conflict.

He warned Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa that Israel “is watching him from the heights of Mt. Hermon,” which Israeli forces captured as part of a buffer zone inside Syria last year, and said Israel struck 40 military targets overnight in southern Syria.

Israel plans to allow members of the Druze minority from Syria to work in Israeli-controlled parts of the Golan Heights as soon as the coming week, Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement Tuesday issued from Mt. Hermon. He stressed that Israel plans to remain in the Syrian buffer zone for an “indefinite period” to ensure that southern Syria remains demilitarized and does not pose a threat to residents of Israel or the Golan Heights.

The Israeli minister's comments come days after Syrian government-linked forces killed hundreds of civilians in revenge attacks primarily targeting members of the Alawite religious minority. The Druze minority straddles Israel, the Golan Heights, Syria, and Lebanon.

The Palestinian militant group said Tuesday it was “dealing responsibly and positively with these negotiations, including the talks with the American envoy for hostage affairs.”

Hamas had said Sunday that it wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators — without changes to its position. 

Hamas wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, which would see the release of remaining hostages from Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace. Israel wants Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. 

A breakthrough agreement to consolidate control of Syria under a single central authority in Damascus is a “step in the right direction,” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Tuesday, but he said the deal must be fully implemented.

The deal between Syria's interim government and the Kurdish-led authority in country's northeast includes a ceasefire and would merge the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces into the Syrian army. Turkey deems the Kurdish forces in Syria as “terrorists” because of their links to the banned Kurdistan Workers' Part.

“We see every effort to cleanse Syria of terrorism as a step in the right direction,” Erdogan said during a Ramadan fast-breaking dinner on Tuesday.

The agreement aligns with Turkey's interests, which has called for a stable and unitary Syria.

One of the store's owners was briefly detained Tuesday and books were seized by Israeli police, who said they received a tip about “books with inciteful content.”

The Educational Bookshop is a hub of intellectual life in east Jerusalem that's popular among researchers, journalists and foreign diplomats. The two Palestinian brothers who own the store were detained after a raid last month.

Imad Muna, one of the owners, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that police showed him no search or arrest warrant before taking him in for questioning along with around 40 books – all with some kind of “icon or keyword related to the conflict or related to Palestine or related to the Israeli occupation.”

He said police kept three books: two academic studies of the conflict written in English, and “a book about Palestine and South Africa.”

A police spokesperson said the confiscated books would be examined to determine if prosecutors need to investigate further.

The back-to-back Israeli police raids are a violation of free expression and a “blatant assault on Palestinian literature and culture,” said PEN America, a literary non-profit dedicated to protecting free speech.

The organization called on Israeli authorities to stop the “relentless harassment and intimidation” of the Educational Bookshop's two Palestinian owners, one of whom was briefly detained again Tuesday. Police said the raid was spurred by complaints about “inciting content” at the store in east Jerusalem.

The strikes Tuesday hit two areas of southern Lebanon, the Israeli military said, allegedly killing a commander in Nabatiyeh province and several militants in the Froun area.

Lebanon's National News Agency reported two Israeli drone strikes in the Froun area on a vehicle, about 20 minutes apart. There were no immediate reports of casualties and Hezbollah did not immediately comment.

Israel has repeatedly launched deadly airstrikes in Lebanon during the ceasefire, saying it has the right to retaliate to unspecified ceasefire violations by Hezbollah and security threats.

The Israeli prime minister's office announced Israel will release five Lebanese detainees as a “gesture” to the new Lebanese president. The release follows a meeting Tuesday in Lebanon between representatives from Israel, Lebanon, France, and the United States. 

Israel said the talks focused on bringing more stability to the region after a bruising war between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which has been paused by a ceasefire since late November. The four nations will continue meeting to discuss three major issues between Israel and Lebanon, including five locations in southern Lebanon that remain under Israeli military control, the border between Israel and Lebanon — which has never officially been determined — and the issue of Lebanese detainees held by Israel. 

“Everyone involved remains committed to maintaining the ceasefire agreement and to fully implement all its terms,” said Morgan Ortagus, the deputy presidential special envoy at the U.S. State Department. According to the terms of the ceasefire, Israel must withdraw from all of Lebanon, including the five points along the border it's still occupying. The Lebanese government and Hezbollah did not have an immediate comment.

The joint drills held Tuesday, called the Maritime Security Belt 2025, took place in the Gulf of Oman near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all crude oil traded worldwide passes. 

The area around the strait in the past has seen Iran seize commercial ships and launch suspected attacks in the time since President Donald Trump first unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers. 

This is the fifth year the three countries took part in the drills, which come after a monthslong Iranian drill that followed a direct Israeli attack on the country, targeting its air defenses and sites associated with its ballistic missile program. 

Palestinians described alleged abuses by Israeli forces and settlers — punched in the genitals, held for days while naked, starved — to independent U.N.-backed human rights investigators on Tuesday during hearings on the treatment of detainees during the war in Gaza.

“This is not just my story. I'm just one person among many detained by the occupying Israeli power,” said one witness from Gaza, Abu Jidyan, according to a translator. 

The Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory's findings can be used as evidence for the International Criminal Court or other bodies that seek to prosecute war crimes and other violations in the context of the war. 

Rights groups have alleged widespread abuse at a military detention facility, Sde Teiman.

Israel has refused to cooperate with the commission, accusing it of anti-Israel bias. Israel has repeatedly denied mistreatment of Palestinian detainees in its custody and said it takes action against any offenses.

The White House is circumspect about the prospects for a peaceful Syria after clashes erupted last week that left hundreds dead.

Monitoring groups said hundreds of civilians were killed in the clashes that broke out last week. Revenge attacks primarily targeted members of the Alawite religious minority to which ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad belongs.

White House National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt said Tuesday that the attacks on religious minorities have raised concerns in the administration “about whether Syria's interim governing authorities are ready to include a religiously and ethnically diverse population, and whether the interim authorities even have the legitimacy to do so.”

Syria's interim government signed a deal Monday with the Kurdish-led authority that controls the country's northeast, including a ceasefire and the merging of the main U.S.-backed force there into the Syrian army. 

“Achieving a resolution at the negotiating table is preferable to achieving it on the battlefield and the United States will continue to watch Syria and the decisions its leaders make,” Hewitt added.

Palestinian first responders say an Israeli airstrike killed four people, including two brothers, in the Gaza Strip.

The Civil Defense, which operates under the Hamas-run government, said Tuesday's strike was carried out near the Netzarim corridor, where Israeli forces had carved out a military zone bisecting the territory before withdrawing from the area as part of a fragile ceasefire.

The Israeli military said it carried out an airstrike against a group of militants “engaged in suspicious activity.”

The fragile ceasefire has held since it began on Jan. 19, even as Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians. Israel says it has struck Palestinians who approached its troops, entered unauthorized areas or otherwise violated the terms of the truce.

Palestinians say settlers attacked a garage in the occupied West Bank overnight, torching three cars. 

Rafaat Sabah, the owner of the garage, said the attack overnight was not the first. He said settlers had broken into his garage previously and stolen oil, tools and other things. This time they set fire to cars belonging to his customers, he said.

The Israeli military said it was investigating the episode.

Marwan Sabah, head of the Umm Safa village council, said settlers have recently brought livestock to graze on village lands with the aim of eventually taking them over. 

The West Bank has seen a surge in violence, including settler attacks on Palestinians, since the war in Gaza began in October 2023.

Over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship live in well over 100 settlements across the West Bank, ranging from hilltop outposts to fully-developed suburbs. The territory's 3 million Palestinians live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Palestinian Authority administering cities and towns.

Palestinians held a funeral on Tuesday for a 32-year-old man who died after being struck by an Israeli military vehicle in the volatile West Bank city of Jenin.

The military described Monday's episode as an accident, saying the man rode a motorcycle into an intersection where it collided with the military vehicle.

Israel has been carrying out a major military operation in Jenin in recent weeks that it says is aimed at rooting out militants. Palestinians view such operations as a way of cementing Israeli control over the territory, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. 

Israel's deputy foreign minister said Tuesday that deadly sectarian violence in neighboring Syria amounted to “ethnic cleansing” and said Israel was working to prevent a threat along its border from Syria's new “jihadi regime.”

“Israel is committed to preventing what we saw in Syria this weekend from happening on our border,” Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel said at a news conference in Jerusalem.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said 1,130 people were killed in the clashes, including 830 civilians, most of them from ousted leader Bashar Assad's Alawite community. The Associated Press could not independently verify these numbers.

Since Islamist-led insurgents ousted Assad in December, Israel has voiced concern that the group could seize Syrian military assets and use them against it, or that instability could spill over into its territory.

Israel has deployed troops inside a buffer zone and vowed to prevent the new Syrian forces from entering the area south of Damascus. On Tuesday, the Israeli military said its fighter jets struck military targets in southern Syria, including radars and equipment. 

The Palestinian Health Ministry says three Palestinians, including a 58-year-old woman, were killed by Israeli fire in the volatile West Bank city of Jenin on Tuesday.

The Israeli military said troops killed two militants in an exchange of fire in Jenin and arrested 10 others. It said its forces eliminated a third militant who had fired at them during the operation and destroyed two vehicles loaded with weapons.

Israel launched a large-scale military operation centered on Jenin shortly after reaching a fragile ceasefire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip in January. Troops have destroyed homes and infrastructure, and tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled their homes across the northern West Bank.

The Gaza Health Ministry says four people have been killed by Israeli fire and another 14 wounded over the past 24 hours.

The ministry said Tuesday that rescuers had also retrieved 32 bodies from under the rubble.

The four killed included three brothers hit by a drone strike in central Gaza on Monday and a woman killed by a drone strike Tuesday in the southern city of Rafah, the ministry said.

The latest deaths brought the overall Palestinian death toll from the war to 48,503. More than 110,000 people have been wounded, according to the ministry.

The ministry says women and children make up most of the dead but does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its toll. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.

The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251 people.

NUUK, Greenland (AP) — The polling station in Greenland's capital closed Tuesday in a parliamentary election that will determine the leaders who will confront U.S. President Donald Trump's effort to take control of the strategically placed Arctic country.

Huge crowds streamed into the polling station in the capital, Nuuk, throughout the day, warmed by sunny skies. Exhausted voting officials closed the polls well after the planned 8 p.m. local time (2200 GMT) to make sure everyone in line got a chance to cast their ballot.

Unofficial election results should be available in the coming hours, but they won't be certified for weeks as paper ballots make their way to the capital from remote settlements by boat, plane and helicopter.

Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede in February called elections a bit early, saying the country needed to be united during a “serious time” that is unlike anything Greenland has ever experienced.

Greenland, a self-governing region of Denmark, straddles strategic air and sea routes in the North Atlantic and has rich deposits of the rare earth minerals needed to make everything from mobile phones to renewable energy technology.

Trump has been outspoken about his desire to control Greenland, telling a joint session of Congress last week that he thought the U.S. was going to get it “one way or the other.”

While the island of 56,000 people has been on a path toward independence since at least 2009, a break from Denmark isn't on the ballot — even though it's on everyone's mind. Voters will instead elect 31 lawmakers who will shape the island's future at a defining moment in history: Should Greenland declare independence?

The mood was festive Tuesday at the sole polling station in Greenland 's capital city, Nuuk, as election workers opened the doors to cheers at 1100 GMT.

Opinion polls show most Greenlanders favor independence. Most say they don't dislike Americans, pointing to the good relations they have with the local Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Force Base, where U.S. military personnel have been stationed since 1951.

But Greenlanders show no sign of wanting to become Americans. Even some of Trump's biggest fans cling to the principle that they should control their destiny: their mantra is that Greenland is open for business, but not for sale. 

“The situation has changed because of Trump and because of the world,” said Doris Jensen, representative of the social democratic Siumut party who said she has always favored independence. “So we have decided in our party that we have to do (it) more quickly.”

Trump's attention has transformed the deeply local process of democracy. Suddenly, the presence of journalists from as far away as Japan and Croatia are reminders that these are far from normal times.

Voter Sofia Rossen had a message for Trump: “Stop talking about Greenland. Stop,” she said in the polling station in Nuuk. 

When U.S. President Donald Trump first suggested buying Greenland in 2019, people thought it was just a joke. No one is laughing now.

The island and the U.S. previously had a positive relationship, but that doesn't mean they want to be part of the United States, she told The Associated Press. Greenland's future must be decided by its people, she said. 

“It is us, we are living here and we know what to do,” she said. “We are not for sale. We are not American, we won't be Americans. We are not (Danes), but we are part of the Danish community.”

“I think most of us have been scared since the new year because of (Trump's) interest,” Pipaluk Lynge, a member of parliament from the ruling Inuit Ataqatigiit, or United Inuit party, told The Associated Press. “So we're really, really looking to Europe right now to see if we could establish a stronger bond with them to secure our sovereign nation.”

After one of the final televised debates at a school auditorium in Nuuk, Prime Minister Egede was greeted by about 75 supporters who were almost outnumbered by photographers and cameramen.

“All these reporters are frightening to us,'' said Aviaja Sinkbaek, who works at the school. “It means that something must be happening soon.”

She added: “I wonder what Trump has up his sleeve.”

Politics in Greenland have a different rhythm. Debates during campaigning rarely got heated. People who became too animated were asked to step outside. Issues included building a skilled workforce and how to decorate the new airport, which in November opened a runway long enough to handle jumbo jets.

On Tuesday, political parties pitched tents outside the polling station at the Nuuk sports hall, offering hot drinks and Greenlandic cake — a raisin-laced bread served with butter — in hopes of swaying voters.

Certifying results will take weeks as ballot papers make their way to Nuuk. That's because there are no roads connecting communities across the island's 2.16 million square kilometers (836,330 square miles).

Now the vast size has drawn outsize attention.

Greenlanders know what they have. They hope the rare earth minerals will help diversify an economy where government jobs account for 40% of employment.

But the government has imposed strict rules to protect the environment on the island, most of which is covered by ice year-round. The harsh atmospheric conditions raise questions about whether mineral extraction is commercially feasible.

SUVs caused a traffic jam on the main road to the hall. Elderly people with canes tromped up the icy roads. 

A lot was at stake. And so the people came.

Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested Tuesday on a warrant from the International Criminal Court accusing him of crimes against humanity over deadly anti-drugs crackdowns he oversaw while in office, the Philippine government said.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine ex-President Rodrigo Duterte, who left a savage legacy from his deadly anti-drugs crackdown, was arrested on a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity for the thousands killed in a war he waged against drugs in a political career spanning decades. His detention capped an international investigation into the killings, which unfolded for more than a dozen years.

Duterte again came under the spotlight during a weekend trip to Hong Kong when the trip sparked speculation that he may have gone into exile to evade arrest. He had appeared as the main speaker on Sunday at a gathering of thousands of cheering and flag-waving Filipino expatriates, who jammed Southorn Stadium in downtown Wan Chai district.

Now 79 and in poor health, Duterte campaigned for his political party's senatorial candidates ahead of the May 12 mid-term elections in the Philippines. He said he was aware the International Criminal Court had issued a warrant for his arrest.

He again tried to justify the brutal crackdown as the crowd cheered him on. Police arrested him as he got off the plane at Manila International Airport based on an ICC warrant.

Here's more about Duterte, his ICC case and what lies ahead for one of Asia's most unorthodox leaders in his time:




Duterte, a former prosecutor, congressman and longtime mayor of the southern Philippine city of Davao, built a political name with his expletive-laced outbursts against the elites, the dominant Roman Catholic church and the West. He was also seen as pro-poor and a populist, but he is perhaps best remembered for his brutal approach to criminality, particularly illegal drugs.

Under his police-enforced crackdown in Davao at the start of the millennium, an estimated 1,000 mostly poor suspects were gunned down extrajudicially. One police officer involved in the Davao killings who later distanced himself from Duterte told The Associated Press that up to 10,000 suspects were killed by his and other police and civilian hit squads. 

An unidentified relative cries as people look at the body of a woman, later identified by her husband as that of Nora Acielo, after she was shot by still unidentified men while about to bring her two children to school at a poor neighborhood in Manila, Philippines Thursday, Dec. 8, 2016. Police said the killing of Acielo was the 13th recorded drug-related case in the past 24 hours in President Rodrigo Duterte's unrelenting war on drugs. (AP Photo/Bullit Marquez, File)



The death toll in the crackdown was alarmingly high for years, gaining Duterte nicknames like “the Punisher” and “Duterte Harry,” after the Western movie police character with little regard for the law. 

Human rights activists said people were afraid to testify against Duterte in court.

In 2016, Duterte won the presidency on an audacious but failed promise to eradicate illegal drugs and corruption within three to six months, in a country long weary of crime and corruption scandals.

“All of you who are into drugs, you sons of bitches, I will really kill you,” Duterte told a huge crowd in a 2016 campaign stop in Manila. “I have no patience, I have no middle ground. Either you kill me or I will kill you idiots.”

The United States, the European Union and other Western governments raised the alarm over the anti-drugs campaign, prompting Duterte in 2016 to tell then-President Barack Obama “you can go to hell” as he threatened to “break up with America.”

The ICC launched an investigation into drug killings under Duterte from Nov. 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity. Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the Rome Statute, the court's founding treaty, in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability over the killings. 

The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court's investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC — a court of last resort — didn't have jurisdiction. 

Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in July 2023 the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration's objections. Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022 and became entangled in a bitter political dispute with the former president, has decided not to rejoin the global court. But the Marcos administration has said it would cooperate if the ICC asks international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice, a request for law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a crime suspect.

China, which controls Hong Kong, and the Philippines do not currently belong to the ICC, but both are members of Interpol. The global court may issue a warrant for Duterte's arrest through Interpol. 

A prominent Philippine politician closely involved in the ICC cases against Duterte told the AP over the weekend the global court had issued a warrant for Duterte's arrest through Interpol. The politician spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the sensitive issue publicly. 

Neither the ICC nor Interpol have yet confirmed the issuance of an arrest warrant.

In his rambling speech before mostly Filipino workers in Hong Kong on Sunday, Duterte again justified his deadly anti-drugs campaign, saying it safeguarded Filipino people. 

Duterte has denied authorizing extrajudicial killings, but he openly and repeatedly threatened to kill suspected drug dealers when he was in office.

“What was my sin?” Duterte asked in Hong Kong. “I did everything in my time so Filipinos can have a little peace and tranquility.”

He said he was prepared to go to jail but told the crowd in jest to make donations for the construction of a monument of him — which he suggested with a gesture of his hand should show him holding a gun. 

Duterte had said he retired from politics after his stormy presidential term ended in 2022. But in another turnaround from his earlier remarks, he registered to run for mayor of Davao with one of his sons as his running mate to be vice mayor, in elections in May.

In Davao, additional police forces were deployed at the international airport and extra checkpoints were set up in what authorities said were meant to be prepared for any contingency ahead of the mid-term elections. The forces in Davao and elsewhere could step in if Duterte's arrest were to ignite unrest, which the Marcos administration said it could deftly handle.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Top military officials from across Europe and beyond joined talks in Paris on Tuesday on the possible contours of an international security force for Ukraine — an idea that France and Britain are pushing to deter any future Russian aggression on its neighbor if Moscow and Kyiv agree to stop fighting.

Participants said they expected the closed-door discussions to be big-picture and broad-brush, providing a gauge of which nations might be ready to join a coalition for Ukraine but not, at this stage, committing them to providing specific numbers of troops, equipment or other assistance.

The French- and British-led effort to reassure Ukraine and help protect it from any renewed Russian aggression if it agrees to a ceasefire comes as Kyiv is under intense pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to engage in peace talks. Senior officials from Ukraine and the United States opened separate talks in the Saudi city of Jeddah on Tuesday focused on halting the full-scale invasion that Russia launched in 2022.

French President Emmanuel Macron attended part of he Paris meeting of army chiefs of 34 countries and other military representatives, including some who were scheduled to dial-in remotely from Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. 

Macron said it was time to “move from concept to plan” to define credible security guarantees and insisted the French-British blueprint should come along with the NATO alliance and its capabilities, Macron's office said, yet without offering detailed specifics.




Slovenia's army chief at the meeting, Lt. Gen. Robert Glavaš, said his NATO and European Union country is willing to be part of the effort. But he said he was hoping for a clearer picture of how a post-ceasefire international force for Ukraine might work, what its missions might be, which countries want be part of it, and whether it would have a mandate from the United Nations or another body.

“The question is: ‘What next?'” he said in an interview with The Associated Press. “Who will go there? As we know in Europe, many countries, especially small countries, don't have a lot of troops.” 

Western and Ukrainian officials said there is no definitive plan for military options yet. The AP spoke to Western and Ukrainian officials in Kyiv, as well as French officials in Paris and British officials in London. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to speak openly about sensitive matters.

The United States — NATO's most militarily powerful member — wasn't invited to the Paris talks because European nations wanted to show that they are able to shoulder a large part of the job of safeguarding Ukraine once a truce is in effect, a French military official said.

For Ukrainian officials, key questions are how such a coalition would react if Russia violates a future ceasefire, whether it would respond militarily to a large Russian offensive and how quickly.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has welcomed the proposal but expressed skepticism, telling The AP in an interview in February that foreign troops alone would not be a sufficient guarantee of security for his country, and that such a plan should be backed up by weapons from the U.S. and Europe, and support for Kyiv to develop its own defense industry.

“Diplomats are discussing, military officials are discussing, but we still don't have real proposals,” said a senior Ukrainian official. The talks “are not in the first stage, we did a lot in the first stage, but we still don't have a real solid approach.” 

As Trump has appeared to nix the idea of U.S. security guarantees and other U.S. officials said this will fall on Europe to enforce, the French-British plan looks to create a force equipped with enough military might to dissuade Russia from attacking Ukraine again. “That is the crux of it,” said a Western official in Kyiv.

A French military official said the force could include heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be rushed within hours or days to aid in Ukraine's defense.

The Western official in Kyiv, offering another idea on the table, said they could incorporate direct and immediate strikes on Russian assets in the event of a violation.

Details have emerged piecemeal in recent weeks as technical discussions have been ongoing between Western diplomatic and military officials in Ukraine and other European capitals.

Last month, some Western officials described a small Europe-dominated “reassurance force” of less than 30,000 troops, rather than an ambitious army of peacekeepers posted along the 600-mile (1,000 kilometer) front line.

But other officials have said the numbers were under discussion. According to one version, troops would be posted away from the front line at key infrastructure sites such as nuclear power plants and backed by Western air and sea power. The front line would largely be monitored remotely, with drones and other technology. Air power, including U.S. air power based outside Ukraine, perhaps in Poland or Romania, would be in reserve to deter breaches and reopen Ukrainian airspace to commercial flights.

Allied navies could also play a role in the Black Sea clearing mines and patrolling to keep international waters safe.

The idea is to “aggregate” the capabilities those countries are ready to provide in order to be able to offer security guarantees to make sure the peace deal is “robust and verifiable,” with the aim to get some U.S. backstop, another French official said.

“To get signals on the U.S. backstop, the ‘able and willing' European countries must be able to aggregate their capabilities and demands,” he said.

Some Western officials cautioned that there will be several stages to a peace plan and a broader range of countries could join the coalition later on. The first step could be a one-month freeze, as proposed by Zelenskyy and European leaders, as a confidence building measure.

The Ukrainian officials said they were optimistic about the coalition of the willing, conceding they have few other options with NATO off the table.

“I fully believe it's very possible,” said one senior Ukrainian official. “Trump is comfortable with the idea, the idea is very positive for us, and if Europe wants to be a real player, they should do this.”

“If they lose this opportunity, we will be in a very difficult situation,” he added.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine police arrested former President Rodrigo Duterte in Manila on Tuesday and sent him by plane to the Netherlands to face charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court, President Ferdinand Marcos said.

The global court in The Hague had ordered Duterte's arrest through Interpol after accusing him of crimes against humanity over deadly anti-drug crackdowns he oversaw while in office, Marcos said in a late-night news conference. Duterte had been arrested at the Manila international airport Tuesday morning when he arrived with his family from Hong Kong. 

Walking slowly with a cane, the 79-year-old former president turned briefly to a small group of aides and supporters, who wept and bid him goodbye, before an escort helped him into the plane. 

His daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, said she sought entry to the airbase where her father was held but was refused. She criticized the Marcos administration for surrendering her father to a foreign court which currently has no jurisdiction to the Philippines.

Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested Tuesday on a warrant from the International Criminal Court accusing him of crimes against humanity over deadly anti-drugs crackdowns he oversaw while in office, the Philippine government said.

Marcos said Duterte's arrest was “proper and correct” and not an act of political persecution, since the Philippines is a member of Interpol. 

Among the most feared leaders in Asia while in power, Duterte became the first ex-leader from the region to be arrested by the global court. 

Clad in a dark jacket, an irate Duterte protested his arrest after arrival in Manila and asked authorities the legal basis of his detention. His lawyers immediately asked the Supreme Court to block any attempt to transport him out of the Philippines.

“Show to me now the legal basis for my being here,” Duterte asked authorities in remarks captured on video by his daughter, Veronica Duterte, who posted the footage on social media. “You have to answer now for the deprivation of liberty.”

The surprise arrest sparked a commotion at the airport, where Duterte's lawyers and aides protested that they, along with a doctor, were prevented from coming close to him after he was taken into police custody. “This is a violation of his constitutional right,” Sen. Bong Go, a close Duterte ally, told reporters.

The ICC has been investigating mass killings in crackdowns overseen by Duterte when he served as mayor of the southern Philippine city of Davao and later as president. Estimates of the death toll of the crackdown during Duterte's presidential term vary, from the more than 6,000 that the national police have reported up to 30,000 claimed by human rights groups.

The ICC arrest warrant, seen by The Associated Press, said “there are reasonable grounds to believe that” the attack on victims “was both widespread and systematic: the attack took place over a period of several years and thousands people appear to have been killed.”

Duterte's arrest was necessary “to ensure his appearance before the court,” the March 7 warrant said. “Mindful of the resultant risk of interference with the investigations and the security of witnesses and victims, the chamber is satisfied that the arrest of Mr. Duterte is necessary.”

In a brief statement after the plane had taken off, the ICC confirmed that one of its pre-trial chambers had issued an arrest warrant for Duterte on charges of “murder as a crime against humanity allegedly committed in the Philippines between Nov. 1, 2011, and March 16, 2019.”

Duterte's arrest and downfall drove families of slain victims of his crackdown to tears. Some gathered in a street rally to welcome his arrest.

“This is a big, long-awaited day for justice,” Randy delos Santos told the AP. His teenage nephew was gunned down by police in a dark riverside alley during an anti-drug operation in suburban Caloocan city in August 2017. 

“We hope that top police officials and the hundreds of police officers who were involved in the illegal killings should also be placed in custody and punished,” delos Santos said.

Three police officers were convicted in 2018 for the high-profile murder of his nephew, Kian delos Santos, prompting Duterte to suspend his crackdown temporarily. 

The conviction was one of only around three so far against law enforcers involved in the anti-drugs campaign. Former Sen. Antonio Trillanes, who led the filing of a complaint against Duterte before the ICC, said the arrest was historic, a major blow to state impunity and tyranny.

“This is like the downfall of an emperor,” Trillanes told the AP. “The next step now is to make sure that all his followers who have committed criminal transgressions like him should also be held to account.”

The government said the 79-year-old former leader was in good health and was examined by government doctors.

The ICC began investigating drug killings under Duterte from Nov. 1, 2011, when he was still mayor of Davao, to March 16, 2019, as possible crimes against humanity. Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the Rome Statute, the court's founding treaty, in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability.

The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court's investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC — a court of last resort — therefore didn't have jurisdiction.

Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in 2023 the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration's objections. Based in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most serious crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who succeeded Duterte in 2022, has decided not to rejoin the global court. But the Marcos administration had said it would cooperate if the ICC asked international police to take Duterte into custody through a so-called Red Notice, a request for law enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and temporarily arrest a crime suspect.

OKUMA, Japan (AP) — The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's radiation levels have significantly dropped since the cataclysmic meltdown 14 years ago Tuesday. Workers walk around in many areas wearing only surgical masks and regular clothes.

It's a different story for those who enter the reactor buildings, including the three damaged in the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. They must use maximum protection — full facemasks with filters, multi-layered gloves and socks, shoe covers, hooded hazmat coveralls and a waterproof jacket, and a helmet.

As workers remove melted fuel debris from the reactors in a monumental nuclear cleanup effort that could take more than a century, they are facing both huge amounts of psychological stress and dangerous levels of radiation.

The Associated Press, which recently visited the plant for a tour and interviews, takes a closer look.

A remote-controlled extendable robot with a tong had several mishaps including equipment failures before returning in November with a tiny piece of melted fuel from inside the damaged No. 2 reactor. 

That first successful test run is a crucial step in what will be a daunting, decades-long decommissioning that must deal with at least 880 tons of melted nuclear fuel that has mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three ruined reactors.

Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant, says even the tiny sample gives officials a lot of information about the melted fuel. More samples are needed, however, to make the work smoother when bigger efforts to remove the debris begin in the 2030s.




A second sample-retrieval mission at the No. 2 reactor is expected in coming weeks. 

Operators hope to send the extendable robot farther into the reactor to take samples closer to the center, where overheated nuclear fuel fell from the core, utility spokesperson Masakatsu Takata said. He pointed out the target area as he stood inside the inner structure of the No. 5 reactor, which is one of two reactors that survived the tsunami. It has an identical design as No. 2. 

Radiation levels are still dangerously high inside the No. 2 reactor building, where the melted fuel debris is behind a thick concrete containment wall. Earlier decontamination work reduced those radiation levels to a fraction of what they used to be.

In late August, small groups took turns doing their work helping the robot in 15- to 30-minute shifts to minimize radiation exposure. They have a remotely controlled robot, but it has to be manually pushed in and out.

“Working under high levels of radiation (during a short) time limit made us feel nervous and rushed,” said Yasunobu Yokokawa, a team leader for the mission. “It was a difficult assignment.”

Full-face masks reduced visibility and made breathing difficult, an extra waterproof jacket made it sweaty and hard to move, and triple-layered gloves made their fingers clumsy, Yokokawa said.

To eliminate unnecessary exposure, they taped around gloves and socks and carried a personal dosimeter to measure radiation. Workers also rehearsed the tasks they'd perform to minimize exposure.

The mission stalled early on when workers noticed that a set of five 1.5-meter (5-foot) pipes meant to push the robot into the reactor's primary containment vessel had been arranged in the wrong order. 

A camera on the robot also failed because of high radioactivity and had to be replaced.

The workers' highest individual radiation dose was more than the overall average but still far below anything approaching a 100-millisievert five-year dose limit. 

Even so, a growing number of workers are concerned about safety and radiation at the plant, said Ono, the decommissioning chief, citing an annual survey of about 5,5,00 workers. 

In 2023, two workers splashed with contaminated sludge at a water treatment facility suffered burns and were hospitalized, though they had no other health problems.

Yokokawa and a plant colleague, Hiroshi Ide, helped in the 2011 emergency and work as team leaders today. They say they want to make the job safer as workers face high radiation in parts of the plant.

On the top floor of the No. 2 reactor, workers are setting up equipment to remove spent fuel units from the cooling pool. That's set to begin within two to three years.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)



At the No. 1 reactor, workers are putting up a giant roof to contain radioactive dust from decontamination work on the top floor ahead of the removal of spent fuel.

To minimize exposure and increase efficiency, workers use a remote-controlled crane to attach pre-assembled parts, according to TEPCO. The No. 1 reactor and its surroundings are among the most contaminated parts of the plant.

Workers are also removing treated radioactive wastewater. They recently started dismantling the emptied water tanks to make room to build facilities needed for the research and storage of melted fuel debris.

After a series of small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor.

Experts say the hard work and huge challenges of decommissioning the plant are just beginning. There are estimations that the work could take more than a century. The government and TEPCO have an initial completion target of 2051, but the retrieval of melted fuel debris is already three years behind, and many big issues remain undecided.

Ide, whose home in Namie town, northwest of the plant, is in a no-go zone because of nuclear contamination, still has to put on a hazmat suit, even for brief visits home. 

“As a Fukushima citizen, I would like to make sure the decommissioning work is done properly so that people can return home without worries,” he said.

BANGKOK (AP) — Activist groups are calling for the United Nations to investigate its special envoy to Myanmar over possible conflicts of interest, after a report detailed her consulting company's alleged ties to Chinese mining and construction companies with interests in the country. 

Justice for Myanmar wrote to U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres following a report in Australia's The Saturday Paper outlining what it said were Julie Bishop's links to Chinese state-owned companies that operate in Myanmar. Since then, multiple other groups have joined the call for a probe.

Bishop, a former Australian foreign minister and current chancellor of the Australian National University, has not commented on those links. There was no response to a query sent to her consulting company. 

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Bishop, as staff member of the international body, is bound by the U.N. Charter and the organization's rules and regulations which require “upholding the highest standards of integrity, including regarding any potential conflicts of interest.”

“In this regard, the special envoy keeps the organization apprised of her outside activities,” he said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Bishop was appointed Guterres' envoy to Myanmar last April.

Myanmar, also known as Burma, is embroiled in a civil war where the country's military rulers are fighting pro-democracy and other forces. China is one of the major suppliers of weapons to the military, which seized power from democratically elected Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021. Chinese-backed mining and construction projects are also a major source of revenue for Myanmar's military government. 




Bishop's links to Chinese and other companies with interests in Myanmar create “unacceptable conflicts of interest that must be fully investigated,” Justice for Myanmar wrote to Guterres. 

“The loss of trust of Myanmar civil society is a critical issue for the special envoy's position since her mandate involves engagement with civil society, among other relevant stakeholders,” the group's spokesperson Yadanar Muang told the AP on Tuesday. 

In a statement sent to The Australian newspaper, Bishop's company said it was “a private-advisory firm engaged to provide strategic analysis and guidance.” 

It added that it “does not take fiduciary or executive roles, nor does it provide legal, corporate or financial advice” and that “any potential or actual conflicts are declared and vetted.”

Australia's Foreign Ministry directed questions to the U.N., noting that Bishop is not a government employee.

The Australian National University stressed that Bishop's role as chancellor was part-time and non-executive. 

“Chancellors generally have interests outside of their university, and as long as these don't conflict with the university's interests, they are free to pursue these,” the university said in a statement emailed to the AP. 

The Saturday Paper said her consulting firm was hired as a strategic advisor on a Greenland mining project by Melbourne-based Energy Transition Minerals, a rare earths company with significant backing from China's Shenghe Resources and “extensive commercial ties to the Chinese Communist Party.” 

ETM is currently involved in a lawsuit against Greenland and Denmark, seeking billions in compensation over Greenland's ban on uranium mining that came after the company had already started developing a project there. The project stalled after the ban in 2021.

Shenghe Resources is a partially state-owned rare earths company and is believed to source rare earths from Myanmar, which is the largest supplier of heavy rare earths to China, Justice for Myanmar said. 

Another ETM partner is the state-owned China Communications Construction Company, which is active in Myanmar, the group said. 

Bishop also has business ties to Australian companies involved in current and past mining and energy projects in Myanmar, Justice for Myanmar said. 

Justice for Myanmar urged Guterres to investigate Bishop's “business activities, consider the appropriateness of her continued U.N. engagement, and disclose the findings” of the probe.

As President Donald Trump seeks to end wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, his approach to both seems to boil down to giving the stronger party what it wants and pushing the weaker to accept it.



His defenders view it as hardnosed realpolitik — a recognition that the strong eventually prevail, so better to cut one's losses in the interest of a certain kind of peace. “You don't have the cards right now,” Trump told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in their White House blowup.

“ He's transactional,” said Aaron David Miller, a former veteran U.S. diplomat now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Trump is “looking for quick wins — deals, I would argue — not anything remotely related to the incredibly difficult work” of conflict resolution.



But the eventual outcome of conflicts is not always determined by military power alone – see America's 20-year war in Afghanistan, where the world's strongest military failed to defeat a tenacious insurgency. 



And the mercurial Trump has a way of complicating any unified theory of his actions: In recent days, he has threatened new sanctions against Russia and his administration unnerved some Israelis by negotiating directly with Hamas., which the U.S. and Israel view as a terrorist group.

Trump has offered Russian President Vladimir Putin nearly everything he wants before peace negotiations even begin, by ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine, and suspending military aid and intelligence sharing that Ukraine relies on as it fends off Russian attacks.



At the same time, he has pressed Zelenskyy to share Ukraine's mineral wealth with the U.S. without formal security guarantees in return.



In the Middle East, Trump has lavished support on Israel, restoring military aid that had been paused by the Biden administration and embracing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's goals of returning all the hostages and eradicating Hamas – which could be mutually exclusive. Trump has yet to make clear whether his long-term vision for peace includes a two-state solution -- long a pillar of U.S. policy in the Middle East.

For Hamas, which started the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Trump has publicly offered only threats and ultimatums. But the administration recently held direct talks with the group rather than going through mediators. 



Alon Pinkas, a former senior Israeli diplomat, said Trump's actions suggest he doesn't see Netanyahu as a power player like Putin or Chinese President Xi Jinping, but more as a “local warlord.”



“He's part of my empire. He's not a decisionmaker,” Pinkas said, describing Trump's approach to the Israeli leader.

Zelenskyy has reached out to Ukraine's European allies, who have pledged to beef up their own defenses, and he has vowed to fight on even as he seeks to repair ties with Washington.



Hamas has dismissed Trump's threats and says dozens of remaining hostages will only be returned in exchange for an end to the war. A fragile truce negotiated by the Biden administration and the Trump team is in limbo, with Israel threatening to resume the fighting.



Diana Buttu, a Palestinian analyst who advised peace negotiators in the 2000s, says Trump's strategy is unlikely to succeed.



Hamas, which has already survived a 15-month Israeli onslaught, “doesn't give two hoots about him,” she said. “They don't see that he's got any leverage over them.”

The limits of military power have been debated for millennia.



Thucydides' fifth century B.C. history of the war between Athens and Sparta includes a famous debate over the use of military power known as the Melian Dialogue.



Athens lands a fleet at the island of Melos and makes the city-state an offer it can't refuse. Join the empire, pay tribute and you won't be obliterated. The Athenians famously advise the Melians to “try to get what it is possible for you to get,” considering that “the strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they have to accept.”



The Melians refuse, appealing to “fair play and just dealing.” They warn the Athenians that such belligerence could drive other small states into the arms of Sparta. Athens lays siege to Melos, and after months of fighting sacks it, putting the men to death and sending the women and children into slavery.



It's a grim parable — and perhaps a cautionary tale for Canada, Greenland and Panama.



In more recent conflicts, however, military might has only gone so far. Hamas has survived five wars against the most powerful military in the Middle East, the last sparked by a surprise attack that caught Israel's vaunted security agencies unaware.



Ukraine held off the Russian invasion after many thought it would be quickly overrun. The Biden administration had even suggested Zelenskyy flee, an offer he famously declined.



Even in Melos, the outcome was not so clear-cut. Twelve years after Athens seemingly proved that might makes right, it lost the war to Sparta.

The United States' most successful diplomatic forays have tended to involve a more even-handed approach. It helps if the warring parties are in what political scientists refer to as a mutually hurting stalemate.



Then-President Jimmy Carter secured the landmark Camp David peace agreement after twisting the arms of Israelis and Egyptians alike just five years after they fought the last of several wars. 



The Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of violence in northern Ireland came after both Britain and Irish republicans concluded that outright victory was impossible.



Trump's supporters boast that he thinks outside the box in the Middle East, but for decades, the U.S. has built its approach around ironclad support for Israel — and its peace efforts have repeatedly failed.



The Abraham Accords brokered by Trump in his first term — in which Israel forged ties with four Arab countries — sidelined the Palestinians. Hamas said its Oct. 7 attack was partly driven by the sense that the Palestinian cause had been forgotten.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)





Buttu recalls meeting with American diplomats from previous administrations who told Palestinians essentially the same thing Trump told Zelenskyy.



At a meeting in November 2000 about a major settlement under construction in east Jerusalem, “the Americans turned to us and said, ‘There's just no way, you're just going to have to accept defeat and move on... You're going to have to lick your wounds,'” Buttu said.



The peace process collapsed around that time as a Palestinian uprising erupted. Twenty-five years later, the conflict is deadlier than ever and no less intractable.



“They told the Israelis that might is right,” Buttu said. “It encourages them to be even mightier.”

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Attorneys for the daughter of a U.S.-sanctioned Russian billionaire asked a U.S. federal court Tuesday for access to the financial records of officials including the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, whose administration is under scrutiny for seizing and selling the family's 265-foot (81-meter) megayacht and not releasing documents related to the sale.

The filing is the latest development in a global legal saga involving the Alfa Nero megayacht, which remained anchored off the eastern Caribbean island of Antigua for more than two years and whose potential buyers included former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

The megayacht, abandoned by Andrey Guryev, a Russian businessman who founded a fertilizer company, is being sought by his daughter, Yulia Guryeva-Motlokhov, who claims she is the rightful owner.

As part of the effort to recover the megayacht, her attorneys stated in the filing that they seek documents and information related to wire transfers and other transactions involving seven people and 12 entities in the past five years.

“The disappearance of millions from the sale of the Alfa Nero is just the beginning,” said Martin De Luca, with Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, adding that the discovery seeks to uncover whether any alleged backroom deals for personal enrichment took place.

The people targeted include Antigua Prime Minister Gaston Browne, his wife, their son and Antigua's general accountant and its port manager.




The entities include West Indies Oil Company Ltd., an Antigua-based petroleum storage and distribution company of which the government is a majority shareholder, and Fancy Bridge Ltd., a Hong Kong-based investment firm that owns shares in the oil company, as does Petróleos de Venezuela S.A., known as PDVSA.

Alfa Nero was anchored off Antigua when the war in Ukraine began in February 2022.

The vessel was not sanctioned by the U.S. government at the time, but officials in Antigua prohibited the megayacht from departing for months, according to the filing.

In August 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Guryev, saying he was part of a group of “Kremlin-connected elites” and “a known close associate” of Russian President Vladimir Putin, having previously served in his government. The department also designated Guryev's superyacht as “blocked property,” and said its location tracking was turned off “to avoid seizure.”

“As innocent people suffer from Russia's illegal war of aggression, Putin's allies have enriched themselves and funded opulent lifestyles,” said then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

In June 2023, the superyacht was removed from the sanctions list so Antigua could liquidate it. By then, the island's government had amended a local act to allow officials to declare vessels as abandoned and sell them at auction, a measure they took with Alfa Nero.

Schmidt, Google's former CEO, won the highest bid at $67 million but later dropped out, as did other bidders.

In July 2024, the government of Antigua and Barbuda sold it to an anonymous buyer for a reported $40 million, according to the filing, which noted that the vessel originally was valued at an estimated $120 million. It noted that private investigators later identified the buyers as Robert Yildirim and Ali Riza Yildirim of the Yildirim Group, a Turkish construction and shipping conglomerate.

The conglomerate did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Following the sale, Antigua's prime minister came under fire by opposition party members who demanded details of how the proceeds were spent. They have yet to receive any information.

“The prime minister does not give information except what he wants people to know,” said D. Gisele Isaac, chairperson of the opposition United Progressive Party. “Up to now, he has never disclosed to us the name of the person who bought Alfa Nero.”

Isaac noted that while Antigua and Barbuda has a Freedom of Information Act, an information commissioner appointed last year has no physical office. 

“There is nowhere to request information even if they were inclined to give it,” she said of the current administration, adding that she believes proceeds from the yacht sale should go to helping rebuild Ukraine.

Browne's wife, Maria Browne, Antigua's Minister of Housing, told The Antigua Observer newspaper in July 2024 that the proceeds were used to pay off government debt. Days before the report was published, the prime minister had said his administration was considering using the money to build a resort.

The filing noted that nearly $10 million remains unaccounted for and that investigators in the case were told the sale documents “were no longer available because they had apparently gone missing.”

Gaston Browne did not immediately return a message for comment.

Legal cases related to Alfa Nero also are ongoing in Russia and the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court. One case alleges that the seizure and sale of the megayacht is unconstitutional, with Browne previously claiming that the lawsuit before the regional court filed by Yulia Guryeva-Motlokhov was “frivolous.”

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — A Ukrainian delegation set to meet with America's top diplomat in Saudi Arabia about ending the 3-year war with Russia will propose a ceasefire covering the Black Sea and long-range missile strikes, as well as the release of prisoners, two senior Ukrainian officials said Monday.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about Tuesday's meeting, also told The Associated Press that the Ukrainian delegation is ready during the talks to sign an agreement with the United States on access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals — a deal that U.S. President Donald Trump is keen to secure.

The officials discussed the confidence-building measures, with no further details, ahead of the Ukrainian negotiating team's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Jeddah.

Kyiv is trying to repair the damage done when Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Feb. 28 visit to Washington descended into an Oval Office argument with Trump and Vice President JD Vance.

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on U.S. talks with Ukraine this week in Saudi Arabia.

At stake is the military aid and intelligence previously offered by the United States that had helped Ukraine in the war but is now paused as Washington pushes for a peace agreement.

Rubio and Zelenskyy landed a few hours apart Monday in Saudi Arabia, but did not meet. 

Zelenskyy met with the kingdom's powerful crown prince Monday evening, with the president saying they “had a detailed discussion on the steps and conditions needed to end the war and secure a reliable and lasting peace.” 




“Saudi Arabia provides a crucial platform for diplomacy, and we appreciate this,” Zelenskyy said online. 

Rubio also met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, thanking him for hosting the talks and also discussing Yemen's Houthi rebels, who are threatening to restart their attacks in the Red Sea.

Speaking to reporters aboard his plane before arriving, Rubio said he and national security adviser Mike Waltz would take stock of Ukraine's responses in Saudi Arabia.

If Ukraine and the U.S. reach an understanding acceptable to Trump, that could accelerate his administration's push to peace talks.

“What we want to know is, are they interested entering some sort of peace conversation and general outlines of the kinds of things they could consider, recognizing that it has been a costly and bloody war for the Ukrainians. They have suffered greatly and their people have suffered greatly,” Rubio said. “And it's hard in the aftermath of something like that to even talk about concessions, but that's the only way this is going to end and prevent more suffering.”

He added: “I'm not going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do. I think we want to listen to see how far they're willing to go and then compare that to what the Russians want and see how far apart we truly are.”

Zelenskyy has said his team meeting Rubio will include his chief of staff Andriy Yermak, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. Rubio will lead the U.S. team.

The rest of Europe remains skeptical about the talks as it has been sidelined by Washington.

The European Union last week agreed to boost the continent's defenses and to free up hundreds of billions of euros for security in response to the Trump administration's shift in stance on Ukraine.

White House special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News on Monday that the pause of U.S. intelligence-sharing with Ukraine has not limited defense intelligence-sharing.

“We never shut off intelligence for ... anything defensive that the Ukrainians need,” Witkoff said.

A pause on sharing U.S. intelligence that can be used for offensive purposes by Ukrainian forces remains in effect, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The official suggested that progress could be made toward reinstating intelligence-sharing with Ukraine during the Saudi talks.

JABLEH, Syria (AP) — Syria's interim government signed a deal Monday with the Kurdish-led authority that controls the country's northeast, including a ceasefire and the merging of the main U.S.-backed force there into the Syrian army.

The deal is a major breakthrough that would bring most of Syria under the control of the government, which is led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that led the ouster of President Bashar Assad in December.

The deal was signed by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.

The deal to be implemented by the end of the year would bring all border crossings with Iraq and Turkey, airports and oil fields in the northeast under the central government's control. Prisons where about 9,000 suspected members of the Islamic State group are also expected to come under government control. 

Syria's Kurds will gain their “constitutional rights” including using and teaching their language, which were banned for decades under Assad. Hundreds of thousands of Kurds, who were displaced during Syria's nearly 14-year civil war, will return to their homes. Thousands of Kurds living in Syria who have been deprived of nationality for decades under Assad will be given the right of citizenship, according to the agreement. 

The deal also says all Syrians will be part of the political process, no matter their religion or ethnicity.




Syria's new rulers are struggling to exert their authority across the country and reach political settlements with other minority communities, notably the Druze in southern Syria.

Earlier on Monday, Syria's government announced the end of the military operation against insurgents loyal to Assad and his family in the worst fighting since the end of the civil war.

The Defense Ministry's announcement came after a surprise attack by gunmen from the Alawite community on a police patrol near the port city of Latakia on Thursday spiraled into widespread clashes across Syria's coastal region. The Assad family are Alawites.

“To the remaining remnants of the defeated regime and its fleeing officers, our message is clear and explicit,” said Defense Ministry spokesperson Col. Hassan Abdel-Ghani. “If you return, we will also return, and you will find before you men who do not know how to retreat and who will not have mercy on those whose hands are stained with the blood of the innocent.”

Abdel-Ghani said security forces will continue searching for sleeper cells and remnants of the insurgency of former government loyalists.

Though the government's counter-offensive was able to largely contain the insurgency, footage surfaced of what appeared to be retaliatory attacks targeting the broader minority Alawite community, an offshoot of Shia Islam whose adherents live mainly in the western coastal region. 

Sajid Allah Al-Deek, a security official in the coastal region, told The Associated Press that security forces were deployed in the area from the Latakia governorate to Jableh and that the coastal highway is functioning again after being closed because of the fighting. 

“The civilians have begun returning to their homes,” Al-Deek said, adding that authorities have started detaining those blamed for acts of violence. 

Imad Baytar said his father, who worked for a taxi company, had gone from Jableh to Damascus and on his way back over the weekend “he was killed in the checkpoint.” Baytar blamed Assad supporters for the killing. 

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said 1,130 people were killed in the clashes, including 830 civilians. The AP could not independently verify these numbers.

Al-Sharaa said the retaliatory attacks against Alawite civilians and mistreatment of prisoners were isolated incidents, and vowed to crack down on the perpetrators as he formed a committee to investigate.

Still, the events alarmed Western governments, who have been urged to lift economic sanctions on Syria.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a statement Sunday urged Syrian authorities to “hold the perpetrators of these massacres” accountable. Rubio said the U.S. “stands with Syria's religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite, and Kurdish communities.”

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) — The father of a 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki, who went missing in the popular Dominican Republic tourist town of Punta Cana while on spring break with friends, said he has asked authorities to widen their investigation.

Konanki was last seen before dawn on March 6 at a beach near the resort where she was staying, according to Civil Defense officials. 

“It's four days, and if she was in water, she would likely have been strewn to shore,” her father Subbarayudu Konanki told WTOP-FM. “She's not found, so we're asking them to investigate multiple options, like kidnapping or abduction.”

Authorities were using drones, helicopters and detection dogs on Monday to scour the waters off the island's east coast where she was supposedly last seen, Jensen Sánchez, a Civil Defense spokesman, told The Associated Press.

“The search is underway at sea because it's presumed she drowned. According to the boy who was with her, the waves swept her away, but that is under police investigation,” he said.

He noted it can take more than a week for a body to surface in warm waters. 

When her family learned of her disappearance, Subbarayudu Konanki and his wife Sreedevi flew to Punta Cana with two family friends. He and a family friend filed a record of complaint Sunday, asking authorities to widen the investigation.




The complaint notes that the student's belongings, including her phone and wallet, were left with her friends, “which is unusual because she always carried her phone with her.”

“In light of these circumstances, I respectfully request that the authorities take immediate steps to investigate not only the possibility of an accidental drowning, but also the possibility of a kidnapping or foul play,” he wrote, according to WTOP-FM.

Sudiksha Konanki, a citizen of India, is a U.S. permanent resident from Chantilly, Virginia, according to the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, which is working with federal officials and university police in support of the Dominican National Police investigation.

University of Pittsburgh officials are in contact with the family and authorities in Virginia, and have offered their support in the efforts to find the missing student and bring her home safely, the school said in a statement.

Konanki and five other female university students traveled to the Dominican Republic on March 3, according to her dad.

BEIRUT (AP) — The Haydar family huddled in their apartment while gunmen stalked their hometown of Baniyas, hunting for members of Syria's minority Alawite sect like them. After 24 terrifying hours, a friend helped Samir Haydar, his wife and two sons escape — just in time.



Minutes later, the gunmen, who were Sunni Muslim, broke into his building and killed the Alawites still there, Haydar said. Down the street, gunmen took Haydar's two older brothers and a nephew out of their homes and killed them, too.



“If I had stayed five minutes longer, I with my entire family would have been killed,” Haydar, 67, said.

This past weekend's sectarian violence was possibly among the bloodiest 72 hours in Syria's modern history, including the 14 years of civil war from which the country is now emerging — and it threatens to open an endless cycle of vengeance. From early Friday to Sunday night, attackers rampaged through coastal provinces heavily populated by Alawites, as well as the nearby provinces of Hama and Homs, killing people, sometimes entire families, on streets, in homes, on rooftops.



Of the roughly 1,000 civilians killed, nearly 200 were in Baniyas, according to the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor. The toll could not be independently confirmed.



Among the attackers, witnesses say, were hardline Sunni Islamists, including Syria-based jihadi foreign fighters, who came from nearby provinces. Some had been allied to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the disbanded insurgent group that in December led the overthrow of longtime autocrat Bashar Assad and whose members dominate the interim government now running the country.






But many were local Sunnis, unleashing hatreds pent-up over past atrocities blamed on Alawites loyal to Assad.

(Syrian Civil Defense White Helmets via AP)





Survivors say some of the attackers in Baniyas were Syrians from surrounding villages seeking vengeance over a 2013 massacre in the nearby town of Beyda, where paramilitaries killed several hundred Sunnis. It was one of several mass killings under then-President Assad, whose attempts to crush protests helped foment an armed insurgency. 



Assad, who is Alawite, filled his security agencies and paramilitaries with members of the sect. Some Sunnis blame the entire community for Assad's brutal crackdowns, though Alawites say they also suffered under his rule. 



“We have a lot of injustices. Many were waiting for the chance to let it out,” Haydar said from his hiding place after fleeing home. “Instead of the pain teaching them mercy and making them against killings, they translated it into more killings.” 



Government reinforcements — which residents said did not intervene during the height of the killings — were eventually sent to restore order, and calm appeared to hold by late Monday. The government declared an independent committee appointed by the president will investigate the attacks. But the bloodshed has deeply tainted attempts by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa to convince Syria's minorities that he wants to include them as equals.

(AP Photo/Omar Albam)













The bloodshed began after reports Thursday night of seemingly coordinated attacks by Assad loyalists on government security forces near the city of Latakia and elsewhere along the coast.



The Associated Press spoke to nine residents from villages and towns hit by the violence. Some refused to give their names out of fear for their security. 



Haydar said that around daybreak Friday, hordes of armed Sunnis descended on Baniyas and surrounding villages in vans and pickup trucks, and waving guns. Another resident said she heard the gunmen shouting, “God is great,” and threatening and cursing the Alawite residents. 



Images and videos soon surfaced online, mostly posted by the perpetrators. Some show fighters in military fatigues pushing residents out of homes into the streets, beating some with rifles and forcing them to bark like dogs, in humiliation. Some show fighters firing on civilians. The hundreds of videos posted could not be immediately verified.



Looting and theft were rampant. Haydar said armed men went into the building of one of his elder brothers, 74-year-old Rafik, stole his valuables and left.



Hiding in his home, Haydar said he saw fighters shoot a neighbor at the entrance of a nearby building. One fighter turned the body over to ensure he was dead.

Around noon Friday, Haydar got a call from the wife of his other brother, Iskander. She screamed that fighters had stormed their building and taken away Iskander and their son, Mourad.



Later, Mourad told his mother what happened. The fighters dragged them to the roof and made him, his father and five other men lie down. Then they sprayed them with bullets. Miraculously, Mourad was uninjured. His father and the rest of the men were killed.



Ali Sheha, a 57-year-old resident of the same neighborhood, said five of his neighbors were shot in the street, including two doctors and their two children. The gunmen prevented anyone from coming to remove their bodies for hours. Acting fast, Sheha secured a van. He, his wife, three children and other families squeezed in and fled.



That night, the village where they took refuge also came under attack. Sheha said he and hundreds of others fled again, sleeping for two nights outside among olive and pine trees.



By Saturday afternoon, Sheha said he knew of at least 20 people killed, including three cousins and two of their children with special needs, gunned down in their food stall. 



When fighters entered his nephew's house, they asked if his wife was Sunni, because she wore a headscarf. They checked her ID and let her go. His sister, living in a building with many Christians, said the gunmen spared them and her husband, in his 80s. 



Haydar and his family escaped with help from a Sunni friend who negotiated for hours with the gunmen, explaining that Haydar had once been imprisoned by Assad's security forces.

(Syrian Civil Defense White Helmets via AP)





The friend, declining to give his name for fear of retribution, said the gunmen shoved and hit him, criticizing him for harboring Alawites.



During the weekend's violence, the friend sheltered 15 Alawites in his home, he said by phone from Baniyas.



In Tuwaym, an Alawite village in the Sunni-majority Hama province in central Syria, a resident said gunmen summoned the men, beat them with rifles and shot some. By the time they left, they had killed 25 members of her family, including her father and nine children between the ages of four and 15.



“I carried the children with my own hands. Some had their bones coming out of the gaping wounds,” she said, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear for her safety.







In Baniyas and elsewhere, bodies were left lying in streets, cars and apartment buildings, civil rescue teams said as they began to collect the dead. Families put out lists online of their slain loved ones. Haydar buried his brothers Sunday. 



Sheha said that as of Tuesday evening, he and hundreds of others remained in the forests outside Baniyas, too afraid to return home. At night, when it gets cold, they shelter in a nearby village.



Sheha, who had been part of a group of Alawite civilians that sought to build bridges with the new government, said the Alawites can't be blamed for the crimes of Assad's forces. Most Alawites were impoverished under Assad, abused by his top aides and forced to show loyalty and serve in the army, he said.



Instead of seeing inclusion and transitional justice, the community is targeted in revenge, he said. 



“Now people are not just afraid, they're terrified,” he said. “They have no trust, even in the government security that are present ... We're terrified of anyone we see with a mask on.”

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's Constitutional Court could soon rule on whether to dismiss or reinstate impeached conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol. That doesn't mean the political crisis caused by Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law is over. 

South Korea's already-severe political divide between conservatives and liberals will likely intensify as Seoul grapples with major foreign policy challenges like U.S. President Donald Trump's “America First” foreign policy platform and North Korea's increasing military cooperation with Russia.

Here's what to expect about the court's likely impending verdict on Yoon's Dec. 3 martial law decree that is testing South Korea's democracy.

The Constitutional Court has been deliberating whether to formally end Yoon's presidency since the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly in December voted to suspend him. Yoon is also facing a separate criminal trial after his arrest and indictment by prosecutors in January for alleged rebellion in connection with his martial law decree.

If the Constitutional Court rules against him, he will be officially thrown out of office and a national election will be held for a successor within two months.

If the court rules for Yoon, he would return to presidential duties. It was earlier unclear whether or how soon he might return to work, because he had been in jail until Saturday. 




Yoon is South Korea's first president who has been arrested while in office, and there are no clear laws or past rulings that could guarantee his immediate return to office, analysts say. But he was eventually released from prison, after a Seoul court canceled his arrest and allowed him to stand his criminal trial without being detained. 

After hearing 16 witnesses, the court ended arguments on Feb. 25, but it hasn't announced when it will announce a verdict. Observers say it could come as early as this week or next week, citing past cases where the court ruled on former presidents.

The biggest issue is why Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the assembly after declaring martial law. Yoon says he wanted to maintain order, but some top military and police officers sent there have said that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to block an assembly vote about his decree or detain his political rivals.

Lawmakers eventually managed to get in and vote down his decree. No violence and no arrests of politicians actually happened. 

Hundreds of thousands of people had earlier rallied near the assembly, calling for Yoon's ouster. But those protests have since been scaled down after Yoon's impeachment. Yoon supporters have also regularly staged major rallies to denounce Yoon's impeachment.

Ousting Yoon from office would prompt his supporters to ramp up protests before a presidential byelection to boost prospects for a new conservative president. Reinstating him would rekindle huge liberal demonstrations demanding Yoon's resignation, according to Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership.

“No matter what decision the Constitutional Court comes up with, South Koreans' division and extremely polarized politics can't help but to deepen,” Choi said.

Acting President Choi Sang-mok said Tuesday the government won't tolerate any illegal, violent protests, saying concerns about physical clashes between pro- and anti-Yoon forces are growing ahead of the court's verdict on Yoon.

Pro-Yoon rallies turned violent in January when protesters stormed the Seoul Western District Court after it approved Yoon's formal arrest warrant. The protesters attacked police officers with bricks, steel pipes and other objects. The attack injured 17 police officers.

Investigative authorities have alleged that Yoon's martial law enforcement amounted to rebellion, describing it as riots with the purpose of undermining the constitution. If he's convicted of rebellion, he could face the death penalty or life imprisonment.

Results of Yoon's criminal trial will likely be affected by the Constitutional Court ruling. 

The Constitutional Court's endorsement of Yoon's impeachment would confirm his violation of the constitution and could help increase prospects for Yoon's conviction of rebellion, said Park SungBae, a lawyer specializing in criminal law.

But a rejection would mean that the Constitutional Court believed Yoon's martial law decree wasn't serious enough to warrant dismissal, or maybe wasn't even illegal. Prosecutors would subsequently find it burdensome to raise Yoon's alleged rebellion at the criminal trial, Park said.

Prosecutors indicted Yoon only on charges of rebellion, because he has presidential immunity from most criminal prosecution. Some could question whether his criminal trial should continue if his impeachment is overturned at the Constitutional Court.

Even if the Constitutional Court reinstates Yoon, Choi said that Yoon's authority has already been badly hurt, so South Korea's leadership vacuum will likely continue.

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Hungary's government will limit the profit margin for grocers on a number of basic food items, the prime minister said on Tuesday, a response to growing inflation hitting consumers in the Central European country. 

Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said in a video on social media that commercial grocers must limit their markup to no more than 10% of wholesale price on 30 different food items, a policy that would be in effect from mid-March until the end of May, but could be extended.

He said that the government would monitor grocers' compliance with the policy, but didn't specify which foods would be included in the requirement. 

“In order to curb excessive and unjustified price increases, we have been negotiating with representatives of commercial chains in recent days,” Orbán said. “Unfortunately, the vendors' offers fell far short of our expectations.”

Inflation data released Tuesday by Hungary's statistical office showed an annual inflation rate of 5.6% for February, while food prices were up 7.1% on the year. By contrast, average inflation in the 20-member eurozone was 2.4% in February, according to the European Union's statistical office Eurostat. 

Hungary, which isn't a member of the eurozone, uses the forint as its national currency.

The data came as an “unpleasant inflation surprise” for Hungary, which “indicates increasing price pressure in the Hungarian economy with regard to more permanent inflationary trends,” Orsolya Nyeste, a macroeconomic analyst with Erste Bank, wrote in a note on Tuesday. 




Hungary has frequently led the EU in inflation in recent years as a cost of living crisis has gripped the country. The populist government has pointed to external factors such as the war in neighboring Ukraine and EU sanctions against Russia to explain the yearslong inflation spiral, though prices in other regional countries like Poland, Romania and Slovakia haven't risen nearly as steeply. 

Extreme jumps in food prices — peaking at more than 45% at the beginning of 2023 — have spurred previous government interventions in Hungary that included price caps on a number of food items as well as fuel at filling stations. But some critics and economists argued that sellers simply raised prices on other products to make up for shortfalls caused by the price controls. 

The inflation numbers present a challenge for Orbán as Hungary's economy continues to struggle before a national election in 2026. The EU's longest-serving leader, in power since 2010, faces a challenge from a new party that has placed the stagnating economy and cost of living issues at the center of its political platform. 

Compounding Hungary's difficulties, the EU has withheld billions in funding from Budapest because of concerns over judicial independence and rule-of-law standards.

SAN JUAN ALOTENANGO, Guatemala (AP) — Guatemala's Volcano of Fire is erupting, and authorities have evacuated nearly 300 families while warning that another 30,000 people in the area could be at risk.

The eruption started overnight. There is no immediate report of casualties. The 12,300-foot (3,763-meter) high volcano is one of the most active in Central America. It last erupted in June 2023.

The volcano spewed gas and ash far into the sky Monday, leading authorities to close schools in the vicinity and a key road connecting communities.

Claudinne Ugalde, secretary of the disaster agency, said “some 30,000 people more or less are at risk in these three (jurisdictions) and we are trying to have them evacuate or self-evacuate,” she said.

The biggest danger from the volcano are lahars, a mixture of ash, rock, mud and debris, that can bury entire towns.

A 2018 eruption killed 194 people and left another 234 missing.

Isaac García, 43, a resident of El Porvenir on the slopes of the volcano, had that tragedy in mind when he and his family decided to heed authorities' warnings to evacuate early Monday.

“We were a little worried because a few years ago the volcano became active,” García said, referencing the 2018 eruption, as he spoke with a mask to protect against the falling ash. He came to a shelter opened in San Juan Alotenango with his mother, wife and their three children, as well as other relatives.




The volcano is 33 miles (53 km) from Guatemala's capital.

The flow of volcanic material is weak to moderate but expected to increase, Guatemala's disaster agency said early Monday.

GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) — Caribbean leaders are pushing back against a new U.S. policy that aims to crack down on Cuban medical missions, saying that the work of hundreds of Cuban medical staff across the region is essential.

Hugh Todd, Guyana's foreign minister, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that foreign ministers from a 15-member Caribbean trade bloc known as Caricom recently met with U.S. Special Envoy for Latin America Mauricio Claver-Carone in Washington, D.C. after the U.S. threatened to restrict the visas of those involved with Cuban missions, which U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called “forced labor.”

“The U.S. is a strategic partner to Caricom, but this very important issue has to be dealt with at the level of heads of government,” Todd said.

Overall, Cuba has some 24,180 doctors working in 56 nations, with the missions boosting health care across the Caribbean, especially in impoverished nations with limited medical services.

“Their presence here is of importance to our health care system,” Kamina Johnson Smith, Jamaica's foreign minister, said at a press briefing last week, noting the island has more than 400 Cuban doctors, nurses, biomedical engineers and technicians.

At least two influential Caribbean leaders, the prime ministers of Trinidad and Tobago and of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, have publicly rallied against the new policy and said they would gladly forgo their U.S. visas.




“I will prefer to lose my visa than to have 60 poor and working people die,” said St. Vincent Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves.

He said Cuban doctors are providing critical care to patients including 60 who receive dialysis treatment.

“I will not be able to offer that service,” he told reporters during a recent official trip to Jamaica.

Meanwhile, Trinidad Prime Minister Keith Rowley told reporters Monday that he wouldn't mind losing his U.S. visa either.

“I just came back from California, and if I never go back there again in my life, I will ensure that the sovereignty of Trinidad and Tobago is known to its people and respected by all,” he said at a recent public event where the crowd clapped, according to the Daily Express, a local newspaper. “We rely heavily on health care specialists whom we have obtained from India, the Philippines, and mainly from Cuba over the decades.”

Rowley said those medical professionals are paid the same as local ones, “but we're now being accused of taking part in the program where people are being exploited. That is someone's interpretation.”

Last month, Bruno Rodríguez, Cuba's foreign minister, accused Rubio of putting his “personal agenda” ahead of U.S. interests and called the move an “unjustified aggressive measure.”

KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — Uganda has deployed an unknown number of troops to South Sudan in a bid to protect the fragile government of President Salva Kiir as a tense rivalry with his deputy threatens a return to civil war in the east African nation. 

Ugandan special forces have been deployed to Juba, the South Sudanese capital, “to support the government of South Sudan” against a possible rebel advance on the city, said Maj. Gen. Felix Kulayigye, a spokesperson for the Ugandan military. 

“We sent a force there two days ago,” he said. “We are not there for peacekeeping.”

In deploying Ugandan soldiers to Juba, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni moved as a guarantor of the peace process that keeps Kiir and Machar together in a delicate government of national unity, Kulayigye told The Associated Press Tuesday. 

Kiir and Museveni are allies, and Museveni has in the past intervened in the South Sudan conflict to keep Kiir in power. 

The deployment of Ugandan troops to South Sudan underscores rising tensions in the oil-producing country that has been plagued by political instability and violence since it gained independence from Sudan in 2011. 

The U.S. on Sunday ordered nonemergency government personnel to leave Juba. The U.N. is warning of “an alarming regression that could erase years of hard-won progress” in South Sudan. 

The latest tensions stem from fighting in the country's north between government troops and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, that's widely believed to be allied with Machar. 




Last week a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, was shot at. Earlier in the week, after the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir, government troops surrounded Machar's home in Juba and several of his allies were arrested. Deputy army chief Gen. Gabriel Duop Lam, who is seen as loyal to Machar, was among those detained.

Kiir had angered Machar's group earlier in the year by firing officials seen as loyal to Machar, who has charged that “persistent violations through unilateral decisions and decrees threaten the very existence” of their peace pact.

Kiir urged calm after last week's helicopter incident, saying in a statement that his government “will handle this crisis and we will remain steadfast in the path of peace.”

Civil war erupted in South Sudan in late 2013 when a rift between Kiir and Machar escalated into fighting along ethnic lines. Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, accused a group of soldiers loyal to Machar, an ethnic Nuer, of trying to take power by force. 

Machar escaped Juba, and later rebels loyal to him came close to capturing Juba but were repulsed by a combined force of South Sudanese soldiers loyal to Kiir and Ugandan special forces. 

More than 400,000 people were killed in the 5-year civil war that followed. 

With the support of regional leaders and the international community, Kiir and Machar signed a peace deal in 2018 and Machar returned to Juba as South Sudan's first vice president. 

But the political rivalry between South Sudan's top two leaders — with Kiir suspicious of his deputy's ambitions and Machar calling Kiir a dictator — remains an obstacle to lasting peace. Both men have been accused of violating multiple ceasefires.

Kiir and Machar are under pressure from the U.S. and others to more quickly implement the 2018 peace deal and prepare for elections.

Challenges include the government's failure to implement promised reforms such as completing the unification of the army command.

Presidential elections, repeatedly postponed, are now scheduled for 2026.

        The administration of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said it would cooperate if the ICC asked international police to take Duterte into custody.
    

Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested by police at Manila's airport on Tuesday in connection with a case of crimes against humanity filed against him, the country's government said. 

Duterte was arrested on the order of the International Criminal Court (ICC) after arriving from Hong Kong. 

Police took him into custody on orders of the ICC, which has been investigating the massive killings that happened under the former president's deadly crackdown against illegal drugs, President Ferdinand Marcos' office said in a statement.  

“Upon his arrival, the prosecutor general served the ICC notification for an arrest warrant to the former president for the crime of crime against humanity,” the government statement. “He's now in the custody of authorities."" 

The surprise arrest sparked a commotion at the airport, where lawyers and aides of Duterte loudly protested that they, along with a doctor and lawyers, were prevented from coming close to him after he was taken into police custody.

 “This is a violation of his constitutional right,” Senator Bong Go, a close ally of Duterte, told reporters. 

The Manila office of the international police received an official copy of the arrest warrant from the global court, the government said. 

It was not immediately clear where the police took Duterte. The government said the 79-year-old former leader was in good health and was examined by government doctors. 

The ICC began investigating drug killings under Duterte from 1 November 2011, when he was still mayor of the southern city of Davao, to 16 March 2019, as possible crimes against humanity. 

Duterte withdrew the Philippines in 2019 from the Rome Statute in a move human rights activists say was aimed at escaping accountability. 

The Duterte administration moved to suspend the global court's investigation in late 2021 by arguing that Philippine authorities were already looking into the same allegations, arguing the ICC — a court of last resort — didn't have jurisdiction. 

Appeals judges at the ICC ruled in 2023 that the investigation could resume and rejected the Duterte administration's objections. 

Based in The Hague, the ICC can step in when countries are unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects in the most heinous international crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.

        India had six of the nine most polluted cities worldwide, a new report from a Swiss-based database found.
    

Most of the world has dirty air, with just 17 per cent of cities globally meeting air pollution guidelines, a new report has found.

Switzerland-based air quality monitoring database IQAir analysed data from 40,000 air quality monitoring stations in 138 countries and found that Chad, Congo, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India had the dirtiest air.

India had six of the nine most polluted cities, with the industrial town of Byrnihat in northeastern India the worst.

Experts said the real amount of air pollution might be far greater as many parts of the world lack the monitoring needed for more accurate data. In Africa, for example, there is only one monitoring station for every 3.7 million people.

More air quality monitors are being set up to counter the issue, the report said. This year, report authors were able to incorporate data from 8,954 new locations and around a thousand new monitors as a result of efforts to better monitor air pollution.

But last week, data monitoring for air pollution was dealt a blow when the US State Department announced it would no longer make public its data from its embassies and consulates around the world.

Breathing in polluted air over a long period of time can cause respiratory illness, Alzheimer's disease and cancer, said Fatimah Ahamad, chief scientist and air pollution expert at Malaysia-based Sunway Centre for Planetary Health.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that air pollution kills around 7 million people each year.

Ahamad said much more needs to be done to cut air pollution levels. The WHO had earlier found that 99 per cent of the world's population lives in places that do not meet recommended air quality levels.

“If you have bad water, no water, you can tell people to wait for half an hour a day, the water will come. But if you have bad air, you cannot tell people to pause breathing,” she said.

Several cities like Beijing, Seoul, South Korea, and Rybnik in Poland have successfully improved their air quality through stricter regulations on pollution from vehicles, power plants, and industry. They've also promoted cleaner energy and invested in public transportation.

Another notable effort to curb severe air pollution was the Association of Southeast Asian Nations agreement on transboundary haze pollution. 

Even though it has had limited success so far, 10 countries in the region pledged to work together to monitor and curb pollution from large forest fires, a common occurrence in the region during dry seasons.

Shweta Narayan, a campaign lead at the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said many of the regions witnessing the worst air pollution are also places where planet-heating gases are released extensively through the burning of coal, oil, and gas.

Slashing planet-warming emissions to slow the heating up of the planet can also improve air quality, she said.

Air pollution and climate crisis ""are two sides of the same coin,"" she said.

        Polls opened on Tuesday for Greenlanders to elect their 31 lawmakers who will shape policy on the strategic island in the North Atlantic.
    

Greenland opened its polls for parliamentary elections on Tuesday, with all eyes set on the North Atlantic island for weeks as US President Donald Trump seeks to take control of it ""one way or the other"".

Home to 56,000 people, the autonomous region of Denmark occupies a strategic location halfway between the US and Russia and contains rare earth minerals key to driving the 21st century's global economy. 

Unofficial election results are expected soon after 11 pm CET, Tuesday, when polls will close. However, ballot papers arriving by plane, boat and helicopter from remote areas of the country will be awaited to give official results. 

Voters will elect 31 lawmakers to the Inatsisartut, Greenland's parliament, and seats will be distributed based on the share of votes each party receives. 

Several parties are participating in the election, including the left-wing party, Inuit Ataqatigiit, led by incumbent Prime Minister Mute Bourup, and the Siumut, which has previously held the parliament majority.

Lawmakers play a crucial role in making decisions for the island's future and have the opportunity to initiate a debate on declaring full-fledged independence from Denmark.

If Greenland were to become independent, it would rank as the world's 12th largest country by land area — a vast expanse now drawing increased attention.

Greenlanders are well aware of their island's rich resources and hope that rare earth minerals can help diversify an economy where government jobs account for 40% of employment.

However, strict environmental regulations protect much of the island, which remains largely covered by ice year-round. The harsh climate raises questions about whether mineral extraction is commercially viable.

Opinion polls indicate that most Greenlanders support independence. While they generally have no ill will toward Americans — often citing good relations with the local Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Force Base, where US military personnel have been stationed since 1951 — they show no interest in becoming part of the US.

Even among local Trump supporters, the belief in Greenland's right to self-determination remains strong. Their mantra is clear: Greenland is open for business but not for sale.

Last week, Trump spoke about Greenland to the US Congress, saying, ""I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.""

“The situation has changed because of Trump and because of the world,” said Doris Jensen, a representative of the social democratic Siumut party, who has always supported independence. “So we have decided in our party that we have to do (it) more quickly.”

        Mahmoud Khalil, a former graduate student at Columbia University, is challenging efforts to deport him over his role in student protests.
    

US President Donald Trump has said the detention of a pro-Palestinian activist in New York last week will be the “first arrest of many”, as his administration cracks down on those who participated in university campus protests against Israel and the war in Gaza. 

Mahmoud Khalil was arrested on Saturday over his role in the protest movement at Columbia University. The former graduate student is currently being held at an immigration facility in Louisiana. 

Although he has not been accused of a crime related to his activism, the US government has indicated that it wants to deport Khalil, who is a legal US resident. 

A federal judge in New York said the 30-year-old could not be deported while the court considers a legal challenge brought by his lawyers. 

Writing on Truth Social on Monday, Trump vowed that Khalil's case would not be the last, accusing him and others of “pro-terrorist, antisemitic, anti-American activity”. 

“We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathisers from our country — never to return again,” the US president wrote. No evidence was provided to back Trump's claims.

All domestic universities and colleges should “comply” with his administration's position on pro-Palestinian protests, the US president added.

The US Education Department warned dozens of universities on Monday that they would lose federal money if they did not take measures, including tackling antisemitism. This came a few days after Columbia had $400 million (€367m) of funding cut by Trump's government. 

The US president's clampdown has been strongly criticised by civil rights groups and some university professors and students, who accuse his administration of attempting to stifle criticism of Israel. 

Michael Thaddeus, a maths professor at Columbia, said Trump's policies were designed to instil fear. “Our message to Washington is that we are not silenced, we are not afraid, and we stand together, determined to defeat this ongoing assault on our fundamental rights,” he added.

In reaction to Khalil's arrest, a few hundred demonstrators gathered on Monday near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in New York to call for his release. 

Khalil has said that he was a spokesperson for — and not a leader of — the pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia.

        Ukraine became the world's largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–2024, with its imports increasing nearly a hundredfold compared with 2015–19. The country has also reformed its own arms industry, ramping up production since Russia's full-scale invasion.
    

Ukraine emerged as the largest importer of major arms globally between 2020 and 2024, with purchases increasing nearly a hundredfold compared to the previous five-year period, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reported on Monday.

At the same time, Ukraine has significantly ramped up its domestic weapon production since 2022, a direct response to Russia's all-out invasion in February of that year.

Around 35% of all weapons needed reportedly are now produced locally, compared to less than 10% at the beginning of the full-scale invasion. 

Europe currently supplies around 30% of Ukraine's military needs, while the US provides another 40%.

Yet, Ukraine can self-produce even more, Ukraine's Strategic Industries Minister Herman Smetanin told Euronews. 

“Up to 40% of weapons used at the frontlines are made in Ukraine. It is almost a half and we can produce even more, we just need funding,” Smetanin said.

Approximately 500 arms producers are operating in Ukraine, collectively employing nearly 300,000 people. Smetanin says all of them are ready and capable of increasing output and production, but they lack money and commitment to long-term funding. 

Understandable, he says, as he points out that ""not a single country would be able to be fully self-sufficient given the intensity of Russia's war against Ukraine.""

“We have financial constraints, and Russia does have those too. But they have a different level and size of economy. They can afford a little more than we can,” Smetanin added.

After Smetanin's interview with Euronews, Ukraine opened private companies' access to defence technologies that are owned by the state. 

If a state customer in the field of defence procurement requires weapons in volumes that exceed the capabilities of state-owned enterprises, at the initiative of the Ministry of Defence, the design documentation may be transferred to other manufacturers, including private ones, according to new rules.

The main achievement of Ukraine is different, however, Smetanin said.

""We have a new generation of weapons constructors and developers,"" Smetanin said, adding that thanks to them, Ukraine is ""becoming stronger in the world thanks to the technologies we have.""

“Look at deepstrike drones, first-person-view drones, other technologies. Who is creating all this? Young people, young engineers, postgraduates and graduates of our Ukrainian universities. A new generation of young people is emerging who are capable of further developing this country in five or ten years,” he illustrated.

And thanks to them, Ukraine is changing the approach and proves to the world that the world can learn a thing or two from Ukraine, Smetanin proudly added. 

“Now more and more foreigners are coming, they see that we have such a production facility, they are very interested and ask how much does it cost? And they want our technologies because it is 10 times cheaper in Ukraine and because everything has already been developed and tested, so they wouldn't need to wait for years,” he said.

Ukraine is now waiting for the most complicated weapons of its own make — missiles, specifically air defence ones, which the country did not produce before Russia's full-scale invasion.

“We had one missile, an anti-ship missile. We produced only dozens of them. And we actually spent 10 years developing this missile,” Smetanin recalled.

Three years into the full-scale invasion, Ukraine ""now already has its own home made missiles,"" according to him.

In December, Ukraine unveiled a new domestically produced missile drone dubbed the “Peklo” (meaning ""Hell"" in Ukrainian). This latest addition to the country's arsenal has a reported range of 700 kilometres and can reach speeds up to 700km/h. 

By the end of 2024, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that the serial production of the long-range Palyanytsia missile drone was underway, with trials of the new Ruta missile ongoing.

Also a new long-range version of Ukraine's domestically produced Neptune cruise missile is expected to become operational in the near future. 

The Neptune is currently best known as the weapon used to sink the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, the cruiser Moskva, during the initial months of the Russian invasion in spring 2022.

Smetanin remained very tight-lipped on any other projects Ukraine has been working on amid its missile production programme, saying only that due to the unfortunate circumstances, Ukraine had to push harder to develop its defence industry and can already now produce arms together with European manufacturers. 

“Now the company that produces NASAMS is thinking about integrating the Ukrainian rocket into its complex,"" he said.

NASAMS, aka Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, is a European-made mobile air defence system capable of launching 72 missiles in just 12 seconds. It is used to intercept aircraft, helicopters, and cruise missiles within a range of up to 40 kilometres.

But when it comes to protecting itself against Russia's most powerful ballistic missiles, Ukraine only has the US-made Patriot defence systems. And with Washington now pausing its military shipments to Kyiv, they could soon run out of ammunition.

“This is the US licence and nothing can be done without their approval. This is the most complicated and the most concerning item in terms of Ukraine's dependence,” Smetanin concluded.

        The accident happened near Johannesburg's O.R.Tambo International Airport on Tuesday. The cause remains unknown.
    

At least 16 people were killed when a bus crashed on a motorway near Johannesburg's international airport in South Africa on Tuesday, the country's transport ministry has said. 

Ministry spokesperson Collen Msibi confirmed that 12 passengers died at the scene and four others died later from their injuries in hospital. 

The cause of the accident is yet to be determined, officials said. 

The bus, which was transporting people from the township of Katlehong, east of Johannesburg, crashed near O.R.Tambo International Airport, they added. 

“On arrival we found patients lying across the road,” said William Ntladi, an emergency management spokesperson for the Ekurhuleni municipality.

Ntladi added that 11 passengers were critically injured, while another 24 suffered moderate to serious injuries. 

Responding to the tragedy, Andile Mngwevu, a city councillor, said: “We are lost for words. This is a disaster.

“To see so many bodies lying around is quite saddening, and the city really feels for the families who would have expected to see their loved ones return home later today.”

South African Transport Minister Barbra Creecy said she was “extremely concerned” by the crash, which is the country's third serious bus accident in the past week. 

Creecy has asked the Road Traffic Management Corporation to meet with all bus operators soon to speak about improving passenger safety.

        On Tuesday, doctors announced Pope Francis was no longer in immediate danger as the 88-year-old pontiff recovers in hospital from double pneumonia.
    

The Vatican on Tuesday announced that Pope Francis had a restful night and woke up around 8 am CET, another positive update after the pontiff's prognosis was upgraded on Monday evening. 

The pope's doctors have lifted an earlier prognosis of ""guarded"", meaning the pontiff's life is no longer in danger. 

Doctors however warned he would still be hospitalised for several more days to receive treatment, on top of a likely period of rehabilitation. 

Pope Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital with a severe respiratory infection more than three weeks ago, and has been an inpatient ever since. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with double pneumonia. 

He is still using supplemental oxygen during the day and a ventilation mask at night in order to help him breathe.

It its latest medical update, the Vatican said doctors had deemed his condition stable with some improvement.

""Improvements recorded in previous days were further consolidated, as confirmed by both blood tests and clinical findings, as well as by the pope's good response to pharmacological therapy,"" the Vatican said.

The pope has been described as being in stable condition for the past week, having suffered two crises of ""acute respiratory insufficiency"" in early March.

The 88-year-old pontiff has experienced several bouts of ill health over the last two years. He has been prone to lung infections since having one part of his lung removed as a young adult. 

His current hospital stay is the longest in his 12-year-papacy.

In a sign of his improved health, Pope Francis followed the Vatican's weeklong spiritual retreat via video link on Monday, joining both morning and afternoon sessions.

        Prosecutors claim the suspects, allegedly members of an Eastern European crime group linked to Iran, were hired to carry out a murder on US soil in 2022.
    

Two men accused of involvement in an Iranian government plan to assassinate a prominent Iranian-American journalist and human rights activist went on trial in New York on Monday.

The two defendants, Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov, are alleged to be members of an Eastern European crime syndicate with links to Iran.

Prosecutors charged them in January 2023 with conspiring to murder Masih Alinejad, a journalist, author, and contributor to Voice of America who fled Iran following the country's contested 2009 presidential election.

Alinejad has confirmed she was the intended target, and is expected to testify during the trial about repeated threats she has faced from the Iranian government. 

Addressing more than 100 prospective jurors at the Manhattan court, Judge Colleen McMahon explained that the trial would last less than three weeks and outlined the charges, which include murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire.

""Nobody got killed,"" McMahon told jurors. ""There was, in fact, no murder. Nobody got hurt.""

She also reminded the court that both Amirov and Omarov had pleaded not guilty and remained presumed innocent until proven otherwise.

During the trial, prosecutors intend to call expert witnesses to testify that the Iranian government has long targeted political dissidents abroad, including Alinejad, for kidnapping or assassination.

The US government's indictment states that Iran “is actively targeting nationals of the United States and its allies living in countries around the world for kidnapping and/or execution, in order to repress and silence dissidents critical of the Iranian regime”. 

Judge McMahon has ruled that while limited testimony about Iran's history of targeting dissidents will be allowed, extensive evidence about “45 years of Iranian state-sponsored vendettas” would be unfair to the defendants, who are not Iranian citizens or members of Iranian intelligence.

However, she confirmed that jurors will hear “a substantial amount of very inflammatory evidence” directly tied to the charges.

According to prosecutors, Tehran has long pursued Alinejad specifically. In 2018, Iranian officials reportedly offered money to her relatives in Iran to lure her to a third country where she could be arrested and extradited to Iran, but her family refused to comply.

Court documents also show that in 2020, Iranian intelligence services orchestrated a plan to kidnap Alinejad in the US and forcibly return her to Iran for execution. 

According to the indictment, Amirov, described as a leader of an Eastern European criminal organisation, was asked to target Alinejad by unnamed individuals. He then contacted Omarov, who was based in Eastern Europe.

The two men are accused of hiring a New York-based individual, offering $30,000 (€27,500) to carry out the attack on Alinejad, whose activism has encouraged Iranian women to defy the country's hijab laws by filming themselves without head coverings.

The plot was ultimately foiled when Alinejad left her home after noticing suspicious activity. New York police officers later arrested the hired hitman, discovering he was in possession of a gun, ammunition magazines, cash, and a black ski mask.

        A new bill that would change an old licencing law has faced opposition from the left over concerns about alcohol consumption.
    

In an effort to improve business and social settings in rural villages, French MP Guillaume Kasbarian is pushing for a new law that would make it easier to reopen bistros, cafés, and bars.

Kasbarian, a member of President Emmanuel Macron's party, Renaissance, hopes to relax the rules surrounding the licence required to sell alcoholic beverages. 

​His proposal passed the National Assembly on Monday with 156 lawmakers in favour and two against. It now requires approval from the Senate to become law. 

According to local media, the number of traditional village bistros has significantly decreased in the past 60 years in small towns across France. 

Many rural communities now lack any form of local business, with cafés once serving as hubs for social interaction and community life. 

In 1960, France had around 200,000 cafés; by 2015, the number had sunk to 36,000. According to a 2017 report by France Boissons industry body and the CREDOC consumer studies agency, the decline mainly affected rural areas.

Kasbarian wants to reverse this trend by simplifying access to the type-4 alcohol licence. As things stand, new licences are not issued. Instead, café or bar owners must wait until an existing drinking spot closes and pay €7,500 to purchase the existing permit before undergoing an administrative approval process. 

Kasbarian's proposed reform would allow villages with less than 3,500 residents to request the permit without having to wait. 

Supporters argue that the change could revive struggling rural communities, making it easier for entrepreneurs to open businesses and encourage social connections in isolated areas. 

“The goal is to bring life back to villages,” Kasbarian told French media. “In many small towns, there is not a single shop, café, or bistro. Yet, these places are essential for socialising and community engagement.”

The proposal has faced resistance from left-wing party La France Insoumise, which argues that it could encourage alcoholism. 

Kasbarian says that these concerns are misguided, pointing out that 80% of alcohol is sold in supermarkets. 

“In villages without bars, people don't stop drinking,"" he told local media, ""they simply consume alcohol at home, without any control. Closing bars and cafés does not fight alcoholism; it's a misleading argument.""

        Exactly three years ago, in early March 2022, satellite images showed the first mass grave of civilians in Bucha, a town in the Kyiv region. It was on the grounds of the Church of St Andrew, where now there is the Wall of Remembrance for the civilians killed by Russian troops during the occupation.
    

The priest at the Church of St Andrew, Father Andriy Halavin, is still in Bucha, three years since Russia started its brutal invasion of Ukraine. 

The region of Kyiv and its towns like Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin were the first to face — and stop — Russian forces in their all-out war in early 2022. 

Showing Bucha's Wall of Remembrance, Father Andriy says it will be replaced with a permanent memorial. 

He told Euronews the wall, replete with metal plaques for each person killed in the town after Russian troops occupied it, should be a place where people could come with their children, for it to be also a place of strength. 

“The liberation of our country started with the liberation of Bucha,"" Father Andriy explained.

Father Andriy knows every corner of Bucha and probably every resident. As he shows the memorial, he points at the house facing the church. 

The family who lived there escaped Russia's war once in the past, when Moscow forces invaded the Donbas. But the Kremlin and its war chased them all the way to Bucha. 

On 5 March — several days into the occupation — the family tried to evacuate. 

""Russian forces opened fire at them, at the entire family, just like this, in the streets of Bucha,"" Father Andriy recalled. 

Only the father survived, having lost his leg. The names of the two children — nine and four years old — and their mother are engraved on the memorial at the church, right across the road from their house. The man still lives in Bucha, Father Andriy says.

He knows the names and stories of almost everyone whose name is on the memorial. Many families got killed while trying to evacuate, he explained. 

“We have surveillance cameras at the exit from Bucha, the roundabout towards Hostomel and Irpin. On the second day of the full-scale war, the Russians fired at any moving car, and many people died there,"" he said.

Many civilians also got killed while staying in Bucha under occupation. “When Russians came into people's houses, they would open fire at anyone inside,” Father Andriy explained.

Residents had no choice but to leave and try to find food, water and medicine. Russian soldiers told the locals to put white bands on their arms, and they'd be safe. 

“A father and a son went to a city hall to get medicine, both got shot. The son, thirteen years old, survived because the bullet got through the hood of his vest. He stayed on the ground, next to the body of his father, pretending to be dead until it was safer to run home,” the priest recalled.

The Vokzal'na Street in Bucha, where a column of Russian armored vehicles was destroyed by a Ukrainian army, famous for a photo that shocked the world, look totally different now. 

There's no sign of battle and almost no sign of destroyed houses. The street has been rebuilt, and it now looks just like any other road in any quiet European town with modern cookie-cutter houses and tidy fences. 

Cafes and shops have been rebuilt and reopened, and people are back. But although one can spot the scars of Russian brutality only on some residential buildings in the facades pockmarked by shrapnel from the shelling signs on the facade — just like on the Church of St Andrew — the emotional wounds have not healed. 

There are 509 names of the civilians killed during the occupation of Bucha on the Wall of Remembrance, Father Andriy says, adding, ""509 civilians died here not as a result of combat, but during the occupation. And we have not yet talked about rape, robbery, abduction of children.""

Among many statements regarding Ukraine by US President Donald Trump, there was one that really stood out, crossing red lines for the Ukrainians: when Trump said that Ukraine should not have started the war.

Father Andriy says for the Russians, negotiations are not a way to find peace, but ""a way to achieve what you cannot achieve with weapons.""

“The Russians wanted to take Kyiv in three days, and they failed. With the help of Trump, negotiations, and so on, they are trying to occupy Ukraine in some other way,"" he explained.

""This is a matter of justice. What is worrying is that when they say ‘negotiations', no one talks about crimes. No one talks about responsibility.”

He says he fully understands why those on the outside might be unable to comprehend it, explaining it as simple as ""human psychology"".

“When planes were already flying over our heads, Russian helicopters were flying overhead and everything was blasting away and exploding, you understand that there is war,"" Father Andriy said.

""But mentally it was it impossible to admit that it can be real in the 21st century.” 

Many people in Europe feel the same way, that the war is impossible, Father Andriy points out. 

""They are not ready to accept it. They have a calm, comfortable life,"" he said, adding that now Europeans are in a state where they are beginning to understand, but they are not ready to give up what they had or accept things as they are. 

“If this continues, there is a danger that they will have to learn Russian. Because if Ukraine falls, Poland and the Baltic states will be next.”

He believes that when it comes to any talks with Russia, the crucial issue is the understanding of what ""peace"" essentially means, which is very different in Ukraine and Russia. Even if the conditions and terms of the agreement are fair, the question is, will this make Russia's Vladimir Putin and his forces stop shooting?

“Ukrainians understand the word ‘peace' when they are not killed, when there is justice, when criminals are held accountable for their crimes — this is peace,"" Father Andriy said.

""From Putin's point of view, I think, ‘peace' is something like when they don't shoot anymore because there are no more survivors left on our side, no one alive, only territories left,"" he concluded.

        US President Donald Trump faces increased pressure to stimulate economic growth after a brutal market selloff on Monday indicated rising recession risks.
    

US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday he intends to double planned tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%.

In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, he said the tariffs are set to take effect on Wednesday, calling the decision a response to the price increases that the provincial government of Ontario put on electricity sold to the United States.

“I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,” he wrote.

After a brutal stock market selloff on Monday and further jitters Tuesday, Trump faces increased pressure to show he has a legitimate plan to grow the economy instead of pushing it into a recession. 

The US President has said his separate 25% tariffs are about fentanyl smuggling and voicing objections to Canada putting high taxes on dairy imports that penalise US farmers. But he also called again for Canada to become part of the United States as its ""51st state,"" saying ""this would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.""

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, after responding to Trump by raising electricity prices, said Tuesday on MSNBC that the U.S. people and its business leaders needed to speak up against the “chaos” caused by Trump's launching of a trade war.

“If we go into a recession it's self made by one person. It's called President Trump's recession,” Ford said. “It shouldn't be this way. We should be booming, both countries.”

Trump condemned the use of electricity “as a bargaining chip and threat,” saying in a separate social media post on Tuesday that Canada ""will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come!”

Ontario provides electricity to Minnesota, New York and Michigan and Trump pledged to declare a national emergency in those states.

Mexico has also been targeted with 25% tariffs because of the president's dissatisfaction over drug trafficking and illegal immigration, though he suspended the taxes on imports that are compliant with the 2020 USMCA trade pact for one month.

Asked if Mexico feared it could face the same 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium as Canada, President Claudia Sheinbaum, said “No, we are respectful.”

The investment bank Goldman Sachs revised down its growth forecast for this year to 1.7% from 2.2% previously. It modestly increased its recession probability to 20% “because the White House has the option to pull back policy changes if downside risks begin to look more serious.”

Trump has tried to assure the public that his tariffs would cause some “transition” to the economy, with the taxes prodding more companies to begin the years-long process of relocating factories to the United States to avoid the tariffs. But he set off alarms in an interview broadcast on Sunday in which he didn't rule out a possible recession.

“I hate to predict things like that,” Trump said on Fox News. ""There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing. And there are always periods of — it takes a little time. It takes a little time. But I don't — I think it should be great for us. I mean, I think it should be great.""

The promise of great things ahead did not eliminate anxiety, with the S&P 500 stock index tumbling 2.7% on Monday in an unmistakable ""Trump slump"" that has erased the market gains that greeted his victory in November 2024. The S&P 500 index fell roughly 1% in Tuesday afternoon trading.

        The French president warned of tough budget decisions ahead as the country struggles with a daunting public deficit.
    

French President Emmanuel Macron is spearheading an accelerating effort to reshape European security. He is taking the initiative just as the European Commission agrees on an €800bn plan to bolster European defence sovereignty in response to the rapprochement between Russia and the US, as well as US President Donald Trump's increasing scorn towards both Ukraine and NATO. 

But as France's debate over military spending intensifies, political divisions mean the chances of finding consensus are increasingly slim.

France currently allocates 2% of its GDP to its defence sector. Macron told French newspaper Le Figaro that he aims to raise defence spending up to 3.5% of the country's GDP, a hike that would require an additional €30bn annually.

Such a drastic increase would be a major challenge given the state of France's strained public finances. 

Macron's ambition clashes with the government's current goal of lowering France's budget deficit to 5.4% of its GDP by the end of 2025, down from around 6% in 2024. 

One proposal under discussion to finance France's increased military spending is a national loan, a measure last used to reduce state debt in 1993. 

Prime Minister François Bayrou and Economy Minister Eric Lombard have floated the idea and also proposed setting up a defence-specific account similar to the Livret A — a regulated, tax-exempt personal savings account with an interest rate set by the state, with funds invested by the state to pay for infrastructure and housing, national debt payments and other uses.

Lombard has also proposed seeking investment from banks, insurance firms, and institutional investors. 

“I think that in the current situation, France can hardly afford to increase its public debt,” Sylvain Bersinger, chief economist at consulting firm Asteres, told Euronews.

""Another solution is to try and increase growth and therefore resources and tax revenues. Typically, this means getting the French to work more by increasing the pension age. But that's so unpopular that I don't think it's even possible. I'd say there's no magic solution."" 

Yet despite economic concerns, public support for increased defence spending remains high. 

A recent survey conducted by Ipsos-Cesi Engineering School showed that 68% of the French electorate support the idea. Even 66% of voters supporting the hard-left party France Unbowed (LFI), which is usually wary of any military intervention, said they support the budget increase. 

As for supporters of the far-right party National Rally (RN), a little more than half said they are in favour of boosting military spending. 

While most MPs in France's lower house of parliament have expressed their support for Ukraine specifically, political divisions remain. 

Last week, lawmakers debated France's stance on Ukraine and whether to send peacekeeping troops on the ground. RN leader Marine Le Pen said that while she supports aiding Ukraine, she believes France should prioritise its national interests. 

She also rejected a unified European defence strategy and opposed any suggestion of sending French troops to Ukraine. 

Meanwhile, the Socialist Party and the Greens have aligned themselves with the government, agreeing that Europe must strengthen its military sovereignty. Socialist leader Olivier Faure said he was against any measures that would place the burden on French citizens. 

Instead, he has proposed taxing corporations and cracking down on EU countries that serve as tax havens for big tech, in particular Ireland and Luxembourg. 

LFI MP Alma Dufour, meanwhile, has raised concerns that increased military spending will ultimately benefit the US defence industry. 

“We're not against France and Europe rearming,"" she said in an interview with broadcaster Franceinfo. ""The question is that if we spend €40bn this year on military equipment, where will that go? To the United States."" 

On Monday, a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute showed that 64% of Europe's arms imports come from the US, followed by France, South Korea, Germany and Israel.

Dufour has proposed an increased tax on billionaires, claiming that a 2% tax on France's 500 richest individuals could generate €25bn — putting France well on the way to achieving Macron's military spending ambitions.

        The new regulation on deportations represents the first tangible result of the outsourcing trend that EU leaders endorsed last year.
    

The European Commission presented on Tuesday a new regulation that, if approved, will enable member states to transfer rejected asylum seekers to distant countries where they have never set foot, signalling a transformative shift in migration policy.

The law falls short of establishing an EU-wide programme to build deportation centres (or ""return hubs"", as Brussels calls them) but lays the necessary legal groundwork to allow governments to strike arrangements with nations outside the bloc that might be willing to host migrants in return for financial incentives.

The physical transfer will only happen after the applicant has exhausted all legal avenues to obtain international protection and has been given a definitive return order. 

Tuesday's regulation is the first tangible result of the outsourcing push that EU leaders endorsed in a watershed summit in October. Back then, heads of state and government agreed to explore ""new ways to prevent and counter irregular migration"", a broad yet vague formulation that has given Brussels permission to enter uncharted territories.

With its proposal, the Commission brings outsourcing a step closer by redefining what ""country of return"" means in practice. Under current rules, member states can send rejected asylum seekers to their country of origin, a country of transit that has a readmission agreement or any other country if the migrant ""voluntarily"" consents.

In the new law, the consent is eroded and the modalities for transfer are expanded to allow EU countries to strike deals with non-EU countries and build deportation centres.

The Commission will not spearhead the construction or management of these facilities, leaving it instead to governments to decide if they want to pursue the project, which is expected to be costly, logistically challenging and politically controversial. Still, the possibility of schemes at the EU level is not completely ruled out.

""We're creating the legal frame, we're not creating the content,"" said Magnus Brunner, the European Commissioner for Internal Affairs and Migration. ""It's an innovative new solution for member states, they're free to take it.""

Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands have led discussions on outsourcing and appear to be the likeliest candidates to move ahead. Italy is reportedly considering a plan to turn its centres in Albania, meant to process asylum claims, into full-fledged ""return hubs"". The Albanian centres are currently empty after being paralysed by legal action.

The regulation, however, sets out minimum criteria that these centres should meet, such as an independent body to monitor the ""effective application"" of the agreement, an exemption for unaccompanied minors and families with children, and a clear definition of responsibilities to handle potential violations of human rights.

Such violations are inevitable, humanitarian organisations have warned since the October summit. In their view, sending migrants, without their consent, to distant nations will result in deficient oversight and substandard conditions, creating fertile ground for rampant breaches of human rights that go unpunished.

NGOs have also raised the alarm about the widespread use of detention that outsourcing will require, as the asylum seekers will need to be physically kept inside the facilities.

The law presented on Tuesday foresees an extensive list of reasons to place rejected asylum seekers in detention, lasting a maximum of two years ""in a given member state"". It does not set a maximum for the detention in an overseas centre, which should be determined in a bilateral agreement and ""may be in the short or longer term"".

""The European Commission has caved to the unworkable, expensive and inhumane demands of a few shrill anti-human rights and anti-migration governments,"" said Eve Geddie, the director of Amnesty International's EU office.

""Today's proposal lays the ground for states to send people to countries to which they have no connection, to languish in detention centres, with little credible guarantees that their rights will be upheld. Frankly, this is a new low for Europe.""

During the presentation, Brunner sought to flip the contentious narrative around outsourcing by depicting it as an effort that is, at least, worth trying.

""Let's look into whether it works or not,"" he said. ""Let's be open-minded on those ideas as well. The 'return hub' possibility is something new, something different, which we can explore in the different member states.""

The Return Regulation intends to close the gap left in the Pact for Migration and Asylum, the all-encompassing reform that the EU approved last year after almost four years of hard-fought negotiations. The Pact establishes common rules for the reception and management of asylum seekers, with a system of ""mandatory solidarity"" to ensure that all governments, from North to South, help share the burden.

But the overhaul did not address the issue of returns, the last stage of the process for asylum seekers whose applications are turned down and who no longer have the right to stay on European soil. A previous attempt to revamp the existing legislation became stuck in the European Parliament and never saw the light of day.

For years, the bloc has struggled to speed up the rate of effective deportations, which fluctuates between 20% and 25%, with no visible progress. NGOs have warned the data behind the return rate is incomplete and should not be used to guide policy-making.

The reasons for the stagnation relate to a lack of cooperation between asylum seekers and authorities, between member states themselves and, especially, between member states and the countries of origin, which often refuse to take back their nationals.

With far-right forces exploiting the issue of irregular migration for electoral gains, member states piled pressure on the Commission to put forward a more stringent text and break the decades-long taboo on outsourcing.

The reply from Brussels seems to deliver on the assignment: besides enshrining in law the permission to build deportation centres in faraway nations, the proposed regulation lays down obligations that rejected asylum seekers must respect, such as providing personal ID, biometric data, contact details and information on countries they transited.

Migrants must remain available at all times throughout the return process and allow their belongings to be searched if ""necessary and duly justified"", the law says.

Those who breach these obligations could see their social benefits cut off, travel documents seized and work permits revoked. They could also face prolonged bans to enter the EU in the future and even ""financial penalties"", which the text does not detail. 

Additionally, the law establishes a fast-tracked procedure to detain and expel asylum seekers who are deemed to pose ""security risks"".

NGOs have decried this ""punitive"" approach, arguing it would harm the rights of asylum seekers, reinforce ""dangerous stereotypes"", and blur the line between migration and criminal law. The fact that the Commission did not carry out an impact assessment before unveiling the regulation has alarmed civil society, who feel the legislation has been rushed under political pressure and without meaningful consultation.

By contrast, the political reception is expected to be warmer.

The Council and the Parliament, the two co-legislators who will negotiate the draft law, have turned markedly to the right in recent years, demanding a harder line to curb irregular migration. Asylum applications across the EU, Norway and Switzerland decreased by 11% in 2024 but remained above the one-million mark.

Lukas Mandl, a conservative MEP from Austria, praised the Commission's proposal as ""really impressive"" and ""very good"", including the outsourcing element, and predicted it would be embraced by a ""vast majority"" in the Parliament. ""I'm confident (that) we will have a proper and good regulation,"" Mandl told Euronews.

Meanwhile, Cecilia Strada, an Italian socialist, criticised how the Commission has tweaked the legal definitions to enable the transfer of migrants to countries with which ""they have no type of connection and where they can, potentially, stay forever.""

""This is not the path that we feel like taking,"" Strada said.

Additionally, the regulation foresees the introduction of a European Return Order to facilitate the recognition of deportation decisions between countries, which is patchy today. After the Migration Pact enters into force, the Commission will make mutual recognition mandatory across the bloc to allow decisions to be directly enforceable.

        Friedrich Merz, who once presented himself as the last line of defence against debt madness, is now set to push Germany's new debt into the trillion-euro range. This program will accelerate the country's economic decline, Joachim Nikolaus Steinhöfel writes.
    

CDU's Friedrich Merz wants to become the next chancellor of Germany — yet rarely has a leading politician shrunk so quickly to the stature of a dwarf, even before his presumed assumption of office, as the nearly 2-metre-tall Christian Democrat. 

Observers have long known that Merz is capable of breathtakingly rapid changes in direction when opportunism dictates, and that he lacks the backbone to stand up for uncomfortable necessities is also well established. 

Now, the potential future German chancellor has demonstrated his extraordinary clumsiness in foreign policy matters with particular emphasis.

Merz claimed that the policies of Argentinian President Javier Milei would ruin the state and trample on the people, reacting to former FDP Finance Minister Christian Lindner's demand that Germany should ""dare (to be) more (like) Milei"". 

Merz was apparently unaware of the spectacular successes of Milei's policies and the turnaround of Argentina's economy. Even more amateurishly, the self-proclaimed transatlanticist Merz responded to US Vice President JD Vance's speech at the Munich Security Conference. 

He described Vance's remarks as ""almost an overbearing approach to Europeans, especially to us Germans."" He added, ""I will not let an American vice president tell me with whom I should speak here in Germany."" 

While this sounds very self-confident, it completely lacks any sense of reality. Germany plays in the second league both militarily and politically, and Merz will very soon feel the consequences of not being in a position to dictate terms.

Germany's military dwarfism is now to be countered by a historic debt spree, diametrically opposed to everything the CDU promised voters before the recent general election. 

There has never been a more blatant 360-degree turnaround — to quote the still-serving German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock — regarding campaign promises in Germany. 

According to a report by Der Spiegel, Merz fell for an internet rumour that US President Donald Trump would announce the United States' withdrawal from NATO in the recent State of the Union address. 

This led him to be persuaded by his potential coalition partner into a debt orgy that will massively damage the country and for which he received nothing in return, especially regarding migration policy. 

This humiliation by the Social Democrats, who suffered their worst election result since the 19th century, will go down in history as a historic failure in coalition negotiations.

One can now bet that Merz and the CDU will also hand over a few hundred billion to the further marginalised Greens for their pet projects, such as climate protection. Friedrich Merz, who once presented himself as the last line of defence against debt madness, is now set to push Germany's new debt into the trillion-euro range.

There are also concerns about the democratic legitimacy of an outgoing parliament deciding on far-reaching constitutional amendments that would bind the future government and are necessary to implement Merz's debt plans. 

Even more so, as the constituent session of the new federal parliament is delayed without necessity just for this purpose. Many interpret this as a disregard for the will of the voters. 

Although Merz promised the entire country exactly the opposite — no new debt — he now wants to use or abuse the voted-out German parliament, the Bundestag, to lead the country and future generations on the “road to serfdom” and into debt bondage. 

Friedrich Merz knows that he would not get a majority for this in the newly elected parliament. That's why those who have been voted out of office should have one last go at chiseling this huge burden into the German constitution. 

Dietrich Murswiek, Germany's leading constitutional lawyer, assessed the events as follows: “The old Bundestag is now to decide quickly, not because the project cannot be postponed, but for the sole purpose of tricking the newly elected Bundestag and presenting it with a fait accompli with the help of the old majority."" 

""This approach shows contempt for the will of the voters, indeed contempt for the democratic legitimisation process. An aloof political class arrogantly disregards those from whom the power of the state should emanate in a democracy,"" Murswiek added. 

""It shows no respect for the election results and no respect for the constitution. The constitution is quickly changed because the required majority to do so was just lost in the election.”

The debt spree, misleadingly referred to as Sondervermögen (“special assets”), is equivalent in size to around 20% of Germany's gross national product. It will thus catapult the country's debt from 65% to 85%, which is not only a serious violation of the Maastricht debt criterion but will also expand the money supply and drastically worsen Germany's credit rating. 

Debt of 0.35% of GDP per year, which was previously permitted under Article 115 of the constitution, will effectively become a minimum annual debt of 4.5% p.a. over the 10-year term. 

Many countries in the eurozone will therefore also turn away from fiscal discipline and ignore the debt rules of the Maastricht Treaty, which will have a considerable impact on the German and eurozone bond markets, resulting in significant interest rate increases. A new European sovereign debt and banking crisis is therefore looming in a few years' time.

Rising capital market interest rates and the absorption of a large proportion of the economy's savings will crowd out private investment, the government spending ratio will increase significantly, and private investment activity will decline, causing the economy's productivity to fall.

While short-term growth may be stimulated through government demand in the spirit of a Keynesian economic stimulus program, the above-described effects will overcompensate for this in the medium term.

Given the performance profile of German authorities in procurement, it is expected that a large part of this program will be wasted. From an economic perspective, defence spending is government consumption, as tanks and other acquisitions are not designed to produce anything in the future. In this sense, they are not even investments.

Regarding infrastructure, the state's inefficient and poor procurement system generally results in paying twice as much as private companies for the same outcome. 

If €500 billion are allocated to this, significant price increases should be expected due to high demand and limited supply capacity. The real purchasing power of this program will therefore be closer to €200 billion rather than €500 billion. The same logic applies to defence spending.

In conclusion, this program will accelerate Germany's economic decline, both in terms of defence and infrastructure.

Joachim Nikolaus Steinhöfel is one of the most renowned German lawyers specialising in media law. In 2024, he won 16 out of 16 cases against the German government, including before the Federal Constitutional Court. His book “Die digitale Bevormundung” (""The Digital Paternalism""), published last year, was a national bestseller.

US President Donald Trump pushed for Canada to become an additional US state in a Tuesday Truth Social post announcing tariffs on the northern country.""The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear,"" he wrote. This comes after Trump announced that he instructed his commerce secretary to add an additional 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum coming into the United States from Canada, bringing the total tariff on those products to 50%.  In the post, Trump said that the tariffs were a response to a 25% surcharge on electricity to three US states bordering Canada that Ontario Premier Doug Ford placed. The surcharges to Michigan, New York, and Minnesota began on Monday. HERDS OF wild bison are seen in northern Canada.

""Canadians taxes will be very substantially reduced, they will be more secure, militarily and otherwise, than ever before, there would no longer be a Northern Border problem, and the greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever — And Canada will be a big part of that,"" he continued. ""The artificial line of separation drawn many years ago will finally disappear, and we will have the safest and most beautiful Nation anywhere in the World — And your brilliant anthem, 'O Canada,' will continue to play, but now representing a GREAT and POWERFUL STATE within the greatest Nation that the World has ever seen!""  Ford told CNN in a Tuesday interview that Canadians strongly rejected Trump's push. ""It's disappointing because Americans are going to pay more,"" the premier told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""There was an unprovoked attack on Canada; on families, on jobs, on businesses, for what reason?""This is absolute chaos created by one person, and that's Donald Trump. Not the American people.""

In honor of Purim, ALEH, Israel's leading network of care for people with severe disabilities, partnered with El Al to create an unforgettable experience for children in wheelchairs.The two teams transformed ALEH's campus in Bnei Brak into a lively airport terminal, complete with a duty-free booth, where children dressed as pilots and flight attendants for a day of imagination.  By collaborating with El Al, the children were able to immerse themselves in the world of aviation and the excitement of air travel, which often seems out of reach for people in wheelchairs. Most importantly, they were able to play and celebrate Purim in a way that was fully accessible to them.“This celebration embodies the essence of Purim – turning the impossible into possible,” said Yehuda Marmorstein, founder and president of ALEH. “At ALEH, we strive to create moments where our children can feel limitless, and this event was a perfect example of that.” AdvertisementThe event was carefully designed with the children's sensory and mobility in mind, ensuring that everyone could comfortably enjoy every aspect of the event.

When Yuval Raphael takes the Eurovision stage in Basel, Switzerland, the world will see a young Israeli woman standing tall, singing for her country.But as the music swells and her voice fills the arena, every listener should remember exactly where she was on October 7: trapped inside a tiny roadside bomb shelter, buried under the bodies of her murdered friends, pretending to be dead as Hamas terrorists stormed in, sprayed bullets, and threw grenades at the dozens of festivalgoers hiding inside.  For seven hours, she lay motionless, covered in blood—some of it hers, most of it not—waiting for an Israeli rescue that took too long to come.Now, almost a year and a half later, she will sing on one of the world's biggest stages, as a contestant and as a survivor. AdvertisementRaphael, 24, from Ra'anana, was one of thousands of Israelis who arrived at the Nova music festival near Re'im, close to the Gaza border, on the night of October 6. As reported by Mako, the festival was supposed to last until midday on October 7—a celebration of music and dance, surrounded by desert landscapes.

According to Israel Hayom, Raphael and her four friends rushed to their car, hoping to escape. But as traffic built up, gunfire erupted. Terrorists, armed with automatic weapons, were storming the festival. ""We saw people screaming, running toward us. Someone yelled, ‘They're shooting! They're killing everyone!'"" Raphael later told Channel 12 News.With nowhere to go, she and her friends spotted a roadside bomb shelter and ran inside.   Stay updated with the latest news!

But Hamas fighters found them within minutes. AdvertisementAccording to Mako, the terrorists fired blindly into the shelter, aiming at anything that moved. The walls were filled with gunshots. Bodies collapsed on top of one another. The wounded screamed.In the middle of the horror, Raphael's father, Zvika Raphael, called her phone. Their conversation, later reported by News 13, became one of the defining recordings of the massacre.""Dad, there are dead people on top of me,"" she whispered. ""Please, send the police.""  ""I'm sending them now, sweetheart,"" he answered. ""Stay quiet. Don't move.""As Hamas continued shooting, he gave her the only advice that could save her life. ""Yuval, stop breathing. Play dead. Do not move. If they think you're dead, they'll leave you alone.""Raphael obeyed. She lay still for hours, pinned under corpses, soaked in blood. As reported by Israel Hayom, the terrorists returned multiple times, shooting anyone who moved, throwing grenades inside.""I could feel the heat of the explosions, feel my body being crushed under the weight of the dead,"" she later told Channel 12. ""I kept repeating to myself, ‘Don't breathe. Don't move. Stay dead.'""The long wait for rescueFor seven hours, Raphael waited—silent, paralyzed, barely alive. At 2:00 p.m., Israeli security forces finally reached the shelter.But when the soldiers called out for survivors to come out, no one moved. As Channel 12 reported, Raphael and the others feared it was a Hamas trap. Only when one of the rescuers called a survivor's name—""Nitzan, your father is waiting for you""—did they finally dare to move.Raphael stepped out into the daylight, her clothes soaked in blood, her body stiff from lying in one position for so long. ""I just kept looking at the sky,"" she told Mako. ""I couldn't believe I was alive.""In the months after October 7, Raphael struggled with PTSD and survivor's guilt. According to Israel Hayom, she vowed not to let trauma define her. ""I decided I wasn't going to live my life with PTSD. I wanted to turn my pain into something meaningful,"" she said.She became an advocate for survivors of the Nova massacre, traveling to Europe and the US to share her story. ""People need to know what happened,"" she told Channel 12. ""They need to hear it from someone who was there.""At the same time, she continued pursuing her dream of music. In January 2025, she won ""The Next Star for Eurovision"", Israel's national selection contest, earning the right to represent Israel in Basel.A performance under political fireRaphael is not just walking into a music competition, but stepping onto one of the most politically charged stages in the world.According to Mako, Eurovision 2025 comes at a time of rising hostility toward Israel in Europe. Some worry that she will face boos, jeers, or even protests, similar to what Israeli contestants have experienced in past years.""I know some people won't want me there,"" she told Israel Hayom. ""But that's exactly why I have to go. I want to stand on that stage, wrapped in the Israeli flag, and make sure the world hears our story.""Yuval is a survivor who refused to stay silent, a voice that Hamas failed to silence.

Dozens of prominent rabbis with extensive diplomatic backgrounds sent letters to US President Donald Trump in recent days regarding the possible inclusion of the Muslim-majority country in the Abraham Accords framework. The group is led by Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and Rabbi Eli Abadi, a senior rabbi in the UAE and personal friend of Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and architect of the Abraham Accords.  Among the high-profile signatories is Rabbi Aryeh Ralbag, head of the rabbinical court of the Rabbinical Alliance of America and Canada, which includes approximately two hundred ultra-Orthodox rabbis and the organization of Zionist rabbis. In their letters, the rabbis emphasized a significant point: Countries that joined the Abraham Accords received extensive incentives and political backing from the United States.  AdvertisementAzerbaijan, on the other hand - described as the most reliable Muslim country as a strategic partner of Israel and a key US ally in the Middle East for three decades - has not received American support.

""Countries that joined the Abraham Accords received positive incentives and benefits in return for making peace with Israel. In contrast, Azerbaijan became a particularly reliable partner and true friend of Israel three decades ago, without any external influence,"" the rabbis write. ""Repealing Section 907 would be a very good gesture of recognition."" Rabbi Marvin Hier, who spoke at Trump's inauguration ceremony in 2017, was selected by Newsweek magazine as America's most influential rabbi. He served as a mediator in talks between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and King Hussein of Jordan, and notes that including Azerbaijan in the agreements ""will strengthen the importance of the Accords and demonstrate that alliances based on mutual respect and cooperation can flourish, regardless of religious or political differences.""

'A significant turning point'The Jewish community in the country ""lives and thrives because respect and brotherhood toward Jews are an integral part of the local tradition,"" as emphasized by Azerbaijan's President, Ilham Aliyev. In their letter, the rabbis note that ""Your policy and vision, Mr. President, are leading to revolutionary changes in the Middle East, while protecting the State of Israel, a key US ally, and promoting stability, peace and economic prosperity. During your first term, you made the Abraham Accords a reality, and now you intend to expand and strengthen them by adding more countries.

The Baloch Liberation Army, an insurgent group in Pakistan, said it captured a train full of people on Tuesday and was holding 214 hostages. The BLA said it considered the people it captured “prisoners of war.”The group accused many of those it holds of being Pakistani security personnel. It said the attack took place in Mashkaf and that they seized a train called the Jaffar Express. Initially, the BLA said it killed six members of the security forces and seized 100 hostages. By mid-day, the number of hostages grew.  BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch said that thirty members of the Pakistan security forces have been killed in clashes. The group says it gave a 48-hour “ultimatum” for a “prisoner exchange.”The BLA has been increasingly active in recent years, which is significant for Iran – Baloch folks live in both Pakistan and Iran, including opposition figures.

Damascus is on a roll. It has signed a deal with the Kurdish-led, US-backed group Syrian Democratic Forces in eastern Syria, and it may now have worked out an agreement with the Druze in Sweida in the country's south.Unlike the SDF, the Druze in Sweida do not have a strong military organization. During the Assad era and the Syrian civil war, they were able to run some of their own affairs locally and had their own armed militia, but they were always vulnerable. For instance, an ISIS attack on Sweida in 2018 killed approximately 200 people.  The Druze thus relied on Damascus for protection, and many served in the security forces. After the toppling of the Assad regime, the Druze were concerned the new leadership might persecute them since Syrian extremists had targeted them in the past. Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, the group that took control in December 2024, did not have a great track record regarding minorities in Syria.However, over the last four months, many things have changed. The Druze have tried to navigate the new situation, and their leaders have met with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa. Advertisement Druze from villages in northern Israel seen in Majdal Shams, Golan Heights, near the border with Syria, April 17, 2023 (credit: AYAL MARGOLIN/FLASH90)Israeli officials have also said they will protect the Druze. Several incidents in Sweida showed Israeli flags being raised in the city and quickly taken down. Meanwhile, Israel has carried out airstrikes and raids in southern Syria and demanded the area be demilitarized.Druze integrationAccording to Al Jazeera, on Tuesday, the Syrian government reached an agreement with the Druze leadership to integrate their area into the Syrian state institutions. Levant 24 reported, “The agreement stipulates that security agencies in Sweida will be incorporated into the Syrian Interior Ministry. “The agreement states that local police officers must be from the people of Sweida. The agreement allows the Syrian government to appoint a governor and a police chief without requiring them to be from Sweida.”According to a separate report, also in Qatari media, the agreement will include the deployment of 300 security forces in the area. These are apparently forces from Damascus, not the existing Druze forces. Hundreds of locals will also become part of a new police force, and a new police commander has already been chosen, with his deputy coming from the locals.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Syrian state media SANA said, “President of the Syrian Arab Republic, Mr. Ahmad al-Sharaa, has recently received [the] governor of Sweida, Mustafa Al-Bakour, and a number of activists of Sweida at the People's Palace in Damascus.” AdvertisementThe report noted that “the Sweida Governorate posted on its Telegram channel that talks during the meeting dealt with important national and local issues.”It continued, “The meeting also stressed the importance of this decisive stage in Syria's history, during which free Syrians aspire for a homeland where justice, law, and fair representation of all spectrum of the Syrian people prevail despite the difficult regional and international circumstances and the plots being hatched against the unity of Syria, its land, and people.”Israel has vowed over the past months to protect the Druze. It would appear that if this agreement moves forward, they may not need protection. That would mean that two groups that Israel sought to support in Syria, the Kurds and Druze, are now moving closer to integration with the new government in Damascus.

The agreement allows the Syrian government to appoint a governor and a police chief without requiring them to be from Sweida.”According to a separate report, also in Qatari media, the agreement will include the deployment of 300 security forces in the area. These are apparently forces from Damascus, not the existing Druze forces. Hundreds of locals will also become part of a new police force, and a new police commander has already been chosen, with his deputy coming from the locals.   Stay updated with the latest news!

However, over the last four months, many things have changed. The Druze have tried to navigate the new situation, and their leaders have met with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa.

The Rishon Lezion Magistrate's Court issued a gag order on Tuesday on all information regarding the ongoing investigation into ties between employees of the Prime Minister's Office and Qatar.The gag order came at the request of the Israel Police's Unit of International Crime Investigations – a branch of the Lahav 433 National Crime Unit – and will apply for 30 days, until April 10.  The police said in response to a query by Haaretz that “leaks from the investigation could lead to its obstruction.”The investigation, which was launched at the directive of Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara, began after a series of media reports alleged commercial ties between members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's media team and Qatari state actors.

(credit: IDF SPOKESPERSON'S UNIT, Via Maariv)According to the report, Feldstein was hired by an international company funded by Qatar to promote the country's image in Israel based on its role in hostage negotiations. Haaretz in late November reported that two other members of the media team, Yonatan Urich and Srulik Einhorn, had provided public relations services to Qatar ahead of the 2022 World Cup.Both Urich and Einhorn were also involved in the Bild case. Urich has been interrogated by the police for his role in the leak, and Einhorn, who currently lives in Europe, is wanted for interrogation.   Stay updated with the latest news!

Netanyahu announced that he sued former IDF chief of staff and defense minister Moshe Ya'alon for allegedly accusing the prime minister of receiving Qatari money himself.

Maybe it will be an opportunity to hear his response to three of his close advisers receiving payment from Qatar? Someone is under pressure from the Shin Bet investigation… and the attempt to fire the Shin Bet head and the attorney general stem from this pressure.”Yair Golan responds to gag orderDemocrats chairman Yair Golan wrote on X/Twitter, “The concern of the Shin Bet and the police that the Prime Minister's Office will disrupt the investigation of the Qatari connection with false and manipulative leaks is not only justified but essential and urgent.”Golan added, “We all remember the false leak to ‘Bild' and the calculated attempt to sabotage the hostage deal. Now, with the serious and worsening suspicion that foreign interests have infiltrated decision-making forums in the midst of a war, there is no room for naivety. It must be assumed that the Prime Minister's Office is dangerous to the investigation of the truth.”  Golan called for an investigation of Netanyahu himself, saying that if the prime minister himself received money from the Qataris, it was a “security offense that cannot be forgiven.”

In a video statement on Tuesday afternoon, Netanyahu called the accusations a “fake scandal campaign.” The accusations “fill a balloon with hot air, which empties out at the same speed,” he said. Netanyahu announced that he sued former IDF chief of staff and defense minister Moshe Ya'alon for allegedly accusing the prime minister of receiving Qatari money himself.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22world%20news%22%20site%3Ajpost.com","WATCH: IDF presence on Syrian Hermon protects from Syrian, Hamas, Iran threats, Katz tells 'Post'","https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-845646","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 17:59:53 GMT","

The presence of the IDF on the Syrian Mount Hermon – and in the general buffer zone – protects Israel from a range of Syrian, Hamas, and Iranian threats, Defense Minister Israel Katz told The Jerusalem Post on Tuesday, as he stood next to a Syrian outpost taken by the IDF in December, following the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime.“There are a series of threats. This regime is a jihadist regime. It put on a mask, but then it removed its mask. It tries to get a following” around the world to reduce economic sanctions and become re-accepted into the good graces of Western nations, Katz told the Post.  The defense minister said, “We knew about this in advance and we got ready,” justifying the IDF's presence in Syria, though Israel has emphasized it has no territorial claims to the country.On December 7-8, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, leading Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, toppled the Assad regime. Since then, it has actively promoted itself as a more tolerant, moderate, and Western-looking Syria, which respects Syrian minorities – and would never threaten Israel. AdvertisementHowever, Israel quickly seized a buffer zone in southern Syria as Sharaa was taking power, out of concern that he, as a former member of al-Qaeda, along with some of his jihadist allies, might talk sweetly to the West for the moment, but then attack Israel in the future once it would let its guard down.Katz stated, “There are also attempts by Iran and Hezbollah to smuggle weapons” through Syria to reconstruct the Lebanese terror group's arsenal to return its ability to attack and threaten Israel. These two threats are widely known, but Katz noted to the Post another much lesser talked-about threat – the Palestinian one. “They have lots of refugee camps [in the area],” which are being used to conceal attempts to formulate attacks on Israel, he said.Palestinians within SyriaIn fact, though rarely discussed in the media, there are approximately 450,000 Palestinians in Syria, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). While many of them have no particular interest in Israel, Hamas and other terrorist groups have tapped into the poverty and hopelessness that many Palestinians in Syria have suffered during their many decades there to draw new recruits to carry out terror attacks against the Jewish state.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  “We are here and the IDF is here” as long as needed to prevent any of these groups from threatening Israel from Syrian territory, Katz told the Post. AdvertisementThe defense minister and military officials have given indications that the IDF could remain in Syria for years, with a withdrawal date from the buffer zone depending on threat conditions on the ground.Katz said of Sharaa, “every morning he opens his eyes in the presidential palace in Damascus, he will see the IDF observing him from the heights of the [Syrian] Hermon and will remember that we are here and in the entire southern Syria area.”He added, “we will strengthen the connection between the local [Syrian] residents and soon, on the 16th of this month, we will start [the program] of [Syrian] Druze working in the Golan Heights” within Israel.  Defense sources estimate that there are around 500,000-600,000 Syrian Druze in the area of the Druze and Hermon mountains, around 37,000 of which are within the Israeli buffer zone.Katz added that overnight between Monday and Tuesday, the air force attacked more than 40 targets in southern Syria in order to follow through on Israel's statements that it will remove potential threats from southern Syria.According to Syrian reports, these were military targets of the previous Assad regime in the villages of Jabab and Izra, in the Daraa province of southern Syria. The reports said that these were targets that previously belonged to the 12th Brigade and the 89th Battalion of Assad's army.According to sources, the reason the Israel Air Force didn't attack these sites in December during a massive strike on Syrian military capabilities – but was rather attacking them now – has to do with threat prioritization.In other words, the IDF considered these radar systems a threat for some time, but those items that the air force struck in December were an even larger threat.There was also an implication – which top Israeli officials have made generally – that there can and will likely be more such attacks on Syrian military capabilities going forward, though Israel is trying hard not to have any friction with Sharaa's forces.Military sources have said that the Syrian Hermon and the nine positions the IDF established in the Syria buffer zone allow Israel to observe much more closely if Hezbollah is trying to smuggle weapons, including in one of its critical areas of Baalbek deeper into Lebanon.Regarding Iran, Katz said at a press conference that Israel would make sure that Tehran does not get a nuclear weapon, and that it was in tight coordination with US President Donald Trump regarding that threat.Regarding Gaza, Katz said there were three major levers of pressure that Israel could bring on Hamas to hopefully get it to release the 59 hostages it is still holding captive.One lever would be to slow and close off humanitarian aid and electricity, which Israel has done over the last week or so. A second lever would be the threat of a potentially imminent re-invasion of Gaza which could be more intense than before.Media commentators have discussed the possibility of a rapid invasion into all of Gaza – instead of the more gradual staged invasion that Israel did from late 2023 to mid-2024 – as well as heavier air power and artillery use against urban areas after civilians are told to evacuate to the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone.The third lever is the full backing of Trump for all the options – as opposed to the Biden administration, which was constantly pressing Israel to use less force and to increase humanitarian aid, said Katz.Regarding the firing of R.-Adm. (ret.) Daniel Hagari as IDF spokesman, the defense minister claimed he had no involvement and that this decision was made entirely by IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir.However, there is widespread reporting that Zamir let Hagari go under the influence of Katz, with the only debate being whether Katz explicitly told him not to keep or promote Hagari or whether Katz's preference was made clear to Zamir, but more passively.

Since then, it has actively promoted itself as a more tolerant, moderate, and Western-looking Syria, which respects Syrian minorities – and would never threaten Israel. AdvertisementHowever, Israel quickly seized a buffer zone in southern Syria as Sharaa was taking power, out of concern that he, as a former member of al-Qaeda, along with some of his jihadist allies, might talk sweetly to the West for the moment, but then attack Israel in the future once it would let its guard down.Katz stated, “There are also attempts by Iran and Hezbollah to smuggle weapons” through Syria to reconstruct the Lebanese terror group's arsenal to return its ability to attack and threaten Israel. These two threats are widely known, but Katz noted to the Post another much lesser talked-about threat – the Palestinian one. “They have lots of refugee camps [in the area],” which are being used to conceal attempts to formulate attacks on Israel, he said.Palestinians within SyriaIn fact, though rarely discussed in the media, there are approximately 450,000 Palestinians in Syria, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). While many of them have no particular interest in Israel, Hamas and other terrorist groups have tapped into the poverty and hopelessness that many Palestinians in Syria have suffered during their many decades there to draw new recruits to carry out terror attacks against the Jewish state.

AdvertisementThe defense minister and military officials have given indications that the IDF could remain in Syria for years, with a withdrawal date from the buffer zone depending on threat conditions on the ground.Katz said of Sharaa, “every morning he opens his eyes in the presidential palace in Damascus, he will see the IDF observing him from the heights of the [Syrian] Hermon and will remember that we are here and in the entire southern Syria area.”He added, “we will strengthen the connection between the local [Syrian] residents and soon, on the 16th of this month, we will start [the program] of [Syrian] Druze working in the Golan Heights” within Israel.  Defense sources estimate that there are around 500,000-600,000 Syrian Druze in the area of the Druze and Hermon mountains, around 37,000 of which are within the Israeli buffer zone.Katz added that overnight between Monday and Tuesday, the air force attacked more than 40 targets in southern Syria in order to follow through on Israel's statements that it will remove potential threats from southern Syria.According to Syrian reports, these were military targets of the previous Assad regime in the villages of Jabab and Izra, in the Daraa province of southern Syria. The reports said that these were targets that previously belonged to the 12th Brigade and the 89th Battalion of Assad's army.According to sources, the reason the Israel Air Force didn't attack these sites in December during a massive strike on Syrian military capabilities – but was rather attacking them now – has to do with threat prioritization.In other words, the IDF considered these radar systems a threat for some time, but those items that the air force struck in December were an even larger threat.There was also an implication – which top Israeli officials have made generally – that there can and will likely be more such attacks on Syrian military capabilities going forward, though Israel is trying hard not to have any friction with Sharaa's forces.Military sources have said that the Syrian Hermon and the nine positions the IDF established in the Syria buffer zone allow Israel to observe much more closely if Hezbollah is trying to smuggle weapons, including in one of its critical areas of Baalbek deeper into Lebanon.Regarding Iran, Katz said at a press conference that Israel would make sure that Tehran does not get a nuclear weapon, and that it was in tight coordination with US President Donald Trump regarding that threat.Regarding Gaza, Katz said there were three major levers of pressure that Israel could bring on Hamas to hopefully get it to release the 59 hostages it is still holding captive.One lever would be to slow and close off humanitarian aid and electricity, which Israel has done over the last week or so. A second lever would be the threat of a potentially imminent re-invasion of Gaza which could be more intense than before.Media commentators have discussed the possibility of a rapid invasion into all of Gaza – instead of the more gradual staged invasion that Israel did from late 2023 to mid-2024 – as well as heavier air power and artillery use against urban areas after civilians are told to evacuate to the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone.The third lever is the full backing of Trump for all the options – as opposed to the Biden administration, which was constantly pressing Israel to use less force and to increase humanitarian aid, said Katz.Regarding the firing of R.-Adm. (ret.) Daniel Hagari as IDF spokesman, the defense minister claimed he had no involvement and that this decision was made entirely by IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir.However, there is widespread reporting that Zamir let Hagari go under the influence of Katz, with the only debate being whether Katz explicitly told him not to keep or promote Hagari or whether Katz's preference was made clear to Zamir, but more passively.

Defense sources estimate that there are around 500,000-600,000 Syrian Druze in the area of the Druze and Hermon mountains, around 37,000 of which are within the Israeli buffer zone.Katz added that overnight between Monday and Tuesday, the air force attacked more than 40 targets in southern Syria in order to follow through on Israel's statements that it will remove potential threats from southern Syria.According to Syrian reports, these were military targets of the previous Assad regime in the villages of Jabab and Izra, in the Daraa province of southern Syria. The reports said that these were targets that previously belonged to the 12th Brigade and the 89th Battalion of Assad's army.According to sources, the reason the Israel Air Force didn't attack these sites in December during a massive strike on Syrian military capabilities – but was rather attacking them now – has to do with threat prioritization.In other words, the IDF considered these radar systems a threat for some time, but those items that the air force struck in December were an even larger threat.There was also an implication – which top Israeli officials have made generally – that there can and will likely be more such attacks on Syrian military capabilities going forward, though Israel is trying hard not to have any friction with Sharaa's forces.Military sources have said that the Syrian Hermon and the nine positions the IDF established in the Syria buffer zone allow Israel to observe much more closely if Hezbollah is trying to smuggle weapons, including in one of its critical areas of Baalbek deeper into Lebanon.Regarding Iran, Katz said at a press conference that Israel would make sure that Tehran does not get a nuclear weapon, and that it was in tight coordination with US President Donald Trump regarding that threat.Regarding Gaza, Katz said there were three major levers of pressure that Israel could bring on Hamas to hopefully get it to release the 59 hostages it is still holding captive.One lever would be to slow and close off humanitarian aid and electricity, which Israel has done over the last week or so. A second lever would be the threat of a potentially imminent re-invasion of Gaza which could be more intense than before.Media commentators have discussed the possibility of a rapid invasion into all of Gaza – instead of the more gradual staged invasion that Israel did from late 2023 to mid-2024 – as well as heavier air power and artillery use against urban areas after civilians are told to evacuate to the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone.The third lever is the full backing of Trump for all the options – as opposed to the Biden administration, which was constantly pressing Israel to use less force and to increase humanitarian aid, said Katz.Regarding the firing of R.-Adm. (ret.) Daniel Hagari as IDF spokesman, the defense minister claimed he had no involvement and that this decision was made entirely by IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir.However, there is widespread reporting that Zamir let Hagari go under the influence of Katz, with the only debate being whether Katz explicitly told him not to keep or promote Hagari or whether Katz's preference was made clear to Zamir, but more passively.

Iran's navy is taking part in a three-day drill with Russia and China. Iranian media said that the Iranian navy had successfully executed the second day of the joint drill. “The three-day naval drills, codenamed the 2025 Maritime Security Belt, kicked off Monday in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman,” the report said.“Rear Admiral Mostafa Tajeddini, deputy operations commander of the Iranian Navy, said on Tuesday that aerial photography exercises and tactical formations were successfully conducted during the joint maritime drill,” IRNA added.  Iran says that its navy is “committed to establishing security both regionally and globally, adding that the Navy will not allow any threats or incursions into the nation's maritime borders.” Iran doesn't have a very large navy. The importance is largely related to coordination with China and Russia.Meanwhile, Iranian Rear Admiral Shahram Irani slammed Trump in comments on March 11. He claimed that Trump had said that the US was not concerned about joint drills. “He said that the participation of three countries in the military exercise, titled Security Belt 2025, is focused on fostering security, contrasting it with the presence of countries like the United States, which consistently contributed to global instability,” IRNA noted. He also praised the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS, of which Iran is a member.

Iran and Russia have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to produce microelectronic components, Iran's state media said. “Russia's Ministry of Industry and Trade signed the agreement with the Nano and Micro Technology Development Headquarters, a division of the Iranian Vice Presidency for Science, Technology, and the Knowledge-Based Economy, on Tuesday, the Moscow-based Kommersant newspaper reported.” The report adds that the Zelenograd Nanotechnology Center (ZNTC), “one of Russia's leading firms in nanotechnology,” will to produce advanced nanolithography equipment, telecommunication multiplexers, and automotive sensors.The naval drills come as Iran seeks to project power in the region. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said, “Iran is determined to fulfill its obligation to the Iraqi administration in thwarting unlawful actions by the United States.” In addition, the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) said it has “dispatched 500 tons of humanitarian aid to Lebanon, according to Babak Mahmoud, the head of the IRCS Aid and Relief Organization.” This shows Iran shoring up support in Iraq and Lebanon. Iran also said on March 11 that it has not received a letter from US President Donald Trump, “days after he claimed to have sent such a letter to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei,” IRNA noted.

Attackers are using the popular dating app Grindr to target members of the queer community in the general Haifa area, an Israeli LGBT organization said. Israeli LGBT task force the Aguda reported that there was a significant uptick in attempted lynchings and stabbings that used the popular dating app Grindr to target LGBT people in the North.   According to reports, attackers are creating fake profiles to arrange meetings in remote locations, where victims are ambushed. Some have been assaulted with sharp weapons, with certain cases escalating to what has been described as attempted lynchings.The Aguda has documented at least ten such incidents in recent months, raising concerns that the attackers remain at large. Two recent cases, both reported in late February, involved stabbings and attempted murder. However, some victims have chosen not to report the attacks, making it harder for authorities to track down those responsible. The Aguda is calling on anyone affected to file complaints with the police, stressing that each report could help prevent further violence.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22world%20news%22%20site%3Ajpost.com","WATCH: Looking down on Syria, Lebanon, Israel: 'Post' makes first ever visit to Syrian Hermon","https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-845639","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 18:00:37 GMT","

At 9,232 feet above sea level, I looked down on Syria, Lebanon, and Israel all at the same time.But when I was looking down on Tuesday, I was looking down from the Syrian peak of Mount Hermon, which is far above the 6,690-foot peak of the Israeli Hermon that I have been on a few times.  Part of what was astounding about the experience was being in Syria at all and my first helicopter ride.I was in Syria once before at Tel Kudne in December, so this should not have been as shocking as that visit, which I had no idea was even theoretically possible until I was suddenly invited by the IDF less than half a day before the visit took place. AdvertisementThere were three other reasons that the visit blew me away. Alpine commandos and snow mobile truck driver, March 11, 2025. (credit: YONAH JEREMY BOB)First was the breathtaking view of the snowy Hermon range and the surrounding areas. Second was the strategic location.Tel Kudne was impressive because we were in Syria and at a Syrian military base with trenches, weaponry, and all kinds of items that you would expect an enemy base to have – but which you would never get to see up close. But the view was limited to 5-10 kilometers into Israel and Syria.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  From the Syrian Hermon, you can see dozens of kilometers in all directions – some days even to Damascus, around 35 kilometers away – and you can view critical junctures where Iran has been smuggling weapons to Hezbollah through Syria for years. AdvertisementTrue, Israeli aircraft have watched and attacked many of these areas in recent years.But now Israel has a whole new close and direct physical way to follow these developments without having to maneuver aircraft or drones, or to get lucky at catching smugglers at the right patrol time, and without having to make a decision about whether to expend airtime in Syria as opposed to one of Israel's many other fronts.IDF Division 210 is just there. It can watch out for smuggling attempts all of the time, without having to move or do anything dramatic.  Third was the fact that IDF Division 210 is not only there, but that they decided to bring myself and other journalists there.A geopolitical decisionThis decision was no simple move for a bit of media attention, but a full-on geopolitical decision.With this visit, the Israeli government is telling the world, even more clearly than its top officials have said in recent statements, that it is staying on the Syrian Hermon and in its Syria buffer zone for the foreseeable future – probably for years.However, every Israeli official makes it clear that the Jewish state has no territorial ambitions for Syria and Israeli forces are limited to nine strategic border positions, trying to disrupt the local Syrian population as little as possible.When I visited Tel Kudne in December, officials were talking about being in a Syria buffer zone for a period of months.Everything was new, no one knew what the new Syrian regime would do next or how the world would react, and an IDF military presence in Syria was not seen as merely temporary, but temporary with a real not too distant end date.The difference in how I arrived at Tel Kudne and the Syrian Hermon tells a lot of this story.For Tel Kudne, I drove myself to Alonei Habashan on the Israeli side of the border. From there, it took us around five minutes to cross into southern Syria. It would take us another 40 minutes or so to get to the top of Tel Kudne in relatively standard army transport vehicles, but that was just to make the approach easier and to be less disruptive to the local Syrians.When the IDF took over Tel Kudne, if the military needed to get more forces there speedily in the future, it could be done with essentially lightning speed.In contrast, to get to the Syrian Hermon, I drove to an Israeli air force base, where we boarded a large helicopter that flew us to a landing point within the Syrian Hermon range.From there, we traveled 14 kilometers for around an hour in large red snowmobiles, ascending around 600 additional meters through very bumpy and snowy twists and turns in order to arrive at the peak.One could get from Israel to Tel Kudne and back in about 30 minutes using fairly standard land vehicles. To get to the Syrian Hermon peak and back requires several hours and a mix of expensive and more risky air force travel combined with specially outfitted snowmobiles.To spend this amount of time and expend this level of resources with civilian-journalists in Syrian territory, the government had to be sure that it is staying for a while and feels secure there.However, even since December, the region and world has radically changed again.Israel's presence in SyriaWhether it is because the new Syrian regime is weaker and more distracted than originally expected or because it has less Western support than originally presumed, or whether it is because of the profound open-ended support that US President Donald Trump is giving to Israeli operations in Syria – Israel will be in Syria for years to come.The longer Israel stays there, the more some of the negative trade-offs of being there may grow. In the meantime, the Post was able to see up close how valuable the area could be strategically, up until the point that Israel and relevant world powers decide that the new Syrian regime will not threaten the Jewish state and will restrain its more violent jihadist elements from doing so.

To get to the Syrian Hermon peak and back requires several hours and a mix of expensive and more risky air force travel combined with specially outfitted snowmobiles.To spend this amount of time and expend this level of resources with civilian-journalists in Syrian territory, the government had to be sure that it is staying for a while and feels secure there.However, even since December, the region and world has radically changed again.Israel's presence in SyriaWhether it is because the new Syrian regime is weaker and more distracted than originally expected or because it has less Western support than originally presumed, or whether it is because of the profound open-ended support that US President Donald Trump is giving to Israeli operations in Syria – Israel will be in Syria for years to come.The longer Israel stays there, the more some of the negative trade-offs of being there may grow. In the meantime, the Post was able to see up close how valuable the area could be strategically, up until the point that Israel and relevant world powers decide that the new Syrian regime will not threaten the Jewish state and will restrain its more violent jihadist elements from doing so.
            



First was the breathtaking view of the snowy Hermon range and the surrounding areas. Second was the strategic location.Tel Kudne was impressive because we were in Syria and at a Syrian military base with trenches, weaponry, and all kinds of items that you would expect an enemy base to have – but which you would never get to see up close. But the view was limited to 5-10 kilometers into Israel and Syria.   Stay updated with the latest news!

AdvertisementTrue, Israeli aircraft have watched and attacked many of these areas in recent years.But now Israel has a whole new close and direct physical way to follow these developments without having to maneuver aircraft or drones, or to get lucky at catching smugglers at the right patrol time, and without having to make a decision about whether to expend airtime in Syria as opposed to one of Israel's many other fronts.IDF Division 210 is just there. It can watch out for smuggling attempts all of the time, without having to move or do anything dramatic.  Third was the fact that IDF Division 210 is not only there, but that they decided to bring myself and other journalists there.A geopolitical decisionThis decision was no simple move for a bit of media attention, but a full-on geopolitical decision.With this visit, the Israeli government is telling the world, even more clearly than its top officials have said in recent statements, that it is staying on the Syrian Hermon and in its Syria buffer zone for the foreseeable future – probably for years.However, every Israeli official makes it clear that the Jewish state has no territorial ambitions for Syria and Israeli forces are limited to nine strategic border positions, trying to disrupt the local Syrian population as little as possible.When I visited Tel Kudne in December, officials were talking about being in a Syria buffer zone for a period of months.Everything was new, no one knew what the new Syrian regime would do next or how the world would react, and an IDF military presence in Syria was not seen as merely temporary, but temporary with a real not too distant end date.The difference in how I arrived at Tel Kudne and the Syrian Hermon tells a lot of this story.For Tel Kudne, I drove myself to Alonei Habashan on the Israeli side of the border. From there, it took us around five minutes to cross into southern Syria. It would take us another 40 minutes or so to get to the top of Tel Kudne in relatively standard army transport vehicles, but that was just to make the approach easier and to be less disruptive to the local Syrians.When the IDF took over Tel Kudne, if the military needed to get more forces there speedily in the future, it could be done with essentially lightning speed.In contrast, to get to the Syrian Hermon, I drove to an Israeli air force base, where we boarded a large helicopter that flew us to a landing point within the Syrian Hermon range.From there, we traveled 14 kilometers for around an hour in large red snowmobiles, ascending around 600 additional meters through very bumpy and snowy twists and turns in order to arrive at the peak.One could get from Israel to Tel Kudne and back in about 30 minutes using fairly standard land vehicles.

Recently, an article published in The Jerusalem Post smeared China's Middle East policy and hyped up false narratives on Taiwan and Xinjiang-related issues, attempting to mislead the Israeli public's perception of China and undermine the friendly relations between our two countries. Such intentions are utterly egregious. I would like to take this opportunity to present the facts to our Israeli friends for a better understanding of China and China-Israel relations.Over the past 30-plus years since establishing diplomatic ties, China-Israel relations have maintained healthy and stable development, yielding fruitful outcomes across various fields. Facts demonstrate that our cooperation features complementary advantages and strong endogenous momentum, delivering mutual benefits to both nations and peoples.China has always been committed to advancing exchanges and cooperation in various fields. Amid conflicts, nearly 20,000 Chinese workers have stayed in their posts in Israel.  Hainan Airlines of China has kept direct flights operational and is going to resume the Beijing-Tel Aviv route on April 10. The new port of Haifa, operated by Chinese enterprises, functions efficiently. The Red Line of the Tel Aviv Light Rail has operated safely for over 500 days, and the Green Line project progresses steadily. Transportation Minister Miri Regev highly commended Chinese companies for overcoming challenges to deliver high-quality results.During the meeting on February 15 between the Chinese and Israeli foreign ministers, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar thanked the Chinese people for sheltering Jewish refugees during World War II and Chinese workers for contributing to Israel's development despite wartime difficulties. He reaffirmed Israel's commitment to the one-China policy and willingness to maintain dialogue and cooperation across fields. China and Israel - Friends or foes? (credit: REUTERS)China also stands ready to work with Israel to advance our comprehensive innovative partnership and promote regional peace, stability, and prosperity.While having different perspectives on Palestine-Israel issues, China always respects Israel's right to existence and development. Guided by the vision of building a global community of shared future and shared human values, we sincerely hope for peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. China has consistently opposed violence against civilians and violations of international humanitarian law, calling for the immediate release of all detained civilians and hostages.No manipulation or political gamesOn the Middle East issue, China never engages in political manipulation or geopolitical games. We maintain friendly cooperation with all countries and never “bolster one and bash the other.” We have always been making judgments based on the merits of each issue and will continue to play a constructive role in regional peace and stability.The mentioned article propagated a blatant lie that “President Isaac Herzog visited Taiwan,” while the truth is that the Israeli government has long adhered to the one-China policy, recognizing that the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China.

They unanimously stated that their observations and experiences in Xinjiang were entirely different from the reports disseminated by Western media.For some time, certain international anti-China forces have persistently spread lies to sabotage China's relations with other countries. We hope all friends in Israel can gain a deeper understanding of China and China-Israel relations through my elaboration, so as to avoid being misled by people with ulterior motives.

In 2024, over 500 delegations totaling tens of thousands of visitors have visited Xinjiang, including foreign dignitaries, diplomatic envoys in China, representatives from international organizations, entrepreneurs, religious figures, experts and scholars, and media journalists. They unanimously stated that their observations and experiences in Xinjiang were entirely different from the reports disseminated by Western media.For some time, certain international anti-China forces have persistently spread lies to sabotage China's relations with other countries. We hope all friends in Israel can gain a deeper understanding of China and China-Israel relations through my elaboration, so as to avoid being misled by people with ulterior motives.

Since the infamous October 7 attacks, antisemitism has exploded and adapted in its virus-like tendencies, finding new ways to achieve popularity by infecting and leeching onto other elements of emerging pop culture. Cryptocurrency, as explained below, is just the latest example. As cryptocurrency platforms ascend in popularity, they must exercise better moral clarity to avoid becoming a petri dish for bigotry and violence, particularly against Jews.Cryptocurrency remains a relatively new phenomenon, yet one that is becoming increasingly integrated into monetary markets around the world.   In 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt a cryptocurrency as legal tender when it embraced Bitcoin as a source of official currency. As Bitcoin has risen to prominence, other cryptocurrencies have emerged into the mainstream conscience, including meme coins.While some meme coins are relatively harmless (such as the world-famous Dogecoin), others have sought to capitalize on blatant antisemitism, racism, and violence in their titles and accompanying thumbnails. Also concerning is that some of these coins are even receiving heightened exposure from large platforms such as pump.fun, which reportedly commands a net valuation estimated at over a billion dollars. Representation of cryptocurrency bitcoin is seen in this illustration taken November 29, 2021 (credit: DADO RUVIC/REUTERS)Pump has clear terms and conditions that prohibit abusive and obscene messages and reserve the company the right to remove such content. Nevertheless, it continues to platform it. Normalizing malign antisemitism, racism, and violence has severe and deadly consequences. As one of cryptocurrency's largest trading platforms, Pump has a moral duty. It must discontinue its practice of capitalizing off tokens that normalize bigotry and violence. According to Article 3.2 of Pump's Terms and Conditions, users “must not post, upload or publish to the Pump Platform any abusive, defamatory, dishonest, or obscene message” and may face “termination of or restrictions on the availability of the Pump Platform” for any violations. Article 20.2 also affords Pump the “sole and absolute discretion to remove, modify, or reject any content.” Despite having the mandate and authority to combat bigotry and promotions of violence on its platform, Pump is arguably helping monetize them. Many of its controversial tokens have achieved King of the Hill (KH) status. Tokens with KH status are tokens with the highest market cap. As a result, Pump rewards KH tokens with heightened visibility, featuring them on its homepage.Tokens with antisemitic conspiraciesMany tokens that have appeared on Pump's homepage with KH status include antisemitic themes and conspiracies. These include the following: “JewNazi” (accompanied by a thumbnail of a Star of David and a swastika inside), “Dirty F***ing Jew” (accompanied by a thumbnail of the Happy Merchant on a coin); “Jews did 911;” and “Jew” (captioned with Jews in Control). Other tokens deploy Hinduphobic themes. One token, for example, titled “Jews vs. Hindus,” appears alongside a thumbnail of two Happy Merchants – one dressed in Jewish attire and the other in purported Hindu garb with a Nazi armband – chained to one another. The token is captioned with the following description: “They're both literally the same, they s*** on everything, invade everything, destroy the economy and housing.”    Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Racism expressed against Black people is also prevalent throughout the platform. Multiple tokens explicitly invoke the “N-word,” and some call for the death of Black people or call upon users to “pump” tokens to kill them. Other coins, such as “Monkey Wars,” employ other derogatory, anti-Black themes. Some coins even glorify the Ku Klux Klan, bearing thumbnails depicting a clansman alongside a description, “We are still here to protect you. Protect yourself and support us today.” The effect of these coins is clearly to gamify, glorify, and even normalize expressions of violence against black people.Pump has also platformed tokens that appear to promote extortion and torture. One token, for example, reads, “LIVE REAL TORTURE UNTIL 100M MC (TORTURE).” By allowing such tokens to feature on its platform, and occasionally on its very homepage, Pump has become tacitly complicit in promoting their obscene messaging. As one of the biggest cryptocurrency trading platforms, Pump must clear its portfolio once and for all of the bigoted and violent content, especially antisemitic vitriol, within its ranks.The writer is an attorney and the director of policy education at StandWithUs, an international nonpartisan education organization that combats antisemitism and misinformation about Israel.

Protect yourself and support us today.” The effect of these coins is clearly to gamify, glorify, and even normalize expressions of violence against black people.Pump has also platformed tokens that appear to promote extortion and torture.

Iran has launched a large-scale joint naval exercise with Russia and China in the northern Indian Ocean, days after its supreme leader dismissed an offer from the US president for nuclear negotiations. The Combined Maritime Security Belt drill aims to improve maritime security and enhance coordination between the three nations while also involving observers from several other countries.For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org Iranian Navy Deputy Operations Commander Admiral Mustafa Tajaldini described the primary goal of the exercise as strengthening naval cooperation and securing major maritime routes. “The primary goal of this exercise is to enhance maritime security in the northern Indian Ocean and strengthen naval cooperation between the Iranian, Chinese, and Russian navies,” Tajaldini said, as quoted by the Tehran Times.  He further noted the broader regional significance, pointing to critical trade routes such as the Straits of Malacca, Hormuz, and Bab el Mandeb. “Our goal is to strengthen collective security, and we've invited Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) nations and regional countries to contribute to this effort,” he added.China's Defense Ministry stated that the exercise includes drills on striking maritime targets, damage control, and joint search-and-rescue operations. Russia's TASS news agency reported that the exercise features 15 combat ships, support vessels, and helicopters.

A Russian ship is seen during the joint Navy exercise of Iran, China and Russia in the Gulf of Oman, Iran, March 10, 2025 (credit: WEST ASIA NEWS AGENCY/REUTERS)Security analysts see the exercise as a clear signal of growing military ties between Iran, Russia, and China as they seek to counterbalance US influence in the region. The Gulf of Oman, where the drills are taking place, serves as a crucial maritime passage linking the Indian Ocean to the Strait of Hormuz, through which over a quarter of the world's seaborne oil trade passes. Trump's thoughts on the joint exerciseWhen asked about the naval exercises, US president Donald Trump dismissed concerns, telling Fox News aboard Air Force One: “We're stronger than all of them. We have more power than all of them.”The exercise comes at a time of heightened tensions following Iran's rejection of nuclear talks with Washington, signaling a continued standoff in diplomatic efforts. Meanwhile, the US 5th Fleet, based in Bahrain, maintains a strong presence in the region, keeping a close watch on maritime security developments.

Since US President Donald Trump announced his plan to transform the Gaza Strip into the “Riviera of the Middle East,” this idea has captured widespread attention. Some view it as an opportunity to rebuild the devastated territory, while others consider it unrealistic and potentially destabilizing for the region.After Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians to Egypt or Jordan failed, a new concept emerged on a limited scale: temporarily relocating Palestinians to the Negev Desert within Israel. This alternative emerged not from the president himself but after Arab countries refused to accept Palestinian refugees. The critical question remains: does this solution offer a practical option, or will it further complicate the situation?Trump stressed Gaza's prime spot on the Mediterranean Sea. During a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president stated: “We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal: [to make Gaza] the Riviera of the Middle East.”  Gaza's coastal position offers not only aesthetic value but substantial economic potential. With proper reconstruction, it could transform into an international tourism hub attracting global investors and visitors. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, previously described Gaza's waterfront as “very valuable,” noting its real estate significance if development focused on creating sustainable livelihoods.How might this theoretical value transform into concrete reality? Trump's proposal primarily focuses on developing Gaza's coastal strip into a vibrant commercial and tourism center, particularly through constructing an international seaport. Such a port would connect Gaza with Mediterranean countries and revitalize trade and investment, creating thousands of jobs for Palestinian youth and reducing the currently excessive unemployment rate of 50%. U.S. President Donald Trump signs the Laken Riley Act at the White House in Washington, U.S., January 29, 2025.  (credit:  REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz)With comprehensive infrastructure support, this initiative could fundamentally transform Gaza's economy by stimulating logistics, tourism, and manufacturing sectors, especially with Arab and Gulf companies willing to finance reconstruction efforts.The coastal development could complement interior reconstruction through Arab and Gulf funding, establishing world-class hospitals, schools, and universities, and restoring Gaza to its former prosperity. This vision offers Palestinians hope for a thriving future, potentially surpassing the conditions in various Arab countries facing chronic economic crises without comparable support opportunities, such as Yemen, Lebanon, or Sudan. Current statistics indicate 90% of Gaza's population depends on humanitarian aid.Economic prosperity could restore social stability and reduce tensions, though this requires international guarantees against terrorist activities, politicization of development projects, and misappropriation of aid – problems that have consistently plagued previous efforts. Success demands a Palestinian-Arab-international partnership focused on sustainable development beyond temporary solutions.The challenge extends beyond potential to current reality. A September 2024 UN report indicates that approximately 70% of Gaza's buildings suffered damage or destruction during the 15-month conflict. Reconstruction costs are estimated to reach $53 billion, including $20 billion during the initial three years. This figure reflects Gaza's profound humanitarian and economic crisis.

They believe this approach would complicate Palestinian issue resolution and create an unwelcome new regional reality.

Belgian author Herman Brusselmans was acquitted Tuesday by the Ghent Criminal Court of charges of Holocaust denial, racism, and incitement to hatred, despite outcry from Jewish organizations over his violent antisemitic remarks. The court ruled that his column in Humo magazine last August did not constitute a criminal offense, citing freedom of expression, as reported by VRT NWS.Brusselmans sparked widespread condemnation after writing in his column about the war in Gaza, “I get so furious that I want to ram a sharp knife through the throat of every Jew I meet.” He also described Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a “small, fat, bald Jew” who wanted to “wipe out the entire Arab world.”  Antisemitism is at a record high. We're keeping our eyes on it >>The column was condemned by Jewish organizations and Belgian officials, including Israel's ambassador to Belgium, Idit Rosenzweig-Abu, who wrote on X, formerly Twitter, “What if someone said in the Belgian press, ‘I'm so angry I want to stick a knife in the neck of every Muslim I meet'?”Brusselmans later defended himself by claiming he was using exaggeration, irony, and sarcasm to express frustration over the war. Jewish groups, however, dismissed his remarks as dangerous incitement. AdvertisementCourt ruling and free speech defenseDespite the language used, the Ghent Criminal Court ruled that Brusselmans' statements were protected under freedom of expression and “did not exceed the limits of the punishable.” The judge acknowledged that Jewish readers may have been offended, but stated that his remarks were legally protected as artistic and political commentary, according to VRT NWS.A Belgian national flag flies over the Royal Palace (credit: FRANCOIS LENOIR / REUTERS)The court further described freedom of speech as “one of the essential pillars in our democratic society,” even when it is controversial or provocative. Jewish groups condemn rulingJewish organizations reacted with outrage, warning that the ruling sets a dangerous precedent and undermines efforts to combat antisemitism.Rabbi Menachem Margolin, president of the European Jewish Association (EJA), strongly condemned the verdict, calling it “a deeply alarming message about the state of the fight against antisemitism in Belgium and Europe.”   Stay updated with the latest news!

It deems it permissible to publish in a national media outlet the desire to ‘stab a knife into the throat of every Jew encountered,' all under the pretext of anger over the situation in Gaza,” he added.Margolin warned that the decision could embolden further antisemitic rhetoric. “By issuing such a verdict, the Belgian judiciary sends a dangerous message: incitement to murder and hatred can be reinterpreted, excused, and ultimately legitimized – at least when the targets are Jews,” he said.The EJA called on the Belgian government to take action, demanding “urgent legislative reforms to close any legal loopholes that enable such morally and legally indefensible rulings.”  “Freedom of speech is a cornerstone of any democracy, but even freedom of speech has limits. That limit is crossed the moment it is used to harm, incite, and endanger another group in society – regardless of their background,” Margolin said.“Freedom of speech is not the freedom to spread hate and antisemitism. When the justice system legitimizes incitement, it erodes the very foundations of democracy itself,” he added.Michel Kotek, chairman of the Jewish Information and Documentation Center, which brought the complaint against Brusselmans, also condemned the ruling, calling it “a disgrace to Belgian jurisprudence.”“Someone who has been making such statements since 1993 – we are no longer talking about an incident. This is a constant repetition of moves in which antisemitic statements predominate,” he said, according to VRT NWS.“We too are for freedom of speech. But where it spills over into hatred and the deprivation of safety, that's where a government must intervene. And that's where it fails,” he added.Ongoing legal challengesDespite his acquittal, Brusselmans still faces multiple legal challenges. On April 4, a Belgian court will decide whether he must stand trial for additional complaints related to his column. Additionally, on May 6, a separate case filed by three Holocaust survivors will be heard, alleging that Brusselmans violated Belgium's anti-racism and negationism laws.Jewish organizations, including the Coordination Committee of Jewish Organizations in Belgium and the Forum of Jewish Organizations, have also filed civil actions against Brusselmans, arguing that his remarks fuel antisemitism and create a hostile environment for Jews in Belgium.The Hate Monitor is here to track antisemitism worldwide.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that he will double the planned tariffs on Canadian aluminium and steel in response to Ontario's decision to impose an electricity surcharge on three US states.

In a social media post on Truth Social, Trump said that the tariff increase would take effect on March 12.

“I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,” Trump posted.

The US president also asked Canada to “immediately drop” their “anti-american farmer tariff” of “250% to 390%” on various US dairy products, adding that they have been for long considered outrageous.



“I will shortly be declaring a National Emergency on Electricity within the threatened area. This will allow the US to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada,” Trump wrote.

The US president further warned: “If other egregious, long time Tariffs are not likewise dropped by Canada, I will substantially increase, on April 2nd, the Tariffs on Cars coming into the U.S. which will, essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada.”

Earlier today, Trump had called Canada a ""tariff abuser"" after the province of Ontario imposed an electricity surcharge on three US states. He had also claimed that his country did not need Canadian energy.

 

Donald Trump's announcement comes after Ontario, which is Canada's most populous province, announced a 25% hike in electricity export tariffs for nearly 1.5 million American consumers living in Minnesota, New York, and Michigan. The revised prices will be effective on Monday.

“I will not hesitate to increase this charge. If the United States escalates, I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford had said.

“Believe me when I say I do not want to do this. I feel terrible for the American people who didn't start this trade war. It's one person who is responsible, it's President Trump,” he added.

Trump has repeatedly spoken about annexing Canada and thrown bilateral trade, the lifeblood of the Canadian economy, into chaos with tariff actions that have veered in various directions since he took office, according to AFP.

President Donald Trump on Monday called Canada a ""tariff abuser"" after the province of Ontario imposed an electricity surcharge on three US states.

The US president also claimed that his country did not need Canadian energy.

""Ontario just announced a 25% surcharge on 'electricity,' of all things,"" Trump said, claiming the province was ""not even allowed to do that.""

""Canada is a Tariff abuser and always has been, but the United States is not going to be subsidising Canada any longer,"" he added on his Truth Social platform.

The Republican president also said that the United States does not need Canada's cars, lumber or energy anymore.

""We don't need your Cars, we don't need your Lumber, we don't need your Energy, and very soon, you will find that out,"" Trump said.

Trump's remarks come after Ontario, which is Canada's most populous province, announced a 25% hike in electricity export tariffs for nearly 1.5 million American consumers living in Minnesota, New York, and Michigan. The revised prices will be effective on Monday.

“I will not hesitate to increase this charge. If the United States escalates, I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford had said.

“Believe me when I say I do not want to do this. I feel terrible for the American people who didn't start this trade war. It's one person who is responsible, it's President Trump,” he added.

Trump has repeatedly spoken about annexing Canada and thrown bilateral trade, the lifeblood of the Canadian economy, into chaos with tariff actions that have veered in various directions since he took office, according to AFP.

Authorities in the Dominican Republic, along with US federal law enforcement agencies, are intensifying their search for 20-year-old Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student who went missing while on vacation in Punta Cana. The young woman, a permanent US resident and Indian citizen, was last seen in the early hours of March 6 on a beach near her resort.

Sudiksha Konanki had been vacationing at the Riu Republica resort with five female college friends when she disappeared.

According to reports, she and her group had been out at a nightclub on the night of March 5 before heading to the beach around 4 am. Surveillance footage confirmed that most of her friends returned to the hotel at 5.55 am, but Konanki remained on the beach with a man whose identity has not been released.

He later told investigators that they went for a swim and were caught by a strong wave. When he returned to the shore, he vomited and fell asleep on a lounge chair, only to wake up and find Konanki missing. He was seen returning to his hotel room around 9.55 am.

Authorities have found no evidence of foul play, but a sarong-style cover-up belonging to Konanki was discovered on a beach chair near the site of her disappearance. Her phone and wallet remained with her friends, raising concerns for her safety. The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office (LCSO) has requested Interpol issue a Yellow Notice, a global alert for missing persons.

Search operations, including K-9 teams, drones, and specialized rescue personnel, are underway across Punta Cana's beaches and waters. The Dominican Civil Defense, National Police, Navy, and firefighters are all involved in the efforts. US agencies, including the FBI, DEA, and Homeland Security Investigations, are supporting the investigation.

Despite speculation that Konanki may have drowned, her family has urged authorities to explore other possibilities, including abduction. Her father, Subbarayudu Konanki, has questioned why her body has not washed ashore if she had drowned. He and other family members have traveled to Punta Cana to push for a broader investigation, citing her missing personal items as unusual behavior for her.

The report in ABC News quoted two police sources with knowledge of the investigation as saying that Konanki's clothes were discovered on a “portable beach bed close to the beach where she went missing”.

The University of Pittsburgh community has expressed deep concern over Konanki's disappearance. “No one expects their loved one to go on vacation and not return,” said Halley Katz, a fellow student. The university has assured full cooperation with authorities and support for the Konanki family.

Meanwhile, the US State Department has issued safety reminders for travelers, advising caution when visiting foreign countries. The Dominican Republic remains a popular tourist destination, though concerns about crime and safety persist.

This month, health officials have raised alarms at three major US airports after travellers infected with measles potentially exposed others to the contagious disease. Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia, along with Los Angeles International and New York's JFK Airport, are all on high alert as authorities work to contain the spread.

On March 3, health officials issued a warning regarding a potential measles outbreak at New York's JFK International Airport after a child, who had arrived on a China Airlines flight, tested positive for the highly contagious disease. This followed an earlier incident on February 19, when a passenger arriving at Los Angeles International Airport on a Korean Air flight from Seoul also tested positive for measles. These cases have raised concerns about the possible spread of the virus at major international airports, as reported by Daily Mail.

A passenger arriving on an international flight at Washington Dulles International Airport has tested positive for measles, a highly contagious respiratory illness that is currently making its way through the United States. Health officials have issued warnings for travellers who were in the airport's Terminal A on 5th March between 4 pm and 9 pm, as they may have been exposed to the virus.

In addition to the airport warning, individuals who visited the Johns Hopkins Howard County Medical Center Pediatric Emergency Department in Maryland on 7th March between 3:30 pm and 7:30 pm are also advised to monitor themselves for any symptoms of measles.

Experts have advised to confirm if they were vaccinated against measles if any of the passengers feel they might have come in contact with the identified cases in the US airports. Moreover, it is advised to monitor the initial symptoms of measles which include Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose before the infected person develops a rash. Health experts have revealed that the symptoms can develop within 7 to 21 days of being exposed to the disease.

Militants opened fire on a passenger train in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, injuring the train driver and causing panic among passengers, reports news agency Reuters.

The Jaffar Express, with around 400 passengers on board in nine bogies, was on its way from Quetta in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province to Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when it was fired on, railway officials said. Authorities have yet to provide details on the extent of the damage or whether additional injuries were reported among passengers.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant separatist group, has claimed responsibility for the assault. In a statement, the BLA also claimed to have taken hostages from the train, including security personnel.

According to reports on local media, the militant group claimed that six military personnel were killed in the attack. The group also stated that hundreds of passengers were being held captive. In a ominous warning, the BLA threatened to execute all hostages if Pakistan attempted to launch a military rescue operation.

HT.com could not independently verify this information.

Security forces have been dispatched to the area, and an investigation into the attack is underway.

The Balochistan government has imposed emergency measures and all institutions have been mobilised to deal with the situation, government spokesperson Shahid Rind said.

“There are reports of intense firing at a Jaffar Express [train] going from Quetta to Peshawar,"" Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind told local media outlet Dawn. The spokesperson said the incident could be a possible terrorist incident.

Balochistan, a resource-rich but conflict-ridden province, has witnessed a longstanding insurgency by separatist groups demanding independence or greater autonomy. The region has seen repeated attacks on security forces, infrastructure, and civilians in recent years.

The BLA seeks independence for Balochistan. It is the biggest of several ethnic insurgent groups that have battled the South Asian nation's government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistan's rich gas and mineral resources.

Tesla experienced its worst trading day in over four years as its stock plummeted 15% on Monday, extending its steep decline in 2025. The sharp drop comes amid rising concerns on Wall Street about waning demand for the company's electric vehicles. However, CEO Elon Musk remains unfazed, assuring investors that the company's long-term prospects remain strong.

""It will be fine long-term,"" Musk stated in a post on X (formerly Twitter). Despite his optimism, the decline in Tesla's market value has rattled investors, especially after recent pessimistic analyst projections.

UBS Group AG's Joseph Spak significantly slashed his delivery estimates for Tesla, predicting only 367,000 vehicles sold in the first quarter - a 16% reduction from his prior forecast. Furthermore, Spak no longer expects Tesla's annual sales to grow in 2025, instead forecasting a 5% decline. This contradicts the company's own projections, which anticipate a return to growth.

Ben Kallo, an analyst from Robert W. Baird & Co., also cut his delivery estimates for Tesla on March 6, citing demand concerns and production disruptions linked to the upcoming Model Y refresh. Spak echoed these concerns, noting that Tesla's website in China suggests relatively short delivery wait times of just two to four weeks - an indication of muted demand.

Tesla is also facing political and reputational headwinds. In Germany, Tesla's registrations plummeted by 70% in the first two months of 2025, partly attributed to backlash against Musk's involvement in the country's hotly contested federal election. Meanwhile, in China, Tesla has struggled to compete with domestic EV leader BYD Co. The company's Shanghai factory saw vehicle shipments nosedive by 49% in February to just 30,688 units, marking its weakest monthly performance since July 2022.

Tesla shares have now plunged 45% since the beginning of 2025, erasing all gains made since Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election in November. Monday's 15% drop marked the largest single-day decline for Tesla stock since September 2020, raising concerns about the company's near-term outlook.

InfoWars reporter Jamie White was killed near his Austin, Texas home on Sunday night, March 9, the outlet announced. InfoWars founder Alex Jones shared the news in a statement shared by the outlet.

“We are deeply saddened to inform you that InfoWars Reporter Jamie White was brutally murdered around midnight Sunday night due, in part, to the policies of the Soros Austin, TX D.A. Jose Garza,” the statement reads. “We pledge that Jamie's tragic death will not be in vain, and those responsible for this senseless violence will be brought to justice.”

It adds, “Jamie's important work will be carried on through InfoWars, our readers, and our cherished listeners.”

Meanwhile, in a broadcast posted to X, Jones described White as a “good friend” who had been working at InfoWars for several years, and praised him as the outlet's best writer. Jones said in the video that White was murdered while heading back home Sunday night.

The Austin Police Department told Fox 7 that cops found an adult male with “obvious signs of trauma” in South Austin on Sunday at around midnight. The man was rushed to the hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.

On social media, Jones blasted the district attorney for White's murder. ""I lay all of this squarely at the feet of Soros and of the sort of crime syndicate of the Democratic Party. They are the ones that administratively cut the police, prosecuted the police, and even cases that are hundred percent clear to be lawful, legal activities,"" he said.

He added, ""You murdered Jamie White, you opened the door, you created the climate, you created conditions on purpose. George Soros. Alexander Soros, you murdered Jamie White. These are sick, degenerate, evil people that know what they're doing and they aided and abetted. They are accomplices to the murder of a great American and Infowars long time veteran reporter Jamie White.""

White wrote on various issues on InfoWars, including politics, entertainment and current affairs. He covered international affairs and high-profile controversies.

One of White's notable stories was on Romania's ban on presidential candidate Călin Georgescu, which prompted protests. He also wrote on Glenn Beck's claim that the Epstein client list would be released if Kash Patel became FBI Director, among other articles. White's works were also featured on platforms like Scribd and TRANSCEND.

White's last post on X was a post by Elon Musk that he reshared. In the post, Musk wrote, “Yeah, why are liberals so violent?” The SpaceX CEO accused “legacy media propaganda” of being “a major part of the problem”.

White's friend and author Chase Geiser said in an X post that the reporter was “truly devoted to the truth.” “At InfoWars, we often cite the ancient Spartan saying, “with your shield or on it,” which is meant to convey that we are never to give up & drop our shields to run away. We are either to come home victorious or having died in the fight,” Geiser wrote.

He added, “Jamie honored that saying every day and, though I'm saddened to see he's come home on his shield, it's because of men like him we are able to carry on the fight in the InfoWar.”

The United States denied entry to Pakistan's ambassador to Turkmenistan and deported him from Los Angeles, according to a report in the Pak media outlet The News. Ambassador KK Wagan was reportedly heading to Los Angeles on a vacation when he was stopped by the US immigration officials.

""Ambassador K K Wagan was deported from the US. He had an immigration objection which led to his deportation,"" a senior official from Pakistan's Foreign Ministry confirmed to The News on Monday.

The report claimed that Wagan was flagged by US immigration due to ""controversial visa references."" However, the exact nature of these concerns and the specific references triggering the action remain unclear. After being stopped, the US authorities reportedly forced him to return to his previous departure point, sparking diplomatic concerns about the handling of the situation.

Ambassador Wagan is a veteran diplomat with extensive experience in Pakistan's foreign service. His career includes key assignments such as serving as second secretary at the Embassy of Pakistan in Kathmandu, deputy consul general in Los Angeles, and ambassador in Muscat, Oman.

Wagan has also held various senior roles, including director general for Overseas Pakistanis, Consular Affairs, and Crisis Management at Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

It is expected that Wagan will be called back to Islamabad for clarification. The report suggests that he may be summoned to explain his position regarding the unusual deportation.

The incident has already been brought to the attention of Pakistan's highest diplomatic authorities. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Foreign Secretary Aamna Baloch have been briefed on the matter, while the Foreign Ministry has instructed its Consulate in Los Angeles to look into the case.

Earlier this month, Reuters reported that people from Afghanistan and Pakistan might not be able to enter the US soon as the Donald Trump administration was working on a new travel ban.

The ban is based on a review of the security and vetting risks of certain countries, the sources, who requested anonymity, said. Other countries may also be included, though the specifics remain unclear, according to three sources, who requested anonymity, cited in a Reuters report.

China's foreign ministry has criticised the Dalai Lama after he claimed in his new book 'Voice for the Voiceless' that the next spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism would be born outside China, reported news agency Reuters.

Addressing the leader's claims, it said, “He has no right to represent the people of Tibet. Reincarnations of the living Buddha, including the Dalai Lama, should abide by the regulations of the country.”

They added, “Reincarnation is a special tradition of Tibetan Buddhism and the name of the living Buddha of Dalai Lama was identified by the central government.”

When asked about the book at a press conference on Monday, the spokesperson for China's foreign ministry had called the Dalai Lama “a political exile who is engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion.”

They had also clarified that his opinions did not change China's stance or the development of Tibet. While Chinese authorities have insisted that the government will choose the next spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama has stated that any successor chosen by China would not be respected.

The 14th Dalai Lama, whose name is Tenzin Gyatso, fled to India with thousands of Tibetans in 1959 after a failed uprising against the communist regime of China led by Mao Zedong.

In his book, he claims that his successor would be born in “a free world” which was outside China. He had previously also stated that the next Tibetan Buddhist leader, could emerge outside Tibet, such as in India, where he resides.

""The right of the Tibetan people to be the custodians of their own homeland cannot be indefinitely denied, nor can their aspiration for freedom be crushed forever through oppression,"" he wrote in an excerpt of his book, as quoted by Reuters.

“One clear lesson we know from history is this: if you keep people permanently unhappy, you cannot have a stable society,” he said.

Due to an expired security certificate, devices are unable to cast on Google's second-generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio, causing a significant and ongoing outage. The tech giant has acknowledged the issue and claims that a solution is in development.

Many users of these devices were unable to cast video to TVs and other screens on Sunday due to an ""untrusted device"" message. Tech-savvy internet users quickly identified the cause of the problem as an expired intermediate certificate authority, which Google had established to manage authentication for the affected devices, as reported by The Register. 

Also read: Google Chromecast outage: Users report issues with Gen 2 device. Could it be the 10-year cycle curse?

This authority had been in effect for ten years before it expired on March 9, 2025. As a result, models relying on this authority can no longer safely connect to Google's backend services or authenticate themselves.

In an update posted on the Google Nest community site—where Chromecast support now appears to be located—the company stated: ""Do not factory reset your device—we will keep you updated when the fix rolls out. If you have already factory reset your device, we will provide instructions on how to set your device up again as soon as possible.""

This update came over a day into the outage, and no new information has emerged since. We have contacted Google for further details and will continue to keep you informed. Since the problem is rooted in the certificate issue built into the devices, a factory reset will not resolve it.

There is still hope for getting your equipment working again, whether or not you have already performed a factory reset. Maciej Mensfeld, a Polish security researcher, provided a user guide on how to fix this. His solution is to try reauthorizing the Chromecast after changing the date on your phone to a time before March 9, 2025. However, not everyone responds well to this approach, and it may take several attempts. Furthermore, even after using this workaround, issues could persist with streaming services like Spotify.

Last year, the Google TV streamer was released by Google, which also quietly ended support and updates for the Chromecast device line starting in 2023. Ongoing online discussions show that many people still rely on these devices. There is no evidence to support rumors that problems like the recent certificate authority expiration are intentional efforts by Google to promote updates.

Additionally, in 2021, Let's Encrypt allowed a root certificate to expire, causing important websites and services on unupdated devices to stop functioning

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is “grateful” to a fast-food chain that switched from seed oils to 100% beef tallow in its french fries recipe. In an interview with Fox News, the Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary travelled to a Steak ‘n Shake location in Florida, where he discussed the importance of his Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) initiative. The 71-year-old claimed on Monday that the customers had been “raving” about healthier french fries ever since. 

“Steak ‘n Shake just switched out, and people are raving about these French fries,” Kennedy told host Sean Hannity. After trying out the company's tweaked french fries recipe, he called it a “completely different experience.” The fast-food chain, which is headquartered in Indiana, announced earlier this month that it has started using 100% all-natural beef tallow at all of its locations.

Reiterating his delight over the change, Kennedy said, “Steak ‘n Shake has been great. We're very grateful [to] them for RFK'ing the french fries. They turned me into a verb,” adding that the “customers are raving about it.” While munching on the salty snack and a double cheeseburger, the former independent presidential candidate said that he believes seed oils are one of the major factors behind the chronic disease “epidemic” in the United States. 

“Seed oil is one of the components of processed foods, and all the science indicates that ultra-processed foods are the principal culprit in this extraordinary explosion – the epidemic we have of chronic disease,” Kennedy explained. “I have a libertarian outlook,” he went on, adding, “People should be able to make their own choices - if you want to eat a doughnut or seed oils, you should be able to.” 

The Kennedy scion emphasised the need for the people to be able to “exercise informed choice.” “You should know what that product is, what's in your food and what the health impacts are. That's all we're going to do,” he continued to say before calling on other companies to join the MAHA initiative and the president's focus on “radical transparency.” 

“President Trump wants us to have radical transparency and to incentivize companies like [Steak ‘n Shake] to switch to traditional ingredients, like beef tallow,” Kennedy said. “We're going to inform Americans about what's been making them sick. We want to do everything that we can to incentivize these companies to be transparent, to switch over from ultra-processed food, and to be part of this movement to make America healthier,” he added.

 By Yoshita Singh 

 United Nations, India told the UN Security Council that it has discussed with the Taliban regime various issues pertaining to bilateral relations and the ""special"" people-to-people ties has been the ""foundation"" of Delhi's present day engagement with the country. 

 India's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish, said Monday at the UN Security meeting on the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan that in the beginning of this year, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri met Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai. 

 “The two sides discussed various issues pertaining to bilateral relations as well as regional developments. The Afghan side appreciated and thanked Indian leadership for continuing to engage and support the people of Afghanistan. It was decided that India would consider engaging in development projects in the near future in addition to the ongoing humanitarian assistance programs,” Harish said in the Council. 

 The January meeting between Misri and Muttaqi was the highest-level contact so far between Delhi and the Taliban since the regime took over Kabul in 2021. Harish underscored that India and Afghanistan share a relationship which has spanned centuries and as its contiguous neighbour, India and Afghanistan share a special people to people relationship which has been the “foundation of our present day engagement with the country.” 

 Harish said that India is closely monitoring the situation in Afghanistan and has been actively engaged in regional and international efforts to maintain stability and peace in the country. 

 “Our broad approach remains to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan and create an international consensus under the UN framework to resolve various issues between the de-facto authorities in Afghanistan and the international community,” the Indian envoy said. 

 He added that India's participation in the UN meetings in Doha, Moscow Format and other fora are a ""reflection of our efforts to secure peace, stability and development in Afghanistan.” 

 India told the UN body that it has been working with various UN agencies for providing assistance to the Afghan people in areas of health, food security, education, sports and capacity building. Since 2001, India has been committed towards rebuilding and reconstruction of Afghanistan. 

 “Our development partnership includes more than 500 projects spread across all provinces in Afghanistan,” he said. 

 Since August 2021, India has delivered 27 tons of relief material, 50,000 tons of wheat, 40,000 litres of pesticides and more than 300 tons of medicines and medical equipment to the country. 

 India has also partnered with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Afghanistan to provide assistance for the welfare of Afghan drug user population, especially women. Under this partnership, India has, since 2022, supplied 11,000 units of hygiene kits, baby food, clothing, medical aid and more than 30 tons of social support items to UNODC, Kabul. 

 Underlining India's historic relationship with the people of Afghanistan, Harish stressed Delhi's “readiness” to respond to the needs of the Afghan people. 

 ""At the same time, we remain committed to continue our close interaction with all relevant stakeholders on Afghanistan and support the international community's efforts towards a stable, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan,” he said. 

 UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva, told the Council it is the responsibility of the de facto authorities to indicate whether they want Afghanistan to be reintegrated into the international system and, if so, whether they are willing to take the necessary steps. 

 ""The de facto authorities have so far treated their international obligations selectively, rejecting some on the basis they allegedly impinge on the country's sovereignty or violate their traditions. But to be very clear, these international obligations affect not only the possibility of progress along the political pathway but, most crucially, the well-being of Afghanistan's entire population, whose voices must be included in the political pathway."" 

 She further said the presence of terrorist groups in Afghanistan, as documented in the recent 1267 sanctions monitoring team report, demonstrate that the international community continues to have legitimate questions about the de facto authorities' ability or commitment to uphold their own guarantees that Afghanistan will not become a threat to other countries. 

 Following the meeting in January between Misri and Muttaqi, a statement by the Ministry of External Affairs had said that the two sides evaluated the ongoing Indian humanitarian assistance programmes. The Afghan Minister appreciated and thanked the Indian leadership for continuing to engage and support the people of Afghanistan. 

 The MEA statement had added that in response to the request from the Afghan side, India would provide further material support in the first instance to the health sector and for the rehabilitation of refugees. The two sides had also discussed strengthening of sports cooperation, which is highly valued by the young generation of Afghanistan. It was also agreed to promote the use of Chabahar port for supporting trade and commercial activities, including for the purpose of humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan. 

 The Afghan side had underlined its sensitivities to India's security concerns, the MEA statement had said.

As US President Donald Trump doubled his planned tariffs on Canadian metals, Ontario's prime minister-elect Mark Carney said that his government will ensure 'maximum impact in the US' and will keep the retaliatory tariffs in place until Americans show respect and commit to fair trade.

Just a day ago, the Liberal Party announced Carney's victory in the leadership with over 85 per cent votes in his favour. He will replace Justin Trudeau at Canada's top office in the coming days.

Having already been known as a Trump critic, Carney dubbed the US president's latest tariffs as an attack on Canadian workers, families and businesses.

""My government will ensure our response has maximum impact in the US and minimal impact here in Canada, while supporting the workers impacted,"" he said.

Carney further added, ""My government will keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade.""

Trump on Tuesday took to his Truth Social network and said that he will double the planned tariffs on Canadian aluminium and steel as a response to Ontario's decision to impose an electricity surcharge on three US states.

He said that the tariff increase would take effect on March 12.

“I have instructed my Secretary of Commerce to add an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%, on all STEEL and ALUMINUM COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES FROM CANADA, ONE OF THE HIGHEST TARIFFING NATIONS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,” Trump posted.

The US president also asked Canada to ""immediately drop"" their ""anti-American farmer tariff"" of ""250% to 390%"" on various US dairy products, adding that they have for long been considered outrageous.

Trump said that the electricity was being used as a ""bargaining chop and threat"", threatening that Canada ""will pay a financial for this so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come!""

He reiterated his stance on wanting to make Canada America's 51st state and said that it is the only thing that makes sense for Ontario. ""This would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.""

Reportedly, Canadian officials are once again planning retaliatory tariffs in response to Trump's doubling down on specific steel and aluminium tariffs. The move is expected to be announced on Wednesday.

Ukraine launched a massive drone attack targeting Russia's capital Moscow, leaving one person dead and three injured, reported news agency Reuters. The attack marks Ukraine's first large-scale aggression towards Russia in 2025.

Governor Andrei Vorobyov stated in a post on Telegram that seven apartments in the region had been evacuated till now due to damage caused by the attacks.

The drone attack occurred right before a visit of Organization of Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE) secretary general to the Russian capital on Tuesday.

The mayor of Moscow stated that “insignificant” damage had also been caused to the roof of a building and a fire had been sparked in a parking lot.

Flights in and out of three Moscow airports have been restricted. Trains travelling through the Domodedovo railway station in the city have also been halted.

Russia's defence ministry said its air defence systems had intercepted 337 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions, including 91 drones over Moscow.

The attack on Moscow comes right before Ukrainian and US officials a are supposed to meet in Saudi Arabia to negotiate an end to the 3-year-long conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

US and Russian officials also met in the Saudi capital in February to discuss restoring ties between the Cold War foes and bringing an end to the war with Ukraine.

After a clash on February 28, during a meeting in the Oval Office, relations between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky have been strained, with the US suspending all military aid and intelligence inputs to the nation.

Trump has also threatened to impose large scale banking sanctions and tariffs on Russia for aggression against Ukraine, and to force both parties to agree to a ceasefire.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, “To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now, before it is too late. Thank you!!!”

 Seven medical professionals who were responsible for treating Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona in his final days are set to stand trial for culpable homicide. The trial, beginning Tuesday in Buenos Aires, will examine allegations that negligence by Maradona's doctors and caregivers led to his untimely death in 2020 at the age of 60.

Maradona, widely regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time, suffered a fatal heart attack at his rented residence in Tigre, an affluent district north of Buenos Aires, while recovering from brain surgery to remove a blood clot.

Despite his history of addiction, obesity, and alcoholism, prosecutors argue that Maradona's death was preventable, had he received proper medical care. An investigative medical panel found that his treatment was “inappropriate, deficient and reckless,” prompting legal action against his caregivers.

The seven defendants include a mix of doctors, nurses, and specialists who played key roles in Maradona's medical care

An eighth medical professional, nurse Gisela Dahiana Madrid, has requested a separate jury trial at a later date.

The case against Maradona's caregivers is built on extensive evidence, including over 120,000 messages and audio recordings of conversations between the medical team and other involved parties. Prosecutors claim that:

All defendants deny wrongdoing, asserting that Maradona was a difficult patient who resisted treatment. Luque has maintained that Maradona insisted on outpatient care, rejecting more intensive medical supervision. The defense has also presented a separate forensic study claiming that Maradona's death was “sudden and without agony.”

“The death occurred unexpectedly, suddenly, during sleeping hours, without offering us any time,” said Luque, the neurologist. In response to the damning medical panel report, the defense commissioned its own forensic study to support its claim that Maradona's death “was sudden and without agony.""

Luque stressed that it was Maradona himself who insisted on home-hospitalization.

Maradona secluded himself during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, as his chronic health problems made him more vulnerable to becoming infected and more likely to become severely ill.

The isolation unleashed depression and anxiety for the superstar in early 2020, according to hundreds of pages of court documents reviewed by The Associated Press. Maradona turned to alcohol, a vice that had long played a role in his troubled legacy.

If convicted of culpable homicide, the accused medical professionals could face up to 25 years in prison.

 By Saleem Ahmed 

 QUETTA, Pakistan - Separatist militants blew up a railway track and opened fire on a passenger train in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, taking dozens of hostages and battling security forces conducting a rescue operation, police and the insurgents said. 

 Police have not specified how many passengers were taken hostage in the remote mountainous area but the insurgents said they were holding 214 people, and have threatened to start executing them. 

 ""The affected train is still on the spot and the armed men are holding passengers,"" senior district police officer Rana Dilawar said. 

 ""Security forces launched a massive operation,"" he said, adding that helicopters and special forces had been deployed. 

 The train was trapped in a tunnel and the driver was killed after sustaining serious injuries, local authorities, police and railway officials said. 

 The Baloch Liberation Army, a separatist militant group, said it blew up the tracks and ""swiftly took control of the train"". The group said it would execute 10 people in response to the ongoing military operation. 

 The BLA has demanded the release within 48 hours of Baloch political prisoners, activists and missing persons it said had been abducted by the military. 

 ""BLA is prepared for a prisoner exchange,"" the group said. 

 ""If our demands are not met within the stipulated period or if the occupying state attempts any military action during this time all prisoners of war will be neutralized and the train will be completely destroyed."" 

 The group, which seeks independence for Balochistan province bordering both Afghanistan and Iran, said the hostages included Pakistan Army members and other security officials travelling on leave. 

 Dilawar said some of the militants had taken a group of around 35 hostages into the mountains while others were still holding the locomotive. He had previously said that over 300 hostages were safe but security officials have since announced that 104 people have been rescued so far. 

 Security forces said an explosion had been heard near the tunnel and that they were exchanging fire with the militants in a mountainous area. 

 A security source who asked not to be identified said many people had lost their lives in the attack, adding that 80 military personnel were among the 425 passengers aboard the train. 

 Another security source said 104 passengers had been rescued, 17 wounded taken to hospital and 16 militants had been killed, adding the rest were surrounded. 

 ""The operation will continue until the last terrorist is eliminated,"" they said. 

 The BLA said it has not suffered any casualties. It said it had killed 30 soldiers and shot down a drone. There was no confirmation of that from Pakistani authorities. 

 Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack, saying security officials were ""repelling"" the militants. 

 EXECUTIONS THREATENED 

 ""Civilian passengers, particularly women, children, the elderly, and Baloch citizens, have been released safely and given a secure route,"" the BLA said in a statement emailed to journalists and posted on Telegram. 

 ""The BLA further warns that if military intervention continues, all hostages will be executed."" 

 The Jaffar Express had been on its way from Balochistan's capital, Quetta, to the city of Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when it was fired on. 

 Pakistani Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack and praised the military for rescuing more than 100 passengers. 

 ""Those who attack innocent passengers are enemies of the country,"" he said. 

 ""Enemy forces are conspiring to create instability in the country through terrorism in Balochistan."" 

 The Balochistan government has imposed emergency measures to deal with the situation, spokesperson Shahid Rind said, without giving any more details. 

 The BLA is the biggest of several groups that have been battling the government for decades, saying it unfairly exploits Balochistan's rich gas and mineral resources. 

 The conflict has seen frequent attacks against the government, army and Chinese interests in the region.

 Russian air defenses shot down 337 Ukrainian drones over 10 Russian regions overnight, military officials said Tuesday, in what appeared to be the biggest Ukrainian drone attack on Russia in the three-year war. 

 The attack came hours before the start of key Ukraine-U.S. talks in Saudi Arabia on how to stop Europe's biggest conflict since World War II. Two people were killed and 18 were injured, including three children, officials said. 

 A senior Ukrainian delegation, meanwhile, was to meet with America's top diplomat in Saudi Arabia about ending the three-year war with Russia. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian or U.S. officials on the attack. 

 The talks in Saudi Arabia reflect a new diplomatic push after an unprecedented argument erupted during President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Feb. 28 visit to the White House. Ukrainian officials told The Associated Press on Monday that they will propose a ceasefire covering the Black Sea, which would bring safer shipping, as well long-range missile strikes that have hit civilians in Ukraine, and the release of prisoners. 

 The Kremlin has not publicly offered any concessions. Russia has said it's ready to cease hostilities on condition that Ukraine drops its bid to join NATO and recognizes regions that Moscow occupies as Russian. 

 Russian forces have held the battlefield momentum for more than a year and are pushing at selected points along the 1,000-kilometer front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region. 

 Most of the Ukrainian drones fired at Russia overnight — 126 of them — were shot down over the Kursk region across the border from Ukraine, parts of which Kyiv's forces control, and 91 were shot down over the Moscow region, according to a statement by Russia's Defense Ministry. 

 Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said over 70 drones targeted the Russian capital and were shot down as they were flying toward it — the biggest single attack on Moscow so far in the war. 

 Other attacked regions listed in the statement included Belgorod, Bryansk and Voronezh on the border with Ukraine and those deeper inside Russia, such as Kaluga, Lipetsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Oryol and Ryazan. 

 The governor of the Moscow region surrounding the capital, Andrei Vorobyov, said the attack damaged several residential buildings and a number of cars. 

 Another person was wounded on a highway in the Lipetsk region, Gov. Igor Artamonov said. 

 Sobyanin said the roof of a building in Moscow also sustained damage, which he described as “insignificant.” Footage of the building, published by RIA Novosti, showed a charred spot on the facade of a multi-story residential building near the roof, with bits of the building's lining stripped off. 

 Flights were temporarily restricted in and out of six airports, including Domodedovo, Vnukovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovsky just outside Moscow, and airports in the Yaroslavl and Nizhny Novgorod regions. 

 Train traffic through the Domodedovo railway station in the Moscow region has also been briefly halted, local officials reported. 

 Local authorities also reported downing drones in the Tula and Vladimir regions adjacent to the Moscow region. It wasn't immediately clear why those regions weren't mentioned in the Defense Ministry's statement. 

 In the Saudi city of Jeddah, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his delegation, including national security adviser Mike Waltz, were preparing to meet Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's team. 

 Two senior Ukrainian officials said Kyiv is ready to sign an agreement with the United States on access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals — a deal that U.S. President Donald Trump is keen to secure. 

 On his plane to Jeddah, Rubio said the U.S. delegation would not be proposing any specific measures to secure an end to the three-year conflict but rather wanted to hear from Ukraine about what they would be willing to consider. 

 “I'm not going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do,” Rubio told reporters accompanying him. “I think we want to listen to see how far they're willing to go and then compare that to what the Russians want and see how far apart we truly are.” 

 Rubio said the rare earths and critical minerals deal could be signed during the meeting but stressed it was not a precondition for the United States to move ahead with discussions with either Ukraine or the Russians. 

 He said it may, in fact, make more sense to take some time to negotiate the precise details of the agreement, which is now a broad memorandum of understanding that leaves out many specifics.

Elon Musk, the owner of X, on Monday, blamed Ukrainian forces for the global outage of the social media platform after a hacking team, Darkstorm, had previously taken credit.

In an interview with Fox News, billionaire Elon Musk addressed the cyber attack on X. “We're not sure exactly what happened, but there was a massive cyberattack to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area,” he said.

X (formerly Twitter) suffered repeated outages throughout Monday. Downdetector, a site that monitors online services, reported complaints of the outage from around 2,000 users in India, 18,000 in the US, and 10,000 in the UK.

Hacking group Dark Storm, in a post on Telegram, had claimed responsibility for “taking Twitter offline."" The pro-Palestinian group is known for targeting countries which support Israel amid the conflict in the Gaza region.

Musk's accusation comes after relations between the US and Ukraine have notably soured after a war of words erupted between US President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on February 28 in the Oval Office.

Elon Musk on Monday also re-posted a user's claims about Ukrainian groups funded by the USAID programme supposedly “blacklisting” senior Trump administration officials like vice president JD Vance and calling for prosecution against them.

However, Musk said that Starlink communication services would continue in Ukraine despite the stormy relations with the US.

""To be extremely clear, no matter how much I disagree with the Ukraine policy, Starlink will never turn off its terminals,"" Musk wrote.

The family of missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki reportedly believes she may have become a victim of a crime. The 20-year-old Indian-origin woman mysteriously disappeared while on a spring break holiday in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. She was last seen at the Riu Republica Resort beach on March 6 around 4:50 am.

Local authorities believe Konanki may have drowned after jumping in the ocean, but a complaint seeking to intensify search efforts made a more sinister suggestion, stating that “while it is possible that Sudiksha drowned, there is a growing suspicion that there may be a crime, specifically the possibility of kidnapping,” WTOP reported.

“It's four days, and if she was in water, she would likely have been strewn to shore,” Konanki's father, Subbarayudu Konanki, told the outlet. “She's not found, so we're asking them to investigate multiple options, like kidnapping or abduction.”

Subbarayudu, along with his wife and two family friends, flew from his home in Virginia to Punta Cana after learning that his daughter was missing. They filed the criminal complaint urging Dominican authorities to “take immediate steps to investigate not only the possibility of an accidental drowning, but also the possibility of a kidnapping or foul play.”

“Her belongings, including personal items like her phone and wallet, were left with her friends, which is unusual because she always carried her phone with her,” the complaint said.

An earlier report by the Dominican Republic outlet Listin Diario said that investigators were questioning a “young man” who was seen swimming at the beach with Konanki sometime before she was last seen. However, it remains unclear if the man is one of the missing woman's classmates from school. The group of classmates from Pitt who were on the trip with Konanki are reportedly being questioned too, to corroborate the man's story.

Elon Musk's daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson on Monday accused her estranged father of using sex-selective in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) when she was conceived.

In a post on social media platform Threads, Vivian Jenna Wilson wrote, “My assigned sex at birth was a commodity that was bought and paid for.”

She added, “So when I was feminine as a child and then turned out to be transgender, I was going against the product that was sold. That expectation of masculinity that I had to rebel against all my life was a monetary transaction. A monetary transaction. A MONETARY TRANSACTION.”

Elon Musk was described as having “an engineering approach to reproduction” as per a Forbes report from 2022, which also confirmed that at least five of his children had been conceived via IVF. All five children were assigned male at birth.

Of those children, at least the first five were conceived via IVF, all of whom were assigned male at birth, per a 2022 report from Forbes, which also described Musk as taking “an engineering approach to reproduction.”

Also Read: US Senator points out Elon Musk's limited power in the Trump administration: ‘He does not have the power…'

The report had raised questions regarding Musk's use of IVF as well, asking, “Were his first babies selected to be male at the preimplantation stage?”

While sex-selective IVF is legal in the United States, it is controversial due to the contested ethics of choosing the sex of the child. It is outlawed in several countries such as India, Canada and China, to prevent people choosing to have male children.

Elon Musk has not commented on his duaghters claims yet. In 2022, Wilson had changed her name and her gender legally, stating that she no longer lived with or wished to be related to her biological father.

During a podcast appearance in 2024, Musk had claimed that Wilson had been “killed by the woke mind virus”, a claim that his daughter refuted.

In her first public interview with NBC News, Vivian Jenna Wilson claimed that her father had been cruel and dismissive regarding her identity.

A 24-year-old tourist from Iowa, who was the last person to see University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki alive, gave three versions to the police of what happened. Joshua Stevem Ribe, a fellow guest at the Caribbean resort from tiny Rock Rapids, suggested that he passed out drunk on the beach, and when he woke up, Konanki was missing.

Konanki, 20, an Indian-origin woman, vanished while on a spring break holiday in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. She was last spotted at the Riu Republica Resort beach on March 6 around 4:50 am.

Dominican media outlet Noticias SIN reported that Konanki and her friends were caught on surveillance video partying at a disco at Riu Republica Resort at 3 am. The group left around 4 am and headed out to the beach, staying there until 5:50 am. They left Konanki and Ribe alone on the beach.

Ribe has provided three versions of what happened next, according to the outlet. He first told police that he threw up from the rough surf and went back to shore, but also asked Konanki if she was ok. He said in the second version that he felt sick to his stomach and left the water, and last saw Konanki in knee-deep water in the surf before he passed out. In the final version, he said he saw Konanki walking along the shore before he fell asleep.

Police said Ribe is cooperating with authorities. They have not said if they suspect foul play in Konanki's disappearance.

Konanki's family, however, fears that she may have become the victim of a crime. Although local authorities suggested she may have drowned after jumping in the ocean, a complaint seeking to intensify search efforts made a more sinister suggestion, stating that “while it is possible that Sudiksha drowned, there is a growing suspicion that there may be a crime, specifically the possibility of kidnapping,” WTOP reported.

“It's four days, and if she was in water, she would likely have been strewn to shore,” Konanki's father, Subbarayudu Konanki, said. “She's not found, so we're asking them to investigate multiple options, like kidnapping or abduction.”

Elon Musk bringing his young children to a meeting with Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi in the United States (US) has caused more than a flutter. Reactions have ranged from amusement to indignation, sparking discussions on diplomatic propriety, modern parenting, and the shifting norms of professional spaces. 

 Some critics viewed Musk's move as a blatant disregard for decorum, trivialising an important occasion. Others called for India to lodge a formal protest, arguing that it insulted the honour of the PM. However, Musk's approach is not entirely new. In the past, he carried his son, X Æ A-XII, on his shoulders at the Oval Office when meeting then-US President Donald Trump. That moment, too, broke conventional expectations, sparking conversations about how workplaces — corporate and political — are evolving to accommodate family life.   This came to the fore again when Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's outfit — a military styled black sweatshirt — to the meeting with Trump at the White House became a hot topic. Zelensky, who has eschewed suits and has worn clothing showing solidarity with his soldiers fighting the Russian army, was even asked by a journalist at the press conference whether he owned a suit.  In February, US vice president JD Vance arrived in Paris for the Global AI Action Summit with his wife Usha and their children. While the family reportedly stayed away from plenary sessions, PM Modi interacted with them, even presenting Vance's son, Vivek, with a birthday gift. These instances raise an interesting question: Are family-friendly optics becoming a new norm in global diplomacy, or are they a form of political grandstanding?

Some critics viewed Musk's move as a blatant disregard for decorum, trivialising an important occasion. Others called for India to lodge a formal protest, arguing that it insulted the honour of the PM. However, Musk's approach is not entirely new. In the past, he carried his son, X Æ A-XII, on his shoulders at the Oval Office when meeting then-US President Donald Trump. That moment, too, broke conventional expectations, sparking conversations about how workplaces — corporate and political — are evolving to accommodate family life. 

This came to the fore again when Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's outfit — a military styled black sweatshirt — to the meeting with Trump at the White House became a hot topic. Zelensky, who has eschewed suits and has worn clothing showing solidarity with his soldiers fighting the Russian army, was even asked by a journalist at the press conference whether he owned a suit. 

In February, US vice president JD Vance arrived in Paris for the Global AI Action Summit with his wife Usha and their children. While the family reportedly stayed away from plenary sessions, PM Modi interacted with them, even presenting Vance's son, Vivek, with a birthday gift. These instances raise an interesting question: Are family-friendly optics becoming a new norm in global diplomacy, or are they a form of political grandstanding?

President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran would not negotiate with the U.S. while being threatened, telling President Donald Trump to ""do whatever the hell you want"", Iranian state media reported on Tuesday.

""It is unacceptable for us that they (the U.S.) give orders and make threats. I won't even negotiate with you. Do whatever the hell you want"", state media quoted Pezeshkian as saying.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that Tehran would not be bullied into negotiations, a day after Donald Trump said he had sent a letter urging Iran to engage in talks on a new nuclear deal.

While expressing openness to a deal with Tehran, Donald Trump has reinstated the ""maximum pressure"" campaign he applied in his first term as president to isolate Iran from the global economy and drive its oil exports down towards zero.

Donald Trump had shut off aid after a disastrous meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky on February 28. (File)

Ukraine endorsed an American proposal for a 30-day ceasefire and agreed to immediate negotiations with Russia in crunch talks in Jeddah on Tuesday after three years of grinding war.

The positive response from Ukraine prompted President Donald Trump's administration to lift a freeze on military aid and to predict the beginning to an end to three years of war.

With Trump stunning allies by applying intense pressure on Kyiv and reaching out to Moscow, Ukrainian officials came to talks in Saudi Arabia eager to make up and had proposed a partial truce on air and sea attacks.

Trump's advisers pressed for more and said Ukraine agreed to their proposal for a full month-long ceasefire in a war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.



""Today we made an offer that the Ukrainians have accepted, which is to enter into a ceasefire and into immediate negotiations,"" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after around nine hours of talks in an ornate hotel in Jeddah.

""We'll take this offer now to the Russians and we hope they'll say yes to peace. The ball is now in their court.

""If they say no then we'll, unfortunately, know what the impediment is to peace here,"" Rubio said of Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbour in February 2022.

Rubio said the United States would immediately resume military assistance and intelligence sharing it had cut off to pressure its wartime partner following a disastrous February 28 meeting between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky.

In Washington, Trump said he was ready to welcome Zelensky back to the White House and may speak to President Vladimir Putin this week.

Asked by a reporter about the prospects of a comprehensive ceasefire in Ukraine, Trump answered: ""Well, I hope it will be over the next few days, I'd like to see.

""I know we have a big meeting with Russia tomorrow and some great conversations hopefully will ensue.""

In a joint statement, Ukraine and the United States said they would conclude ""as soon as possible"" a deal securing US access to Ukraine's mineral wealth, which Trump demanded as compensation for billions of dollars in US weapons under his predecessor Joe Biden.

Zelensky was supposed to sign the deal at the White House before the dramatic on-camera showdown, in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance dressed down the wartime leader and accused him of ingratitude.

Zelensky quickly thanked Trump over the ""positive"" ceasefire proposal made in Jeddah and said the United States must now work to persuade Russia.

""The American side understands our arguments, perceives our proposals, and I want to thank President Trump for the constructive conversation between our teams,"" Zelensky said in his evening address.

- Russia must respond 'clearly' -

Since the US cutoff of aid and intelligence sharing, Russia has stepped up attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and seized back land in Russia's Kursk region which Ukrainian forces had infiltrated as they seek leverage.

Hours before the Jeddah talks, Ukraine staged a major direct attack on Moscow, with hundreds of drones slamming into the capital and other areas, leaving three people dead.

Top Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak said in Jeddah that Ukraine had made clear that its desire is peace.

""Russia needs to say, very clearly, they want peace or not, they want to end this war, which they started, or no,"" Yermak told reporters.

Trump's abrupt shift on Ukraine following Biden's strong support has rattled European allies, with France and Germany increasingly speaking of developing common European defence if the United States no longer offers its security guarantees through NATO.

But Mike Waltz, Trump's national security advisor, countered that the brash president has ""literally moved the entire global conversation"" in support of peace.

""We've gone from if the war is going to end to how the war is going to end,"" Waltz told reporters alongside Rubio.

Waltz, who said he would speak in the coming days with his Russian counterpart, credited the Ukrainians with agreeing on the need to ""end the killing, to end the tragic meat-grinder of people and national treasure"".

- Allies cautious -

Rubio will head Wednesday to Canada -- another country with which Trump is feuding -- to meet fellow foreign ministers of the Group of Seven industrial democracies.

Rubio has said he will push the G7 to avoid ""antagonistic"" language about Russia for fear of scuttling diplomacy.

In Poland, a top supporter of Ukraine and where historical memories of Russia run deep, Prime Minister Donald Tusk praised the ""important step towards peace"" by the United States and Ukraine.

Even if Russia agrees to a ceasefire, much remains uncertain in negotiations. Ukraine has pressed for security guarantees, but Trump, in another shift from Biden, has ruled out NATO membership.

Waltz said that the talks in Jeddah discussed ""substantive details on how this war is going to permanently end"" including ""what type of guarantees they're going to have for their long term security and prosperity"".

French President Emmanuel Macron, who has mulled European forces in Ukraine as part of any deal, said Tuesday that Kyiv needs ""credible"" security guarantees in any ceasefire.

Justin Trudeau resigned on January 6 as both- the Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party

After resigning as Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau was captured exiting Parliament in a playful style -- carrying a chair and with his tongue sticking out.

As per convention Canadian lawmakers are allowed to take their chairs with them when they leave Parliament, Brian Lilley, Political columnist for the Toronto Sun noted in a post on X.

""When any MP leaves the Commons, they are allowed to take their chair, their seat with them. I find it a great tradition, one that I support. That said, this is a weird photo of Trudeau leaving with his. Also, perhaps another sign of a looming election"", he wrote on X.

Justin Trudeau had in his remarks while stepping down highlighted the 'achievements' of the Liberal Party over the past decade while looking towards the future, hours ahead of the announcement of his successor as the leader of his party as per CBC News.

In his speech at the Liberal Leadership Convention, TJustin rudeau said, ""I am damn proud of what we've done over these past 10 years for the middle class and the people working hard to join it.""

As the Liberal Party enters a new era, Justin Trudeau told the crowd that ""there is a responsibility to ensure that Canada stays the best country on Earth! In one of his last speeches as Liberal leader and Canada's PM, he urged his supporters to keep fighting for Canada as hard as they can.

Justin Trudeau resigned on January 6 as both- the Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party amid widespread anger over his government's handling of a housing crisis and rising costs of living.

Prime Minister-Designate of Canada, Mark Carney was elected on Sunday to lead Canada's Liberal Party into the next federal elections later this year.

Carney stepped up in this role as Canada seeks to counter its looming trade war with US President Donald Trump.

In a post on X, he said, ""Thank you. Now let's build a stronger Canada, together,"" adding, ""We're strongest when we are united.""

Pakistani troops freed dozens of train passengers taken hostage by armed militants in the country's southwest on Tuesday, with hundreds more still being held in the deadly siege.

Security sources said that heavy gunfire was ongoing between security forces and the militants.

Gunmen forced the train to a halt in a remote, mountainous area of Balochistan province on Tuesday afternoon, with the assault immediately claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist group behind rising violence in the province which borders Afghanistan and Iran.

""Security forces have successfully freed 80 hostages, including 43 men, 26 women, and 11 children, from the terrorists,"" security sources told AFP, adding that 13 militants had been killed.

""Efforts are ongoing to ensure the safe release of the remaining passengers. The terrorists have been surrounded, and the operation will continue until the last terrorist is neutralized.""

A nearby railway station in Mach has been turned into a makeshift hospital to receive some of the wounded.

The driver of the train, a police officer and soldier were all killed in the assault, according to paramedic Nazim Farooq and railway official Muhammad Aslam, both at Mach railway station.

Earlier in the day, Muhammad Kashif, a senior railway government official in Quetta, the capital of the province, told AFP that ""over 450 passengers onboard are being held hostage by gunmen.""

In a statement, the BLA said gunmen bombed the railway track before storming aboard the train.

""The militants swiftly took control of the train and have taken all passengers hostage,"" said the statement released to media.

The group ""warned of severe consequences"" if an attempt is made to rescue the hostages.

The incident happened around 1:00 pm (0800 GMT) in rural Sibi district, near to a city station where the train had been due to stop.

The train had left Quetta for Peshawar, in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa -- a more than 30-hour journey -- at around 9:00 am.

A senior police official from the area bordering Sibi, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said that ""the train remains stuck just before a tunnel surrounded by mountains"".

An emergency has been imposed at hospitals in Sibi, according to the government official.

Decades-long insurgency

The area is a mountainous region making it easier for militants to have hideouts and plan attacks.

Security forces have been battling a decades-long insurgency in impoverished Balochistan, which militant groups claim is being exploited by outsiders, with wealth from its natural resources syphoned off with little benefit to the local population.

But violence has soared in the western border regions with Afghanistan, from north to south, since the Taliban took back power in 2021.

Pakistan accuses the Taliban government in Kabul of offering safe haven to militants to plan attacks. The Taliban government denies the charge.

The BLA have launched larger scale attacks in recent months, including holding a motorway overnight and identifying travellers from outside the province and shooting them dead.

BLA militants also killed seven Punjabi travellers in February after they were ordered off a bus.

In November, the BLA claimed responsibility for a bombing at Quetta's main railway station that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers.

Last year was the deadliest year in almost a decade, with more than 1,600 people killed in attacks in Pakistan, mostly in the border regions, according to the Center for Research and Security Studies, an Islamabad-based analysis group.

President Donald Trump reversed course on Tuesday afternoon on a pledge to double tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada to 50%, just hours after announcing the higher tariffs, in rapid-fire moves that scrambled financial markets. The switch came after a Canadian official also backed off his own plans for a 25% surcharge on electricity.

Trump's latest salvo, which whipsawed financial markets and rekindled fears of inflation, followed Ontario Premier Doug Ford's announcement that he would place a 25% surcharge on the electricity Canada's most populous province supplies to more than 1 million U.S. homes unless Trump dropped all of his tariff threats against Canada's exports into the U.S.

Faced with Trump's 50% tariff threat, Ford agreed to suspend the surcharge and meet with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington on Thursday.

The White House then announced that only the previously planned 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum products from the United States' northern neighbor and all other countries would take effect on Wednesday - with no exceptions or exemptions.

""President Trump has once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. ""Pursuant to his previous executive orders, a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum with no exceptions or exemptions will go into effect for Canada and all of our other trading partners at midnight, March 12th.""

The back-and-forth between the U.S. and Canada further unsettled financial markets already battered by Trump's focus on tariffs. After tumbling hard after Trump's initial post on Truth Social, stocks rebounded after Ford said he would suspend the surcharge and Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire.

The S&P 500 index dropped as low as 5,528.41 points, briefly marking a 10% fall from its record closing high of 6,144.15 on February 19, which is commonly known as a market correction. U.S. stocks have fallen hard since reaching a record high about a month after Trump took office on January 20, with nearly $5 trillion of market value erased from U.S. indexes.

Trump triggered the selloff with a morning post on his Truth Social media platform, saying he had instructed Lutnick to put an additional 25% tariff on the metals products from Canada that take effect on Wednesday, on top of the 25% on all imported steel and aluminum products from other countries.

He also criticized Canada for trade protections on dairy and other agricultural products and threatened to ""substantially increase"" duties on cars coming into the U.S. that are set to take effect on April 2 ""if other egregious, long time Tariffs are not likewise dropped by Canada.""

The U.S. president shook off the market gyrations, telling reporters that markets would go up and down, but that he had to rebuild the economy.

Trump, heartened by Ontario's move, said the tariff rates could rise further, building pressure on countries to move manufacturing into the United States.

""The higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build ... The biggest win is not the tariffs. That's a big win. It's a lot of money. But the biggest win is they move into our country and produce jobs,"" he said, insisting the tariffs would ""be throwing off a lot of money to this country.""

The escalation of the trade war occurred as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prepared to hand over power this week to his successor Mark Carney, who won the leadership race of the ruling Liberals last weekend. On Monday, Carney said he could not speak with Trump until he was sworn in as prime minister.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Ford's initial comments were ""egregious and insulting"" and said Canada would be ""very wise not to shut off electricity for the American people."" Trump was determined to ensure the U.S. relied on its own domestic electricity, she said.

Another Canadian province, Alberta, gave U.S. officials options to de-escalate the trade dispute, its energy minister told reporters at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston.

Trump later met with about 100 chief executives of U.S. firms amid evidence that his trade policies could hurt the U.S. economy, threatening to dash a ""soft landing"" that until recently appeared as the base case and reignite inflation. 

Before the gathering, airlines, department stores and other businesses warned that his fast-shifting trade policies are starting to have a chilling effect, with consumers pulling back on purchases of everything from basic goods to travel.

CONFIDENCE TAKES A HIT

Leavitt sparred with an AP reporter over the tariffs during a regular briefing after he questioned why Trump was now backing tax hikes in the form of tariffs after pushing for tax cuts.

""Ultimately, when we have fair and balanced trade, which the American people have not seen in decades ... revenues will stay here, wages will go up and our country will be made wealthy again,"" she said. ""And I think it's insulting that you are trying to test my knowledge of economics, and the decisions that this president has made. I now regret giving a question to the Associated Press.""

Investors are bracing for a further round of tariffs on autos as well as tit-for-tat reciprocal tariffs in early April. Canada and China have retaliated with their own tariffs on U.S. exports, while Mexico stopped short of retaliation after Trump delayed his planned levies on the southern U.S. neighbor.

""This is what a trade war looks like,"" said Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center. ""Tit-for-tat escalation which can quickly spiral to both sides' economic detriment.""

The metals tariffs will apply to millions of tons of steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and other countries that had been entering the U.S. on a duty-free basis under carve-outs. Trump has vowed that the tariffs will be applied ""without exceptions or exemptions"" in a move he hopes will aid the struggling U.S. industries.

Trump's promise to double the metals levies on Canada sent some aluminum prices soaring. Price premiums for aluminum on the U.S. physical market climbed to a record high above $990 a metric ton on Tuesday.

Trump's hyper-focus on tariffs since taking office in January has rattled investor, consumer and business confidence in ways that economists increasingly worry could cause a recession. A small business survey on Tuesday showed sentiment weakening for a third straight month, fully eroding a confidence boost following Trump's November 5 election victory, and a survey of households by the New York Federal Reserve on Monday showed consumers growing more pessimistic about their finances, inflation and the job market.

In a major embarrassment for Pakistan, a senior diplomat was denied entry into the US despite having a valid visa and necessary documents, reported The News, a Pakistani media outlet. KK Wagan, the ambassador of Pakistan to Turkmenistan, was stopped by the US immigration on his arrival in Los Angeles and deported.

Quoting an unnamed official in the Pakistan foreign ministry, the report said the envoy had an ""immigration objection"".

Mr Wagan, a seasoned diplomat, was on a personal trip to Los Angeles. The report said he had a valid US visa and other travel documents.

Immigration authorities stopped Mr Wagan after he arrived in Los Angeles with officials flagging concerns over diplomatic protocol. The US officials flagged ""controversial visa references"" of Mr Wagan, though there is no clarity over the specific concerns, the report said citing diplomatic sources.

He was then asked to return from where he had arrived in Los Angeles.

Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and other top officials have been briefed on the issue, according to the report. Mr Wagan is likely to be summoned to Islamabad to give an explanation over the incident.

GeoTV, another Pakistani outlet, said their foreign office has confirmed Mr Wagan was on a private visit to Los Angeles and that the matter is being thoroughly investigated.

The incident is a major cause of embarrassment for Islamabad amid reports that US President Donald Trump would soon impose a travel ban on the country that effectively stops the entry of Pakistanis into the US.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Baloch separatists who hijacked a train with 200-plus people on board Pakistan, had stopped the train inside a tunnel by blowing up the tracks. They had then opened fire at the engine, in which the driver was injured, reported Pakistani news channel Geo News.

Security officials present on the train returned fire but failed to stop the terrorists who took control of the train, Geo News reported, quoting un-named sources.

There are 17 tunnels in that area on the railway line and due to the difficult terrain, the speed of the train is often slow. ""The train was stopped by armed men in Tunnel No 8,"" the train controller said. 

The banned Baloch Liberation Army has apparently given an ultimatum to the Pakistan government.

Their message said if their demands are not met within the given time-frame, or any military intervention is attempted, ""all prisoners of war would be destroyed and the train would be completely destroyed"".

The group has claimed that they have 214 Pakistani personnel in their custody. These include personnel from the military, paramilitary, police and intelligence agencies.

There is no word on the civilians who were on the train as well. More than 450 passengers and staff are feared to have been taken hostage, local media had reported.

Sources said that no contact could be immediately made with the train crew due to the lack of mobile and telephone networks at the location of the attack.

The local authorities in Balochistan have imposed emergency measures and all institutions have been mobilised to deal with the situation, government spokesperson Shahid Rind said, according to Pakistani daily Dawn.

The Baloch Liberation Army is the strongest of a number of insurgent groups in Pakistan that have been active in the areas bordering Afghanistan and Iran. The low-key group has suddenly stepped up their activities using new tactics to inflict high death and injury tolls and target the Pakistan army.

A 24-year-old tourist from the US state of Iowa was the last person to see Sudiksha Konanki, the 20-year-old University of Pittsburgh student who went missing from a Dominican Republic beach. Joshua Steven Ribe, who admitted to passing out drunk on the shore, claimed Ms Konanki was gone when he woke up, Dominican news outlet El Nacional reported.

Now, as a massive search enters its fourth day, her family fears she may have been kidnapped.

Ms Konanki, a pre-med student from South Riding, Virginia, was vacationing with five friends at the Riu Republica Resort in Punta Cana. Surveillance footage from Noticias SIN showed the group partying at a resort disco until 3 am before heading to the beach around 4 am. By 5:50 am, her friends left her alone with Mr Ribe, making him the last known person to see her alive.

Mr Ribe has since provided three different versions of what happened next:

Despite the conflicting accounts, police have not named him a suspect but confirmed he was cooperating with investigators.

Ms Konanki's friends waited nearly 12 hours before reporting her missing at 4 pm on Thursday, The NY Post reported.

Authorities have deployed drones, helicopters, boats, scuba divers, and all-terrain vehicles to search for the missing Indian student. Juan Salas, director of the Dominican Republic's Civil Defence, said that the chances of finding her alive are ""minimal.""

Authorities believe she may have drowned after entering the ocean in a brown bikini, as her clothes were found on a beach chaise lounge. Her father, Subbarayudu Konanki, has formally requested an expanded investigation, fearing she was kidnapped.

""It's four days, and if she was in the water, she would likely have been strewn to shore. She's not found, so we're asking them to investigate multiple options, like kidnapping or abduction,"" he told WTOP-TV.

The family also finds it unusual that Ms Konanki's phone and wallet were left with her friends, as she always carried her phone with her.

Family friend Ramprakash Krishnamanaidu said, ""If she's not in the water, they couldn't find her in the resorts, they couldn't find her in the hospitals - then where is she?""

The Dominican National Police are now interrogating multiple individuals, including Ms Konanki's friends and other resort guests. Authorities are also reviewing surveillance footage from nearby resorts.

International agencies including the FBI, DEA, Homeland Security Investigations, and University of Pittsburgh police are assisting with the case. The Indian Embassy in the Dominican Republic has taken diplomatic charge.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Elon Musk has alleged that the massive cyberattack that targeted his social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), had digital traces originating from Ukraine. Mr Musk, in an interview with Fox News, said, ""We're not sure exactly what happened, but there was a massive cyberattack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.""

The attack, which began early Monday, led to widespread outages across Asia, Europe, and North America. According to Downdetector, a site that tracks service disruptions, users reported being unable to access X for extended periods.

This is not the first time the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has blamed cyberattacks for issues on the platform. He previously attributed a similar outage to an attack last year, which coincided with a planned live-streamed interview with Donald Trump.

Mr Musk further amplified his claims by sharing a post from an X account named DogeDesigner, suggesting that the attack was part of a campaign against him. The post linked the cyberattack to recent protests against Mr Musk's leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and acts of vandalism against Tesla facilities.

Mr Musk speculated that the attack required ""tremendous resources"" and suggested it could be the work of a nation-state or a large, coordinated group.

During an interview with Fox Business, he elaborated, claiming that the computers involved in the attack had digital footprints linked to Ukraine. However, cybersecurity experts caution that attributing an attack based on IP addresses alone is unreliable, as attackers can easily mask their locations.

As X struggled to recover from the disruption, outage reports peaked at more than 40,000 users experiencing connectivity issues, according to tracking data. Many users found the platform intermittently inaccessible throughout the day.

Since Mr Musk's $44 billion takeover of Twitter in 2022, the company has drastically reduced its workforce. Technical issues have become more frequent, and Musk's reinstatement of previously banned accounts - including those spreading conspiracy theories - has drawn criticism from advocacy groups.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

A Hindu Monarchy Again?","https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ndtv-explains-nepals-return-of-the-king-movement-hindu-monarchy-again-7900064","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:07:12 GMT","

Nearly seventeen years ago - on May 28, 2008, to be exact - Nepal abolished a 239-year-old Hindu monarchy, with Gyanendra Shah as king, and brought the curtain down on a decade-long civil war that had killed over 16,000 people. The Hindu-majority nation was reborn as a federal, secular republic.

On Sunday, thousands (over 10,000 by some accounts) campaigned to turn back the clock, demanding the return of Shah amid concerns over political instability, corruption, a cost of living crisis, unemployment, and a lack of economic development.

""Come King, save the nation…"" was the refrain that rang out as Shah, who had been touring the nation, possibly to feel out the level of support, left the airport in Kathmandu.

""The country faces instability. Prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare,"" Rajindra Kunwar, 43, a teacher and a pro-monarchy protester, told AFP, ""The law applies to the public… but not politicians. That's why we need the king.""

That ""instability"" is emphasised by Nepal having had 13 governments since 2008.

First, this isn't new.

Before it was abolished, the Nepalese monarch was revered, mostly.

That slumped after Shah's power grab in 2005. Anti-monarchy protests broke out in 2006 and Shah was forced to hand over his newly-seized authority to the fledgling government.

But respect for the Hindu monarchy never fully went away.

There were periodic protests calling for the return of the king. Among the more recent, in 2020 The Record Nepal reported mass demonstrations by royalists and Hindu groups, including in the east, which is where the current Prime Minister, KP Sharma Oli is from.

And, in 2023, Kathmandu police tear gassed a mob demanding the return of the monarchy.

On Sunday those sentiments were on display again, much of it led by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, a Hindu nationalist outfit that is the fifth-largest in the House.

The Kathmandu Post has reported increased popularity for Gyanendra Shah, although political analysts in that country do not expect him to return to power.

In a nutshell, the Nepalese people are dissatisfied with their country as a republic.

International Monetary Fund data shows economic growth has declined over the past few years. Real GDP touched a high of nine per cent in 2015 before falling to under five per cent last year. Inflation, at average consumer prices, was 4.6 per cent last year.

Those welcoming Shah at the airport on Sunday said they were hoping for a change to stop their country from further deteriorating. ""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way…” 72-year-old Thir Bahadur told The Associated Press.

Former anti-monarchists are also on board.

Kulraj Shrestha, a 30-year-old carpenter who protested to remove Shah, has changed his mind and now supports the monarchy. ""The worst thing is massive corruption… politicians are not doing anything. I was in the protests that took away monarchy… but I was mistaken and the nation has further plunged. So I have changed my mind,"" he told AP.

Probably, although he has not issued a statement either way. Yet, his travelling to parts of the country suggest he is at least considering a return to the throne.

Publicly at least, Shah has called for unity and for his countrymen and women to rally for the ""defence, progress, and prosperity of the country"".

For now, it appears he is waiting and watching, possibly to see how much stronger these round of pro-monarchy protests will be and how far it may run.

Back in 2008, a Constituent Assembly, led by a Prime Minister - Pushpa Kamal Dahal, a former rebel commander - was set up and tasked with drafting a new Constitution within 48 months. And elections, that true test of a democracy, were to be held shortly after.

But prolonged political squabbling, and the April 2015 earthquake, which killed 9,000 people and caused millions of dollars of damage, meant the (extended) first Assembly gave way to a second. It wasn't till September 2015 the new Constitution was presented and approved.

The late Sushil Koirala, then the Prime Minister and who oversaw a 507-25 vote in favour, called it ""a matter of pride for all Nepalis that the 'people's Constitution has been passed"".

Nepal's first election was a further two years away; millions of Nepalese lined up to vote in a two-phase poll for national and provincial polls in May 2017.

Private yachts were moored nearby, and some of the biggest celebrities were in attendance as Saudi Arabia partially opened Neom, its ambitious $500 billion mega-city in the desert. The event was meant to showcase Saudi Arabia's vision for the future. But there are hudles. 

According to a Wall Street Journal report, the first phase of the project, Sindalah, was years behind schedule and vastly over budget. Initially projected to cost $1.3 billion, the luxury resort's price tag had ballooned to nearly $4 billion. Most notably, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman -the project's mastermind - was absent from the event. Weeks later, Neom's CEO, Nadhmi al-Nasr, was replaced.

Since its 2017 launch, Neom has consumed more than $50 billion, the report says, but its boldest ideas - such as a floating business district, a ski resort in the desert, and a 170-kilometre-long linear city - have struggled to materialise.

The Wall Street Journal accessed reports which reveal widespread financial manipulation within Neom's leadership. An internal audit found evidence that executives, with assistance from consultants McKinsey & Co., had used overly optimistic financial projections to justify surging costs. The audit cited ""deliberate manipulation"" of figures by ""certain members of management.""

The report claims that a draft board presentation from 2023 estimated that completing Neom by 2080 would require $8.8 trillion - more than 25 times Saudi Arabia's annual budget. Even the first phase, set to run until 2035, is expected to cost $370 billion.

Neom was meant to redefine urban living, with Crown Prince Salman comparing it to the Egyptian pyramids. The Line, its centrepiece, was envisioned as a futuristic city stretching 170 kilometres across the desert, housed within two parallel skyscrapers taller than the Empire State Building.

But the scale has proved overwhelming. The original plan to build 16 km of The Line by 2030 was already ambitious, requiring more glass and steel than exists in entire cities. Even that was later revised down to 2.4 km, with only a half-mile section, including a stadium - expected by 2034.

Engineering challenges and rising costs have forced compromises. The Line's 1,640-foot height makes construction difficult, and Neom officials suggested lowering it to 1,000 feet to cut costs. The Crown Prince rejected this, insisting on finding savings elsewhere.

The ski resort, Trojena, has also seen costs spiral. The Wall Street Journal, citing a 2023 review, found a $10 billion surge in expenses. To balance the books, revenue projections were reportedly inflated - hotel room rates were suddenly tripled or quadrupled to justify the investment.

Saudi officials have long insisted that Neom will eventually attract private investment. But foreign direct investment in the kingdom remains far below targets - just $26 billion in 2023, against an official 2030 goal of $100 billion per year.

Potential investors remain wary. Many are concerned about the scale and complexity of the projects, as well as the regulatory environment in Saudi Arabia. The International Monetary Fund has urged greater transparency on project spending.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg spent $13,000 (Rs 11.3 lakh) on lingerie for herself and her 26-year-old female assistant on a trip to Europe, a new memoir has claimed.

Ms Sandberg also invited the assistant to ""come to bed"" on a private jet on the way home, Sarah Wynn-Williams, a former Facebook employee, claimed in her new book titled 'Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism.'

Ms Wynn-Williams spent six years at the company before quitting in 2017.

According to Ms Wynn-Williams' memoir, Ms Sandberg and her aide switched between sleeping in each other's laps and stroking each other's hair during a long car ride throughout Europe.

Ms Sandberg allegedly told Wynn-Williams to buy lingerie for both of them and the total cost was $13,000, according to a book review in The New York Times on Monday.

The book review claimed that Ms Sandberg got extremely upset when Ms Wynn-Williams refused to join her in ""the only bed on the plane"" during a private jet journey home.

A Meta representative, however, rubbished the claims and called them ""a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations.""

The representative noted that Ms Wynn-Williams was fired eight years ago for ""poor performance and toxic behaviour.""

An internal inquiry at the time ruled that Wynn-Williams' claims of harassment were ""misleading and unfounded.""

They further implied that anti-Facebook campaigners have since paid Ms Wynn-Williams, portraying the book as a continuation of their goal.

Ms Wynn-Williams characterised CEO Mark Zuckerberg as someone who went from being obsessed with engineering and coding to becoming an executive enamoured with politics and popularity, per The Times.

The author compared Ms Sandberg and Mr Zuckerberg to the ""careless people"" from 'The Great Gatsby' - those who cause mayhem and leave others to bear the consequences.

Earlier in January, a judge sanctioned Sheryl Sandberg for deleting emails linked to the lawsuit over Facebook's Cambridge Analytica privacy issue while she was instructed to preserve the data.

The judge stated that there was evidence that Ms Sandberg deleted messages that were probably related to the shareholder litigation and used a personal account under a false identity.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

India says it has not committed to slashing import duties on US products, days after President Donald Trump announced that New Delhi had agreed to ""cut their tariffs way down"".

Only weeks into his second term, Trump has upended global trade, targeting friends and foes alike. He has also blamed all trading partners of ""unfair"" practices, and has announced reciprocal tariffs on many countries, including India, to begin from next month.

Trump once again railed at India's ""massive tariffs"" last week.

""You can't sell anything into India, it is almost restrictive,"" Trump said.

""They have agreed, by the way, they want to cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done,"" he added.

But the Indian government told a parliamentary panel that ""no commitments had been made to the US on the issue,"" a report in The Times of India newspaper said Tuesday.

The government ""has sought time until September to address the issue that is being repeatedly flagged by the American president,"" it added.

India's commerce secretary Sunil Barthwal ""said that India and the US were working towards a mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement, focusing on long-term trade cooperation instead of merely seeking immediate tariffs adjustments"".

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who visited the White House last month, has an acknowledged rapport with Trump, who said he shares a ""special bond"" with the Indian leader.

PM Modi said the world's largest and fifth-largest economies would work on a ""mutually beneficial trade agreement"" to be sealed ""very soon"".

While the United States is a crucial market for India's information technology and services sectors, Washington has made billions of dollars in new military hardware sales to New Delhi in recent years.

Trump could visit India later this year for a summit of heads of state from the Quad -- a four-way grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the United States.

About 540 Indians lured into a cyber crime network with fake job offers have been rescued from Thailand and other countries. An Indian Air Force (IAF) flight carrying 283 rescued nationals returned yesterday and a second flight will bring back the rest from Mae Sot today. At least 42 of them are from the Telugu states, said Union Minister Bandi Sanjay, sharing information about the repatriation process.

These nationals were lured with fake job offers and sold to fake call centres involved in cyber fraud in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. ""These persons were subsequently made to indulge in cybercrime and engage in other fraudulent activities in scam centres operating in regions along the Myanmar-Thailand border,"" said the Ministry of External Affairs.

The Myanmar army rescued them.

Indian embassies in Myanmar and Thailand secured the repatriation in coordination with the local authorities, the MEA said. They were brought to Mae Sot city in Thailand from where they are being flown to Delhi.

The Golden Triangle Region in Southeast Asia, where the international borders of Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar meet, is a cyber crime hotspot where such fake call centres operate.



The government said it keeps warning of such rackets that target Indians with fake job offers. It has advised people to verify the foreign employers through the Indian missions abroad, the recruiting agents, and companies before accepting any such job offer.

Last December, an agent accused of luring several young Indians to commit such crimes was arrested from Hyderabad. Kamran Haider alias Zaidi, who carried a reward of Rs 2 lakh, was caught after a 2,500-km case.

A Tennessee man was lying in bed early Monday morning when his dog accidentally shot at him. According to the Memphis Police Department, officers responded to an accidental injury call just before 4 am in the 700 block of Whitney Avenue.

The victim, Jerald Kirkwood, told police he was in bed with his girlfriend when his pet Pitbull, Oreo, jumped and inadvertently set off a firearm.

""The dog is a playful dog, and he likes to jump around and stuff like that, and it just went off,"" the man's girlfriend told FOX13.

Authorities said the dog's paw got caught in the trigger guard, discharging the gun. The bullet grazed Mr Kirkwood's upper left thigh. Officers found a spent shell casing on the front room floor.

""There was a freak incident, and the dog jumped up and caused the gun to discharge,"" the man's friend told local outlet WREG.

Police classified the case as an accidental injury. Mr Kirkwood was taken to a hospital in non-critical condition. His girlfriend, who left the scene with the gun after the incident, told FOX13 they now plan to be extra cautious with firearms at home. ""Keep the safety on or use a trigger lock,"" she said.

The Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security stresses that the ""safe and secure storage"" of firearms is one of the most essential responsibilities of gun owners. The agency advises firearms and ammunition should be securely stored to prevent access by children or unauthorised individuals. Guns should be locked, with bullets stored separately. 

Every firearm should be treated as if it is loaded. Guns should always be pointed in a safe direction, and the trigger should not be touched unless the person handling it intends to fire. Firearms should never be used under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any impairing medication.

Proper training is essential. Gun owners should understand how a firearm operates before handling it. In Tennessee, applicants must complete a Handgun Safety Course within six months before applying for a permit.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

At least one person was killed and three others were injured as Ukraine targeted Moscow in a ""massive"" overnight drone attack on Tuesday. According to Russia's Defence Ministry, as many as 337 drones were launched by Kyiv over Monday night, with 91 of them targeting the Moscow region. The attack, possibly the largest by Ukraine since the start of the war, sparked fires across Moscow, and forced the suspension of train and air travel, authorities said.

The strike on the Russian capital, hundreds of kilometres from the Ukraine border, came ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's meeting with America's top diplomat Marco Rubio in Saudi Arabia aimed at ending the three-year war and restoring support from its key benefactor, which under President Donald Trump has demanded concessions to end the three-year war.

Russia's defense ministry said its military downed a total of 337 Ukrainian drones, including 91 over the Moscow region and 126 over the Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces have been pulling back. Russia's Investigative Committee has reportedly opened a terrorism case in response to the massive drone attack.

A post shared by NDTV WORLD (@ndtvworld)

The Moscow city mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, in a Telegram post said it was the largest Ukrainian drone attack on the city. As rush hour built, he said air defences were still repelling attacks on the city, which along with the surrounding region has a population of at least 21 million and is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in Europe.

""The most massive attack of enemy UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) on Moscow has been repelled,"" Sobyanin said in a post on Telegram.

Moscow Region Governor Andrei Vorobyov said at least one person was killed and three injured, and he posted a picture of a wrecked apartment with its windows blown out. He added that drone debris damaged at least seven units in a residential building in another suburb in the southeast. He also informed that a few residents were forced to evacuate a multi-storey building in the Ramenskoye district of the Moscow region, about 50 km (31 miles) southeast of the Kremlin.

Russia's aviation watchdog said flights were suspended at all four of Moscow's airports to ensure air safety after the attacks. Two other airports, in the Yaroslavl and Nizhny Novgorod regions, both east of Moscow, were also closed.

The RIA news agency reported that a train station in the Domodedovo district, about 35km south of Moscow, was also damaged in the strike. Damage to railway tracks from drone attacks was also reported in the Moscow region, leading to the cancellation of some commuter trains.

Despite the massive attack, a report by news agency Reuters said there was no sign of panic in Moscow, where commuters went to work as normal in the central part of the city.

Russian state-controlled international news television network RT posted videos showing residential fires started by drones. 

The massive dawn drone attack unfurled just as a team of Ukrainian officials prepared to meet a US team in Saudi Arabia to seek grounds for possible peace talks in the three-year-old war, and as Russian forces try to encircle thousands of Ukrainian soldiers in the western Russian region of Kursk.

The talks in Saudi Arabia will be the most senior since a disastrous White House meeting last month, when Trump berated Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky for purported ingratitude. Since Trump's dressing down of Zelensky, Washington has suspended military aid to Ukraine as well as intelligence sharing and access to satellite imagery in a bid to force it to the negotiating table.

Though Trump said he wants to deliver peace in Ukraine, the war is heating up on the battlefield with a major Russian spring offensive in Kursk and a series of Ukrainian drone attacks deep into Russia.

The war, the biggest in Europe since World War Two, has combined grinding World War One style attrition trench and artillery warfare with the major innovation of drones. Moscow and Kyiv have both sought to buy and develop new drones, deploy them in innovative ways, and seek new ways to destroy them - from using farmers' shotguns to advanced electronic jamming systems.

Russia has developed a myriad of electronic ""umbrellas"" over Moscow and over key installations, with additional advanced internal layers over strategic buildings, and a complex web of air defences to shoot down the drones before they reach the Kremlin in the heart of the capital.

Kyiv, itself the target of repeated mass drone strikes from Russian forces, has tried to strike back against its vastly larger eastern neighbour with repeated drone strikes against oil refineries, airfields and even Russian strategic early-warning radar stations.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

A 20-year old Indian student has gone missing while on vacation in the Dominican Republic and US federal law enforcement agencies are working with authorities in the Caribbean country on the investigation in her disappearance.

Sudiksha Konanki is a citizen of India and a permanent resident of the United States. A student at the University of Pittsburgh, Konanki was reported to be vacationing with five female college friends at a resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office said in a statement Monday.

Konanki was reported missing on March 6. The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office (LCSO) said it continues to assist and support the US federal law enforcement agencies working with the Dominican National Police and others to determine Konanki's whereabouts and what may have happened to her.

Konanki, a resident of Loudoun County, Virginia, was reported missing while vacationing on a spring break trip in Punta Cana and was last seen in the early morning of March 6.

“The ongoing investigation includes wide-ranging search efforts, along with a review of surveillance video and telephone records. Interviews are also continuing with anyone who may have seen or been with Konanki before she went missing,” the LCSO statement said. It added that the LCSO has filed for a Yellow Notice (worldwide police alert for a missing person) to be issued by INTERPOL.

A report in ABC News said three Dominican officials involved in the investigation told the outlet “over the weekend that Konanki is believed to have drowned in the ocean.” The LCSO cautioned against drawing any unsubstantiated conclusions, saying there has been considerable public speculation about what may have happened to Konanki and who may be involved.

“We caution anyone from drawing any unsubstantiated conclusions and are committed to ensuring that a thorough investigation is conducted before any conclusions are reached,” it said.

The LCSO said it is hopeful for Konanki's safe return and “we are committed to supporting this investigation and her family in every way possible”.

The LCSO is working closely with federal partners at the US Department of State, FBI, DEA and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) as well as the University of Pittsburgh Police in support of the ongoing investigation by the Dominican National Police.

The report in ABC News quoted two police sources with knowledge of the investigation as saying that Konanki's clothes were discovered on a “portable beach bed close to the beach where she went missing”.

The police have found no evidence of violence, according to sources.

The ABC News report said that after going to a nightclub on the night of March 5, Konanki and a group of people went to the beach about 4 am local time on Thursday, March 6. The report quotes sources as saying that the other women travelling with Konanki went back to their hotel about 5:55 am, with security cameras capturing their return to their rooms.

“A man stayed behind with Konanki on the beach,” according to a Dominican Republic investigative police report.

“The man, whose name was not released, told police that he and Konanki went for a swim and got caught by a big wave, the police report said,” according to the ABC News report.

The man is understood to have told the police that when he got back to the beach, he threw up and went to sleep on a beach bed. “When he woke up, Konanki was nowhere to be seen,” the report said.

Sources have said that the man, who was seen in security video coming back to his hotel room at 9:55 am, is “not considered a suspect in Konanki's death"".

Officials said Konanki's friends, who were with her around the time of her disappearance, were also questioned by the police and have not been charged with crimes, the ABC News report said. PTI YAS AS AS

The Royal Air Force (RAF) is facing a shortage of pilots owing to the failure of a diversity hiring scheme, a report in The Telegraph has claimed. Such is the crunch that candidates who were previously rejected and older applicants who have experience in ""flying-related"" roles are being urged to reapply.

It was under Air Chief Marshal Sir Mike Wigston's tenure that the Air Force pledged to having 40 per cent women and 20 per cent of personnel from ethnic minorities by 2030. As the diversity hiring policies were pushed, air chiefs were told to stop choosing ""useless white male pilots"", the leaked emails showed.

Afterwards, Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton was forced to issue an apology as the recruitment bias came into the public domain. A group of 31 white male pilot trainees were held back, a review found. They subsequently received compensation while the Air Force admitted its hiring targets were 'unrealistic'.

As per the report, the RAF is suffering from a 30 per cent shortfall in the pilots at the rank of Flight Lieutenant and Squadron Leader. With Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer pledging to put ""jets in the sky"" to protect Ukraine, the lack of manpower can prove stifling.



""The RAF's availability of combat pilots has been hit by a perfect storm: including woke manipulation of recruiting practices, the revival of civilian airlines post-Covid and technical issues with training aircraft, particularly engine reliability on the Hawk T2,"" said Mark Francois, the shadow Armed Forces minister.

""All this really matters. If we are now going to see 'jets in the sky' defending any Ukrainian peace deal then we need enough trained pilots to fly them.""

According to an RAF internal briefing note titled ‘Opportunities for professional transfer to the pilot specialisation', dated March 5, personnel from other branches of RAF are being asked to reconsider their previous applications. The same document reveals a similar scheme has been unveiled to train more weapons systems operators.

US officials, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Ukrainian officials, led by Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy - Andriy Yermak have started their talks in Saudi Arabia's Jeddah.

Yermak said on Tuesday that discussions with the US delegation in the Saudi port city of Jeddah had begun positively.  

""The meeting with the US team started very constructively, we continue our work,"" Yermak, who was attending the most senior meeting with US officials, said on social media.

Ukraine wants peace and is ready to negotiate to end the war, a top advisor to President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday as he entered talks with US counterparts in Saudi Arabia.

""We are ready to do everything to achieve peace,"" Yermak told reporters.

The US-Ukraine peace talks follow last month's White House talks when US President Donald Trump and Zelensky clashed, and took bilateral relations to an all time low. Trump raised his voice at Zelensky and said that he should be more grateful for the US aid given to Ukraine to fight Russia. Meanwhile, US Vice President JD Vance also berated Zelensky and called him “disrespectful”.

Zelensky hopes the talks in Jeddah will revive “pragmatic” ties with the US after the meeting with Trump ended badly last month.

Ukraine launched its biggest drone attack on Russia overnight , deploying 91 drones, killing one, closing airports and causing diversions of dozens of flights.

Rubio said, ""We have to understand the Ukrainian position and just have a general idea of what concessions they'd be willing to make, because you're not going to get a ceasefire and an end to this war unless both sides make concessions”.

Trump's deal will be discussed in the meeting, as the key to US support and military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded Ukraine 3 years ago. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

US President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he would buy a ""brand new Tesla"" tomorrow morning in a show of support for Elon Musk, ""a truly great American"". In a post on Truth Social, Trump  praised his ally Musk and called out ""radical left lunatics"" for going against Tesla and its CEO Musk.

""To Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans, Elon Musk is 'putting it on the line' in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform just after midnight on Tuesday.

""But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's ""baby,"" in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,"" Trump said.

The US President alleged that a similar attempt was made on him during the 2024 Presidential Ballot Box.

""I'm going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American. Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???""



Elon Musk was quick to reply and thank the President. Sharing a screenshot of Trump's post, Musk wrote: ""Thank you, President!""

The President's post comes amid ongoing protests against Tesla over Musk's role in the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). People across the US have been seen holding banners ""Elon must go away"", calling for ""Tesla takedown"". Tesla facilities across the US witnessed majorly peaceful protests, barring a few that turned violent.

Tesla shares on Monday closed after a 15 per cent decline. In the last month, Tesla shares dropped by over 30 per cent. This is led by uncertainty over Trump's import tariffs and threats.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

A former Amazon employee, among the first to work for the e-commerce giant, has shared his work experience and his connections with founder Jeff Bezos. Steve Yegge, 56, began his career at Amazon in 1998 as a technical programme manager, four years after Mr Bezos launched the business.

Speaking to Business Insider, Mr Yegge discussed how he joined Amazon and worked on a ""secret project"" that the company's millionaire founder had commissioned. ""I found Amazon could be a horrible place to work,"" Mr Yegge said, looking back on his time there.

He disliked Amazon's workplace culture, for workers would refrain from requesting leaves of absence due to ""this pressure that everybody had to work all the time.""

He called the Amazon offices ""dark and dingy,"" but said the vibe was amazing regardless of the unattractive setting.

""Once you stepped into the building, there was a crackle in the air,"" Mr Yegge remarked.

Despite having a bad experience at Amazon, Mr Yegge had a lot of respect for the company's founder and said he ""really liked"" him.

""I didn't like working at Amazon, but I actually really liked Jeff,"" Mr Yegge said, adding he was a ""hands-on leader"" who had an ""unmistakable magnetism to him.""

Mr Bezos was occasionally blind to issues in the office because he was so ""focused on the mission"", Mr Yegge said.

He added that working with the billionaire and his leadership team was ""normally calm and serious with a sense of urgency"".

Mr Bezos would ""sometimes laugh in their faces"" when others voiced concerns to him. People around him are ""very cautious"" with their language, Mr Yegge added.

Although Mr Yegge criticised Amazon's office culture, he clarified that the company's commercial operations had nothing to do with his decision to cut ties with it.

He is still a customer of Amazon and ""don't boycott them because of their practices"".

A court in Dhaka has ordered the seizure of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Dhanmondi residence, 'Sudasadhan', and some other properties owned by her family members, who are in exile in India.

At the same time, the court ordered the seizure of 124 bank accounts belonging to her family, an official said.

Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Zakir Hossain Ghalib issued the order on Tuesday following an application by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).

Sheikh Hasina's husband, the late nuclear scientist MA Wazed Miah, was nicknamed Sudha Miah. The house, 'Sudhasadan, was named after him.

In addition to Sheikh Hasina, some other properties have been seized, owned by her son Sajib Wazed Joy, daughter Saima Wazed Putul, sister Sheikh Rehana, and her daughters, Tulip Siddique and Radwan Mujib Siddique.

On February 6, Bangladesh's Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a strong protest with the Indian Government over the ""false and fabricated"" comments and statements continuously being made in different platforms, including social media, by the country's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina aimed at instigating instability.

Through a protest note handed over to the Acting High Commissioner of India in Dhaka, the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that it conveyed the deep concern, disappointment and serious reservation of the Government of Bangladesh, as such statements are hurting the sentiments of the people in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh has requested the Government of India to immediately take appropriate measures, in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, to stop Hasina from making such ""false, fabricated and incendiary statements"" using social media and other communications while she is in India, the statement said.

On August 5, a student-led movement ousted Bangladesh's Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, after weeks of protests and clashes that killed over 600 people. Hasina, 77, fled to India, and an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed.

Police, responding to an emergency call, found four bodies at the Reddy home.

A Hyderabad couple died by suicide after killing their children - 13 and 10 years old.

In a note left behind, the couple wrote in Telugu, ""I had no other option but to end my life. Please forgive me. I have been struggling in my career and suffering mentally and physically. I have been suffering from diabetes, nerve, and kidney-related issues.""

Sources told NDTV Chandrasekhar Reddy, 44, and his wife, Kavitha, 35, laboured through financial hardship brought on by Mr Reddy having been unemployed since 2023.

Mr Reddy, the police said, had earlier worked as a junior lecturer in a private college.

Their home was on the third floor of an independent house. When NDTV visited the house it was as the Reddy family left it - in good condition, with children's bicycles leaning against one wall of the terrace and freshly washed clothes strung up to dry. There was also a football.

But now, tragically, left with little or no money and no hope apparent, Mr Reddy and Ms Kavitha resorted to the cruelest of actions - killing their children and taking their own lives.

Police, alerted by a call to the 100 emergency line, found their bodies at their home in the city's Habsiguda area on Monday night.

Mr Reddy and Ms Kavitha were found in separate rooms, while their children were found in their respective bedrooms. A preliminary inquiry suggests the couple strangled their son, 10-year-old Vishwan Reddy, and daughter, Shrita Reddy, before hanging themselves.

The boy was studying in Class V and the girl in Class IX.

Both Mr Reddy and Ms Kavitha were from Telangana's Kalwakurthy, and both had family in Hyderabad. Their deaths, and that of their children, underline the fragile daily lives of the vast majority of India's 1.44 billion-strong population - many of whom try desperately to make ends meet or, as in this case, deal with the physical and mental trauma of long-term unemployment.

The bodies have been stored at the city's Gandhi Hospital and post-mortems have been ordered.

In Western Australia, researchers have made a significant discovery: they have found the oldest meteorite impact crater in the world. It is estimated that a huge meteorite struck the Earth 3.5 billion years ago, creating the North Pole Dome Site in the Pilbara region.

The discovery, which was made by researchers from the Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) and Curtin University's School of Earth and Planetary Sciences, is anticipated to provide fresh insight into the first stages of life on Earth. There is minimal flora in the crater, which is a huge, bare area of red rock.

The study, published in Nature Communications, reveals that the impact would have had a profound effect on the Earth's surface, potentially creating an environment conducive to the emergence of life.

Study co-lead Professor Tim Johnson, from Curtin University, said in a statement the discovery significantly challenged previous assumptions about our planet's ancient history.

""Before our discovery, the oldest impact crater was 2.2 billion years old, so this is by far the oldest known crater ever found on Earth,"" Professor Johnson said.

Researchers discovered the crater thanks to 'shatter cones', distinctive rock formations only formed under the intense pressure of a meteorite strike.

The shatter cones at the site, about 40 kilometres west of Marble Bar in WA's Pilbara region, were formed when a meteorite slammed into the area at more than 36,000 km/h.

This would have been a major planetary event, resulting in a crater more than 100 km wide that would have sent debris flying across the globe.

""We know large impacts were common in the early solar system from looking at the Moon,"" Professor Johnson said.

""Until now, the absence of any truly ancient craters means they are largely ignored by geologists.

""This study provides a crucial piece of the puzzle of Earth's impact history and suggests there may be many other ancient craters that could be discovered over time.""","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

In a bizarre courtroom occurrence during the trial of former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, a prosecutor accidentally played the video of a naked woman unrelated to the case. The gaffe, which elicited laughter in the room, was captured on camera.

Prosecutor Marlene Orjuela initially played a video of a dwarf person dancing to music while carrying a liquor can. Shortly after, an AI-enhanced video of a nude woman was shown on screen.

Realising her mistake, Ms Orjuela promptly stopped the video and apologised for accidentally selecting a different clip rather than playing from a series of recorded phone calls related to Mr Uribe's case. 

“Your Honour, my apologies. We wanted to show everything that [Diego Cadena] had sent, but we didn't foresee that this would happen,” Ms Orjuela said. 

“We have 57 files consisting of videos and audio recordings,” Ms Orjuela's colleague Luz Mireya Lopez added.

Ms Orjuela struggled to remain calm as the court and the victims' attorneys started to laugh. She said, ""My apologies, Your Honour, but, well… it's just that…”

Alvaro Uribe remained stone-faced through the entire comical mishap.

Mr Uribe has been charged with witness tampering and bribery. The 71-year-old leader has also been accused of ""offering cash or other benefits"" to witnesses to undermine a political rival digging into the former President's family ties to right-wing paramilitary groups. 

If found guilty of bribery and procedural fraud, Mr Uribe may spend up to 12 years in prison, plus eight years for procedural fraud.

Mr Uribe has denied all charges against him and has accused Colombia's chief prosecutor's office of “political vengeance.” The next hearing is set for Tuesday.

Alvaro Uribe served as Colombia's President between 2002 and 2010. Known for being tough on the left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) combatants, Mr Uribe is still a prominent voice on Colombia's right. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Dark Storm, a pro-Palestinian hacking group, has claimed responsibility for hacking X (formerly Twitter) on Monday.

The attack caused a major global outage, with over 40,000 users affected. The platform remained down for several hours before being restored. X CEO Elon Musk said the platform suffered a massive cyberattack. ""It was done with a lot of resources,"" Musk wrote, suggesting that ""either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved.""

Who are Dark Storm?

Dark Storm Team is a pro-Palestinian hacktivist group known for launching cyberattacks against entities they perceive as Israel supporters. Their operations include Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and other forms of cyber warfare, targeting governments, infrastructure, and organisations aligned with Israeli interests.

Dark Storm isn't just driven by ideology, it also sells cyberattack services for profit. The group offers DDoS attacks on websites, both secure and vulnerable, along with database breaches, as per their Telegram channel.

Dark Storm Activities

How Did Dark Storm Attack X?

Cybersecurity experts identified the X attack as a multi-layered Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. Hackers flooded X's servers with an overwhelming volume of fake requests, crippling the platform's ability to function.

Unlike a simple traffic surge, the attack used a botnet - a network of hijacked devices - including compromised personal computers, smart cameras, and routers. These devices, controlled remotely by the hackers, helped sustain the attack and make it harder to stop.

X has yet to confirm whether Dark Storm was behind the attack.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

A Democratic U.S. senator who just visited Ukraine said on Monday the Trump administration's suspension of intelligence-sharing had lessened Kyiv's defenses against Russia, and dismissed Trump advisor Elon Musk calling him a ""traitor.""

""One hundred percent,"" Senator Mark Kelly told reporters when asked if he had heard during his visit of specific attacks or incidents that would have been affected if Ukrainians had had the intelligence.

""If there's stuff they don't get, that they need, that changes their ability to defend against attacks,"" Kelly said. ""And those attacks happened on Friday night, on Saturday, when I was there.""

The Arizona senator did not provide further details.

Since Thursday, Ukrainian authorities have reported Russian attacks including damage to Ukrainian energy and gas infrastructure, and an assault with missiles and drones in which at least 14 people were killed and 37 wounded. Russia launched more air strikes overnight Monday on Kyiv, Ukrainian authorities said.

Kelly, a member of the Armed Services Committee, was in Ukraine from Saturday to Sunday to show support for its people and assess the situation there.

The Trump administration announced last week that it had halted intelligence-sharing with Ukraine, piling pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to cooperate with U.S. President Donald Trump in convening peace talks with Russia.

That suspension followed a halt to U.S. military aid to Kyiv after a White House meeting where Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who opposed aid to Ukraine during his Senate term, clashed publicly with Zelenskiy.

Zelenskiy was in Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a day before talks between Ukrainian and U.S. officials that Washington hopes will deliver substantial progress towards ending Russia's war with Ukraine.

Assistance for the government in Kyiv, once something strongly supported by dozens of Trump's Republicans as well as Democrats, has become far more partisan since Trump began his second term on January 20.

Democratic support for Kyiv has stayed strong, but Republicans have wavered, with Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson saying that there was ""no appetite"" for another bill funding assistance.

Underscoring the political divide, Musk called Kelly a ""traitor"" on X.com, a social media platform Musk owns, after Kelly posted that he had visited Ukraine during the weekend and accused Trump of trying to weaken Ukraine ahead of peace talks.

Kelly, a former astronaut who served as a combat pilot during a 25-year Navy career, commented to reporters when asked about Musk, ""Obviously, he's not a serious guy.""

On X, Kelly had responded: ""Traitor? Elon, if you don't understand that defending freedom is a basic tenet of what makes America great and keeps us safe, maybe you should leave it to those of us who do.""

Kelly's trip was his third visit to Ukraine since 2023.

Russia's army said Tuesday it had retaken 12 settlements from Ukraine in the western Kursk region, where Moscow has launched a rapid counteroffensive to take back land seized by Kyiv last year.

Ukraine has been losing ground in the Russian border region -- swathes of which it has held since August 2024 and which it hoped to use as leverage in peace negotiations -- for several weeks. 

The announcement came as Ukrainian and US diplomats sat down for talks on how to end the conflict in Saudi Arabia. 

""The units of the 'North' group of troops during the offensive liberated 12 settlements ... and more than 100 square kilometres of the Kursk region territory,"" Russia's defence ministry said in a statement. 

Moscow said it had retaken the villages of Argonom, Bogdanovka, Bondarevka, Dmitryukov, Zazulevka, Ivashkovsky, Kolmakov, Kubatkin, Martynovka, Mikhaylovka, Pravda and Yuzhny. 

The villages lie to the north, east and south of Sudzha -- the main regional town under Ukrainian control. 

Russia's advance in the area comes as the US has cut off Ukraine's access to intelligence sharing and satellite data in a bid to force it to negotiate.  

Ukraine said Monday that it was reinforcing its troops in Kursk region, insisting there was no threat of encirclement of its troops. 

Russian military bloggers have said Moscow's forces have crawled through underground tunnels and pipelines -- including gas pipes -- near Sudzha to surprise Ukrainian forces. 

Russian state television published footage of a soldier in a gas mask with an air pack on his back squeezing into a small hole from an underground tunnel to enter a pipeline, with another soldier saying it has been effective as ""the enemy cannot see us.""

Porter, a former consumer protection attorney, enters a crowded field that Kamala Harris may eventually enter

The former Democratic House member Katie Porter announced on Tuesday that she is entering California's 2026 gubernatorial contest, joining a crowded field of candidates that could be upended if former vice-president Kamala Harris joins the race.

Porter, who became a social media celebrity by brandishing a whiteboard at congressional hearings while grilling CEOs, promised in a campaign launch video to be an aggressive counterweight to Donald Trump's administration at a time when the heavily Democratic state has clashed with the White House over issues from water management to immigrant rights.

“In Congress, I held the Trump administration's feet to the fire when they hurt Americans. As governor, I won't ever back down when Trump hurts Californians – whether he's holding up disaster relief, attacking our rights or our communities, or screwing over working families to benefit himself and his cronies,” Porter said.

The contest to replace the term-limited incumbent Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, has already lured a large scrum of announced and likely candidates.

Harris, a former state attorney general and US senator, has not ruled out seeking the governorship since she left Washington in January after a failed presidential bid. Porter is friendly with Harris and has indicated she would step aside if the former vice-president joins the race. In 2012, Harris, then California's attorney general, appointed Porter to be the state's independent bank monitor in a multibillion-dollar nationwide mortgage settlement.

If Harris enters the race, “there are very few politicians who would want to take her on”, said Jack Pitney, a Claremont McKenna College political scientist. “She'd be likely to win the Democratic nomination, and Democrats are likely to win the governorship.”

Porter, who made an unsuccessful run for US Senate last year, ultimately losing to Adam Schiff, and also is known for her small-dollar fundraising prowess, becomes one of the best-known candidates, joining the former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and the current lieutenant governor, Eleni Kounalakis, among others, on the Democratic side.

Democrats are expected to easily hold the governor's mansion in a state where they outnumber registered Republicans by nearly two to one. Republicans have not won a statewide election in California in nearly two decades.

On the GOP side, the Riverside county sheriff, Chad Bianco, last month became the first major Republican to announce a bid to replace Newsom, whose term runs through early January 2027. He blamed Democrats for the ongoing homeless crisis and runaway housing prices.

Even if Harris gets in the race, the state's open primary system can be unpredictable – all candidates appear on a single ballot, regardless of party, and only the top two vote-getters advance to the November general election. Trump-aligned candidates could enter on the GOP side, generating conservative interest, or a wealthy candidate could emerge with the funds to rattle the expected order.

“These open primaries are hard to handicap,” said the Democratic consultant Andrew Acosta. “It just makes it harder to predict.”

Porter, a progressive favorite, created an online backlash after losing the 2024 Senate race, when she faulted “billionaires spending millions to rig this election”. She finished third in the primary – behind Democrat and eventual winner Adam Schiff and Republican Steve Garvey – and did not advance to the November election.

Some likened her words to Trump's baseless claims of election fraud in 2020. Porter later clarified her initial statement to say she didn't believe the California vote count or election process had been compromised but she didn't recant her earlier remarks. Rigged, she said in a follow-up, “means manipulated by dishonest means”.

She has been an active fundraiser since leaving her southern California House district in January and returned to teaching at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law.

In 2018 Porter, an Elizabeth Warren protege and former consumer protection attorney, beat a two-term incumbent Republican in the longtime conservative stronghold Orange county for her US House seat.

She became known in Congress for her unsparing interrogations of business leaders and other committee witnesses, often using her whiteboard to break down complex figures while using plainspoken language to assail corporate greed.

Porter said in her video announcing her campaign for governor that “I first ran for office to hold Trump accountable. I feel that same call to serve now to stop him from hurting Californians.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

High-stakes vote fell along party lines, with just one Republican opposing it and one Democrat supporting it

House Republicans pulled off a near party-line vote on Tuesday to pass their controversial funding bill to curb the looming government shutdown, shipping it off to the Senate, where it still will face an uphill battle to pass.

The Trump-backed bill passed 217 to 213, with the Kentucky representative Thomas Massie casting the sole Republican “no” vote, joining all almost all House Democrats who had come out hard against it for slashing social programs and granting the Trump administration broader federal powers. The Democrat Jared Golden of Maine joined Republicans in backing the measure.

The stopgap bill, revealed by House Republican leadership over the weekend, would fund the government through September and carves $13bn from non-defense spending while adding $6bn to military budgets and preserving a $20bn IRS funding freeze – priorities embraced by Donald Trump but denounced by Democrats as an assault on vulnerable Americans.

The vice-president, JD Vance, in a Tuesday huddle with Republicans on the Hill said the blame would fall squarely on the Republicans should they fail to pass the measure, according to Politico.

The House heads to recess later this week, leaving lawmakers in the Senate with a take-it-or-leave it scenario.

The bill's priorities align closely with Trump's agenda, particularly its provisions that could grant the administration broader authority to redirect funds between programs – a power Democrats fear could allow significant reshaping of federal priorities without congressional approval.

House Republicans were rushing to pass the bill before Thursday, when they would then hand the measure off to the Senate before heading home for a week-and-a-half long recess.

Still, the Senate presents another hurdle, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority but need 60 votes to pass the legislation. At least eight Democratic senators would need to cross party lines for the bill to advance, assuming all Republican senators except Rand Paul, from Kentucky, who is expected to oppose it, vote in favor.

That's a hard sell for the Democrats, who are facing intense pressure from within their party and constituency to resist Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk's unilateral cuts to federal agencies, which have eliminated more than 100,000 jobs.

And unlike their House counterparts, Senate Democrats appear divided on the measure. Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania indicated potential support, stating that a shutdown would be “chaos” and that he would “never vote for chaos”.

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon also said he was reluctant to vote against it, saying: “Shutdowns are a bad idea. I'm not a shutdown guy.”

However, other Democratic senators, including Michigan's Elissa Slotkin, are not supporting the bill and are demanding assurances that “the money is spent the way Congress intends” before lending their support.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Officials have begun large-scale destruction of classified documents, including using shredders and ‘burn bags'

Officials at the US Agency for International Development (USAid) have begun a large-scale destruction of classified documents at their headquarters in the Ronald Reagan building in Washington DC including with shredders and using “burn bags”, according to an internal email seen by the Guardian.

The email, sent by the acting USAid secretary, Erica Y Carr, instructs staff on procedures for clearing “classified safes and personnel documents” through shredding and the use of “burn bags” marked “SECRET” throughout the day on Tuesday.

“Shred as many documents first, and reserve the burn bags for when the shredder becomes unavailable or needs a break,” Carr wrote in the email, which provides detailed instructions on how to properly seal and label the burn bags.

The timing of this document purge comes amid ongoing controversy over what is essentially the shuttering of USAid following the Trump administration's attempts to reshape the independent agency through the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).

Doge is headed by Elon Musk, the world's richest man, and he has been tasked with slashing the number of jobs at the federal government and the amount of money it spends. Amid the huge turmoil that has gripped the US government as the Musk-led Doge carries out its activities, USAid has been among the worst-hit government agencies.

The huge cuts at USAid have affected projects across the globe as vast numbers of projects are paused, shuttered or have their funding slashed. There has been widespread outcry at the move from USAid workers but also across the international development sector as they warn of the detrimental impact it will have on some of the world's most vulnerable populations.

When federal agencies are dissolved or restructured, their records are typically transferred to successor agencies or the National Archives and Records Administration (Nara) in accordance with the Federal Records Act (FRA). During the US's hasty exit out of Afghanistan in 2021, Nara sent a reminder to safely and lawfully discard sensitive documents.

But compliance with the FRA in this situation is deeply in question, since the law explicitly prohibits the destruction of government records before their designated retention period – typically a minimum of three years. There's also lingering concern that it risks permanently eliminating evidence needed for ongoing Freedom of Information Act (Foia) requests and future oversight investigations.

USAid's office of the inspector general last year announced that it had initiated an investigation on agency oversight of Musk's Starlink terminals being sent to and used by the government of Ukraine.

Democratic members of the Senate foreign relations committee sent a letter to the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, in February demanding answers about Doge's access to USAid headquarters and agency records, though they did not specifically address potential document destruction.

It's unclear whether proper records management protocols are being followed during this process, or if documents that should be preserved are being destroyed.

“If you need additional burn bags or sharpie markers, please let me or the SEC InfoSec Team know,” the email said.

The state department did not respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

New York fired more than 2,000 prison guards on Monday for failing to return to work after an illegal work stoppage – carried out amid fallout over the high-profile deaths of two detained people as well as reports of violence by guards.

But the state said enough officers had come back on the job to declare the wildcat strike over.

“After 22 days of an illegal strike, the governor and I are happy to report it is now ended,” the New York corrections department commissioner, Daniel Martuscello, said during a virtual press briefing.

The state and the guards' union struck a new deal to end the strike this weekend, but it was contingent on at least 85% of staff returning to work by Monday morning. Although the number returning fell short of the 85% goal, Martuscello said the state would honor the deal's overtime provisions, along with some others.

He said New York's national guard would remain in place at prisons in a support position while the department undertakes an aggressive recruiting campaign to attract additional employees. About 10,000 security staff are available to work in prisons across the state, he said, down from about 13,500 before the wildcat strike.

“Termination letters have been sent to over 2,000 officers who remained on strike. Officers and sergeants who did not have preapproved medical leave and didn't return by this morning, 6.45am deadline, have been terminated effective immediately,” Martuscello said.

An email seeking comment was sent to the guards' union, the New York State Correctional Officers & Police Benevolent Association.

Guards upset over working conditions began illegally walking off the job on 17 February at many state prisons, forcing New York governor, Kathy Hochul, to send national guard troops in to maintain operations. Inmates have complained about deteriorating conditions behind bars since the walkout.

And the death of a 22-year-old man at the beginning of March at a prison near Utica is being investigated by a special prosecutor.

The walkout violates a state law barring strikes by most public employees and was not sanctioned by the guards' union. Two previous deals aimed at ending the strike failed to coax enough guards back to end the crisis.

Like the other deals, this one addresses a key complaint of the striking guards with a 90-day suspension of a provision of a state law that limits the use of solitary confinement. Guards will work 12-hour shifts, and the state corrections department will not discipline officers who participated in the strike if they returned by the Monday deadline.

Multiple inmates have died since the walkouts began, though it was unclear if strike-related prison conditions played a role in the deaths.

The Onondaga county district attorney, William Fitzpatrick, is investigating the death of Messiah Nantwi at Mid-State correctional facility on 1 March as a special prosecutor. Authorities have declined to provide details, but a court filing by the attorney general's office said there was “probable cause to believe” that as many as nine correctional officers either caused or could be implicated in his death.

Fifteen prison staffers were placed on leave following Nantwi's death.

It is the second criminal investigation into a state prison inmate death in recent months. In February, six guards were charged with murder in the December death of Robert Brooks, who was incarcerated at the Marcy correctional facility, across the street from the Mid-State prison.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Democratic senator and former combat pilot dismisses billionaire who wrote ‘You are a traitor' after Ukraine trip

Elon Musk is “not a serious guy”, said Mark Kelly, the US fighter pilot and astronaut turned Arizona Democratic senator, after the Tesla owner and close Donald Trump ally called him a “traitor” for visiting Ukraine in support of its fight against Russia's invading troops.

On Sunday, Kelly posted to social media photos of his visit and a lengthy statement.

“Just left Ukraine,” he said. “What I saw proved to me we can't give up on the Ukrainian people. Everyone wants this war to end, but any agreement has to protect Ukraine's security and can't be a giveaway to [Vladimir] Putin,” referring to the Russian president who ordered his military to invade Ukraine in February 2022.

Musk, who owns X, on which Kelly posted, responded: “You are a traitor.”

Kelly said: “Traitor? Elon, if you don't understand that defending freedom is a basic tenet of what makes America great and keeps us safe, maybe you should leave it to those of us who do.”

In Washington on Monday, Kelly was asked about Musk's charge.

“Obviously, he's not a serious guy,” Kelly said.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the latter has received substantial aid from the US and Europe. Kelly's recent visit was his third. It came amid international consternation over Trump's abandonment of Kyiv and courting of Moscow.

The president and aides have said they want peace but have taken controversial steps, including starting talks without Ukraine; hectoring the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in a tempestuous White House meeting; suspending military aid and intelligence sharing.

On Monday, Kelly shared further thoughts.

“I just got back from 36 hours in Ukraine,” he wrote. “Wanted to share a story from while we were there. At a hospital, we talked with a wounded Ukrainian soldier. I asked him what he thought about the change in US policy. His response in English was, ‘What the fuck.'”

In Washington, Kelly was asked if he had heard in Ukraine of attacks or incidents that would have been affected if Ukrainians had had access to US intelligence.

“One hundred per cent,” Kelly said. “If there's stuff they don't get, that they need, that changes their ability to defend against attacks. And those attacks happened on Friday night, on Saturday, when I was there.”

Peace talks resumed in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, this time with Ukrainian involvement.

On Monday night, Kelly spoke to MSNBC.

“When I was 22 years old,” he said, “as I was getting sworn in to the United States navy, I swore an oath to protect and defend the constitution. I have believed that oath my entire life. I flew in combat in the first Gulf war. I served in the United States navy for 25 years. I spent 15 years at Nasa, risking my life flying the space shuttle.”

Referring to Musk's oversight of sweeping cuts to federal budgets and staffing, he added: “The only oath I can think of that maybe Elon has sworn is an oath to his own checking account, to his pocket book, an oath maybe to ruining the lives of veterans.

“I had veterans in my office last week who, after really good performance reports, found out that Elon Musk fired them for poor performance. He was ruining these people's lives … they did not deserve to get fired by an email from an unelected billionaire.”

The Vermont independent senator Bernie Sanders was among those to rebuke Musk for his attack on Kelly, telling CNN: “It is really unspeakable. It really is. I think the American people are sick and tired of the wealthiest guy in the world running the United States government and calling, in this case, a guy who put his life on the line to defend us, a traitor. That's beyond the pale.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Millions of children could lose free school meals as food costs rise, warns School Nutrition Association president

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has slashed two programs that provided more than $1bn for schools and food banks to purchase food from local farms and ranchers.

About $660m of those funds were contained in the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program, which provided funds to schools and child care facilities but is now being eliminated.

The rest were part of the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provided funds to local food banks and other organizations. The USDA unfroze funds for existing agreements, but a second round of funding in fiscal year 2025 has been nixed.

“These proposals would cause millions of children to lose access to free school meals at a time when working families are struggling with rising food costs,” said a statement from Shannon Gleave, the president of the School Nutrition Association. “Meanwhile, short-staffed school nutrition teams, striving to improve menus and expand scratch-cooking, would be saddled with time-consuming and costly paperwork created by new government inefficiencies.”

The USDA had announced $1.13bn in funding for both of the programs this past December. State officials learned of the cuts on Friday.

They come as Donald Trump's second presidential administration has aggressively cut federal spending and imposed tariffs, which collectively have forced food organizations and farmers to cut staff as well as halt investments.

Food banks have already been seeing demands due to rising food prices, and Republicans in Congress are pushing to make significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap).

A USDA spokesperson told Politico that funding for the programs chosen for elimination “will be terminated following 60-day notification”. The spokesperson said the programs were created by executive orders issued during Joe Biden's presidency and “no longer effectuate the goals of the agency”.

The spokesperson also said other agreements that were previously in place “still have substantial financial resources remaining [and] will continue to be in effect for the remainder of the period of performance”.

The Massachusetts governor, Maura Healey, criticized the Trump White House for cutting programs which would have provided $12m in food-related funding for schools and food banks in her state.

In a press release, she said Trump and his billionaire spending-reduction adviser Elon Musk “have declared that feeding children and supporting local farmers are no longer ‘priorities', and it's just the latest terrible cut with real impact on families across Massachusetts”.

“There is nothing ‘appropriate' about it,” she said. “Trump and Musk are continuing to withhold essential funding in violation of court orders, and our children, farmers and small businesses are bearing the brunt of it.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Trump administration has axed $400m in federal funding to Columbia and detained student activist Mahmoud Khalil

The Trump administration said on Tuesday that Columbia University was “refusing to help” the Department of Homeland Security identify people for arrest on campus, after immigration authorities detained a prominent Palestinian activist and recent Columbia graduate over the weekend.

The Trump White House's press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said on Tuesday the administration had given the university names of multiple individuals it accused of “pro-Hamas activity”, reiterating the administration's intention to deport activists associated with pro-Palestinian protests.

“Columbia University has been given the names of other individuals who have engaged in pro-Hamas activity, and they are refusing to help DHS identify those individuals on campus,” Leavitt said in a press briefing. “And as the president said very strongly in his statement yesterday, he is not going to tolerate that.”

Khalil, a permanent US resident who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests at the university last year, was detained on Saturday night in an unprecedented move that prompted widespread outrage and alarm from free speech advocates.

Trump described the arrest this week as the “first arrest of many to come”.

The federal immigration authorities who arrested Khalil reportedly said they were acting on a state department order to revoke the green card granting him permanent residency.

As of Tuesday, Khalil had not been charged with any crime. However, two people with knowledge of the matter told the New York Times that the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was relying on a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 that gives him broad power to expel foreigners if they give him “reasonable ground to believe” their presence in the US has “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences”. Zeteo also reported that Rubio himself “personally signed off on the arrest”.

As of Monday morning, Khalil was being held at an immigration detention facility near Jena, Louisiana.

On Monday evening, a federal judge in Manhattan barred his deportation pending a hearing in his case set for Wednesday.

The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights have joined Khalil's legal team, led by his attorney, Amy Greer. Greer stated on Monday that she had spoken with Khalil and that he was “healthy and his spirits are undaunted by his predicament”.

On Tuesday, 13 members of Congress – led by the Palestinian-American US representative Rashida Tlaib – issued a letter demanding his immediate release.

The arrest came just days after Donald Trump's second presidential administration canceled $400m in funding to Columbia University over what it described as the college's failure to protect students from antisemitic harassment on campus.

On Monday, the US education department's civil rights office followed the cuts to Columbia with new warnings to 60 other colleges and universities indicating that they may face “enforcement actions” for allegations of antisemitic harassment as well as discrimination on their campuses.

A department statement said it sent the admonitions under the agency's authority to enforce Title VI of the federal Civil Rights Act, which “prohibits any institution that receives federal funds from discriminating on the basis of race, color, and national origin”.

“National origin includes shared (Jewish) ancestry,” the statement said.

The letters stem from an executive order signed by Trump shortly after retaking office in January that purported to “combat antisemitism”. A fact sheet corresponding to Trump's order suggested deporting international students involved in pro-Palestinian protests.

In a statement on Monday, the education secretary, Linda McMahon, said her department was “deeply disappointed that Jewish students studying on elite US campuses continue to fear for their safety amid the relentless antisemitic eruptions that have severely disrupted campus life for more than a year”.

“University leaders must do better,” the former executive for the WWE professional wrestling promotion said. “US colleges and universities benefit from enormous public investments funded by US taxpayers.

“That support is a privilege, and it is contingent on scrupulous adherence to federal anti-discrimination laws.”

Trump had recently threatened to halt all federal funding for any college or school that allows “illegal protests” and vowed to imprison “agitators”. The president accused Columbia University of repeatedly failing to protect students from antisemitic harassment.

The institution has been a focal point for campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza. Demonstrations erupted last spring both across the US and internationally, with students calling for an end to the US's support to the Israeli military as well as demanding that their universities divest from companies with ties to Israel.

At Columbia, such protests led to mass arrests, suspensions and the resignation of the university's president at the time.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Putin may well stick to previous demands over Ukrainian elections and a rejection of European peacekeeping forces

Suddenly the ball is in Russia's court. The flow of US intelligence and military aid to Ukraine is to resume – and the Kremlin is being asked to agree to a 30-day ceasefire that Kyiv has already told the Americans it will sign up to.

It is a dizzying turnaround from the Oval Office row between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump and the apparent abandonment of the White House's strategy to simply pressurise Ukraine into agreeing to a peace deal. Now, for the first time, Russia is being asked to make a commitment, though it is unclear what will follow if it does sign up.

Announcing the peace proposal in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said that he hoped Russia would accept a peace agreement “so we can get to the second phase of this, which is real negotiations”.

That may leave plenty of room for interpretation. Russia has also been pushing for a ceasefire, though the Kremlin had wanted that to be followed by elections in Ukraine, before any full negotiation about territory and Kyiv's future security.

Ukraine, meanwhile, will want strong security guarantees to avoid a resumption of the war, involving European peacekeepers on the ground, which Russia has so far said it is against. An open question, perhaps, is whether peacekeepers could enter Ukraine during a ceasefire period, but this is speculative.

Until Tuesday's discussions between US and Ukrainian delegations bore fruit, the battlefield dynamics did not appear to favour a ceasefire. Ukraine's decision to launch a drone attack into Russia on Monday night was a clear demonstration that its military capacity had not yet been significantly dented by the pause in supply of US military intelligence. It was also an aggressive effort to put pressure on Moscow to agree a peace.

Russia's defence ministry said Ukraine had attacked with 337 drones, 91 of which were aimed at Moscow and the surrounding region. Three people were reported to have been killed, all four of the Russian capital's airports had to be closed, and local air defences were not entirely effective in repelling the assault.

A handful of residential buildings were visibly damaged, though not too seriously. Moscow's regional governor said that two people had been killed at a car park near a meat processing plant in Domodedovo, 5 miles from an airport. Fragments of a drone hit the ground, setting fire to cars shortly after 5am, Andrei Vorobyov wrote on his Telegram channel. Later, it was reported that a third man had died.

Striking at civilian targets is never attractive, though the images were not dissimilar to those of Ukrainian cities hit nightly by Russian bombing over the past three years. Russia has also been increasing the scale of its drone attacks recently – on Monday it launched 126 Shahed drones, as well as other, decoy drones, into Ukraine, alongside a ballistic missile.

Fighting on the frontline has favoured Russia for some time, but not dramatically or decisively so. On Thursday last week, a day after the US confirmed its decision to halt the flow of intelligence, Russia launched an effort, with the help of North Korean troops, to recapture the remainder of the Kursk area held by Ukraine.

That has forced the defenders back by between 4 and 8 miles (6.5km and 13km) and into the outskirts of Sudhza, a village that Ukraine has occupied since August. But its success may well be a function of a concerted attack, rather than a beginnings of a rout caused by the temporary absence of targeting data. That means Russian progress in the Kursk sector, for example, is very likely to continue if no ceasefire is agreed.

Nevertheless, the diplomatic momentum is suddenly with Ukraine, though with the mercurial Donald Trump involved, it is unclear for how long. Around $1bn (£772m) of US military aid is now potentially unblocked, while key functions for totemic weapons such as F-16s are presumably being restored – and the Kremlin's immediate hopes of grinding down Kyiv on the frontline are set back.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

White House walks back doubling of steel and aluminum tariffs as Ontario relents on electricity levy after tit-for-tat day

The looming trade war between the US and Canada escalated on Tuesday as Donald Trump threatened to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum after Canadian threats to increase electricity prices for US customers.

On Tuesday morning Trump announced plans to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum from 25% to 50% and once again threatened to annex Canada as retaliation for the province of Ontario's imposition of a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to several US states, in a dramatic escalation of the trade war between the two ostensibly allied countries.

The news set off another stock market sell-off on Wall Street that was tempered when Ontario's premier, Doug Ford, said he made a deal with the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, to suspend Canada's 25% tariff on exports of electricity to Michigan, New York and Minnesota after Lutnick agreed to discuss renewing existing trade relations.

New tariffs of 25% on all imported steel and aluminum are still scheduled to take effect at midnight on Wednesday, including against allies and top US suppliers Canada and Mexico, the White House confirmed to Reuters.

Incorrectly calling Canada “one of the highest tariffing nations anywhere in the world”, Trump said he had instructed his secretary of commerce to increase levies on the metals due to start on Wednesday morning. He also threatened more tariffs on 2 April on the car industry that would “essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada”.

Asking rhetorically why the US received electricity from another country, he accused Canada of using energy, “that so affects the life of innocent people, as a bargaining chip and threat” and said “they will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come”.

Mark Carney, Canada's incoming prime minister, called Trump's latest move “an attack on Canadian workers, families and businesses” and promised to “keep our tariffs on until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade”.

The Trump administration was also reportedly preparing on Tuesday to institute a new rule that would require some Canadians staying in the US for more than 30 days to register personal information and agree to fingerprinting, according to Bloomberg. Currently there is largely frictionless travel for citizens between the two countries.

The fractious economic battle between the US and Canada has developed even graver undertones as Trump makes increasingly aggressive threats for the US to absorb its northern neighbour. Although at first claiming that he wanted Canada to crack down on fentanyl, Trump has now accused the US ally of underpaying for military protection and incorrectly described the trade imbalance with Canada as a $200bn subsidy from the US.

Trump coupled his tariff declaration with openly aggressive language about making Canada “our cherished Fifty First State”, repeating a constant refrain over the last few months. He claimed American statehood for Canada would make “all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear”, called the border “an artificial line of separation drawn many years ago” and suggested the Canadian national anthem, O Canada, would become a state anthem.

The rhetoric has inspired a rare unity among Canadian politicians, with Carney campaigning for Liberal leader on standing up to Trump, and saying to a standing ovation in his acceptance speech on Sunday that “Canada never, ever will be part of America”.

Trump's moves are just the latest in the chaos around the president's trade policy, amid tumbling stock markets and fears it could trigger a possible US recession.

The White House's strategy so far has been to play down the anxiety on Wall Street, even as stocks waver. After Trump refused to rule out the possibility of a recession in an interview with Fox News over the weekend, the Nasdaq had its worst day on Monday since September 2022, dropping 4%.

Shares in US automakers also fell after the announcement, as traders bet that high metal tariffs would drive up costs for the American industrial sector, eating into their profits. Ford Motor dropped nearly 4%, while General Motors dipped by 1.3%. Shares in the carmaker Stellantis – which has several manufacturing facilities in Canada – fell by more than 5%.

Price premiums for aluminum on US physical market soared to a record high above $990 a metric ton, Reuters reported.

The Ontario premier Ford has said that Trump must take the blame if there is a recession in the US, telling MSNBC on Tuesday: “If we go into a recession, it will be called the Trump recession.”

Ford has said in the past that he would be willing to cut off US energy supply from Canada completely in response to Trump's tariffs.

“We will be relentless,” Ford said, adding he would not “hesitate” to shut off electricity exports to the US if Trump continues the trade war.
 “That's the last thing I want to do. I want to send more electricity down to the US, to our closest allies or our best neighbors in the world. I want to send more electricity.” But, he said, “Is it a tool in our toolkit? One hundred per cent, and as he continues to hurt Canadian families, Ontario families, I won't hesitate to do that.”

Ford also encouraged American CEOs, who have been largely silent on the trade war and threats to Canadian sovereignty, to speak up. On Tuesday Trump is set to meet with the Business Roundtable, an influential group of business leaders that includes the CEOs of Google, Amazon and JPMorgan.

Ford said: “We need those CEOs to actually get a backbone and stand in front of him and tell him, ‘This is going to be a disaster. It's mass chaos right now.'”

The group said in a statement last week that while it supported trade policies that “open markets to US exports, revitalize the domestic manufacturing base and de-risk supply chains”, it called on the White House to “preserve the benefits” of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump himself signed in 2020 but has since apparently violated by suddenly imposing steep tariffs on both countries.

Tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum imports were already slated to apply to all countries globally on Wednesday, after Trump announced them last month.

Both consumer and business confidence has dropped in the US since Trump entered office.

A survey published on Monday in Chief Executive magazine found that CEOs' rating of the current business climate fell 20% in January, from 6.3 out of 10 – with 1 being “poor” and 10 being “excellent” – to 5, the lowest since spring 2020. 
  Meanwhile, consumer confidence measured by the Conference Board found that confidence dropped over 6% in February, its biggest month-to-month drop since August 2021.

Trump had not yet spoken with Carney, said the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday, arguing that the tariffs on Canadian metals “was a retaliatory statement due to the escalation of rhetoric that we've seen out of Ontario, Canada”.

“I think Canada is a neighbor. They are a partner. They have always been an ally,” she said, adding: “Perhaps they are becoming a competitor now.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Attack on Moscow as peace talks began was designed to reinforce Kyiv's proposal for an air truce with Russia

Ukraine's decision to launch a drone attack into Russia as the next phase of peace negotiations involving delegations from Washington and Kyiv began is a clear demonstration that its military capacity has not yet been significantly dented by Donald Trump's decision to withhold military intelligence last week.

Russia's defence ministry said Ukraine had attacked with 337 drones, 91 of which were aimed at Moscow and the surrounding region. Three people were reported to have been killed, all four of the Russian capital's airports had to be closed, and local air defences were not entirely effective in repelling the assault.

A handful of apartment buildings were visibly damaged, though not too seriously. Moscow's regional governor said that two people had been killed at a car park near a meat processing plant in Domodedovo, 5 miles from an airport. Fragments of a drone hit the ground, setting fire to cars shortly after 5am, Andrei Vorobyov wrote on his Telegram channel. Later, it was reported that a third man had died.

Striking at civilian targets is never attractive, though the images were not dissimilar to those of Ukrainian cities hit nightly by Russian bombing over the past three years. Russia has also been increasing the scale of its drone attacks recently – on Monday it launched 126 Shahed drones, as well as other, decoy drones, into Ukraine, as well as a ballistic missile.

Though it is not clear what targeting information Ukraine is working with now, there have been assurances by the French and British that they will continue to supply reconnaissance data gleaned from satellites and air- and ground-based surveillance, as well as open-source data. Moscow's airports, for example, cannot move and it is easy to force their closure with simply the threat of a drone attack.

Tuesday night's attacks are a reminder of how far Ukraine's long-range drone capability (mostly manufactured indigenously) has developed, but is also a warning to Moscow that the loss of US intelligence – principally targeting information – is not likely to precipitate a battlefield collapse as diplomatic talks begin.

Until Donald Trump's arrival in the White House, there had been no peace negotiations since spring 2022. That has been changed by the US president's willingness to talk to Russia's Vladimir Putin and lean on Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy – but it is anything but clear that Kyiv will choose this moment to give in.

Critically, the revised military balance, without US intelligence, has yet to be established. On Thursday last week, a day after the US confirmed its decision, Russia launched an effort, with the help of North Korean troops, to recapture the remainder of the Kursk pocket held by Ukraine. It has forced the defenders back by between 4 and 8 miles (6.5km and 13km) and into the outskirts of Sudhza, a village that Ukraine has occupied since August.

Ukraine's position in the salient has deteriorated markedly, but it may well be a function of a concentrated Russian attack, rather than the beginnings of a rout caused by an absence of targeting data. The return of North Korean soldiers to the frontline, after a period in which they were reconstituted after taking heavy casualties, and reports of a heavy use of Russian drones both point to a determined offensive.

There were reports of some totemic US weapons systems – such as the radar jammers on Ukraine's small fleet of F-16s jets – becoming non-functional. But the loss of capability in one area may be more than offset by gains elsewhere: the growing sophistication of Ukrainian jamming means that Russian glide bombs, once considered a wonder weapon, are increasingly inaccurate.

A more open question is whether halting US military aid will significantly degrade the position of the Ukrainians over time, but if the diplomatic track does not bear fruit, experts believe Russia and Ukraine can carry on fighting at similar levels of intensity through the rest of 2025. Meanwhile, the battles of the moment, at least, are likely to be coloured heavily by the political discussions.

Ukraine's attack into Russia is also designed to reinforce its proposal for an air truce – itself a counter to Trump's argument that Kyiv does not want peace. In reality, it is Ukraine that would gain the most from halting long-range missile and drone attacks, giving it a chance to rebuild its partly destroyed energy networks. So by striking into Russia, it can at least argue that Moscow would have something to gain.

The problem is that military escalation is not the most obvious route to peace.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Standing in the driveway of the White House with Tesla vehicles, Trump said he would label violence against the company's showrooms as domestic terrorism

Donald Trump said he is buying a “brand new Tesla” and blamed “Radical Left Lunatics” for “illegally” boycotting Elon Musk's electric vehicle company. The announcement came a day after Tesla suffered its worst share price fall in nearly five years.

Later, the president also said he would label violence against Tesla showrooms as domestic terrorism. Trump was responding to a question during a Tuesday press conference, in which a reporter said, “Talk to us about some of the violence that's been going on around the country at Tesla dealerships. Some say they should be labeled domestic terrorists.”

“I will do that. I'll do that,” Trump said. “I'm going to put a stop to it. Because they're harming a great American company.”

Trump spoke on the White House driveway, alongside Musk and Musk's young son. Several Tesla vehicles were parked in the driveway for Trump to pick which vehicle to buy. In August 2024, a podcaster gifted Trump a Cybertruck. On Tuesday, Trump selected a red Model S, which he said he would pay for by check.

“Elon Musk is ‘putting it on the line' in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's ‘baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Tuesday morning.

During the press conference, Trump reiterated these statements saying: “We already know who some of them are. We're going to catch them, and they're bad guys.”

Tesla's shares fell sharply on Monday as markets reacted to the threat of a recession and Trump's tariff plans. Tesla's slide came amid widespread protests over the billionaire Musk's influence in the federal government at Tesla dealerships, a boycott campaign, car owners selling their Tesla vehicles, and activists pushing members of the public to sell Tesla shares.

“In any event, I'm going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American. Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???”

Trump's claim the boycott is “illegal” is false. The supreme court ruled in 1972 that the first amendment of the US constitution protects Americans' right to protest against private businesses.

The group TeslaTakedown, which has been organizing the anti-Tesla protests nationwide, says people also have the right to protest peacefully on the sidewalks and streets in front of the company's showrooms.

“Peaceful protest on public property is not domestic terrorism,” the group said in a statement. “We will not be bullied or allow our rights to be trampled on or stolen.”

Musk's net worth decreased by $29bn yesterday alone, and has fallen by $132bn over the past 12 months, as Tesla shares' gains have been wiped out. Tesla shares have declined every week since Trump took office, declining 15% on Monday alone. He remains the richest man in the world with a fortune of more than $320bn, according to Forbes.

Tesla's board members, including Musk's brother Kimbal Musk, have offloaded millions of dollars worth of shares in recent months. Tesla vehicle sales abroad have also dropped significantly, including by 76.3% in Germany in February 2025 compared with February 2024.

The boycott has emerged as Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) has wreaked havoc throughout the federal government in a proclaimed effort to reduce federal spending. The access and actions by Musk and his team have incited concerns over the lack of transparency, false claims about cancelled contracts and grants and the amount of savings made.

Polls have shown public support for Doge is mixed to unfavorable, with the vast majority of Democratic voters polling that Musk has too much power.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Elizabeth Oyer claims justice department senior ‘bullied' her due to Trump's relationship with actor sentenced for domestic violence in 2011

The pardon attorney of the US justice department was recently fired after refusing to recommend that Mel Gibson be allowed to own guns again, a right denied since the actor, director and prominent ally of Donald Trump was sentenced to probation for domestic violence in 2011, the New York Times reported.

The pardon attorney is a non-political role, supervising matters of clemency and recommendations for presidential pardons. Elizabeth Oyer was appointed under Joe Biden's presidency in 2022. She told the Times she had been working on a project to restore gun ownership rights to some people convicted of crimes and misdemeanors, a power held by the justice department but not often used.

A list of 95 candidates was whittled down to nine by senior figures, Oler said, then “sent … back to me saying: ‘We would like you to add Mel Gibson to this memo.'”

According to the Times, Oyer was also sent a January letter from Gibson's lawyer addressed to two senior justice department officials, James McHenry and Emil Bove, “arguing for [Gibson's] gun rights to be restored, saying that he had been tapped for a special appointment by the president and that he had made a number of big, successful movies”.

On 16 January, four days before starting his second presidency, Trump said the 69-year-old star of Mad Max, Braveheart and other blockbusters had been named, alongside two other veteran actors, Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone, “special Ambassadors to a great but very troubled place, Hollywood, California”.

Oyer told the Times: “Giving guns back to domestic abusers is a serious matter that, in my view, is not something that I could recommend lightly, because there are real consequences that flow from people who have a history of domestic violence being in possession of firearms.”

She said she was “vaguely aware” of a 2006 episode in which Gibson was stopped by a police officer on suspicion of drunk driving and responded with antisemitic abuse.

As described by Oyer, after she made clear her opposition to restoring Gibson's gun rights, a senior official under the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, asked if she was “flexible”. Told she was not, the official “shifted from friendly to condescending to bullying”, and “essentially explained to me that Mel Gibson has a personal relationship with President Trump and that should be sufficient basis for me to make a recommendation and that I would be wise to make the recommendation”, Oyer said.

Like Bove, Blanche was an attorney for Trump in criminal cases, including one in New York which resulted in 34 felony convictions arising from hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels, an adult film star who claimed an affair.

After the conversation, Oyer said, she “literally did not sleep a wink, because I understood that the position I was in was one that was going to either require me to compromise my strongly held views and ethics or would likely result in me losing my ability to participate in these conversations going forward”.

According to the Times, Oyer told a colleague: “I can't believe this, but I really think Mel Gibson is going to be my downfall.”

On Friday, Oyer was among high-profile figures fired from the justice department. She told the Times the termination happened suddenly.

The Times said two anonymous sources confirmed Oyer's version of events. Speaking to NBC News, an unnamed senior justice department official said: “The fact that this was the No 1 thing they wanted to address was bizarre.”

Unnamed justice department officials told the Times and NBC Oyer's account was not accurate. A representative for Gibson did not respond to a Times comment request.

On Saturday, Gibson was seen at a Las Vegas Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event in the company of Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, an agency of the justice department.

At that event, the UFC president, Dana White, made headlines by saying Patel was “dead serious” about partnering with the promotion company to train FBI agents.

Oyer told the Times that senior officials wanted to make a quick announcement about people having gun rights restored, a group that would presumably include Gibson – though by Tuesday no such announcement had been made.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Jessica Brösche to join Lucas Sielaff, who is reported to have returned to Germany on 6 March

A German tourist detained by US immigration authorities is due to be deported back to Germany on Tuesday after spending more than six weeks in detention, including eight days in solitary confinement.

Jessica Brösche, a 29-year-old tattoo artist from Berlin, will reportedly join Lucas Sielaff, 25, from Bad Bibra in Saxony-Anhalt, who is reported to have returned to Germany on 6 March, after being arrested at the Mexican border on 18 February before being detained for almost two weeks.

The families of the two tourists, who were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) had compared their ordeals to “a horror film”.

Both Germans were held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, a prison in San Diego, California.

Their cases, followed closely by German consulate staff in the US and the foreign ministry in Berlin, share similarities with the fate of the British tourist Rebecca Burke, 28, a graphic artist from Monmouthshire who was handcuffed and taken to a detention facility in Washington state more than 11 days ago while trying to cross into the US on the Canadian border, according to her family.

All the incidents are being described as evidence of the immigration crackdown in the US since the inauguration of Donald Trump. Not only has there a crackdown on entries into the US, but the increase in cases has reportedly meant a bureaucratic backlog leading to delays in decisions on cases of those who have been detained.

Brösche's mother, Birgit, confirmed to German media on Tuesday that her daughter was on her way home. Brösche's friend Nikita Lofving, whom the Berliner had intended to visit in Los Angeles, confirmed to the LA Times she had spoken to her friend.

Speaking to a journalist from ABC 10News San Diego in a phone interview on 1 March, Brösche said she had spent eight days in solitary confinement. She said: “It was horrible. Like, it's really horrible. I just want to get home, you know? I'm really desperate.”

Lofving, who had been in constant contact with her friend, said: “[Brösche] says it was like a horror movie. They were screaming in all different rooms. After nine days, she said she went so insane that she started punching the walls and then she's got blood on her knuckles.”

The staff at the prison had called a psychologist who wanted to prescribe anti-psychotic medicine to calm her down, but Brösche had refused to take anything, Lofving said.

Brösche's mother told the Berlin tabloid BZ: “I will believe it [her release] only when I am able to take her in my arms.”

CoreCivic, the company that owns the Otay Mesa Detention Center, denied Brösche's claims that she had been in solitary confinement, according to ABC 10News.

Brösche and Lofving had attempted to enter the US from Tijuana in Mexico on 25 January. The two were traveling with tattoo equipment. Lofving said that Brösche was arrested and taken away by officers on the border. The US immigration authorities, Ice, assumed Brösche was intending to work illegally in the US, Lofving said. Her friend was in possession of an Esta travel permit.

According to Brösche's Instagram profile, she had only intended to stay in LA until mid-February. Germany's foreign ministry confirmed it had worked together with its consulate general in LA to resolve the issue.

Sielaff returned to Germany last week after spending two weeks in detention, after his entry permit was cancelled at the Mexican border, amid suspicions by the US authorities that he had remained in the US longer than he was allowed.

He was arrested at the border point at San Ysidro on 18 February. He had entered the US on a tourist visa and had subsequently visited Mexico with his girlfriend, Lennon Tyler, where they had taken her dog to the vet. According to Tyler, on their return to the US, Sielaff had incorrectly answered a question as to where he lived, due to his poor grasp of English. He had said Las Vegas, where he was staying with Tyler, his fiancee, when he should have said Germany, where he permanently resides, she said.

After two weeks in detention, Sielaff was allowed to leave. His girlfriend said she booked him a flight from San Diego to Munich on 6 March. In an interview with the Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger, Tyler warned people against travelling to the US. “Don't come here,” she said. “Especially not if you're on a tourist visa, and especially not over the Mexican border.”

US authorities have yet to issue a statement on the German cases.

Rebecca Burke's father said on Monday that he was trying to get his daughter out of the detention centre, and had been in touch with the British consulate in San Francisco. He described the conditions in which she was being held as “horrendous”. She had been travelling on a tourist visa, but was told she should have applied for a working visa as she planned to stay with a family receiving accommodation in exchange for carrying out domestic chores.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Concern over crackdown on anti-fascists and Black Lives Matter movement as Trump loyalist takes control of agency

Fears are mounting that Kash Patel, an outspoken Maga disciple and newly appointed director of the FBI, will make good on past comments about crackdowns on anti-fascists and Black Lives Matter protesters.

For years, Donald Trump has also called for designating “Antifa” or more broadly, all anti-fascist activists – as an official domestic terrorist organization. While that has not materialized into official policy, Trump's top national security leaders at the FBI, CIA and the Pentagon are all hardcore loyalists intent on carrying out his political agenda.

Even from inside the FBI, an anonymous agent has publicly warned that the domestic counter-terrorism strategy could switch from inquiries against the hyper-violent far right to leftwing protest movements.

Though the bureau has never been a friend to anti-fascist or Black protest movements in the past, today's activists have taken note of the electoral changes and the promises for retribution in store for what Trump called “enemies from within” at his many rallies.

“We see opposition to fascism under Trump's fascist rule to be an increasingly dangerous endeavor,” said Walter Tull, a member of the Antifa international social media collective. “Many of us are taking far more precautions than we've ever done before.”

Tull believes Trump will once again attempt to hit anti-fascist activists with a terrorist designation, like he has Mexican cartels (another of Trump's major talking points), because “people who attempt to outlaw opposition to fascism are fascists”.

“But we are also inspired by the massive opposition shown by people taking to the streets and doing everything possible to oppose Trump,” added Tull.

Patel has long made anti-fascist activists part of his rhetorical list of enemies. In March 2023, Patel was a guest on a conspiracy theorist's podcast and excoriated the Biden administration for not prosecuting two lawyers that allegedly burned an NYPD vehicle at a BLM protest in Brooklyn during the summer of 2020.

“Go back to the Antifa riots,” said Patel. “Two liberal attorneys, white-shoe lawyers, firebombed a New York City police car and burned it to the ground with molotov cocktails.”

Patel falsely said the judge then “gave them basically probation”. Both lawyers were disbarred and received sentencing.

He further claimed the only correction to this system was “a massive overhaul” requiring control of the executive branch, with a partisan attorney general. After that, according to the now director of the FBI, “you have to wipe out the FBI” and close down its nerve center in Washington DC.

So far, Patel's dream has become reality: Trump is in the White House with Pam Bondi as his attorney general and Patel has already relocated up to 1,500 agents from FBI headquarters at the J Edgar Hoover building in DC. Targeting “Antifa” could very well be among his next actions.

But the FBI ignoring the threat of domestic terrorism emanating from the far right, in favor of focusing on anti-fascist or BLM protesters from years ago, risks emboldening neo-Nazi groups that are already rebuilding under a friendlier law enforcement climate.

“There is no major domestic terrorism threat, or concern for public safety in terms of violence directed at people, from the anti-fascist movement,” said Heidi Beirich, who cited well-known statistics pointing to the far right as the overwhelming domestic terror threat to the US. “The FBI would pursue pure folly – letting violent actors metastasize, while hunting a bogeyman that doesn't exist.

“And I should add there is no ‘Antifa' organization – just loose groups across the country who don't murder people based on their racist ideology like white supremacists do.”

Beirich believes it is likely that Patel will dispatch the FBI to pursue the political and personal grievances the president has been listing during his presidential campaign.

“I assume he will use the FBI not to protect us, but to carry out his and Trump's personal vendettas,” she said.

During the tail end of his first presidency, Trump became obsessed with name-checking Antifa and the protest movement surrounding the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. He infamously held a Bible to the sky as armed police rounded up BLM protesters in DC.

Mere months after that incident, US Marshals controversially gunned down an anti-fascist activist in Washington, while 750 federal officers were sent to Portland on a mission of law and order that Trump personally urged.

A chapter of anti-fascist activists in Atlanta, one of the most effective in the country at outing the identities of influential neo-Nazis and rightwing extremists, told the Guardian it was prepared and being proactive, rather than giving in to fear.

“This is a serious situation and we don't want to minimize it,” said the Atlanta anti-fascists in an email, noting the Biden administration also used its justice department to pursue grassroots protesters. “However, the stakes have always been serious for us.”

But stopping their activism, the Atlanta anti-fascists say, will never be an option.

“We're going to keep doing what we always do: monitoring, exposing and countering open fascists,” they said, while acknowledging rightwing extremists will probably have more state support than them in the coming years. “Anti-fascists may need to take practical steps against the threat of repression, such as adopting even stronger information security measures.”

Counter-terrorism experts have also spoken out over the dangers of diverting policing resources to pursuing leftists, which according to data, do not pose a serious danger to public or national security.

“If you asked 10 non-partisan counter-terrorism analysts where the most significant domestic terrorism threat emanates from, close to 10 would say the far right,” said Colin Clarke the director of research at the Soufan Group who considers himself among those types of apolitical watchdogs. “That's not an opinion, it's based on data and empirical evidence.”

Clarke did make clear there is a small and growing threat from organizations he described as “far left”.

“But when it comes to allocating resources to counter-terrorism,” said Clarke, “going after Antifa instead of homegrown violent extremists motivated by jihadism or white supremacy, makes little sense.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Court heard emotionally charged statements as Clifford was sentenced for the murders of Carol Hunt and her daughters Louise and Hannah

The sentencing of Kyle Clifford for the murders of Carol Hunt and her daughters Louise and Hannah has heard emotionally charged victim statements, paying tribute to the women and describing the ex-soldier as “a monster”.

Clifford was given a whole-life order at Cambridge crown court for the murder and rape of his ex-partner, Louise Hunt, and the killings of her mother and sister.

Before the sentencing, which Clifford refused to attend, the court was addressed by the BBC broadcaster John Hunt, Carol's husband and father to the two young women. He was followed by Alex Klein, Hannah's partner, and Amy Hunt, Louise and Hannah's sister.

“Do I really need to detail the impact of having three-quarters of my family murdered?” asked Hunt, addressing Clifford directly.

“But then I realised that this was my final opportunity to say what I want to say to you specifically, Kyle, words that will also be directed to your family, who will carry guilt forward for the rest of their lives; I know you valued them so poorly from all the conversations we had, Kyle, but I suppose even they must be damaged by what you have done.

“I also want to confirm to the world the truth, especially how Louise conducted herself within a textbook, mature break-up on her part, understanding the conflict of saying goodbye to someone she once loved but not allowing those memories to cloud her certain knowledge that you simply failed to be the person she needed. You failed.

“Unlike you, Kyle, at every step of their lives they made the correct choices to improve themselves as people; Louise enjoyed more success and fulfilment in one morning than you achieved in your entire miserable life.

“We all offered you kindness, especially Carol. She had picked up on your personal inadequacies right from the start. She sensed your immaturity but always knew Louise would work things out.

“Carol still displayed her compassion right up until the moment she answered the door to you on July 9th.

“I often think of the list Louise wrote to herself to remind her of the reasons that you fell short. The racism. She was rightly disgusted by that. Your belittling language. The fact that your family is a mess. Like any women should be allowed to do, she worked you out despite repeated deceit and said enough is enough. I hope women around the world will take Louise's bravery as a shining beacon for their lives. If you feel enough is enough, then it is.”

Hunt spoke of Louise's favourite novel from her school days, Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, and how she would quote lines from it to match life's challenges. One of them was about the goodness of mockingbirds who “don't do one thing except make music for us to enjoy”.

He added: “All their lives Carol, Hannah and Louise similarly spent their time bringing joy and colour and happiness to other people's lives. You killed three beautiful mockingbirds, Kyle.

“The impact of what you have done will be taken to my grave, but on the way there, I want you to know that I stand strong before you today. As you are consigned to a fate far greater than death, I can draw on the love and strength that I still feel from the girls in every moment of every day. I am lucky. I have the most wonderful daughter, Amy, who gives me such focus and purpose.

“Whatever sentence you are about to receive, whatever misery lies ahead for you for the next 60 years, remember that after your days on earth are done, on your dying day, there will be no release for you. The screams of hell, Kyle, I can hear them faintly now. The red carpet will come out for you. At that point, when the person you could have been meets the person you are, you will realise your miserable fate will last for eternity.”

Clifford was described by Klein as “a coward – you simply were not good enough for an angel like Louise”.

“Hannah completed my life. I would give anything to have her back. She deserved to have the happiest life with me,” he said.

“Kyle, the world knows how pathetic you are and that my Hannah stopped you in your tracks. You are a weak and insecure little boy who compulsively lied.”

Paying tribute to his partner, Klein said: “Hannah can only be described as an angel. She would never lay a finger on anyone.

“Hannah completed my life. We worked so hard to build a future together and achieve our goals and all I wanted was to share that with her. She was my world, the perfect woman, she supported me and understood me in every way.”

Clifford was described as a “monster” by Amy Hunt, who spoke of his rape and murder of Louise Hunt and said that what he did “to my baby sister is nothing short of demonic”.

“That day, and every day leading up to it, Kyle, you had a choice and you chose to inflict violence on a horrific scale, all for your own selfish and sadistic aims.

“All the time, truly thinking of yourself alone, I can only assume that in the days after Louise broke up with you in the kindest, most respectful way … you created some kind of false narrative in your head about how we had supposedly wronged you in order to allow you to avoid confronting the pain and shame within you and the truth – that the break-up was entirely your fault.

“That day, my mum, Hannah and Louise were all simply living their lives, getting on with their day in the home working or returning to their home after work.

“Their home is a place that was and should have continued to be safe for them and you made it the most unsafe place in the world for those few hours – you are a monster.”

NFL star Odell Beckham Jr has denied any wrongdoing after saying he was named in a lawsuit that alleges Sean ‘Diddy' Combs initiated a gang-rape against a woman in California.

In an initial lawsuit filed in October, Ashley Parham claims she was lured to an apartment in Orinda, California, and assaulted by multiple men. She alleges the assault was watched by Combs, who she had claimed had played a part in the killing of Tupac Shakur. An amended lawsuit filed on Friday is understood to have named former Beckham as one of her attackers.

On Monday, Beckham released a statement denying the allegations.

“I have been informed of the allegations about me in a suit in [California],” Beckham wrote on social media. “I really can't even believe that my name is mentioned in that matter. There is absolutely no truth to those allegations. I do not know and have never met the person that filed the suit. I was not anywhere near Orinda, CA at that time. In fact, I don't think I have ever even been to Orinda, CA. I have never done anything like that, and I would never do anything like that to anyone. I'm confident that these ridiculous claims against me will be dismissed.”

Law enforcement in Contra Costa county said in February they had investigated the allegations and concluded “the claims were unfounded.”

Combs's legal team have also denied the allegations. “Mr Combs was nowhere near Orinda, California on the day Ms Parham claims she was assaulted there, and the Contra Costa Sheriff's Department has already confirmed Ms Parham's claims were determined to be unfounded following a thorough investigation,” Combs's lawyers said in a statement.

Beckham is currently a free agent and last played for the Miami Dolphins. The 32-year-old is a three-time Pro Bowler and won the Super Bowl with the Los Angeles Rams in the 2021 season.

Combs is being held at the Metropolitan detention center in New York as he awaits trial on federal charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. His trial is set to begin in May.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Călin Georgescu, a Russia-friendly populist, won first round of election before result was annulled

Romania's top court has upheld a decision to ban presidential election frontrunner Călin Georgescu from standing in a rerun of the vote in May, sparking protest in Bucharest and leaving the country's far-right parties four days to find a candidate.

Georgescu, an anti-EU, Moscow-friendly populist, surged from almost nowhere to win the first round of the country's presidential election last year, but the result was annulled by Romania's top court because of suspected Russian interference.

Amid claims of “massive” social media manipulation, he was placed under criminal investigation last month on six charges including false statements about his campaign financing, fraudulent use of digital technologies and promoting fascist organisations.

He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Romania's central election bureau said on Sunday it had decided to bar Georgescu's candidacy for the rerun of the first-round vote, due on 4 May, ruling it “unacceptable” that he should stand after the constitutional court's annulment of the November vote.

After deliberating for two hours, the constitutional court rejected Georgescu's appeal against that decision on Tuesday in a unanimous ruling that cannot be challenged. It would publish its reasoning at a later date, the court added.

Several hundred protesters gathered outside the courthouse waving Romanian flags and chanting “freedom” and “thieves”. Ana Florescu, 57, said Romania was “not a democracy any more … There is no justice. They have stolen it.”

Florescu, an economist, said the mainstream political parties that have run the country since the collapse of communism in 1989 had “made so many mistakes. No one trusts them any more. And now they have just cancelled a candidate.”

Gabriel Feraru, 63, an engineer, said the entire political class was “afraid of Georgescu because he is anti-system, and they will lose all their corrupt privileges”. He said he would boycott the rerun unless Georgescu endorsed a new far-right candidate.

The deadline for candidacies is 15 March, giving Romania's far-right parties, including the Alliance for the Union of Romanians party (AUR) and the party of Young People (POT), which had united behind Georgescu's run, little time to agree on a replacement.

The former government official told his supporters after the ruling to “follow your conscience” when casting their ballot. “Today, the masters have decided: no equality, no freedom, no fraternity for Romanians,” Georgescu posted on social media.

“Long live France and Brussels, long live their colony named Romania,” he added in English and French. “While America is becoming great again, Europe and Romania have become petty, corrupt, and under dictatorship.”

George Simion, chairman of the AUR and of the far-right bloc that holds about a third of seats in parliament, said the court's decision was “a disgrace … Once again, it is mocking the Romanian people, is attacking our democracy and our essential rights.”

Many protesters said they would either boycott the new ballot or vote for an anti-establishment candidate. “I'll vote for anyone new who isn't a part of this system. People are fed up with these same politicians,” said Ionel Popa, a 52-year-old taxi driver.

The decisions to annul the elections and disqualify Georgescu have drawn sharp criticism from Washington. Billionaire Elon Musk posted on social media on Monday, asking: “How can a judge end democracy in Romania?”

The US vice-president, JD Vance, had previously said the annulment of the first-round vote showed Romania did not share American values. Georgescu, 62, was leading in the polls and was projected to win about 40% of votes in May.

Georgescu had been polling in single digits before the November election and had declared zero campaign spending. He has lauded Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, as “a man who loves his country” and praised Romania's 1930s fascist leaders.

He has also denied the existence of Covid-19, declared Jesus Christ to be “the only true science”, claimed Nato would never help Romania and said Bucharest was not very good at foreign affairs and should rely on “Russian wisdom”.

Moscow has denied any link with Georgescu but said on Tuesday any presidential election without him would be “illegitimate”. Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described Romanian authorities' decisions as a “violation of all democratic norms”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Education secretary Linda McMahon announced hundreds of staff were subject to the ‘reduction in workforce'. This blog is now closed.

“As part of the Department of Education's final mission,” the new education secretary, Linda McMahon, announced on Tuesday evening, “the Department today initiated a reduction in force (RIF) impacting nearly 50% of the Department's workforce.”

On social media, McMahon, the former chief executive officer of World Wrestling Entertainment, shared posts praising the move, including one by a founder of Moms for Liberty, a conservative activist group that has called for the banning of books it calls pornographic, curtailing the teaching of LGBTQ+ experiences and restricting discussions of race in schools.

After Tuesday's layoffs of about 1,300 workers, the department's staff will be roughly half of its previous 4,100, the agency said in a statement. According to the department, another 572 employees had already accepted “voluntary resignation opportunities and retirement” over the last seven weeks. The newly laid-off employees will be placed on administrative leave at the end of next week.

The department is also terminating leases on buildings in cities including New York, Boston, Chicago and Cleveland, officials said.

Department officials said the agency would continue to oversee the distribution of federal aid to schools, student loan management and oversight of Pell grants.

Trump campaigned on a promise to close the department, claiming it had been overtaken by “radicals, zealots and Marxists”. At McMahon's confirmation hearing, she acknowledged that only Congress has the power to abolish the agency but said it might be due for cuts and a reorganization.

On Monday, McMahon wrote to 60 universities to warn them that they were under investigation for supposed violations of the Civil Rights Act because of protests against Israel's war on Gaza that the Trump administration defines as “antisemitic harassment and discrimination” of Jewish students.

As the department pushes ahead with cuts, a federal judge in Boston blocked the Trump administration's plan to cut hundreds of millions of dollars for teacher training, finding that cuts were already affecting training programs aimed at addressing a nationwide teacher shortage.

The US district judge Myong Joun sided with eight states that had requested a temporary restraining order. The states argued the cuts were likely driven by Trump's drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which the president seems to believe is a form of racism against white Americans.

We are wrapping up our live coverage for the day, but will return to chronicle the second Trump administration on Wednesday. Here are some of the day's developments:

Donald Trump's trade war kicks into a higher gear at midnight, as 25% tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum are scheduled to begin. There was widespread confusion about whether the tariffs would be delayed, or increased, amid conflicting statements from the president and his chief trade adviser, but the White House said that the previously delayed tariffs would begin, even as the stock marker plunges.

The detained Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident, remains in federal custody, despite being charged with no crime. Khalil's wife said in a statement before a hearing on Wednesday in Manhattan that he was forced into an unmarked car by immigration officers who refused to show a warrant.

The Department of Education's “final mission” starts with laying off nearly half its workforce, its new secretary said. About 1,300 federal education workers received notices of lay-offs on Tuesday.

The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives passed a stopgap funding bill, which would avert a government shutdown if it also passed the Senate before midnight on Friday.

Ukraine agreed to accept a US proposal for an immediate 30-day ceasefire and to take steps toward restoring a durable peace after Russia's invasion, according to a joint statement by American and Ukrainian delegations meeting in Saudi Arabia. Russia has not commented.

Canada's prime minister-designate Mark Carney said he would not lift retaliatory tariffs on American goods until Washington does the same.

At Tuesday's promotional event for Elon Musk's line of Tesla electric vehicles at the White House, Trump refused to drive one of the cars, and scoffed at the idea that his predecessor, Joe Biden, had done so at a similar event. There is video of Biden doing so, in August 2021, at an event to promote electric vehicles that Musk reportedly was angry at being excluded from over anti-union policies.

Ahead of a hearing at the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse in Lower Manhattan on Wednesday, the wife of Mahmoud Khalil has released the following statement:

My husband, Mahmoud Khalil, is my rock. He is my home and he is my happy place. I am currently 8 months pregnant, and I could not imagine a better father for my child. We've been excitedly preparing to welcome our baby, and now Mahmoud has been ripped away from me for no reason at all.

I am pleading with the world to continue to speak up against his unjust and horrific detention by the Trump administration.

This last week has been a nightmare: Six days ago, an intense and targeted doxxing campaign against Mahmoud began. Anti-Palestinian organizations were spreading false claims about my husband that were simply not based in reality. They were making threats against Mahmoud and he was so concerned about his safety that he emailed Columbia University on March 7th. In his email, he begged the university for legal support, “I haven't been able to sleep, fearing that ICE or a dangerous individual might come to my home. I urgently need legal support and I urge you to intervene,” he said in his email.

Columbia University never responded to that email.

Instead, on March 8th, at around 8:30 pm, as we were returning home from an Iftar dinner, an ICE officer followed us into our building and asked, “Are you Mahmoud Khalil?”

Mahmoud stated, “Yes.”

The officer then proceeded to say, “We are with the police, you have to come with us.”

The officer told Mahmoud to give me the apartment keys and that I could go upstairs. When I refused, afraid to leave my husband, the officer stated, “I will arrest you too.”

The officers later barricaded Mahmoud from me. We were not shown any warrant and the ICE officers hung up the phone on our lawyer. When my husband attempted to give me his phone so I could speak with our lawyer, the officers got increasingly aggressive, despite Mahmoud being fully cooperative.

Everyone who knows Mahmoud knows him to be level-headed even in the most stressful situations. And even in this terrifying situation, he was calm.

Within minutes, they had handcuffed Mahmoud, took him out into the street and forced him into an unmarked car. Watching this play out in front of me was traumatizing: It felt like a scene from a movie I never signed up to watch.

I was born and raised in the Midwest. My parents came here from Syria, carrying their stories of the oppressive regime there that made life unlivable. They believed living in the US would bring a sense of safety and stability. But here I am, 40 years after my parents immigrated here, and just weeks before I'm due to give birth to our first child, and I feel more unsafe and unstable than I have in my entire life.

US immigration ripped my soul from me when they handcuffed my husband and forced him into an unmarked vehicle. Instead of putting together our nursery and washing baby clothes in anticipation of our first child, I am left sitting in our apartment, wondering when Mahmoud will get a chance to call me from a detention center.

I demand the US government release him, reinstate his Green Card, and bring him home.

Perkins Coie, a prominent law firm Donald Trump is seeking to punish with an executive order, sued the Trump administration in federal court on Tuesday, saying the firm “cannot allow its clients to be bullied”.

The 6 March executive order stripped the firm's lawyers of security clearances and access to federal buildings, and said the government would review contracts with any of the firm's clients. The order cited the firm's work representing Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016 and its hiring of a firm that created a dossier on Trump's connections to Russia.

The order raised deep concerns about the rule of law in the United States and underscored the way Trump is using the power of the presidency to punish his political enemies.

The suit, filed in federal court in Washington DC on Tuesday, says the purpose of Trump's executive order “is intentionally obvious to the general public and the press because the very goal is to chill future lawyers from representing particular clients” Major law firms have been more reluctant to take on Trump in his second administration, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The lawyers asked the court to block the order, citing violations of the US constitution's first amendment, as well as the fifth amendment, which guarantees due process of law, and the sixth amendment, which guarantees the right to be represented by a lawyer.

The Trump administration has also targeted another firm, Covington & Burling, over its connection to Jack Smith, the former justice department special counsel who prosecuted Trump.

At Tuesday's promotional event for Elon Musk's line of Tesla electric vehicles at the White House, when a reporter asked Donald Trump whether he would take one for a spin, he goaded the president by mentioning he had seen his predecessor, Joe Biden, do so at a similar event.

Trump, who claimed he was “not allowed to drive”, scoffed at the idea and suggested the reporter must have been “the only one” who had seen Biden drive an EV.

In fact, there is plenty of video of Biden taking an electric Jeep for a test drive in the same location in August 2021.

What makes the contrast between the two events to promote electric vehicles on the south lawn of the White House even more stark is the fact that Musk, who was excluded from Biden's event, played such a central role in Trump's.

In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported last year that being snubbed by Biden, who invited the heads of three Tesla rivals – General Motors, Ford and Chrysler parent Stellantis – to the 2021 signing of an executive order promoting electric vehicles helped push the billionaire in Trump's direction.

With Trump now ensconced in the White House, but Tesla's stock sinking due to Musk's leading role in the destruction of federal agencies, the Tesla chief executive seemed delighted by the president's personal effort to boost his sales on Tuesday.

When Trump got into the driver's seat of a Tesla Model S, Musk hopped in to the passenger seat to explain to him just how easy it is to drive. “It's like driving a golf cart, basically,” Musk said. “It's literally like a golf cart that goes really fast.”

After Trump decided not to drive in front of the assembled cameras, he got out, cracking: “You think Biden could get into that car?”

Trump was then asked by Brian Glenn, a favored correspondent for the far-right news channel Real America's Voice, to comment on anti-Tesla protests, as well as vandalism at some dealerships.

“Some say they should be labeled domestic terrorists,” Glenn commented.

“I will do that,” Trump replied. “I'm going to stop them.”

Glenn said later that he had asked the question because the anti-Tesla protests were “no different from what we saw antifa do”.

When another reporter asked whether the point of the product placement at the White House was to “boost Tesla sales and boost their stock”, Trump replied: “Well, I hope it does.”

“As part of the Department of Education's final mission,” the new education secretary, Linda McMahon, announced on Tuesday evening, “the Department today initiated a reduction in force (RIF) impacting nearly 50% of the Department's workforce.”

On social media, McMahon, the former chief executive officer of World Wrestling Entertainment, shared posts praising the move, including one by a founder of Moms for Liberty, a conservative activist group that has called for the banning of books it calls pornographic, curtailing the teaching of LGBTQ+ experiences and restricting discussions of race in schools.

After Tuesday's layoffs of about 1,300 workers, the department's staff will be roughly half of its previous 4,100, the agency said in a statement. According to the department, another 572 employees had already accepted “voluntary resignation opportunities and retirement” over the last seven weeks. The newly laid-off employees will be placed on administrative leave at the end of next week.

The department is also terminating leases on buildings in cities including New York, Boston, Chicago and Cleveland, officials said.

Department officials said the agency would continue to oversee the distribution of federal aid to schools, student loan management and oversight of Pell grants.

Trump campaigned on a promise to close the department, claiming it had been overtaken by “radicals, zealots and Marxists”. At McMahon's confirmation hearing, she acknowledged that only Congress has the power to abolish the agency but said it might be due for cuts and a reorganization.

On Monday, McMahon wrote to 60 universities to warn them that they were under investigation for supposed violations of the Civil Rights Act because of protests against Israel's war on Gaza that the Trump administration defines as “antisemitic harassment and discrimination” of Jewish students.

As the department pushes ahead with cuts, a federal judge in Boston blocked the Trump administration's plan to cut hundreds of millions of dollars for teacher training, finding that cuts were already affecting training programs aimed at addressing a nationwide teacher shortage.

The US district judge Myong Joun sided with eight states that had requested a temporary restraining order. The states argued the cuts were likely driven by Trump's drive to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which the president seems to believe is a form of racism against white Americans.

Following widespread confusion as to whether or not Trump would make good on his threat to impose 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, the White House released a statement to clarify that the president had withdrawn that proposal, but would press ahead with blanket 25% tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum from US trading partners, including Canada, starting at midnight.

Here is the full statement from a White House deputy press secretary, Kush Desai, who got his start as a “fact check reporter” for the Daily Caller, a publication co-founded by Tucker Carlson, who is not known for his rigorous adherence to the facts:

After President Trump threatened to use his executive powers to retaliate with a colossal 50 percent tariff against Canada, Ontario Premier Doug Ford spoke with Secretary Lutnick to convey that he is backing down on implementing a 25 percent charge on electricity exports to the United States. President Trump has once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people. Pursuant to his previous executive orders, a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum with no exceptions or exemptions will go into effect for Canada and all of our other trading partners at midnight, March 12th.

The uncertainty about tariffs has helped drive the stock market sharply down this week.

The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives passed a stopgap funding bill, which would avert a government shutdown if it also passed the Senate before midnight on Friday.

The measure would extend government funding largely at current levels through the end of September, but includes cuts in funding, including for veterans' healthcare, infrastructure investments, and nutrition and rent assistance for families in need. It passed by a vote of 217-213, with one Republican voting against it, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, and one Democrat voting for it, Representative Jared Golden of Maine.

Democrats in the Senate could block the bill from becoming law, since it requires 60 votes there, and Republicans hold only 53 seats. One Republican senator, Rand Paul, has come out strongly against the bill, writing: “Count me as a hell no!” on X. One Democratic senator, John Fetterman, said he would support the Republican bill, telling a HuffPost reporter: “I'm not going to vote to shut the government down.”

In remarks to reporters outside the White House on Tuesday, Donald Trump defended the decision to detain the former Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, saying that he would like to see the measure, which has triggered widespread condemnation and protests, be expanded to attempt to deport more students from the US.

Trump was asked how many arrests would be necessary and answered: “I think we ought to get them all out of the country,”, adding: “They're troublemakers, they're agitators, they don't love our country.” Trump claimed to have watched tapes of Khalil making statements that he described as “plenty bad”.

Up to half of the Department of Education's 4,400 employees could be laid off on Tuesday evening, sources tell CNN.

The news was echoed by a report from Fox that employees could receive “reduction in force” notices ahead of sweeping layoffs.

The new education secretary, Linda McMahon, said in a video posted on X on Tuesday that Trump would be making good on one of his campaign promises by “sending education back to the states”.

Trump could still make good on a pledge to eliminate the education department entirely, which Republicans have been discussing for more than a decade. In 2011, when the governor of Texas, Rick Perry, had a brain freeze on naming all three of the departments he would cut, one of the two he named was education.

In the meantime, however, the department is being used to pursue other priorities of the Trump administration.

On Monday, the department announced that it had “sent letters to 60 institutions of higher education warning them of potential enforcement actions if they do not fulfill their obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to protect Jewish students on campus, including uninterrupted access to campus facilities and educational opportunities.”

Peter Navarro, a senior aide to Donald Trump on trade, told CNBC that the president had reversed his decision, announced this morning, to double planned tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum to 50%.

New tariffs of 25% on all imported steel and aluminum are still scheduled take effect at midnight on Wednesday, including against allies and top US suppliers Canada and Mexico, the White House confirmed to Reuters after Navarro's interview.

Trump had earlier signaled to reporters outside the White House that he was rethinking his decision to double tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports, after Ontario's premier Doug Ford canceled a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to three US states.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Since pontiff was hospitalised conspiracy theories have swirled online claiming he has died

While Pope Francis was being treated for double pneumonia, Italian TikToker Ottavo made his way unchallenged into a ward at Gemelli hospital in Rome, followed by a camera. His aim was to bolster a conspiracy theory circulating on social media for weeks: that the 88-year-old pontiff was dead “and the Vatican refuses to tell us”.

“There's no security at all – nothing whatsoever,” he told his 10,000 followers in the video. “I would never have been able to get this far if he were there. For that reason, in my opinion, Pope Francis passed away.”

But Ottavo had overlooked one detail: the ward he infiltrated was not the one where Francis was being treated.

Since the pontiff was hospitalised last month, the Vatican has been waging a quiet battle against the fake news, conspiracy theorists and AI-generated images circulating on social networks concerning his health – producing regular updates on his health and a voice message from his hospital bed.

Before Ottavo, another TikToker nicknamed Er Bombolino had attempted to enter the hospital a few days earlier to prove that Francis was dead. He, too, ended up in the wrong ward.

The pontiff has been treated at Gemelli hospital since 14 February . On 22 February, he suffered a “prolonged asthmatic respiratory crisis” and on 28 February had “an isolated crisis of bronchospasm” – a tightening of the muscles that line the airways in the lungs

Doctors on Monday said Francis was no longer in immediate danger and responding well to treatment in hospital, but fake news about his state of health continues to proliferate online.

Some social media accounts have falsely announced his death four times since he arrived in hospital and thousands of fake photos have begun circulating on the web featuring Francis apparently in distress and dressed in a white cassock on a hospital bed with an oxygen mask on his face.

Last Thursday, for the first time since he had been admitted to the hospital, the pope recorded and released an audio message thanking those who had been praying for his recovery, his voice breathless as he neared three weeks in hospital with pneumonia.

Speaking in his native Spanish, Francis said in a message broadcast in St Peter's Square: “I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your prayers for my health from the square, I accompany you from here.” .

Media reports in Italy have suggested one of the objectives of the pope's audio was a response by the Vatican to fake news about the pontiff's death.

Avvenire, a national daily newspaper affiliated with the Catholic church, wrote: “The pope's audio message broadcast last night is the first evidence that debunks the insinuations. However, with his prolonged hospitalisation, there is a risk that the spread of fake news may widen.”

The director of the Holy See Press Office told the Guardian on Tuesday: “Fake news speaks for itself. We deliver our news with regularity and transparency.

“We said that with that audio the pope wanted to thank the faithful for their prayers in these weeks. If one of the goals of that audio was also to dismiss the fake news about his health, well – everyone is free to draw their own conclusions.”

Police are also reportedly gathering information on disinformation and considering potential charges, though the interior ministry told the Guardian “that no official investigation is under way at present”.

TikTokers Ottavo and Er Bombolino in a joint Instagram video defended themselves against the accusations, saying: “We are not conspiracy theorists. We are devoted to Pope Francis. We are only seeking the truth. Where is Pope Francis?”

The Vatican had previously noted that the decision not to appear in video was made by Pope Francis himself. “Everyone is free to choose how and when to be seen,” the Vatican's press office said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

European Commission draft includes orders for people to leave EU entirely and conditions for ‘return hubs' outside bloc

The European Commission has outlined proposals to increase deportations of people with no legal right to stay in the EU, but critics said it had opened the door to “prolonged detention” of people with plans for offshore detention centres.

The plans for a European returns system published on Tuesday came after EU leaders demanded “innovative solutions” to deal with undocumented migrants, in response to gains made by the far-right in last year's European elections.

The commission said it was proposing “effective and modern procedures” that would increase returns of people denied asylum or who had overstayed their visa. Only one in five people without the right to stay are returned to their country of origin, a figure that has changed little in recent years.

The draft regulation, which would have to be agreed by EU ministers and MEPs, would create a European Return Order, to ensure that an order to leave a member state would function as an order to leave the EU.

People deemed to be a flight risk could also be detained for up to two years, compared with 18 months under existing law.

The regulation also imposes conditions on EU member states seeking to strike deals with non-EU countries to create offshore centres for deported people, otherwise known as “return hubs”. Unlike Italy's agreement with Albania, or the previous British government's Rwanda deal, EU return hubs would not be used to hold asylum seekers, only people denied the right to stay.

EU governments negotiating such deals would have to ensure respect for fundamental rights, including no pushbacks, according to the draft legal text. Unaccompanied minors and families with children would also be excluded from such arrangements.

The International Rescue Committee said many questions remained unanswered, including how long people would be forced to stay in the centres and how the EU would ensure their rights were safeguarded in non-EU countries.

“While it's unclear exactly what form the EU's proposed return hubs would take, we do know that its existing migration deals with non-EU countries have resulted in thousands of refugees and other migrants being exposed to violence, abuse, exploitation and death,” said Marta Welander, the EU advocacy director at IRC.

The plans were welcomed by the centre-right European People's party, but the Greens and the left raised concerns.

Tineke Strik, a Dutch Green MEP on the European parliament's civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee, said return hubs would “inevitably lead to prolonged detention and pose very real practical and legal risks when it comes to upholding fundamental rights under other countries' judicial systems”.

She added that the use of return hubs “shifts responsibility for taking care of people needing to return from the EU to third countries” and distracted from working on efficient return procedures and cooperation with countries of origin.

European Commission officials said EU countries negotiating “return hubs” would have to respect EU law and international human rights standards precisely “to avoid the situation of having a legal limbo”, but did not confirm whether the two-year limit on detention would apply outside the bloc.

Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president in charge of security, said migration had been exploited by populists for political gain: “When people with no right to stay remain at the EU, the credibility of our entire migration policy is undermined.”

Magnus Brunner, the body's commissioner for migration, rejected comparisons with Italy's Albania deal or the abandoned UK-Rwanda agreement, because return hubs would not apply to asylum seekers.

Questions remain over which countries would agree to host return hubs, which would be negotiated by EU member states, rather than Brussels. Brunner said: “Whether we find the third countries as well, that is a question of agreements and negotiations.”

Last year, just over 1 million people sought asylum in Europe's border-free Schengen area, an 11% decrease on the previous year, but the second straight year that asylum claims exceeded 1m since 2015-16, according to the European Union Agency for Asylum. In 2024, only 42% of asylum claims were accepted.

The EU last year passed a sweeping set of measures to manage migration, which are mostly yet to be implemented, but was unable to agree on an updated deportation law. The commission promised to fill that gap, after the far-right made big gains in the 2024 European parliament elections, which were widely perceived to be in response to migration.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Sarah Celiz among tens of thousands feeling relief that ex-Philippines president will finally face the courts

Sarah Celiz wept as she sat at home watching footage from Manila's main airport on her phone. They were tears of sadness, and of relief.

The former Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte, who had just landed in the capital, was surrounded by officials and being taken into custody. The international criminal court had issued an arrest warrant over his bloody “war on drugs”, in which her two sons were among the tens of thousands of people killed in deprived urban areas.

A man who for years had seemed untouchable was finally facing justice. “I was really shocked. It was as if a bomb had suddenly exploded,” Celiz said. “I cried because of so much joy and sadness. Sadness because we lost our loved ones … joy because he [Duterte] is now where he belongs.”

But, she added: “For me, it's not enough. What I want is for what happened to my sons to happen to him as well … His family will feel what we felt.”

Celiz's sons Almon and Dicklie were killed in 2017, six months apart, during Duterte's deadly crackdowns. Her area, Bagong Silang, in Caloocan, a poor district of Metro Manila, was one of the worst affected.

Almon, 32, a father of five, was killed on 6 February that year when a police taskforce arrived at a wake he was attending.

Celiz was at home when she heard the news from her daughter-in-law. She recalls racing outside: “I felt like I was running on air, like my feet weren't touching the ground.”

She rushed to the spot where her son had been shot, just 10 minutes from their home, but his body was no longer there – friends had taken him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. He had been shot in his chest and an arm.

Between 12,000 and 30,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed in connection with anti-drugs operations, between July 2016 – when Duterte took office – and March 2019, according to data cited by the ICC. Most were young men, targeted in the streets of deprived urban areas.

At the height of the killings, dozens of people were killed in a single night.

Six months after Almon's killing, Dicklie, his 31-year-old younger brother, a father of seven, was also killed. He had been out on a tricycle. Celiz was told a bag was placed over his head and he was taken to a police station. She found his body only the following day, at a funeral parlour.

The police said he had fought back against their officer, a claim frequently made by authorities to justify the killings. He had been shot multiple times, including four times in the chest, and once in his head. His body was abandoned in the streets, she was told.

Duterte and his supporters have argued that allegations of wrongdoing should be dealt with by the Philippine justice system. Yet in the years that have passed since Celiz's sons were killed, there has never been any investigation. She says police at a local station told her that even if she tried to file a complaint, there was no evidence.

Today, Celiz cares for her 12 fatherless grandchildren. “Even though it is hard, I told them the truth [about what happened],” she said. The family struggles financially, she added. Her granddaughter cried recently because she could not afford to buy a special robe to mark her high school graduation.

“If their fathers hadn't been killed, they wouldn't have lost their parent. Now, I can't do anything [to financially support them],” she said.

Duterte, who appeared before a senate inquiry into the drugs war killings in 2024, said he offered “no apologies, no excuses” for his drugs crackdown, saying: “I did what I had to do, and whether you believe it or not, I did it for my country.”

Celiz feels only relief that he will finally face the courts. At 11.03pm a plane carrying the former president set off for The Hague, in the Netherlands, the home of the ICC. “I am sorry to say this,” she adds: “That demon doesn't know how to say sorry.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Revealed: rhetoric by interim US attorney for DC includes falsely claiming Kamala Harris ‘self-identified' as Black

Donald Trump's appointee as interim US attorney for the District of Columbia and nominee to hold the position permanently, Ed Martin, has repeatedly made derogatory and racist comments in past social media posts and columns.

Martin's rhetoric includes falsely claiming Kamala Harris is “self-identified” as Black and calling her the new Rachel Dolezal, claiming Planned Parenthood targets Black communities for abortions, claiming that the supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor made racist comments to white males about her own identity and invoking false claims about Dr Martin Luther King Jr to affirm support for the Republican party and the Tea Party movement.

Trump appointed Martin to be interim US attorney in January 2025 Last week, Martin wrote a letter to the dean of Georgetown's law school, telling the school to end any diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, claiming his office would not hire anyone associated with a university with DEI programs.

In recent weeks, he has also tried to initiate a grand jury investigation into the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, over 2020 comments about supreme court justices and wrote letters threatening to prosecute Schumer and the congressman Robert Garcia over their criticism of billionaire Elon Musk and the so-called “department of government efficiency”.

He has also referred to himself and other US attorneys as “President Trump's lawyers” rather than an independent, law-abiding officer sworn to uphold the US constitution. Senate Democrats have asked the DC bar association to investigate Martin for using the office to threaten political opponents and pardon past clients, January 6 defendants.

The US attorney's office for the District of Columbia declined to comment. “President Trump was given a resounding mandate by the American people to restore law and order. His nomination of Ed Martin underscores his commitment to making America safe again, starting with our nation's capital,” said Liz Huston, the assistant White House press secretary.

Leading up to the 2024 presidential election, Martin repeatedly referred to Harris as a “self-identified” Black woman and as “the DEI candidate.” “Hillary Clinton must be kicking herself that she didn't do it,” he wrote on social media in August 2024.

“Move over Rachel Dolezal. Why Kamala Harris can never be Black,” he wrote twice in July 2024, linking to an unrelated NPR article about Dolezal.

The Guardian obtained copies of columns Martin wrote for the Evening Whirl, a non-digital, crime tabloid in St Louis, Missouri, as he was a leader in the local Tea Party that emerged and grew in response to Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election win.

In a 2010 column entitled “What would MLK Say?”, Martin, criticized a Martin Luther King Jr event at Harris Stowe State University, a historical Black university in St. Louis, because he said the attendees and speakers didn't criticize “racist tendencies” of the Democratic party.

He argued “the truth that few will say out loud”, is entitlements, invoking King to perpetuate racist stereotypes of welfare recipients, and ignoring how King advocated for guaranteed income to address poverty.

“America has – for over 40 years now – engaged in a ‘war on poverty' that has created an underclass of men and women who have too little education and too little family structure to ever make it out of poverty. Most are black and brown,” Martin wrote, falsely, as most Americans under the poverty line are white.

“Welfare and other entitlements encouraged young men to leave their kids, your women to never marry but have many kids, and both men and women to not work (and collect payments),” Martin added.

He lamented in a later column, claiming King and the Tea Party movement were aligned. Even recently, Martin falsely claimed King was a registered Republican.

“I wonder what Martin Luther King Jr might think of the Tea Party movement. I can't help but think he would appreciate their desire to rally, strive for change, and peaceably force the folks in power to listen,” Martin wrote.

In a 2009 column titled “If Sotomayor was a white man,” Martin claimed her supreme court nomination would be over, claiming a comment she made about her experiences as a Latina woman was racist against white men.

“In 2001, she said this: ‘I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.' Wow. Imagine if a white male nominee had said ‘a white guy like me will make better decisions that some Puerto Rican woman.'”

Martin's columns were written in the wake of his resignation as chief of staff to the Republican governor of Missouri in 2007, following a scandal in which a staff attorney was fired by Martin for trying to enforce public email records laws.

Also before his resignation, Hispanic groups called on the Missouri governor to fire Martin after he said during an August 2007 Missouri housing development commission meeting that in a work force where there are “Mexican-looking people they are likely illegal”. The governor of Missouri Matt Blunt dismissed the calls, claiming the comments were taken out of context.

He became a leader among the Tea Party in Missouri in 2008, attempted to get elected to Congress and then the state attorney general's office in 2012. He was elected chair of the Missouri Republican party in 2013 to 2015.

At a 2016 Tea Party rally, Martin told the crowd: “You're not racist if you don't like Mexicans. They're from a nation. If you don't think Muslims are vetted enough, because they blow things up, that's not racist.”

In 2018, he was fired as a CNN contributor after audio revealed him calling panelists on CNN he appeared with “Black racists” and “rabid feminists”.

He spoke at a “Stop the Steal” rally in 2021, echoed false claims about the 2020 election being stolen from Trump, and has represented some January 6 defendants in court. He has repeatedly used the QAnon conspiracy theory slogan in support of the election fraud claims.

“What they're stealing is not just an election. It's our future and it's our republic,” Martin said at a rally in Washington DC on 5 January 2021.

In 2021, Martin appeared on the VDare book club podcast hosted by James Kirkpatrick, an alias of white nationalist blogger Kevin DeAnna. Martin hosted VDare's founder Peter Brimelow, a leading activist in white nationalist movements, several times on his podcast in 2018 and 2019.

He served on the 2024 Republican national convention platform committee.

His rhetoric throughout his columns was often insidious toward crime, Democrats, abortion and teachers' unions.

In a column about public safety in December 2008, Martin suggested “send in the National Guard” or “hire Blackwater to clear the streets”, in reference to the private military contractor that incited international outcry in 2007 when contractors with the firm killed unarmed civilians in Iraq.

Martin frequently falsely claimed tax dollars were being used to fund abortions. He had previously worked at an anti-abortion group and has recently supported a national ban on abortions without exceptions and entertained the possibility of jailing women who get abortions and doctors who perform them.

He has also repeatedly pushed a false claim that Planned Parenthood targets Black communities for abortions.

“Since Planned Parenthood has successfully positioned their abortion services targeting Black Americans, when is it okay to call them white supremacists?” he wrote on X in February 2023. In July 2024, he posted a cartoon comparing slavery to abortion.

In criticizing teachers' unions, Martin claimed they were “fiddling while Rome burns and too many of our children end up ignorant or dead”, in a December 2008 column.

“Drill everywhere and for all we got,” Martin wrote in a 2010 column, adding the Arctic Wildlife Refuge should be opened up for oil drilling. “We are told as Americans we cannot drill there because we will disturb ‘nature' and impact the caribou. I say choose our kids' future over caribou and drill.”

In a January 2009 column on Obama's inauguration, Martin claimed Joe Biden had “obvious plastic surgery” and “looks like Joan Rivers in a dark suit”. He claimed on X in 2024 that Obama and Biden are both racists.

In a 2008 column, Martin criticized pushbacks over the derogatory use of Obama's middle name.

“They want to make Hussein off-limits and they want to attack people who say the name. This is the worst kind of imposition of speech regulation and it is plainly un-American,” Martin said. “This silliness should stop; after all, it may soon be President Barack Hussein Obama leading our country.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Kyiv ‘ready to do everything' to end fighting after Trump cut support for Ukraine in its war with Russia

Senior US and Ukrainian officials have held marathon crunch talks in Saudi Arabia focused on ending the war with Russia, aiming to build confidence despite a personal crisis between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Although the two presidents were absent, Zelenskyy sent his chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, while Trump dispatched his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, to Jeddah.

“We are ready to do everything to achieve peace,” Yermak told reporters as he arrived for the talks, held in an opulent room provided by the Gulf state.

The two sides talked for about three hours in the morning before taking a break, with more meetings planned for the afternoon. During the talks, Yermak posted one line on social media: “Work in progress.” After nightfall, the two sides had not made any announcements on how long the negotiations would last.

Zelenskyy, who was also in Jeddah to meet the crown prince but not in the room for the talks, had said Ukraine's position would be “fully constructive”.

It was expected that the Ukrainians would suggest to the Americans a one-month ceasefire in the air and at sea, if Russia agreed to the same, during which time further discussions could take place on a more lasting end to the fighting.

The offer, which Zelenskyy has floated publicly before, was designed to show the Americans that Ukraine is bringing constructive proposals to the table.

Rubio, on his flight out, said Washington's main aim was to see if Kyiv was “prepared to do difficult things, like the Russians are going to have to do difficult things, to end this conflict or at least pause it in some way, shape or form”.

The stakes could not be higher for Ukraine, with the prospect of US military aid and intelligence sharing being restarted if the talks go well. Trump cut off that critical support after the heated Oval Office argument in which he and his vice-president, JD Vance, rowed with Zelenskyy in front of the world's media. Members of the US administration have suggested repeatedly that Zelenskyy should hold elections or step down.

Domestically, Zelenskyy's flagging ratings were boosted by his dressing down in the White House, and most Ukrainians say they would not want elections while the war continues. However, while there is anger at Trump's demands, there is a strong feeling that, given the difficult situation at the front and exhaustion after three years of war, the Ukrainian president should make every effort to mend relations with the White House.

Since the debacle in Washington, Ukraine has sought to flatter Trump, to prevent a peace plan from being forced upon it. Writing in the Guardian before the talks started, Yermak complimented a “strong American leadership” but said “a peace must be found that is both just and sustainable”.

Trump's interest in Ukraine has initially focused on a money-making scheme in which Kyiv would hand over a proportion of the country's mineral wealth to the US. It is not clear if that deal will be agreed in Jeddah.

After the US president dropped support for Ukraine, European governments rallied behind the country, promising funds and military aid, but they have also put pressure on Zelenskyy to repair ties with the superpower.

The Guardian understands that British and French officials were particularly key in advising Kyiv on how best to put their position to the Americans. Jonathan Powell, an adviser to the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, is in regular contact with Yermak and visited Kyiv over the weekend. Yermak said the visit was part of “joint work with partners to develop a plan for achieving a just and lasting peace” before the Saudi summit.

The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, posted a social media update on Tuesday stressing the importance of the day's US-Ukraine talks.

“Dear Americans, dear Ukrainians, don't waste this chance. The whole world is watching you in Jeddah today. Good luck!” he said.

Russia has celebrated the loss of support from Ukraine's largest, and previously steadfast, backer. While most European governments ended working ties with Vladimir Putin after the full-scale 2022 invasion, which they say is a war of aggression, Trump has been more willing to build a rapport with the Russian leader.

Several media outlets, including Reuters and Axios, have reported that Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, planned to visit Moscow this week to meet Putin.

Asked about those reports, the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said contacts between Russia and the US were now quite intensive, the RIA news agency reported.

It remains to be seen how ready Russia is for any peace deal, even in the current scenario in which the Trump team seems to be requiring more sacrifices from Kyiv than Moscow.

On Tuesday, Putin's spokesperson said the signals from Washington were causing many in Moscow to rejoice, but added there should not be premature celebration.

“You always need to hope for the best but still be prepared for the worst, and we should always be ready to defend our interests,” Dmitry Peskov said at a conference, in comments reported by Russia's Kommersant newspaper. “Many people are rushing to put on rose-tinted spectacles and are saying that the Americans will now stop providing weapons or have already done so, that Musk will turn all the communications systems off, and everything will work out for us. But it will work out for us anyway.”

Peskov said Moscow expected the US would inform Russia about the talks with Ukraine, the Russian state news agency Tass reported.

On the battlefield, Moscow has seized the moment to launch a recent offensive in the Kursk region of western Russia, where it is trying to eject the Ukrainian army.

On Tuesday, Russia's defence ministry said its troops had regained more than 100 sq km (38.6 sq miles) of territory and 12 settlements in Kursk, which was taken by Ukrainian forces seven months ago. Kyiv has said the Kursk operation was an attempt to gain a bargaining chip in future negotiations and to force Russia to shift forces from eastern Ukraine.

In an attempt to put pressure on Moscow hours before the Jeddah peace talks, Ukraine launched its largest drone attack on Moscow since the start of the war.

The Russian defence ministry reported 337 drones were launched at Russia overnight on Monday, including 91 targeting the Moscow region, killing two people, sparking fires and disrupting flights and train services.

“This is an additional signal to Putin that he should also be interested in a ceasefire in the air,” said Andriy Kovalenko, a Ukrainian national security council official.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

President sacks Alusine Kanneh after video of him with Johannes Leijdekkers, one of Europe's most wanted

Sierra Leone's president has fired the head of the immigration service days after footage was published showing him receiving a birthday gift from a fugitive Dutch drug kingpin.

The footage of Alusine Kanneh being handed a present by Johannes Leijdekkers – which has not been independently verified by the Guardian – was published by the investigative outlet Follow the Money and the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad on Friday.

The dinner is understood to have been held in an upmarket restaurant in Freetown, the country's capital.

Leijdekkers, 33, one of Europe's most wanted fugitives, was sentenced in absentia to 24 years in prison for drug smuggling by a Rotterdam court last June.

Kanneh was relieved of his duties the same day the reports were published but authorities in Freetown did not disclose the reason for his dismissal in a short statement by the presidential secretary.

For months speculation has swirled in the west African country that Kanneh and other members of the political elite had been helping Leijdekkers accumulate influence.

In February, a Guardian investigation established that Leijdekkers had been in the country since at least 2022 and had spent time at nightclubs and house parties.

A Reuters report in January placed him at a New Year's Day church service in President Julius Maada Bio's home town, sitting near the leader's daughter Agnes Bio, with whom he is believed to be in a relationship.

Days before that event, the immigration ministry introduced an investment-for-citizenship scheme under Kanneh's direction. Called Go-for-Gold, it offers a fast-track path to citizenship in 90 days for investors willing to pay $140,000 (£108,000). The traditional route to naturalisation involves eight years' residence.

Leijdekkers has a passport from Turkey, where he previously resided after going on the run from Dutch authorities. It is unknown if he has Sierra Leonean documentation too.

At a press conference in January, Sierra Leonean police said their own investigations had established that the church service footage depicted a man called Omar Sheriff. The country's police chief, William Fayia Sellu, declined to say at the time whether Sheriff and Leijdekkers were the same person.

Leijdekkers, who has assumed numerous aliases and nicknames, including Bolle Jos, was sentenced in absentia by a Rotterdam court last June to 24 years in prison for six drug transports totalling 7,000kg of cocaine, an armed robbery in Finland, and ordering the murder of an associate. He received a 10-year sentence in absentia by a court in Belgium in September over an attempt to smuggle drugs via the port of Antwerp in 2020.

Organised criminal groups have long used west African countries as a staging post for cocaine shipments from South America to Europe. The revelations about Leijdekkers come at an awkward moment for the authorities in Sierra Leone, which earlier this year recalled its ambassador from neighbouring Guinea after seven suitcases containing suspected cocaine were found in an embassy vehicle.

Dutch officials are still in discussions to extradite Leijdekkers, even though Sierra Leone does not have a formal extradition treaty with the Netherlands.

Sources in Freetown told the Guardian that Sierra Leone's government wanted to swap Leijdekkers for the Netherlands-based influential social commentator Abdul Will Kamara,  AKA Adebayor, whose videos and long WhatsApp voice notes are popular among older people and those in rural areas.

Officials and ruling party supporters claim he incited deadly riots in 2022 in the capital and north of the country that left at least 26 civilians and six police officers dead.

In February, the information minister, Chernor Bah, said two attempts to extradite Adebayor had been unsuccessful. Bah was approached for comment on Monday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Fashion week also brings Louis Vuitton showcasing cinematic romance of train travel

Chanel came gift-wrapped in black ribbon at Paris fashion week. The ribbon was made of steel, not silk. It was the width of a city street and 368 metres long, soaring skywards beside the long catwalk like very pretty scaffolding. The message: the house of Chanel is as tough as it is chic.

New designer Matthieu Blazy is expected to take up his role next month, by which time Chanel will have been without a creative lead for almost a year. This design vacuum poses a challenge for the house, but Chanel still has a star designer – albeit one who has been dead for 54 years.

Coco herself, in suit and pearls and with a black ribbon trim on her shallow boater hat, is still the image that springs to mind first at the mention of the name Chanel, and this gives the house unrivalled staying power. The collections that have been produced by the leaderless design studio for the past year stay close to her codes. Like a good cheeseburger, the clothes are nonetheless satisfying for being predictable. Consumers never get bored of cheeseburgers.

A celebrity crowd that included the actor Dakota Fanning, gathered to admire grenadine silk tweed suits in cream, lipstick red and classic black, that came matched with ribboned hats.

There were crystal bows as jewellery, silk bows as blouse buttons, and a trompe l'œil ribbon snaking across a knitted dress. Pearls were supersized, with a single pearl the size of a tennis ball as the heel of a boot, and a string of pearls scaled up to be slung cross-body, with a hollow central pearl as a tiny bag.

Sock boots, with shiny black patent toes sewn on to bow-trimmed lace socks, brought Chanel's two-tone pump up to date, leaning into fashion's current obsession with posh socks. The handbags that drive Chanel's profits were an integral part of the show with a style for every look – from miniature versions the size of postage stamps to oversized laptop sacks.

Prestige in fashion is about Oscar dresses and dazzling catwalk shows, but profits are dictated by sales of handbags, totes, wallets and sunglasses. Louis Vuitton is the biggest luxury house in the world, with a brand value estimated at $130bn (£100bn) last year, because it never forgets that the real point of dressing Emma Stone for the Oscars last week was to have her front row in Paris this week.

The vibe at Louis Vuitton was the cinematic romance of train travel, in films from Casablanca to Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Designer Nicolas Ghesquière has a way of wearing his references lightly, fusing imagination and nostalgia to create something entirely new.

Devore velvet gowns with silk turbans spoke to the era of the Orient Express; slouchy knits and handkerchief hem skirts with chunky boots were more Interrail. Curvy dresses winked at Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot. There was a mini collaboration with Kraftwerk, with the album art for 1977's Trans Europe Express on the back of a pinstripe jumpsuit.

Ghesquière is a unicorn in fashion. He is now in his 11th year at Louis Vuitton, with another four years to run on his contract. While a game of designer musical chairs is being played out all around him at Paris and Milan fashion weeks he remains a calm, constant presence, ending this show with smiles and waves and a kiss for loyal client Brigitte Macron in the front row.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Archaeologists identify a possible Celtic settlement on the island and believe the trove was hurriedly transported there

The mystery of why the world's largest iron age Celtic hoard was buried on the south-east coast of Jersey more than 2,000 years ago may have been solved by archaeologists.

When about 70,000 silver coins, 11 gold torques and jewellery were unearthed in a field at Le Câtillon in the Grouville district in 2012, experts were unable to explain why they had been transported to a remote and unpopulated area with dangerous coastal reefs.

Now a geophysical survey around the site has identified a possible Celtic settlement, which means Jersey was no isolated backwater in the mid-first century BC.

A study of the site is published this week by the magazine Wreckwatch, with support from the educational Highlands Foundation of Jersey.

The detectorists Reg Mead and Richard Miles had immediately reported their discovery to Jersey Heritage. As a crown dependency, it was processed under the England, Wales and Northern Ireland Treasure Trove Act 1996, leading to its acquisition by Jersey's government for £4.25m. The finds are displayed at La Hougue Bie Museum in Jersey.

The detectorists have joined experts in researching the hoard, which is believed to have originated in the ancient French region of Armorica, which is modern-day Brittany and Normandy, as almost all the coins are linked to the Coriosolitae tribe, whose name may derive from the Celtic corios, meaning army or troop.

Archaeologists believe the riches were hurriedly transported overseas to Jersey to ensure they did not fall into the hands of Julius Caesar's Roman army during the Gallic wars.

In the geophysical survey, the team found linear anomalies spanning several tens of metres, parallel and perpendicular to each other, some with subdivisions that resemble late iron age rural Celtic settlements in northern France.

Dr Hervé Duval-Gatignol, Société Jersiaise's archaeologist, said: “This could represent part of a rectilinear enclosure consistent with known forms of rural settlements of late iron age date in Armorica.”

Small magnetic anomalies suggest pits and postholes of buildings.

Dr Sean Kingsley, Wreckwatch's editor-in-chief and an archaeologist who has explored more than 350 shipwrecks in the last 30 years, said the Celts were innovative boatbuilders and sailors: “By the time Caesar attacked Brittany in 56BC, the Celts' seaborne trade was a well-oiled machine. Practical knowledge about low and high water times, the locations of shoals, winds, weather and landing places had long been passed down from generation to generation.

“In light of the dangerous shoals in the approaches to Jersey, it is possible that the Câtillon II hoard was shipped on a hide-boat vessel resembling the gold model of a boat from Broighter in Northern Ireland. This first century BC seacraft was equipped with a sail, steering oar pivoted near the stern and, crucially, nine oars on each side, which would have been invaluable to overcome unfavourable wind and steer clear of reefs. Ships built with hide or leather waterproof coverings fastened to a framework of light timbers sound flimsy but could be strongly constructed, light and flexible, ideal to ride the crests of high waves in the unpredictable Atlantic seas or for landing in almost any cove.”

He added: “Another new take is that we believe the landscape was sacred to the Celts, with ancestral power going back millennia, linked to a Neolithic megalithic tomb perched on the hilltop above the hoard discovery site.

“There's something incredibly special about these fields. The spiritual power of the ancestors is likely to have been a big reason why the hoard was brought to Jersey.”

The Wreckwatch issue is accompanied by a video.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Anti-government rally in Belgrade this weekend billed as climax to months of unrest since Novi Sad tragedy last year

Several hundred student protesters have blocked Serbia's public television station building in Belgrade as tensions soar days before a large rally planned for the weekend that is billed as the climax of months of anti-government demonstrations.

The students, who first blocked the TV building in the capital's city centre late on Monday, gathered again in their hundreds on Tuesday after announcing that their blockade would last for at least 22 hours. A similar blockade was organised in the country's second-largest city, Novi Sad.

University students in Serbia are behind almost daily rallies that started after a concrete canopy crashed down at a railway station in Novi Sad last November, killing 15 people. The protests have rocked populist rule of the president, Aleksandar Vučić, and his firm grip on power.

During the blockade on Monday evening, riot police briefly used batons against the crowd, which tried to block one of the entrances to the TV building with metal security fences.

The students blame the public broadcaster for biased reporting and siding with Vučić and the government during the demonstrations. The Serbian president was the guest of the main TV news bulletin on Monday evening.

During the interview, Vučić insulted the student-led protests, warning that security officers would use force against people at the rally planned for Saturday. He added that the nationwide demonstrations would never cause him to step down.

“You will have to kill me if you want to replace me,” he said.

The TV reporter who interviewed Vučić called the protesting students “a mob”, which the president appeared to approve of.

The interview followed a spat between Vučić and the station, RTS, in which the president described a reporter covering the protests as “an imbecile”. He later apologised for the remark, but said RTS reporters were a “disgrace to their profession”.

The station issued a statement denouncing the blockade on Tuesday. “Forcibly preventing RTS employees from coming to their workplaces represents a dangerous step into open conflicts with unpredictable consequences,” it said.

On the same day, Vučić met Donald Trump Jr, the US president's eldest son, who had just arrived in Belgrade. The purpose of his visit was not immediately known. Vučić is a vocal supporter of the US president.

Many in Serbia believe that the roof collapse in Novi Sad last November was caused by poor renovation work fuelled by government corruption. Authorities have indicted 16 people over the disaster.

The students have insisted on full accountability for the tragedy, a call that has garnered widespread support among citizens who are largely disillusioned with politicians and have lost trust in state institutions.

Student-led rallies have drawn tens of thousands of people, becoming among the biggest ever in the Balkan country, which has a long history of anti-government protests. Vučić has described the rallies as a western-orchestrated ploy to oust him from power.

Vučić has claimed that protesters “will try to achieve something with violence and that will be the end” this Saturday. Many demonstrators “will end up behind bars accused of criminal acts,” he added.

Student-led protests in the past months have mostly been peaceful, while incidents were recorded when opponents drove their cars into protest blockades or attacked the protesters.

Vučić and his rightwing Serbian Progressive party have held a firm grip on power in Serbia for more than a decade, facing accusations of stifling democratic freedoms despite formally seeking EU entry for Serbia.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Sausage-based snack and ‘power bar of the skilled factory worker' is being bought in record numbers in Lower Saxony

In recent years, Volkswagen's financial woes may have become emblematic of Germany's economic downturn. But, amid a slump in car sales, one of its more obscure products that has nothing to do with automobiles is experiencing a boom: the VW currywurst.

Described as the fuel of the carmaker's own factory workers and served up daily in its numerous works canteens and nearby supermarkets, the snack has officially become the company's most popular product.

“More than 8 million Volkswagen original currywursts marks a new sales record for us,” VW's chief human resources officer, Gunnar Kilian, said on social media this week.

Currywurst – sliced sausage slathered in tomato sauce and sprinkled with curry powder and sometimes paprika – is one of Germany's favourite dishes. The car manufacturer sold 8.5m of their own brand last year, a rise of 200,000 on 2023, a company spokesperson said.

VW, long one of the most iconic brands in an economy that for decades was Europe's powerhouse but which has contracted for the past two years, has had little else to celebrate this week.

The company's annual report, released on Tuesday, showed net profit down 30.6% compared with the previous year owing to high production costs and decreased sales in China.

The 10-brand group, whose models include Audi, Seat and Skoda alongside VW, had a challenging 2024, marked by a long and bitter dispute with German unions that ended with a deal in December to cut 35,000 jobs by 2030.

On Tuesday, the company's finance chief, Arno Antlitz, said that “consistently reducing costs and increasing profitability” was VW's goal, and that the company expected revenue this year to exceed the 2024 figure by “up to 5%”.

But VW also acknowledged that challenges remained “arising from an environment characterised by political uncertainty, increasing trade restrictions and geopolitical tensions”. This includes a lack of clarity over Donald Trump's threat to impose 25% tariffs on manufacturers in the EU.

Away from the global turbulence, however, the company can rely on its sausages.

The VW currywurst – which is available in the company's 30 canteens and work site kiosks as well as local supermarkets near to its factories – is prepared according to a secret recipe known only to a handful of employees.

Introduced in 1973, it is produced by the company's own on-site butchers in its so-called service factory, considered so important to the running of the business it is branded as a Volkswagen Originalteil – an original part – and boasts its own parts number: 199 398 500 A.

In 2021, VW bosses' decision to strike the currywurst off the menu at the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg, northern Germany, led to an outcry among workers.

It also provoked the ire of the former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder, one of the dish's most famous fans and a former leader of the state of Lower Saxony where VW is based.

He waded into the row, calling currywurst the “power bar of the skilled factory worker”. It was reinstated, with apologies, from company managers, who had said they had been responding to employees' increasing calls for healthy vegetarian and vegan options.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Air raid alarms are sounding and there are explosions in both Kyiv and Kharkiv, the RIA news agency reports.

If you're just joining us, you may have missed Dan Sabbagh's analysis of recent developments in peace negotiations.

Here it is:

Suddenly the ball is in Russia's court. The flow of US intelligence and military aid to Ukraine is to resume – and the Kremlin is being asked to agree to a 30-day ceasefire that Kyiv has already told the Americans it will sign up to.

It is a dizzying turnaround from the Oval Office row between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump and the apparent abandonment of the White House's strategy to simply pressurise Ukraine into agreeing to a peace deal. Now, for the first time, Russia is being asked to make a commitment, though it is unclear what will follow if it does sign up.

Announcing the peace proposal in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said that he hoped Russia would accept a peace agreement “so we can get to the second phase of this, which is real negotiations”.

That may leave plenty of room for interpretation. Russia has also been pushing for a ceasefire, though the Kremlin had wanted that to be followed by elections in Ukraine, before any full negotiation about territory and Kyiv's future security.

Russia launched an overnight air attack on Kyiv, with air defence forces engaged in repelling the strikes, Vitali Klitschko, mayor of the Ukrainian capital said.

The UK's foreign secretary David Lammy welcomed the “breakthrough” in US-Ukraine talks on a ceasefire deal, and said he was looking forward to working with other nations to drive progress towards peace.

Lammy wrote on X: “We welcome the breakthrough ceasefire proposal agreed today by the US and Ukraine.

“The ball is now firmly in Russia's court.

“Looking forward to working with G7 partners this week to drive progress towards a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.”

Ukraine's defence minister Rustem Umerov wrote on X he was “grateful to all participants of today's meeting for a very productive and results-oriented conversation”.

He went on to thank his “American colleagues” and “Saudi friends and partners” for their support.

The U.S. fully restored intelligence sharing with Ukraine following talks in Saudi Arabia, a Ukrainian senior governmental official told Reuters.

Separately, a presidential official said that military assistance had also been resumed.

Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the American 30-day ceasefire proposal on Tuesday, saying his country accepted it and also wanted Russia to abide by the agreement.

Responding to Ukraine accepting the US's ceasefire plan, the UK's Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: “The fastest way to bring peace in Ukraine is for Putin to withdraw his troops immediately.

“I'm relieved Trump has now reversed his senseless decision to suspend intelligence-sharing and security aid. There's no doubt it cost Ukrainian lives and emboldened Putin.

“The terrifying thing is: Trump's so unreliable, we can't count on him not to do it again.

“Now more than ever we must stand with Ukraine and work alongside our European partners to support a just peace, even in the absence of a reliable ally in the US.”

Poland has welcomed a deal that will immediately restore US military aid and intelligence sharing to Ukraine.

“We are ready as Poland, with an airport, with a hub in Rzeszow, in Jasionka, to accept this aid,” Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, the Polish foreign minister, told the TVN24 news channel.

“We maintain operational capability all the time, and we are fully prepared to resume American support.”

US president Donald Trump said he wanted to “get this show on the road” and end the war in Ukraine after the countries agreed a plan for a 30-day ceasefire.

Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said: “Ukraine, ceasefire, Ukraine, ceasefire, just agreed to a little while ago.

“Now we have to go to Russia, and hopefully President Putin will agree to that also, and we can get this show on the road.

“We want to get that war over with.”

Seemingly referring to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's turbulent visit to the White House last month, the president said: “I think it's a big difference between the last visit you saw in the Oval Office, and this.

“That's a total ceasefire – Ukraine has agreed to it, and hopefully Russia will agree to it.

“We're going to meet with them later on today and tomorrow, and hopefully we'll be able to wipe out a deal.”

He added: “If we can get Russia to do it, that'll be great. If we can't, we just keep going on and people are going to get killed, lots of people.”

It's 11pm in Kyiv, midnight in Moscow and 5pm in Washington. Here's a recap of the latest developments on the war in Ukraine:

Ukraine said it was ready to accept an immediate 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia following talks with senior US officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. “Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the US proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation,” a joint statement by the Ukrainian and US delegation said.

The US announced it would immediately lift its restrictions on military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. US officials said they hoped the agreement would help lead to talks to end the war. The decision came more than a week after the US cut off crucial aid to Ukraine, including deliveries of military radars and ammunition, as well as information sharing, which put significant pressure on Ukraine to agree to a US-proposed deal.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Donald Trump and said Ukraine was committed to seeking a peace “so that war does not return”. “Ukraine is ready to accept this proposal – we see it as a positive step and are ready to take it,” Zelenskyy said. “Now, it is up to the United States to convince Russia to do the same. If Russia agrees, the ceasefire will take effect immediately.”

Trump said he hoped Vladimir Putin would reciprocate and agree to the ceasefire proposal. Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel to Moscow in the coming days to propose the ceasefire to Vladimir Putin. “Ukraine has agreed to it. And hopefully Russia will agree to it,” Trump told reporters. Trump also said he would welcome Zelenskyy back to the White House after their clash last month.

US secretary of state Marco Rubio said the ball was “now in Russia's court” after the negotiations concluded. Rubio told reporters after the talks that he hoped Russia would say yes to the deal. “If they say no, then we'll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here,” he said.

European leaders welcomed the news of the agreement. European Council president António Costa and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen described the news as a “positive development” and said the EU “is ready to play its full part”. France and its partners “remain committed to a solid and lasting peace, backed by robust security guarantees for Ukraine,” president Emmanuel Macron said.

UK prime minister Keir Starmer also welcomed the agreement. “We now all need to redouble our efforts to get to a lasting and secure peace as soon as possible,” Starmer said in a statement, adding that he would be “convening leaders this Saturday to discuss next steps”.

Health secretary accuses food companies of ‘exploiting loophole' over food safety and urges greater transparency

The US secretary of health and human services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has directed the Food and Drug Administration to revise safety rules to help eliminate a provision that allows companies to affirm that food ingredients are safe.

The move would increase transparency for consumers as well as the FDA's oversight of food ingredients considered to be safe, Kennedy said on Monday.

“For far too long, ingredient manufacturers and sponsors have exploited a loophole that has allowed new ingredients and chemicals, often with unknown safety data, to be introduced into the US food supply without notification to the FDA or the public,” he said in a statement.

Kennedy has promised to address an epidemic of chronic illness with Donald Trump's backing, but his broad agenda from making food healthier to studying vaccines could clash with government spending cuts.

Currently, the FDA strongly encourages manufacturers to submit notices under a rule known as “substances generally recognized as safe”, but they can also affirm the use of a substance without notifying the FDA.

Eliminating this pathway would make it mandatory for companies that want to introduce new ingredients in foods to publicly notify the FDA of their intended use and submit underlying safety data, HHS said.

The FDA maintains a public inventory where all notices, supporting data and response letters are available for review.

PepsiCo, General Mills, Kraft Heinz, Hershey, Mondelez and Kellanova did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

A few months ago the FDA had set in motion a restructuring of its food division to increase oversight of food supply and agricultural products under the former commissioner Robert Califf.

In January, it proposed that food companies display nutrition labels on the front of the packages.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

US currency has lost all the gains it enjoyed since Trump won election and hits lowest level since mid-October

The euro and the pound have risen against the dollar to their highest level since the week of the US election, as the greenback sank against other leading currencies amid mounting “Trumpcession” fears.

The European single currency rose by a cent to $1.093, breaching the $1.09 barrier for the first time since Donald Trump won the presidential race. Sterling hit $1.2956, its highest since 8 November, with both currencies strengthening after the US president escalated his trade war with Canada by lifting planned tariffs on metal imports.

Trump's move drove stocks lower on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 index was down 1.2% in early afternoon trading, following a 2.7% slump on Monday.

The dollar lost 0.6% against a basket of leading currencies on Tuesday and, like the US stock market, has lost all its gains since Trump's election victory. It hit its lowest level since the middle of October on Tuesday morning.

After a global sell-off in stock markets on Monday, there were further losses on Tuesday after Trump doubled the tariff being imposed on Canadian steel and aluminium tariffs on Wednesday to 50%.

The UK's FTSE 100 share index lost 1.2%, or 104 points, to finish at 8,495 points, the lowest closing level since 16 January. Germany's DAX and the French CAC index both shed about 1.3%.

“This latest escalation in trade tensions comes hot on the heels of a tumultuous Monday, which marked the worst day of 2025 for US markets. Investor fears were stoked by President Trump's aggressive tariff policies targeting America's largest trading partners, sending shockwaves through the financial landscape,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index.

“The situation has left many observers questioning the broader implications of these trade policies on both the US economy and its international relationships,” Razaqzada added.

Before Trump's announcement, there had been a mixed session in Asia-Pacific markets where Japan's Nikkei fell by 0.6% and the South Korean market lost 1.3%, while Chinese exchanges closed moderately higher, up between 0.3% and 0.4%.

Trump vowed to buy a Tesla car in support of the billionaire Elon Musk after a slump in the electric carmaker's share price, amid a backlash against the Tesla founder who has become one of the US president's biggest allies. Tesla shares have more than halved in value since hitting a peak in December.

Writing on Truth Social, Trump accused “Radical Left Lunatics” of “trying to illegally and collusively boycott” the business after Tesla shares tumbled by 15% on Monday, their biggest daily decline since 2020.

The Swiss investment bank UBS has warned there is an increased risk that the US economy could suffer a downturn. It updated its house view scenario, and now forecasts a 30% chance of a “stagflationary or cyclical downturn” in the US, up from 25% at the end of last month.

Along with the Japanese yen, the euro is one of the beneficiaries as investors have dumped the US dollar.

Vasileios Gkionakis, a senior economist and strategist at the UK fund manager Aviva Investors, said there were several factors propelling the European single currency higher: the unwinding of the Trump/tariff trade; the seismic shift in Germany's fiscal stance, alongside EU-wide announcements; and the hawkish interest rate cut by the European Central Bank. Weaker-than-expected US economic data and a potential ceasefire in Russia's war against Ukraine are also playing a role.

“When push comes to shove, Europe gets its act together and cracks on with structural changes: in sum, this is a sentiment and confidence shift and outright currency-positive,” he said. “Assuming that any tariff impact will not be material, how high can the euro go?”

Some analysts predict the euro will reach $1.15 by the end of this year and $1.20 by the end of 2026. Gkionakis said he believes the $1.15 level could be hit “much sooner” than the end of the year.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Baloch Liberation Army claims to have killed 30 military personnel after blowing up tracks in Balochistan region

A separatist militant group in Pakistan's south-western Balochistan province says it has taken 214 hostages including military personnel after hijacking a train, as the country's security situation continues to decline sharply.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) blew up the tracks and fired on the Jaffar Express train as it travelled through a tunnel in a remote and mountainous area, bringing the train to a halt.

The train was travelling from Quetta in Balochistan to Peshawar in neighbouring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Tuesday afternoon.

The train, which had about 400 passengers onboard, was trapped in the tunnel and the driver was badly wounded, local authorities, police and railway officials said, without confirming the BLA's account of hostages.

In a statement, the BLA claimed to have killed 30 military personnel and taken 214 military and police personnel hostage, describing them as “prisoners of war”. It said all civilians onboard, had been given a safe route off the train.

The Balochistan government denied there had been any military officers on the train. However, official sources who did not have permission to speak on the record told the Guardian there were more than 150 security personnel on the train.

By Tuesday night, the train and the hostages remained in the custody of the BLA and the terrorist group said it was engaged in an “intense confrontation” with the Pakistani military and air force. The BLA warned in a statement that “if military intervention continues, all hostages will be executed”.

The group offered a prisoner exchange and said the Pakistani state had 48 hours to release Baloch political prisoners, forcibly disappeared persons and national resistance activists, otherwise all hostages would be “neutralised and the train will be completely destroyed”.

A railway official confirmed there had been no communication made so far with staff onboard the train and that the driver had been severely injured in the attack.

They said more trains had been sent to the site to help rescue people but added that efforts had been hampered by the rough terrain and poor network coverage.

“The scale of the incident and the possibility of terrorist elements are being determined,” said a Balochistan government spokesperson, Shahid Rind. “The Balochistan government has ordered that emergency measures be taken, and all institutions remain active.”

Pakistan's interior minister, Mohsin Naqvi, condemned the incident, saying: “The beasts who fire on innocent passengers do not deserve any concessions.”

Balochistan, a rugged and impoverished province that is the largest in Pakistan, has grappled with violent separatist movements for over half a century. The region, which shares borders with Iran and Afghanistan, has long felt neglected and exploited by successive Pakistani governments and has faced a long-running and brutal counter-insurgency by the armed forces, which has left thousands dead or disappeared.

The militancy movement has been gathering fresh momentum in recent years amid a decline in Pakistan's security situation since the Taliban returned to power in neighbouring Afghanistan.

The ranks of the BLA have swelled and Baloch militants routinely operate checkpoints and block highways in the province.

The militants have recently been behind several high-profile terrorist attacks. In February, BLA militants killed seven Punjabi travellers on a bus and in November last year the group claimed responsibility for a bombing at Quetta's main railway station that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers.

Large numbers of Chinese projects being built in the region have also been targeted, including a suicide bomb attack at Karachi airport last October that killed several Chinese workers.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Analysis shows 10% of peers make half of all contributions to debates while others claim allowances but say nothing

Fifteen members of the House of Lords did not say a word in the chamber, sit on a committee or hold any government post during the last parliament, while claiming more than £500,000 in allowances between them.

Analysis by the Guardian has revealed the extent to which some members of the UK's upper chamber do little or no parliamentary work.

Peers can claim an allowance of £361 for every day they turn up. They do not have to vote, speak or do any work beyond entering the building in order to be able to claim this money. They can also claim back money for certain travel expenses.

Fifteen peers claimed a total of £585,985 in allowances and expenses during the last parliament despite not speaking or doing other committee work. Only three of the 15 sent a written question to the government over the period. All but one voted during the parliament, on average taking part in a third of voting days.

The figures cover the 2019 parliament, which sat until the summer of last year, and exclude peers who had been appointed for fewer than 50 sitting days by the end of the parliament.

Just 10% of lords made more than half of all debate contributions. Removing the quietest half of peers would have had little impact on the numbers contributing to debates but would have reduced the allowances and expenses bill by 28%, the analysis suggests.

Khalid Hameed, a former private wealth company chief executive who became a peer in 2007, appears to have done nothing at all beyond turning up. He did not speak, send a written question, sit on a committee, hold a government post or vote in the house between the 2019 and 2024 elections, while claiming £27,628 in allowances for turning up 98 times.

The non-affiliated peer Swraj Paul claimed £100,946 in allowances over the same period. He did not speak, write or hold a committee or government post, and voted only once. The 93-year-old business magnate is the seventh-oldest peer (the oldest, Tony Christopher, turns 100 in April).

Among the other less heard from peers was Elizabeth Smith, Lady Smith of Gilmorehill, who stepped down from the chamber in February. The widow of the former Labour leader John Smith took part in 38% of votes in the last parliament, but had not spoken in the Lords since 1999. She had submitted five written questions since the 2019 general election, most recently in 2020, and claimed £31,224.90 in allowances and travel.

Llin Golding claimed the most in allowances and travel of the 15 peers over the period: £129,143. Like Smith, she voted relatively often (on 81% of voting days), but did not contribute to any debates.

A further 31 peers also never said a word or held a committee or government post but did not claim an allowance over the period.

The Electoral Reform Society has described those who vote but do not otherwise participate as “lobby fodder lords” who are used to help push a party's agenda through parliament but otherwise contribute very little.

A 2017 report by the campaign group said many peers simply turned up to claim their allowance and vote, without taking part in the essential scrutiny of government.

Jess Garland, the society's director of policy and research, described the upper chamber as “ludicrously bloated”. She said: “Despite many peers working hard, the vast size of the House of Lords means it lacks accountability and too many peers get away with not contributing.

“Those who sit in parliament shaping our laws should be chosen by, and accountable to, the British people who live under those laws. That way, all peers will be accountable for fulfilling their roles, not just those who choose to play an active role.”

Peers can claim a formal leave of absence if they are unable to contribute. The process, which has no fixed rules, is designed to help those with medical or family issues, or who are taking up diplomatic or other roles. None of the peers claiming allowances were on leave of absence.

Many peers – including Lord Hameed and Lord Paul – hardly ever voted. They were among 49 peers (excluding bishops, the speaker and the lord chamberlain, who either do not vote or have irregular voting patterns as a rule) who voted fewer than 10 times. Twenty-three peers did not vote once between 2019 and 2024.

A Lords spokesperson said: “Members contribute to parliamentary work in a variety of ways which are by no means limited to considering amendments to legislation. Not all parliamentary work leaves a record in Hansard. Members of the Lords are not paid a salary and can only claim attendance allowance for days they attend the House and undertake parliamentary work.”

Labour has set out plans to remove the remaining 92 hereditary peers from the chamber. Since 2019, hereditary peers have claimed more in allowances and expenses on average than non-hereditary peers (£95,800 per hereditary peer, compared with £92,300 for non-hereditaries).

Hereditary peers also spoke less often (155 times on average, compared with 191 for other peers) and were less likely to pose written questions to the government (18 letters on average, compared with 45 for other peers).

The Conservative peer Lord Crathorne was the most expensive hereditary member of the Lords when compared with his debate contributions, speaking just once while claiming £118,162 in allowances. He wrote 12 questions to the government over the period.

Crathorne, 85, said he was still a committed member of the Lords, actively engaging in debates, late-night sessions and votes. He also pointed to his involvement in several all-party parliamentary groups and his extra-parliamentary work with charities as evidence of his public service.

“I would make the point that while speaking is an important part of our parliamentary democracy, so too are listening, participating and voting,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Athiak Dau Riak was traditionally married for a record bride price last year, despite her mother's insistence that she was only 14, which led to threats of reprisals

The mother of an alleged child bride has left a safe house in South Sudan to travel to be with her daughter after discovering the teenager is pregnant.

Deborah Kuir Yach made headlines last year when she opposed a competition for her daughter's hand in marriage, insisting that her child Athiak Dau Riak was only 14. Fear of reprisals from her husband and family forced her to leave her home in the capital, Juba, and go into hiding.

After eight months living in a shelter under the protection of a local NGO, the 41-year-old mother of seven has travelled to Nairobi where Athiak is believed to be staying with relatives.

Despite the threats she faced after her stance became widely known, Yach said she is determined to be with her daughter – who is due to give birth this month – in keeping with the cultural tradition of the Dinka, one of the largest ethnic groups in South Sudan.

“Now that Athiak is pregnant, I can't do anything about the marriage. Let her be with her husband. They will decide together whether she can go back to school later on,” said Yach. “[But] according to our Dinka tradition, a daughter must give birth to her first child in her mother's home – that's why I am going to Kenya.”

Yach does not know if Athiak will be allowed to stay with her but said she would visit her to guide her daughter into motherhood, and help take care of the baby.

Although she was perceived as a victim of child marriage by those who condemned the wedding, Athiak sided with family members who orchestrated it.

“Athiak disagrees with what I have done. She says that I brought shame to the family,” Yach told the Guardian before she left South Sudan. “But I explained to her that I didn't want to stay where I am mistreated. Athiak wants to protect the image of the family but I will not go back, I am following my truth and my right,” she said, adding that she wants a divorce. “I just found out that he brought another wife home.”

In June 2024 Athiak travelled to Nairobi shortly after her traditional wedding to Chol Marol Deng, a South Sudanese man in his 40s who lives in Canada. A court case opened the same month by South Sudanese lawyer Josephine Adhet Deng against Yach's husband, Dau Riak Magany, accusing him of arranging the marriage of a minor – a crime under South Sudan's laws – failed to progress. Attempts by Deng to have Athiak brought back from Kenya were rejected by South Sudan's public prosecution office in October 2024.

Yach has travelled to Kenya with her three younger daughters in the hope that she can protect them from a similar fate to Athiak. Her brother, Athiak's uncle, who also publicly opposed the marriage, is supporting her.

“My niece is now pregnant and I'm not seeing this case going anywhere,” said Daniel Chol Yach, who lives in Canada. “I've tried tirelessly to alert the Canadian authorities but nothing has happened so far. Chol has been travelling freely and he impregnated Athiak, even though the marriage is not complete, and although he had said he would let her go back to school.” While the customary part of the wedding was celebrated in Juba, the marriage is not legally finalised.

“Now I want to make sure that my sister, Deborah, and my nieces have a better future. I'm renting a place for them in Nairobi. The kids will go to school there, and that will protect them from what happened to Athiak. With good education, they'll be able to know what is best for their future.”

Yach hopes to put her daughters in school in Kenya and, eventually, to join her brother in Canada to build a better life for herself and her family. “The reason I leave my country is the future of my children. If I stayed in South Sudan, maybe they will be married young, too.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Officials say 337 drones targeted Russia hours before US and Ukrainian teams met for peace talks in Saudi Arabia

Ukraine has launched its largest drone attack on Moscow since the start of the war hours before US and Ukrainian teams convened for peace talks in Saudi Arabia.

The Russian defence ministry reported that 337 drones were launched at Russia overnight on Monday, including 91 targeting the Moscow region, killing three people, causing fires and disrupting flights and train services.

A senior Ukrainian official said on Tuesday the drone attack should encourage Vladimir Putin to accept an aerial and naval ceasefire that Ukraine is expected to propose during the talks in Saudi Arabia.

“The largest drone attack in history was carried out on Moscow and the Moscow region,” said Andriy Kovalenko, a national security council official responsible for countering disinformation. He added: “This is an additional signal to Putin that he should also be interested in a ceasefire in the air.”

Russia's health ministry reported that 18 people were injured in the Moscow region.

The Russian aviation watchdog said flights were suspended at all four of Moscow's airports. Two other airports, in the Yaroslavl and Nizhny Novgorod regions east of Moscow, were also closed.

Russian Telegram channels shared images showing the aftermath of drone strikes on a car park outside Miratorg, one of Russia's biggest meat producers, in the Moscow southern suburb of Domodedovo, which killed three security guards and damaged about 40 vehicles.

Tatyana, a shopkeeper from Domodedovo, said: “I've been up since 3am. The sound of drones woke us first, then came the explosions. It was the loudest night in three years, absolutely terrifying.”

There was some anger in Moscow over the apparent lack of warning from Russia's emergency services about the drone attack.

“How did such a large number of drones cross the border from Ukraine unnoticed? Where were the alarms?” Oksana wrote in a chat on Telegram for Domodedovo residents.

Russian state media also published images of a damaged apartment in a multi-storey building in the Ramenskoye district, about 31 miles (50km) south-east of the Kremlin.

It was not immediately clear whether Russia's defence systems had intercepted all the drones flying toward Moscow.

Shot, a Telegram channel with links to the security services, cited a former Russian serviceman who reportedly shot down one of the drones with a hunting rifle in a small village outside Moscow.

Russian officials and pro-Russian outlets frequently say drones have been shot down and their debris damaged housing or facilities – regardless of whether the drones hit their intended military targets.

Ukraine routinely launches drone attacks on Russia, targeting infrastructure critical to Moscow's war effort. Tuesday's attack was the largest on the capital this year, coming hours before US and Ukrainian teams were to meet for peace talks in Saudi Arabia. The timing appeared to send a clear signal to Moscow and Washington that Kyiv was not prepared to accept an unfavourable peace deal and remained a formidable military force.

Like their Ukrainian counterparts, Russian officials and Moscow-aligned Telegram channels also linked the attack to the peace talks.

“The meaning behind this largest drone attack on the Moscow region is clear – it coincides with the start of negotiations in Saudi Arabia, where Ukraine will try to push for an air and naval ceasefire that is entirely unfavourable to Russia,” wrote the popular pro-Kremlin channel MIG Russia.

“The raid is meant to suggest that such a decision would supposedly benefit all parties … But it won't work,” the channel added.

The Kremlin has yet to comment on Ukraine's latest proposal for a partial ceasefire, though Russia has previously dismissed such proposals as attempts to buy time and allow Kyiv to rebuild its military.

On Monday the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, travelled to Saudi Arabia hoping to mend his strained relationship with the US and secure better terms to end the war. Ukraine also aims to persuade the Trump administration to reverse its decision to halt intelligence-sharing and military aid.

Without American military aid, Ukraine is leaning heavily on its fast-growing drone industry and the production of domestically made artillery systems to sustain its defence efforts.

Ukraine and Russia have developed innovative and increasingly sophisticated UAV programmes. Kyiv has established its own drone command and has improved the range of its systems, with attacks hundreds of kilometres into Russia. It has hit weapons storage units, oil processing facilities and enemy airstrips near the Arctic Circle, as well as naval vessels in the Caspian Sea.

Kommersant, a Russian news outlet, said Ukraine primarily used its new An-126 Liutyi (Fierce) drones for Tuesday's strikes on Moscow.

Separate from its attack on the Russian capital, Ukraine also launched more than 100 drones at Russia's Kursk region, near the Ukrainian border, where Moscow has been reclaiming territory lost after Kyiv's surprise incursion last summer.

Since the US halted military and intelligence aid to Ukraine, Russia has intensified its offensive in the Kursk region, threatening to encircle thousands of Ukrainian troops.

On Tuesday, Maria Zakharova, from the Russian ministry of foreign affairs, claimed that the large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow was a sign that Russian forces were gaining the upper hand on the battlefield.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

New book by spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism will raise the stakes in a dispute with Beijing over control of Tibet

The Dalai Lama's successor will be born outside China, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism says in a new book, raising the stakes in a dispute with Beijing over control of the Himalayan region he fled more than six decades ago.

Tibetans worldwide want the institution of the Dalai Lama to continue after the 89-year-old's death, he writes in Voice for the Voiceless, which was reviewed by Reuters and is being released on Tuesday.

He had previously said the line of spiritual leaders might end with him.

His book marks the first time the Dalai Lama has specified that his successor would be born in the “free world”, which he describes as outside China. He has previously said only that he could reincarnate outside Tibet, possibly in India where he lives in exile.

“Since the purpose of a reincarnation is to carry on the work of the predecessor, the new Dalai Lama will be born in the free world so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama – that is, to be the voice for universal compassion, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, and the symbol of Tibet embodying the aspirations of the Tibetan people – will continue,” the Dalai Lama writes.

Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, fled at the age of 23 to India with thousands of other Tibetans in 1959 after a failed uprising against the rule of Mao Zedong's Communists. Beijing insists it will choose his successor, but the Dalai Lama has said any successor named by China would not be respected.

China brands the Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for keeping alive the Tibetan cause, a “separatist”.

When asked about the book at a press briefing on Monday, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said the Dalai Lama “is a political exile who is engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion.

“On the Tibet issue, China's position is consistent and clear. What the Dalai Lama says and does cannot change the objective fact of Tibet's prosperity and development.”

Beijing said in February it hoped the Dalai Lama would “return to the right path” and that it was open to discussing his future if he met such conditions as recognising that Tibet and Taiwan are inalienable parts of China, whose sole legal government is that of the People's Republic of China. That proposal has been rejected by the Tibetan parliament-in-exile in India.

In his book, the Dalai Lama says he has received numerous petitions for more than a decade from a wide spectrum of Tibetan people, including senior monks and Tibetans living in Tibet and outside, “uniformly asking me to ensure that the Dalai Lama lineage be continued”.

Tibetan tradition holds that the soul of a senior Buddhist monk is reincarnated in the body of a child on his death. The current Dalai Lama was identified as the reincarnation of his predecessor when he was two.

The book, which the Dalai Lama calls an account of his dealings with Chinese leaders over seven decades, is being published on Tuesday in the US by William Morrow and in Britain by HarperNonFiction, with HarperCollins publications to follow in India and other countries.

The Dalai Lama, who has said he will release details about his succession around his 90th birthday in July, writes that his homeland remains “in the grip of repressive Communist Chinese rule” and that the campaign for the freedom of the Tibetan people will continue “no matter what”, even after his death.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Seven health professionals who worked with football legend in days before his death face trial in Argentina

An Argentinian neurosurgeon and six other medical professionals have gone on trial in Buenos Aires over the death of the legendary footballer Diego Maradona.

Ardent admirers of the World Cup-winning star, who died in November 2020 aged 60, gathered outside the courtroom to demand punishment for the people they blame for Maradona's premature death.

Protesters shouted “Murderer! Murderer!” as one of the seven defendants entered the building on Tuesday morning with her lawyer at the start of what is expected to be an emotionally charged four-month trial. Other demonstrators carried posters that called for “Justice for God!”

As he arrived for the opening session, Fernando Burlando, a lawyer representing Maradona's daughters, told journalists the court would hear evidence that would make it “shudder”. “The most important thing is to understand that they killed Diego … What they did was a murder,” Burlando said.

Maradona was found dead at his home near the Argentinian capital on 25 November 2020 having suffered a heart attack while he recovered from surgery he had undergone earlier that month to treat bleeding around the brain.

The death of the footballer, considered a national treasure in Argentina, prompted a massive outpouring of grief. Thousands flocked to the Casa Rosada presidential palace to attend the wake of a player who was famed for his sporting genius and a 1986 “hand of God” goal against England but spent decades battling cocaine and alcohol addiction. “Olé, olé olé olé, Die-go, Die-go!” mourners chanted as they stood in line.

Celebration of Maradona's life and achievements quickly turned to anger, recriminations and claims that medical negligence may have played a role in his death.

Prosecutors accused Maradona's eight-member medical team – seven of whom are going on trial this week – of failing to provide adequate care that might have kept him alive as he recovered from surgery.

They claim those medics pushed for Maradona to receive home care, a decision that proved “reckless” and “totally deficient”. Prosecutors allege the footballer was abandoned to his fate for a “prolonged, agonising period” before his death.

The defendants, who include the neurosurgeon Leopoldo Luciano Luque, 44, and the 36-year-old psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov – have all denied the charges. Vadim Mischanchuk, a lawyer for Cosachov, said he was “very optimistic” of an acquittal, arguing his client was in charge of Maradona's mental, not physical health.

Mario Baudry, a lawyer for Maradona's ex-wife, Verónica Ojeda, said of Luque and Cosachov: “The main responsibility is theirs.”

Each defendant could face between eight and 25 years in prison if convicted of “homicide with possible intent”, allegedly for pursuing a course of action despite knowing it could lead to the footballer's death.

More than 100 witnesses, including members of Maradona's family and doctors who tended to him over the years, are expected to take the stand in the long-delayed trial, which has revived painful memories of the player's demise.

In La Paternal neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, where the player nicknamed “El Pibe de Oro” (the Golden Boy) revealed his prodigious talent as a player for Argentinos Juniors in the 1970s, graffiti urging “Justice for Diego!” was daubed on walls before the trial.

“All society needs to know … what really happened, who abandoned him … and whoever is responsible must pay the price,” Hilda Pereira, a pensioner, said. Maradona “did not deserve to die as he died, alone”, she added.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Amid aggressive interest from US president Trump and growing calls for independence ahead of polls, outcome will have far-reaching repercussions

Greenland goes to the polls on Tuesday in what could be the most consequential election of the Arctic island's history.

With an electorate of approximately 40,000 – of a population of 57,000 – the margins are small.

But amid aggressive interest from the US president, Donald Trump, and growing calls at home for independence from Greenland's former colonial ruler Denmark, which retains control of security and foreign policy in the autonomous territory, the election outcome will have wide-reaching repercussions from Copenhagen to Washington DC and beyond.

There are six parties on the ballot. With 12 seats in the Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament, the biggest party going into the election was Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), which, led by prime minister Múte Egede, ran the governing coalition.

Siumut, led by Erik Jensen, is the second biggest party with 10 seats. For the last two years the two parties have been in coalition government. Before that, IA was in coalition with Naleraq, which brings us on to another of the key players.

With four seats, Naleraq is the largest opposition party going into the election. The party, led by Pele Broberg, a former government minister, has been gaining traction with its promise to hold a snap vote on independence. It is the most open of the parties to collaborating with the US.

The other players are the Democrats with three seats, Atassut with two seats, and relatively new party, Qulleq, which is mainly focused on independence.  

All but one of the parties, Atassut, which wants to expand and strengthen the commonwealth with Denmark, support independence, but differ on the speed at which they believe it should be attained.

Even with all the external drama around Trump, the biggest talking points of the election have been perennial domestic ones: economy, welfare, job creation, healthcare, education, fisheries. Independence and the relationship with Denmark and the US are also normal subjects in Greenlandic elections – but this time voters and politicians have had the additional pressure of the world watching and providing commentary.

Despite saying he “strongly supports the people of Greenland's right to determine their own future,” Trump followed up his Greenland comments during his speech to Congress with another message on Sunday inviting Greenland to join the US, promising he was “ready to invest billions of dollars” and “make you rich”.

As the world order realigns to a second Trump term and as the Arctic becomes an increasing battleground between global superpowers, Greenland's geographical positioning and wealth of raw materials are making it increasingly important. This means that Greenland's choice of leadership, and their subsequent choice of allies, has potentially far-reaching consequences. Egede has called it a “fateful choice” for Greenland.

Naalakkersuisut, Greenland's government, has long sought partnership in mineral extraction, but until recently has not been met by the kind of enthusiasm it was looking for. Meanwhile, tensions between Greenland and Denmark as a result of revelations over numerous colonial and post-colonial injustices, are contributing to momentum for the longstanding independence movement and the wish to speed up the process to full independence.

Since Trump's recent advances, Greenlandic politicians say that Copenhagen has been dramatically more willing to appease Nuuk. Rasmus Leander Nielsen, head of Nasiffik, the University of Greenland's centre for foreign and security policy, said the most likely outcome is that Greenland will try to renegotiate its relationship with Denmark within the kingdom. “Now with heightened tensions, Greenland has pretty good cards in its hands and could make the argument that they need to do something different from the status quo.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Judge tells triple killer he will spend rest of his life behind bars after father John Hunt tells Clifford ‘hell will roll out the red carpet for you'

John Hunt pays tribute to family as triple killer jailed for life

The judge has given Kyle Clifford, who murdered his ex-girlfriend and her sister with a crossbow and their mother with a butcher's knife, a whole life order with no possibility of parole.

Justice Bennathan said:

This is no occasion to subject family and friends of your victims to any delay or suspense.

I therefore make clear at once that for each of these three murders, the sentence will be one of life imprisonment with a whole-life order. That means a sentence from which you will never be released.

Kyle Clifford has been given a whole-life order for the murder and rape of his ex-partner, Louise Hunt, alongside the murders of her mother Carol and sister Hannah.

Clifford, 26, will never be released from prison after being sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court for the murders, which were committed last July. He was also sentenced to a concurrent 20-year sentence for raping Louise.

“You planned and contemplated killing all three of your victims,” the judge said as he delivered his sentencing remarks. He described the killer as a “jealous man soaked in self pity, who holds women in utter contempt”.

Clifford allegedly began plotting to attack Louise two days after she had ended their 18-month relationship because he was “enraged” by the rejection.

The court heard powerful victim impact statements from BBC racing commentator John Hunt, whose wife and two daughters were murdered by Clifford, Amy Hunt, Louise and Hannah's older sister and Carol's daughter, and Alex Klein, Hannah's partner.

In his statement, John Hunt described Clifford as a psychopath disguised as an ordinary human being. “Whatever sentence you are about to receive, whatever misery lies ahead for you in the next 60 years, once your days on earth are done, on your dying day, there will be no release for you,” he said. “The screams of hell, Kyle. I can hear them faintly now. They are going to roll out the red carpet for you. At that point, when the person you could have been meets the person you are, you will realise your miserable fate will last for eternity.”

Amy Hunt - the eldest daughter - described Clifford as a “monster” who carried out “demonic” acts.

Alex Klein said of the triple killer: “You are a weak and insecure little boy who compulsively lied”, adding that his “soul will suffer for eternity”.

A prosecutor told the judge earlier in the hearing it was “no coincidence” Clifford had sought out podcasts by the self-styled misogynistic influencer Andrew Tate before the murders. Clifford had watched up to 10 videos of Tate in the lead-up to his crimes.

You can read more about what was said in the hearing today in this report filed by my colleague Ben Quinn who has been at Cambridge Crown Court since this morning.

We have some more comments from Nick Gardner, the senior investigating officer in the case of triple murderer Kyle Clifford. He said that “three innocent women from the same family lost their lives simply because Clifford could not accept rejection or Louise (Hunt)'s right to leave their relationship”.

Speaking outside of Cambridge Crown Court, he continued:

There was nothing that Louise, Carol or Hannah (Hunt) could have done to predict the violence that ensued or to prevent it from happening.

They resisted Clifford's attack with bravery and Hannah herself raised the alarm despite having suffered an injury that would later take her life.

Today's sentence sends a message to men who perpetrate serious acts of violence against women.

You will be held accountable and you will face the full force of the law.

Prosecutors previously said Clifford became “enraged” when Louise ended their 18-month relationship, leading him to “carefully” plan the 9 July murders of Louise, Carol and Hannah Hunt. The court previously heard the murders were fuelled by the “violent misogyny promoted” by Andrew Tate, after it emerged that Clifford searched for his podcast less than 24 hours before the attacks.

Det Ch Insp Nick Gardner said the Hunt family had “suffered unimaginable loss as the result of (Kyle) Clifford's actions”.

Speaking outside Cambridge Crown Court, he said:

They have shown dignity and strength of courage throughout the investigation and trial, and although the sentence will provide little or no consolation at least we know that Clifford will never be released from prison.

He praised the police officers who helped detain Clifford after he went on the run with a crossbow, describing the defendant as “clearly a dangerous man”.

“These officers acted with immense bravery knowing that he was likely armed and had killed three people just hours earlier,” Gardner was quoted by the PA news agency as having said.

As a reminder, Clifford became the subject of a search for a number of hours before he was found injured in Lavender Hill cemetery in Enfield on 10 July 2024 (the day after the murders) after shooting himself in the chest with a crossbow. He is now paralysed from the chest downwards.

Clifford refused to attend Cambridge crown court for his sentencing today or to appear virtually.

Lisa Kiff, from the Crown Prosecution Service, has released a statement after the sentencing of Kyle Clifford. She said the killer showed a complete lack of remorse over his “inhumane crimes” and tried to escape the “gravity of his actions” at every turn.

She said:

Kyle Clifford is a murderer and rapist, who at every turn has attempted to escape the gravity of his actions.

From seeking to evade arrest, to not attending his trial or the sentencing hearing today - his lack of remorse and accountability for the truly inhumane crimes he committed has been laid bare.

While Clifford pleaded guilty to the murders of Carol, Louise and Hannah Hunt, the Crown Prosecution Service took the decision to proceed with the rape charge. This was to ensure full justice was secured for Louise, and to ensure that Clifford could be sentenced for the full extent of his offending.

That decision has been vindicated by his conviction for the rape and by the sentence passed today as Clifford will never be released from prison.

On behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service, I want to express my heartfelt sympathies and admiration to the Hunt family. They had the strength and courage to attend court every day and hear first-hand the devastating truth of what happened to Carol, Louise and Hannah – something which, in stark contrast, Clifford was too cowardly to do.

We hope today's sentence, which ensures Clifford can never hurt anyone again, can help the Hunt family with their healing process as they navigate the future and continue to honour the lives of Carol, Louise and Hannah.

Justice Bennathan says he is left in “no doubt this is a sentence I must impose”. The judge, summing up his sentencing remarks, paid tribute to the “astonishing dignity and courage” with which Carol, Louise and Hannah's family conducted themselves throughout the hearing.

As a reminder, John Hunt and Amy Hunt gave powerful victim impact statements, some of which you can read here and here.

The judge also praised the work of the legal teams for the prosecution and defence, as well as the police for their investigation.

BBC racing commentator John Hunt could be seen embracing his surviving daughter Amy and other friends and family members at Cambridge Crown Court.

The judge said:

I am satisfied so that I am sure that you both planned and contemplated killing all three of your victims. I have already mentioned your planning. 

You knew the routine and habits of that household. You clearly anticipated that Carol Hunt would be in the house as you went equipped to trick your way inside.

You must have known Louise Hunt would be working in the building in the garden, as you knew her routine and she was the obvious target to be raped and murdered. 

You knew the routines of the household. You were there for over four hours and must have anticipated that Hannah Hunt would return.

While you had used Louise Hunt's phone to ensure John Hunt would not be home any time soon, you made no such enquiry about Hannah. 

You would have known she wore a uniform for work which she would be bound to come home to change before doing anything else in the evening. 

I am sure that Hannah too was part of your premeditation and that you intended to murder her if the chance presented itself.

Addressing Kyle Clifford's short-lived career in the military, the judge says it could be “significant mitigation” in “many cases” but not in this one.

The judge said in his sentencing remarks:

You have been referred to at times as a former soldier. In many cases that would serve as significant mitigation. 

Not so in your case, however, as your two years in the army included 286 days at home claiming to be ill, you never saw active service, and your utility to the armed forces can be gleaned in a parting comment from your commanding officer that: “His character is wholly unsuited to military employment and he has no care nor concern beyond himself”.

The judge has sentenced Kyle Clifford to a concurrent 20-year sentence for raping his ex-girlfriend Louise Hunt. Justice Bennathan had already said Clifford will never be released from prison after giving him a whole-life order for murdering his ex-girlfriend, her sister and mother.

Clifford has also been sentenced to one year for possession of a crossbow, one year for possession of a knife and eight years for false imprisonment of Louise Hunt.

The judge has praised the heroic and powerful victim impact statements John and Amy Hunt gave at Cambridge Crown Court this morning and afternoon.

Justice Bennathan said:

The statements of John and Amy Hunt also demonstrated great courage and determination that your terrible crimes will not define them or stop them leading the lives Carol, Louise and Hannah Hunt would have wished for them. They showed a gentle heroism of which you can only dream.

“Your brutal and cowardly attack had been planned over about 11 days,” the judge said.

“You conducted extensive research into the movements of Louise's father John, into her mother's Facebook page, into buying a crossbow, a knife and an air pistol, and even into the weather on the day of the attack.”

The judge gave the whole-life order term immediately because he said he didn't want to hold anybody in suspense.

Justice Bennathan said Carol Hunt, 61, had shown “nothing but kindness in the moment before” he attacked her om the day of the triple murder last July.

The judge says Clifford raped and killed Louise after she was “gentle as she could” ending the 18 month relationship, before the former soldier went on to kill her sister Hannah.

The judge summed Clifford up as a “jealous man soaked in self-pity, a man who holds women in utter contempt”.

The judge has given Kyle Clifford, who murdered his ex-girlfriend and her sister with a crossbow and their mother with a butcher's knife, a whole life order with no possibility of parole.

Justice Bennathan said:

This is no occasion to subject family and friends of your victims to any delay or suspense.

I therefore make clear at once that for each of these three murders, the sentence will be one of life imprisonment with a whole-life order. That means a sentence from which you will never be released.

The judge, justice Joel Bennathan, is expected to begin sentencing shortly. The mandatory sentence for the crime of murder is life imprisonment, but a judge sets a minimum term before parole can be considered.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Donald Trump's talk of tariffs and the unpredictability of a trade war is causing investor uncertainty in the ASX 200

The Australian share market has plummeted, shedding more than $45bn after US markets tanked overnight on recession fears.

The benchmark S&P/ASX200 dropped more than 140 points, or about 1.79%, to 7820.1 after jumping off a cliff at the start of Tuesday's session.

The broader All Ordinaries index was down about 1.9%, or 156.4 points, to 8035.3 points.

The main index lost as much as $45bn in market value, from Monday's close of $2.6tn, in the first half of the trading day.

US president Donald Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs have fanned investor uncertainty at a time when the growth outlook of the world's largest economy is being questioned.

“The market's reacting at the moment to a number of factors, but things like concerns of Trump's tariffs, that this could trigger an economic slowdown,” Steven Daghlian, a CommSec market analyst, said.

“The unpredictability of the trade war was something that really weighed on markets last week.”

On Sunday – and in the wake of weaker than expected US jobs and inflation data – Trump could not say if his protectionist policies could lead the US into a recession, sending shockwaves through global markets.

China's retaliatory tariffs on select US imports are set to take effect by Monday. At the same time, US Congress is scrambling to agree to a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown.

On Wall Street, the S&P500 lost 155.21 points, or 2.69%, to end at 5,614.99 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 726.01 points (3.99%) to 17,470.21. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 890.63 points (2.08%) to 41,911.09.

The tech sell-off impacted the so-called “Magnificent Seven” stocks of Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google owner Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, all down more than 5%.

Tech stocks account for roughly a third of the US share market and the Magnificent Seven alone had a combined valuation of US$18tn (A$29tn) in February, greater than the GDP of any nations except the US and China.

“When you have seven stocks that are so large and have such a significant weight on an impact on the broader market, you know that's obviously a risk,” Daghlian said.

All 11 Australian sectors on the local bourse were in the red, led by IT stocks which fell by 4.9%.

The resource sector and financials, which account for more than half of Australia's share market by company size, were down 2.0% and 1.7% respectively.

Consumer discretionary stocks fell more than 2%, while industrials, real estate and health care stocks were all down more than 1% by midday.

The Australian share market slumped about 8.1% from reaching an all-time-high of 8615 on 14 February.

“Yes, we're down heavily, but this is after record highs just weeks ago,” Daghlian said.

The Australian dollar was buying 62.68 US cents, down from 63.16 on Monday afternoon.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Ex-president to face charges of crimes against humanity over ‘war on drugs' that rights groups say left 30,000 dead

The former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte has left Manila on a plane headed to The Hague, hours after he was served with an arrest warrant from the international criminal court over the killings resulting from his “war on drugs”.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr told a press conference that a plane carrying Duterte took off at 11.03pm local time on Tuesday. “The plane is en route to The Hague in the Netherlands, allowing the former president to face charges of crimes against humanity in relation to his bloody war on drugs,” he said.

Duterte's youngest daughter, Veronica Duterte, said on social media that the plane had been used to “kidnap” her father.

The former leader, who will turn 80 this month, is accused by ICC prosecutors of crimes against humanity over his anti-drugs crackdowns, in which as many as 30,000 people were killed. Most of the victims were men in poor, urban areas who were gunned down in the streets.

Duterte was arrested on Tuesday morning at Manila's main airport after flying back from Hong Kong. “Early in the morning, Interpol Manila received the official copy of the warrant of the arrest from the ICC,” the presidential palace said in a statement. “As of now, he is under the custody of authorities.”

Video shared online had earlier showed the former leader walking with a stick and being helped to board the stairs of a plane, surrounded by security. His lawyer, Martin Delgra, told local media it was bound for The Hague, where the ICC is based, although this has not been confirmed by officials until Marcos spoke after its departure.

Marcos, who was previously allied with Duterte's elder daughter Sara, the country's vice-president, had in the past refused to cooperate with the ICC investigation. However, his stance shifted after the two families became embroiled in a feud.

Marcos said the arrest came at the request of the ICC. “I am confident the arrest was proper, correct and followed all necessary legal procedures,” he said after Duterte's departure. “We did not help the International Criminal Court in any way. The arrest was made in compliance with Interpol.”

Sara Duterte said she had “no message” for her former ally. “If you are a Filipino, you will never obey the foreigners inside your own country,” she said. “I don't have any message for [Marcos]. I don't think there's any point talking to a person who will allow a citizen to be turned over to foreigners.”

A video shared by the broadcaster GMA had shown the moment of arrest as Duterte was stopped onboard a plane as he arrived in Manila. “You will just have to kill me. I won't allow you to take the side of the white foreigners,” he said in the footage.

Philippine police said 379 police personnel had been deployed to the airport and other key locations. Duterte told police after he was taken into cusody he should be put on trial in a court in the Philippines. “If I committed a sin, prosecute me in Philippine courts,” he said in a video shared on social media by a relative.

Leila de Lima, one of the fiercest critics of Duterte and the “war on drugs” who was jailed for more than six years on baseless charges under his former government, said: “Today, Duterte is being made to answer – not to me, but to the victims, to their families, to a world that refuses to forget. This is not about vengeance. This is about justice finally taking its course.”

Josalee S Deinla, the secretary general of the National Union of Peoples' Lawyers, which represents the victims of the war on drugs, said justice was “finally catching up” with the former leader.

Much of the day's events were relayed on social media and Veronica Duterte posted updates throughout Tuesday. In one clip, an official said Duterte's family could select three people to accompany him to a charter flight. “Tell where he will be brought. You son of a bitch,” a voice shouted. In another update, Veronica Duterte warned about her father's health, posting a photograph of him resting and receiving oxygen.

Duterte's supporters have argued that, as the Philippines withdrew from the Rome statute in 2019, the ICC no longer has jurisdiction. However, the ICC has previously said it retains jurisdiction for alleged crimes that occurred in the country before its withdrawal.

Rights groups had urged the government to swiftly surrender him to the ICC.

Duterte became president in 2016 after promising a merciless, bloody crackdown that would rid the country of drugs. On the campaign trail he once said there would be so many bodies dumped in Manila Bay that fish would grow fat from feeding on them. After taking office, he publicly stated he would kill suspected drug dealers and urged the public to kill addicts.

Since his election, between 12,000 and 30,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed in connection with anti-drugs operations, according to data cited by the ICC.

Even as his crackdowns provoked international horror, he remained highly popular at home throughout his presidency.

Police reports often sought to justify killings, saying officers had acted in self-defence, despite witnesses stating otherwise. Rights groups documenting the crackdowns allege police routinely planted evidence, including guns, spent ammunition and drugs. An independent forensic pathologist investigating the killings has also uncovered serious irregularities in how postmortems were performed, including death certificates that wrongly attributed fatalities to natural causes.

Duterte, who appeared before a senate inquiry into the drugs war killings in 2024, said he offered “no apologies, no excuses” for his policies, saying: “I did what I had to do, and whether you believe it or not, I did it for my country.” During the same hearing, he told senators he had ordered officers to encourage criminals to fight back and resist arrest, so that police could then justify killing them – but also denied authorising police to kill suspects.

Duterte also told the hearing that he kept a “death squad” of criminals to kill other criminals while serving as a mayor of Davao, before becoming president.

The ICC's investigation into the anti-drugs killings covers alleged crimes committed from November 2011 to June 2016, including extrajudicial killings in Davao City, as well as across the country during his presidency up until 16 March 2019, when the Philippines withdrew from the court.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Highly toxic jet fuel leaking from oil tanker threatens local ecosystems as investigations begin into collision's cause

Leaking fuel from the collision between a cargo ship and oil tanker in the North Sea would have a “devastating” impact on marine life, experts have said, as investigations began into the cause of the incident.

Fires continued to burn onboard both vessels 24 hours after the Stena Immaculate tanker and cargo ship Solong collided off the coast of Yorkshire on Monday morning. A search for a missing crew member was called off overnight.

As investigations stepped up, Downing Street said no evidence of foul play had been found. The owner of the Solong, the German maritime firm Ernst Russ, said the vessel was not carrying any containers “ladened with sodium cyanide”, contrary to reports.

HM Coastguard said the Solong had separated from the Stena Immaculate, which was carrying jet fuel for the US military, at 11.20pm on Monday – about 13 hours after the collision – and had begun to drift southwards. A spokesperson said it was monitoring the development and that a 1km exclusion zone was in place.

Environmental experts warned that the jet fuel leaking from the 183-metre-long Stena Immaculate was toxic for humans and wildlife.

Dr Simon Boxall, an academic in oceanography at the University of Southampton, said the Jet A-1 fuel had a “much higher toxicity” than crude oil and that “the impact of that on life in the oceans would be devastating”.

The ships collided close near a known breeding ground for harbour porpoises as well as a number of other marine and wildlife protected areas, which could now be under threat from any contaminants leaking from the wrecks, environmental NGOs warned.

Just west of the collision site is the Humber estuary and the Wash, one of the UK's most important ecosystems which is home to hundreds of thousands of seabirds, said Sandy Luk, the chief executive of the Marine Conservation Society.

“Thousands of seals and their pups call this stretch of coast home at this time of year, and there are protected areas nearby for harbour porpoises and special marine habitats,” she added.

“Our biggest concern to the environment right now is the degree to which these chemicals accumulate or disperse, both into the water column and the distance they travel. This all depends on the weather, the currents and the extent of the spill.”

Dr Paul Johnston, a senior scientist at the Greenpeace Research Laboratories at Exeter University, said: “The jet fuel that entered the water close to a breeding ground for harbour porpoises is toxic to fish and other sea creatures” 

A US sailor onboard the Stena Immaculate told CBS News that the Solong “came out of the blue”, giving those onboard “only seconds to react”.

The crew member described how flames were lapping at the sailors as they evacuated the burning vessel, leaving some with singed hair.

The whole incident from impact to evacuation lasted about 30 minutes, they said.

The crew member said the Stena Immaculate had anchored at that spot and relayed its coordinates on Sunday, meaning all other vessels should have known where it was.

Dr Seyedvahid Vakili, a maritime expert at the University of Southampton, said it was difficult to determine the main cause of the collision but that in most cases “human factors play a significant role”.

“This is particularly relevant for container vessels where high workloads and fatigue can be major contributing factors. At this stage it needs further comprehensive investigation,” he said.

Matthew Pennycook, a government minister, said coastguard aircraft were monitoring the site of the incident. He said: “We are working with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to assess the impact on water pollution. The fire is obviously still raging.”

He added: “The Maritime and Coastguard Agency are well equipped to contain and disperse any oil spills. We don't think air quality impacts are outside of normal levels, but we will keep the situation under review.”

According to Crowley, the shipping company that manages the MV Stena Immaculate, the vessel was holding 220,000 barrels of jet fuel in 16 segregated cargo tanks.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Air defences engaged in repelling Russian attack on Ukrainian capital; Zelenskyy says ‘significant' part of talks in Saudi Arabia will concern security guarantees

Russia launched airstrikes overnight on Kyiv, with air defence systems engaged in repelling the attack, Ukrainian authorities said late on Monday. “Air defence forces are working to eliminate the threat in the skies over Kyiv,” mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app. Reuters witnesses heard explosions in the capital and surrounding region that sounded like air defence systems in operation.

Ukraine targeted Moscow early on Tuesday in possibly its largest ever drone attack on the Russian capital, reportedly killing at least one person. The attack sparked fires and forced the suspension of flights and train travel, authorities said. Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said Russian air defences had repelled what he said was the largest Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian capital. The regional governor, Andrei Vorobyov, said, “At the moment, one person is known to have died and three were injured.” At least 34 drones were destroyed in a November drone attack on Moscow, the largest in the war till that point.

Russian forces are trying to cross the border and gain a foothold in Ukraine's Sumy province as they press ahead with a counteroffensive aiming to eliminate the last of Kyiv's position in the Russian Kursk region.

Senior US and Ukrainian officials have arrived in Saudi Arabia for high-stakes meetings aimed at repairing a severely damaged relationship that has left Kyiv without Washington's support. Ukraine's delegation, led by Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, will meet the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and other senior White House officials on what is seen as neutral ground in the Saudi city of Jeddah.

Zelenskyy has also flown to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the eve of separate, high-stakes meetings between Ukrainian and US officials.

The Ukrainian delegation will propose a ceasefire covering the Black Sea and long-range missile strikes, as well as the release of prisoners, two senior Ukrainian officials told the Associated Press. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly about Tuesday's meeting, also told The AP that the Ukrainian delegation is ready during the talks to sign an agreement with the United States on access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals – a deal that US President Donald Trump is keen to secure.

Zelenskyy said that Kyiv's position in Tuesday's talks in Saudi Arabia with US officials will be “fully constructive” and that he hopes for practical outcomes from the negotiations on ending the war. Zelenskyy said that a “significant” part of his talks was dedicated to the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine.

The US opposes language that could harm its efforts to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, Rubio said on Monday, as Washington wrangled with G7 allies ahead of a meeting this week, further alarming them. The foreign ministers of the Group of Seven major democracies – Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States – will meet in the river resort of La Malbaie, Quebec on Wednesday-Friday for the first time since President Donald Trump returned to power in January. “We feel like antagonistic language sometimes makes it harder to bring parties to the table, especially since we're the only ones right now that seem to be in a position to make talks like that possible,” Rubio said.

Canada had initially hoped the seven would agree on an overall statement ranging on the war in Ukraine and a second declaration that would outline the G7's efforts to curb Russia's so-called shadow fleet, according to four G7 diplomats who spoke to Reuters. The first statement would have included the Middle East and China, too. Shadow fleet refers to vessels used by Russia to move oil, arms and grains around in violation of international sanctions imposed on it over the war. The vessels are not regulated or insured by conventional western providers.

Almost two pages out of eight in the last G7 statement in November were focused entirely on Ukraine, mostly taking aim at Russia. However, the diplomats said agreement on the full communique this time was proving very difficult, with some fearing that a compromise may not be found. Two diplomats said the United States was seeking to remove references to sanctions and Russia's war in Ukraine, while demanding tougher language on China.

A Democratic US senator who visited Ukraine recently said the Trump administration's suspension of intelligence-sharing had lessened Kyiv's defences against Russia, and dismissed Trump adviser Elon Musk calling him a “traitor.” “One hundred percent,” Senator Mark Kelly told reporters when asked if he had heard during his visit of specific attacks or incidents that would have been affected if Ukrainians had had the intelligence. “If there's stuff they don't get, that they need, that changes their ability to defend against attacks,” Kelly said. “And those attacks happened on Friday night, on Saturday, when I was there.” The Arizona senator did not provide further details.

Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, plans a visit to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, a person briefed on the plans told Reuters. Witkoff, who is officially Trump's Middle East envoy, has played a growing role in efforts to bring about an end to the Ukraine war.

This live coverage has ended.

Rights groups on Monday condemned Israel's decision to cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip. The move Sunday came nine days after Israel halted all aid into Gaza in an apparent effort to pressure Hamas on negotiations after the first phase of a ceasefire deal expired on March 1.

U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territories Muhannad Hadi said Monday that any further delay in the resumption of aid will “further reverse any progress we have managed to achieve during the ceasefire.”

Israel has provided almost no electricity to Gaza since the start of the war in October 2023, but the largely symbolic announcement was nevertheless applauded by the far right, which has argued for the near-total elimination of humanitarian aid, fuel and power supplies as Israel pushes for further hostage releases and its other objectives.

After the electricity cut, Gaza's main functioning desalinization facility, which provides much of the enclave's safe drinking water, has been operating using generators, with capacity reduced by more than 80 percent and fuel reserves for about 10 days if Israel does not permit more fuel deliveries, a senior official for Gaza's Costal Municipalities Water Utility said on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive details.

Gisha, an Israeli human rights group that aims to protect the freedom of movement for Palestinians, renewed a petition to enable humanitarian access into Gaza, saying there “cannot be any dispute that hermetically closing all goods crossings to Israel constitutes a conscious trampling on Israel's obligations as a party to the conflict and as an occupying power.”

President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is expected to travel to the Qatari capital, Doha, on Tuesday for ceasefire talks, according to a U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.

David Mencer, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister's office, said Monday that Israel has accepted an invitation by mediating countries, backed by the United States, to send a delegation to Doha. The delegation left for Qatar on Monday, an Israeli official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy.

The talks would mark the Trump administration's first ceasefire negotiations with representatives or intermediaries of Israel and Hamas.

Mahmoud Khalil and his wife, eight months pregnant with their first child, were returning home to Columbia University housing from a friend's house Saturday night when a group of men in plain clothes approached them in the lobby, according to federal court records.

The men asked if he was Mahmoud Khalil, according to the court records, which identify him only as M.K. but match details of his arrest provided over the weekend by attorneys. When Khalil said yes, the men identified themselves as Department of Homeland Security agents and arrested him. The agents ordered his wife to return to her apartment, and according to his lawyers, told her that if she refused she would be arrested, too. Khalil said he is a permanent resident with a green card; his wife is a U.S. citizen.

A federal court petition demanding Khalil's release provides details of the Trump administration's nighttime arrest of the Columbia University activist, who was swiftly whisked away to a detention center. Lawyers demanding his release say officers violated his constitutional rights and other federal laws, according to the court filing.

President Donald Trump on Monday declared that Khalil's detention “is the first arrest of many to come.”

In a social media post, Trump said ICE “proudly” detained Khalil in compliance with the president's executive orders to target noncitizens who, in his view, engage in activities that are contrary to U.S. interests. Without providing evidence, Trump accused Khalil and other activists of engaging in “pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity” and vowed to banish them permanently.

“We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it,” the president wrote. “Many are not students, they are paid agitators. We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country — never to return again. If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here.” He said he expects all American colleges and universities to comply.

Hundreds of members of Syria's Alawite minority, including women and children, have been killed in reprisal attacks after clashes between government forces and armed remnants of the previous regime spiraled into widespread sectarian bloodshed, monitoring groups and local officials said Sunday, presenting the most serious challenge to the country's stability since the fall of the Assad dynasty in December.

Interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former fighter known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani and a Sunni Islamist, called for national unity Sunday as videos of mass executions and bodies piled in the streets of Alawite villages proliferated online. The scale of the violence in recent days was beginning to emerge: At least 624 people were killed, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, which has documented rights violations in Syria since the popular uprising against Assad rule in 2011.

Other local rights monitors reported similar figures, and Alawite community leaders said they expected the toll to climb as more deaths are verified.

JERUSALEM — Israel will open an office under its Defense Ministry to manage the mass displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to other countries, far-right lawmakers said Sunday, as they pitched their mounting effort to depopulate the territory as being closely aligned with President Donald Trump's own vision to “clean out” and redevelop the enclave.

The formation of the new office, which was not immediately confirmed by the Defense Ministry, would represent a tangible step toward implementing the highly controversial proposal voiced in February by Trump — and cheered on by Israel's right wing — to remove Gazans, after 15 months of war and intense Israeli bombardment that have left the tiny territory in ruins.

At a public hearing on Sunday in Israel's Knesset, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the new “Emigration Authority” would be co-led by the Defense Ministry and the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It would receive enough funding to carry out what he envisions as a “massive logistical operation” to find destination countries that will accept and employ Palestinians from Gaza, he said.

More than 2 million people currently live inside the Strip. Smotrich, who visited Washington last week, said he spoke to U.S. officials who backed the plan.

Israel's energy minister said Sunday that he would immediately cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip, in an apparent effort to pressure Hamas on negotiations after the first phase of a ceasefire deal expired on March 1. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The collision has raised fears of an explosion or environmental catastrophe, with rescue teams racing to the scene.

LONDON — Rescue teams raced to the aid of two cargo vessels that collided Monday in the North Sea off the east coast of England, sparking fires aboard both ships — an oil tanker and a container vessel, British officials said. The incident forced crew members to abandon ship.

More than 40 crew members were taken ashore at the nearby Port of Grimsby,  with one crew member  hospitalized, according to local officials.

The fate of all personnel remained unclear. Graham Stuart, a member of Parliament from the area, told reporters that both ships' full rosters were safe. But the owner of the container ship told the BBC that one person remained unaccounted for.

Officials cautioned that the situation remained unstable, as fears of an explosion or environmental disaster — or both — ran high. Video showed plumes of black smoke and orange flames coming from both ships.

The British coast guard mounted a major rescue operation, with helicopters, planes, lifeboats and firefighting vessels from nearby bases. A pop-up flotilla of private and commercial craft in the area also responded, some reportedly picking up crew members and transporting them to shore.

The 600-foot tanker is the U.S.-flagged Stena Immaculate, a ship that sometimes transports materials for the U.S. military. The other vessel is the Solong, a Portuguese-registered container ship.

The American tanker, having traveled from Greece, was anchored just off the Yorkshire port city of Hull at the time of the collision, according to maritime traffic sites. The Solong was heading south from a Scottish port toward Rotterdam when it struck the stationary tanker, according to an analysis by Marinetraffic.com.

Mayday calls were reported shortly before 10 a.m. local time, the coast guard said. Some residents reported seeing a “massive fireball” after the collision, said Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the Port of Grimsby East.

British Transport Minister Heidi Alexander said on X that her office was monitoring the situation and was in touch with the coast guard.

The Stena Immaculate's joint owner, Crowley Logistics, based in Jacksonville, Florida, said in a statement that the ship was carrying jet fuel. The coast guard said it was preparing for the strong possibility of a spill.

“The incident remains ongoing and an assessment of the likely counter pollution response required is being enacted,” the coast guard said in a statement.

Officials in Hull said they are bracing for a possible environmental catastrophe if the tanker explodes or founders in the sensitive coastal waters where the ship was burning. The ship had been at anchor in the Humber estuary, near the approach to the port.

Hull City Council leader Mike Ross told the BBC that any significant spill could be “devastating.”

Greenpeace UK said in a statement that it was too early to determine the extent of the spill and that weather, currents and then amount of material spilled would determined how serious the damage would be. But the group cautioned that “the high speed of the collision and the footage of the aftermath are cause for great concern.”

The Stena Immaculate is one of a small group of tankers that remain on standby to transport fuel for the U.S. military during times of emergency. It was reflagged as an American vessel in 2023 and staffed with an American crew as part of the program, according to the Crowley Logistics website.

Mark Hartl, a scientist at Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University who studies the impact of chemical pollution on marine organisms, said that the environmental risks posed by jet fuel are likelier to be more immediate and localized than in a heavy crude oil spill.

Components of jet fuel can evaporate more quickly, he said, reducing the likelihood of long oil slicks that run toward the coast. But the fuel can still be hazardous for animals in the area, especially if it is ingested or comes into contact with the gills of fish.

“There's also the issue that a lot of it is burning, so that changes the complexity and chemistry a bit,” Hartl said. “It'll also change how the substances interact” with the animals. “And what else is in that ship?” he said. “There might be other contaminants. It's a bit early to speculate.”

The other ship also carried at least some dangerous cargo, according to Lloyd's List Intelligence; the Solong manifest included some “15 containers of Sodium Cyanide & Alcohol,” a potentially dangerous toxin.

“If you've got huge plumes of this and birds flying through, they will be affected,” Hartl said. “But hopefully they will see this dark plume and simply avoid it.”

The collision occurred in a crowded shipping area under conditions that were moderate but foggy, local officials said. The cause of the accident remains unclear. British officials said investigators were on their way to the scene.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Over the weekend, Russian forces pushed hard against the territory controlled by Ukraine in Kursk, but troops are still holding on.

KYIV — Ukrainian forces battled to stave off fierce Russian attacks both inside Russia and along Ukraine's front lines, as the country's officials prepared Monday for high-stakes talks in Saudi Arabia with an increasingly skeptical ally, the United States.

Ukraine hopes the talks, set to begin Tuesday, will restore relations after a bruising week in which President Donald Trump paused the provision of military aid and intelligence sharing vital for Kyiv to repel Russian attacks. After Russian advances in the Kursk region, where Ukrainians hold a sliver of Russian territory, the Ukrainian military said the situation was stabilizing.

Ukrainian officials will seek to convince the U.S. delegation that they are ready for a swift end to the war, and they are set to present a case for a partial ceasefire after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week he would push for a ban on long-range drone and missile attacks as well as on military operations in the Black Sea.

Trump appeared to indicate a softening of the pressure on Ukraine when he told reporters late Sunday that the United States had “just about” ended a suspension of intelligence sharing with Kyiv and said he expected good results from the talks.

U.S. military and intelligence support for Ukraine may resume if its leaders commit to a peace process, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Monday.

Rubio said the initial suspension of aid “came about because we felt the Ukrainians were not committed” to negotiations. But if that changes, U.S. policy will probably change, too, he said as he landed in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah.

“My hope is we'll have a really good meeting tomorrow and be in a different place,” he added.

The Ukrainian delegation will be led by Zelensky's top aide, Andriy Yermak. Zelensky will not attend the meeting but is  in Saudi Arabia on a separate trip.

Following a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, Zelensky said Ukraine's position in the talks will be “fully constructive.”

In a post on X, Zelensky said the pair discussed the “steps and conditions needed to end the war and secure a reliable and lasting peace,” which the Ukrainian president said included the release of prisoners and the return of children taken during the conflict.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he had spoken with Trump ahead of the U.S.-Ukraine talks and said he hoped for a positive outcome to the talks that would enable U.S. aid and intelligence sharing to be restarted. British officials had been speaking to their Ukrainian counterparts over the weekend, and they remain committed to a lasting peace, he said.

Zelensky is under pressure to support Trump's diplomatic drive to bring a quick end to the war despite the lack of any promises for U.S. security guarantees to prevent new Russian incursions into Ukraine.

Officials in Kyiv are still smarting from last week's sudden pulling of military support, which left many in Ukraine feeling betrayed and leaders across Europe questioning the future of the transatlantic alliance.

The situation “is fragile, and it's based on things that often we don't understand at all. I don't want to make any forecasts anymore because it is completely unpredictable,” one Ukrainian official said.

“Tomorrow's meeting will be very important for Ukraine,” said another senior Ukrainian official, adding that he expected the situation to still change many times. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive situation.

The senior official warned that last week's decision to pause military aid could open the way for Russian propaganda to convince Ukrainians that they had fought — and died — for empty promises from the West, allowing Russia to potentially make political inroads to destabilize the government.

“People will ask for what did we pay a huge price, what was the reason for this: So that one day the Americans said, ‘Thank you, it was a proxy war'?” he said. Russian propaganda will attempt to say: “‘You died not for your interests but for the interests of Uncle Sam. And after this, Uncle Sam betrayed you.' Believe me, we will have enough politicians who will repeat it.”

The pausing of large portions of intelligence sharing appeared to have had an immediate effect on the battlefield. Russian forces advanced on Friday in Russia's Kursk region, seeking to encircle Ukrainian troops and cut off supply lines.

By Monday, however, the situation appeared to be stabilizing after Ukraine sent reinforcements and was mostly able to repel a daring attempt by Russian forces on Saturday to break into Ukraine's strategic stronghold in the town of Sudzha by crawling through a gas pipeline.

A spokesman for the army, Dmytro Likhovy, said Ukrainian forces had been able to “destroy” most of the Russian attack force by blowing up a segment of the pipeline but added that the situation on the front line was still “dynamic.”

Russian ground forces from the Kursk region were making repeated attempts to cross Ukraine's northeastern border in small groups in a relentless effort to try to encircle Ukrainian forces, Likhovy said.

“This is how they are managing to build up a presence,” he said. Ukraine's commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrsky, on Monday said that Ukrainian units were not currently under threat of encirclement.

“The situation is difficult because they control the logistics routes,” said a Ukrainian fighter from the 82nd Brigade, who goes by the call sign Krim. Under military rules, soldiers typically speak on the condition that they are identified only by call sign or first name. “They attempt meat grinder assaults.”

The soldier said that the events of recent weeks had left him feeling “like we're in some kind of surreal TV show rather than reality,” adding that it was “obvious that Trump is on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's side and will pressure us.”

Current and former Ukrainian officials said the withdrawal of U.S. support last week could affect future trust in the United States across Europe, as well as morale among the Ukrainian armed forces. “If things go the way they're going, it is very serious damage to American soft power,” said Oleh Rybachuk, former chief of staff to ex-president Viktor Yushchenko, one of the leaders of the Orange Revolution in which Ukraine first sought to break free from Moscow's orbit 20 years ago.

The U.S. pause in military assistance also impacted the provision of satellite imagery services, affecting commercial providers such as Maxar that had signed contracts with Ukraine.

Rybachuk said the decision would undermine trust in U.S. weaponry and technology. “Can you imagine the shock of the Europeans who realized that if this is how Ukraine is being treated, that this could happen to them? They have all purchased trillions of dollars' worth of U.S. equipment and now they are not sure if that equipment will work.”

Russia has intensified its efforts to retake Ukraine's sliver of Kursk in recent weeks, sending in elite units of paratroopers and marines, as well as several thousand reinforcements of now battle-hardened North Korean soldiers who began fighting in Kursk in the autumn.

According to estimates by military experts, Russia has retaken about half of the territory it lost in the summer. Britain's Defense Ministry said Monday that Ukrainian forces probably maintain control of about 115 square miles (300 square kilometers) of Kursk.

Likhovy said Russian and North Korean forces now far outnumber Ukrainian troops in Kursk. But the change in focus meant Russia was now losing ground in Pokrovsk in the east, he said. “They are sending new forces, and possibly because of this they have reduced pressure in Pokrovsk in Donetsk,” he said. “There, we have been able to stabilize the situation and in some places restore control over territories we lost before.”

Andriy, a drone unit commander operating in Kursk, told The Washington Post that the Ukrainian troop withdrawal from some parts of Kursk was to preserve personnel. He said the troops there had yet to feel the impact of the suspension of American military support.

“The Russians are pressing from all directions now — it's tough, but we are holding on gradually,” he said.

A British couple is challenging the nearly $2,000 fine they received after reporting that a stowaway had hitched a ride home with them from their French vacation.

LONDON — Adrian Fenton and his wife, Joanne, had just returned home from vacation in France when they were startled to discover they had company. A teenager had somehow climbed into the bike rack on their motor home and returned with them all the way back home to Essex, in southern England.

Their next surprise: They were fined almost $2,000 for it.

Four months after the couple reported the stowaway to police, the pair received a 1,500-pound ($1,943) fine in the mail from Britain's Home Office. It said they had failed to properly inspect their vehicle for stowaways upon their return from the Champagne region in October.

“I lifted the cover up, and — lo and behold — I saw a pair of white trainers,” said Fenton, 57, a retired firefighter. “My wife gave him a bottle of water and asked if he was okay.”

The person was detained by police and taken away, Fenton said. The young man told police he was 16 and from Sudan.

The Fentons are in the process of challenging the fine, which they believe was issued unfairly, punishing them for contacting law enforcement and serving only to disincentivize others from doing the same.

“Our fine should be quashed,” Fenton said. “Who in their right mind now would call the police?” he asked. “Now, every single holidaymaker and tourist who hears this story is never going to call the police.”

In 2023, Britain's Conservative government increased the onus on drivers entering the country to inspect their vehicles for stowaways, levying fines of up to 10,000 pounds ($12,956) on those who fail to comply with basic checks for each clandestine traveler found in their vehicle. The legislation was introduced amid a slew of efforts to curb unlawful migration, including an extreme plan — since abandoned — to send asylum seekers to Rwanda.

The Fentons believe that the Sudanese teen climbed aboard their vehicle while it was stationary in northern France, and spent about six hours crammed into their tightly packed canvas bike carrier as they sped under the Channel Tunnel by train and drove to their home in Heybridge, Essex.

Last year, more than 700 Sudanese nationals were found to have arrived in Britain unlawfully, excluding those who arrived by small boat or stopped at a regular port of entry — the most of any nationality. The country has been embroiled in a brutal civil war since April 2023, displacing almost 9 million people within Sudan and leading an additional 3.4 million to flee elsewhere. Britain does not specify in regularly published data the number of people found to have unlawfully entered the country as stowaways.

“We gave him water to make sure he was hydrated, we gave him food,” Fenton said. “He'd obviously gone through a little bit of trauma traveling back, but other than that he was fit and well.” Britain's Home Office declined to provide any details on the stowaway's immigration status, citing a policy against commenting on individual cases.

The strict onus on drivers to check their vehicles is unreasonable, Fenton said. “You can't check your vehicle at every set of traffic lights. … It's impossible and not safe.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Since 2022, the United States has allocated more than $120 billion in aid to Ukraine. European nations have collectively allocated over $140 billion.

A previous version of this article incorrectly said that the United States has allocated more than $100 billion in aid to Ukraine since 2022. The United States has allocated more than $120 billion. The article has been corrected. 

As the United States and Ukraine kick off talks Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, U.S. military aid to Ukraine remains on hold — along with intelligence sharing and satellite imagery services.

The pause began after President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance publicly clashed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office; Trump accused Zelensky of “gambling with World War Three” and not showing enough gratitude for U.S. support.

As Ukrainian and American leaders navigate this rift in relations, here's a closer look at the aid that Ukraine is hoping to get back.

Since 2022, the United States has allocated more than $120 billion in aid to Ukraine — far more than any other country. Meanwhile, European nations have collectively allocated more than $140 billion.

Of the total U.S. aid, about $67 billion has been designated for military support since Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy and the State Department. European countries have allocated $65 billion in military aid in the same time frame.

The effects of the White House's actions, intended to pressure Zelensky into peace negotiations with Russia, can already be felt on the ground. Ukraine has about six months before it runs out of weapons and the Russians gain more territory, said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser in the defense and security department of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).

“Even with the stockpiles of weapons Ukraine has, they will have to reduce their level of operations in a couple of weeks,” Cancian said. “And without strategic and tactical intelligence, we are looking at the Ukrainians having close to two months left before Ukrainian lines begin to buckle at one of the many fronts they are fighting,” he said.

U.S. military aid to Ukraine primarily comes from two sources: weapons drawn from Pentagon stockpiles, known as the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA), and funds that allow Ukraine to purchase arms directly from U.S. manufacturers, known as the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). Weapons purchased through the USAI can take years to be manufactured, according to the Pentagon. The pause in military aid will cause more delays.

Only about 20 percent of the military equipment Ukraine uses to fight comes from the United States, according to the Royal United Services Institute, a British defense think tank; it includes long-range rockets for the multiple rocket-launching system known as HIMARS and Patriot missiles, which are among the most effective air defense weapons in the world.

While Europe and Ukraine can ramp up manufacturing artillery, missiles and other arms that the United States is putting on hold, they are not able to replicate these weapons systems.

“They have done an excellent job marshaling their limited resources, but without U.S. intelligence and aid, it is an impossible task,” said Melinda Haring, a fellow at the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a senior adviser at Razom for Ukraine.

Data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, CSIS and the Defense Department. Kiel estimates the total amount of U.S. aid allocated to Ukraine at more than $120 billion. A congressional report from January reported the number to be over $174 billion. The Kiel Institute told The Washington Post that it tracks only aid that is directly allocated to Ukraine, which means it does not include funding for Ukrainian refugees residing in other countries or the money spent on training Ukrainian soldiers, among other factors. Committed and allocated aid values are approximate because of varying calculation methods and currency conversions for bilateral and military aid to Ukraine. Kiel's monthly allocated military aid values, expressed in U.S. dollars, were calculated using the average exchange rate between euros and dollars for each month.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The agreement was signed by Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.

BEIRUT — Syria's interim government on Monday reached a landmark deal with Kurdish-led authorities to bring the oil-rich northeast under its control, a major win for President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has said he wants to unify the nation but is now under scrutiny after a wave of sectarian killings roiled the country's northwest over the weekend.

The agreement was signed in Damascus during a meeting between Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-majority militia backed by the United States. It recognizes Kurds, who make up about 10 percent of the population, as “an indigenous community of the Syrian state” and guarantees them full political and constitutional rights. The deal also calls for the integration of “all civil and military institutions in northeastern Syria” with the administration in Damascus, giving Sharaa and his government access to the region's airports, border crossings and lucrative oil fields.

The Kurds had carved out a semiautonomous region in the midst of Syria's civil war, and their fighters, backed by U.S. airpower, vanquished the Islamic State group in 2019. Then Syrian rebels led by Sharaa, a onetime insurgent, toppled President Bashar al-Assad in December, and negotiations began to bring the SDF and the territory it controlled under the rule of the new Syrian state.

“In this sensitive period, we are working together to ensure a transitional phase that reflects our people's aspirations for justice and stability​,” Abdi posted on X. “We are committed to building a better future that guarantees the rights of all Syrians and fulfills their aspirations for peace and dignity. We consider this agreement as a real opportunity to build a new Syria that embraces all its components.”

The statement announcing the agreement came just hours after interim authorities said they had ended military operations against Assad loyalists in northwestern Syria. Over the weekend, hundreds of people were killed after clashes between largely Sunni government forces and a nascent insurgency spiraled into sectarian violence against Alawite communities in Tartus and Latakia, along the Syrian coast.

The Syrian Network for Human Rights, which has tracked abuses in Syria since 2011, documented at least 779 deaths between Thursday and Monday, executive director Fadel Abdul Ghany said. Assad is a member of the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam that governed Syria's Sunni Muslim majority for nearly five decades.

The fighting in Syria's Alawite heartland erupted on Friday after a government convoy was ambushed in Beit Ana, a town in Latakia province. Locals there said the attack was in response to the violence and discrimination they've faced since the new government took over. The ensuing gun battles — and later, massacres — were the bloodiest since Assad's fall.

In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Sharaa acknowledged that armed groups who once fought Assad descended on the coast and “many violations occurred.” The operation against former regime's remnants “became an opportunity for revenge,” he said, adding that the killings threatened efforts to unify Syria. It “will impact this path,” Sharaa told the news agency, but he vowed to “rectify the situation as much as we can.”

Hundreds among the government forces were also killed in the fighting, Sharaa and human rights monitors said. He also appointed a committee, including Alawites, to investigate the killings.

In a statement, Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Hassan Abdul Ghani said that government forces were able to “neutralize the security cells and the remnants of the defunct regime” and that plans were in place to continue pursuing Assad loyalists. He said the ministry would cooperate with the committee.

“We will give the investigation committee the full opportunity to uncover the circumstances of the events, verify the facts and provide justice to the oppressed,” Abdul Ghani said.

But while the violence appeared to slow on Monday, many residents are still displaced and say they are afraid to go back home. One resident from Barmiya in Tartus province, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said that she was still hiding in the woods after fleeing gunmen she described as targeting Alawites. “Our only sin is that we are Alawites,” she said in a phone interview. “We are honorable Alawites. We have nothing to do with the rest of the [former] regime.”

Many Syrians have fled into neighboring Lebanon, which already hosts an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees. About 100,000 people, mainly Alawites and Shiite Muslims, also crossed into Lebanon after Assad was overthrown.

On Monday, Syrian state media reported that military police arrested two fighters who were shown in a video clip “committing illegal and bloody violations against civilians in a coastal village.” It was unclear to which faction the fighters belonged.

Israel's energy minister said Sunday that he would immediately cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip, in an apparent effort to pressure Hamas on negotiations after the first phase of a ceasefire deal expired on March 1. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with Ukrainian officials for the first time since the Oval Office blow-up between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky.

The Trump administration may resume U.S. military and intelligence support for Ukraine if its leaders commit to a peace process during a high-stakes meeting Tuesday in Saudi Arabia, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters.

Rubio said the initial suspension of aid “came about because we felt the Ukrainians were not committed” to negotiations to end the three-year war to repel Russia's invasion, but if that changes, U.S. policy will probably change, too, he said Monday as he landed in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah.

“My hope is we'll have a really good meeting tomorrow and be in a different place,” he added.

Rubio's meeting will be his first with senior Ukrainian officials since the Oval Office blow-up between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that resulted in the aid being cut off.

The decision stunned Ukrainian officials and alarmed U.S. allies in Europe who are desperately hoping for the talks to restore U.S.-Ukrainian relations as a wave of Russian attacks has continued to hit government and residential buildings across Ukraine.

Ahead of Rubio's arrival in Jeddah, U.S. officials said they were pleased at the high-level delegation Zelensky chose to send. “The fact that they're coming here at senior levels is a good indication to us that they want to sit down, and they're ready to move forward,” a senior State Department official said on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive talks.

The Ukrainian delegation will be led by Zelensky's top aide, Andriy Yermak, alongside Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and deputy head of the presidential office Pavlo Palisa. Rubio will be joined by White House national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.

Zelensky will not attend the meeting but will be in Saudi Arabia to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh.

“These are separate events,” a Ukrainian official told The Washington Post.

“We hope for results — both in bringing peace closer and in continuing support,” Zelensky said in a video address late Sunday.

Zelensky is under extraordinary pressure to placate the Trump administration and demonstrate support for the president's diplomatic drive despite his unanswered push for a U.S. security guarantee that would deter Russia from reinvading Ukraine.

Trump has insisted that the United States be repaid for the more than $100 billion it has spent in its support for Kyiv since Russia invaded more than three years ago. To that end, Kyiv and Washington are negotiating a deal that would provide the United States access to rare metals in Ukraine that U.S. officials say will provide a type of security guarantee for Ukraine given the presence of U.S. businesspeople — an arrangement many Ukrainian officials view as insufficient.

The Trump administration has ruled out allowing Ukraine into NATO, viewing that as placing new burdens on the United States and obviating a path to peace with Moscow.

Rubio emphasized that the conflict in Ukraine has calcified into a war of attrition, and that neither Russia nor Ukraine can prevail militarily. He said both sides would have to accept concessions but that the first objective for U.S. officials was understanding Ukraine's position.

“The most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things — like the Russians will have to do difficult things — to end this conflict,” he said.

Rubio said the mineral deal was not a core focus of the meetings in Saudi Arabia, but emphasized that “it's certainly a deal the president wants to see done … doesn't necessarily have to be done tomorrow.”

Ukrainian officials have bristled at the way the Trump administration has handled the negotiations, in particular by excluding them from the initial talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia.

Trump, who called Zelensky a “dictator” who was ungrateful for U.S. support, has softened his tone in recent days.

On Sunday, when asked whether he would consider lifting the intelligence pause, Trump said “we just about have. I mean, we really just about have, and we want to do anything we can to get Ukraine to be serious about getting something done.”

Among the types of intelligence that have been suspended is the provision of satellite imagery services used by Ukrainian artillery and drone units to assess quality targets and keep tabs on Russian positions and depots.

Rubio clarified that the Ukrainians are “already receiving defensive intelligence information as we speak.”

The United States also stopped the transfer of any of the $3.85 billion in remaining military equipment available for Ukraine, as well as halted the delivery of weapons already in transit after having been approved by the Biden administration.

“The pause in aid broadly is something I hope we can resolve. Obviously what happens tomorrow will be key to that,” Rubio said.

The latest: The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine's territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.

The fight: Ukrainian troops have  intensified their attacks on the front line in the southeast region, according to multiple individuals in the country's armed forces, in a significant push toward Russian-occupied territory.

The front line: The Washington Post has mapped out the 600-mile front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces.

Fighting alongside Malian soldiers, Wagner mercenaries have massacred civilians and burned their villages in northern Mali, fueling a fast-growing refugee crisis.

BASSIKOUNOU, Mauritania — Families travel through the night on desert backroads, arriving in this desolate borderland each day with new stories of terror about the White men in masks who drove them from their homes.

Mercenaries with Russia's Wagner Group, fighting alongside Malian soldiers, have assaulted women, massacred civilians and burned villages in Mali, the displaced say — a campaign of wanton violence that is fueling a rapidly growing refugee crisis to the west in neighboring Mauritania.

“We have never seen anything like this,” said Kossi ag Mohamed, a 31-year-old herder who described fleeing his village in Mali's Timbuktu region. Wagner, he said, had brought “catastrophe.”

Mali's military junta, which seized power from the democratically elected president in a coup d'état in 2020, began working with Wagner in late 2021. Nearly two years later, the future of the Kremlin-linked mercenary group was thrown into doubt when its founder, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, was killed in a plane crash after a short-lived rebellion against President Vladimir Putin.

But Wagner never went away, and its fighters have continued to deploy overseas — a shadow force that experts say now operates as an extension of Russia's Defense Ministry. In Mali, the group's footprint has only grown, according to analysts and visuals verified by The Washington Post, providing a revenue stream for Putin's cash-strapped government and a base of influence for Moscow in an increasingly anarchic West Africa.

Malian authorities say the partnership is designed to combat Tuareg separatists — who have long agitated for their own state in northern Mali — as well as militant groups loyal to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. But it is civilians, not armed groups, that have borne the brunt of Wagner's brutality.

“They kill people very indiscriminately,” said Héni Nsaibia, West Africa senior analyst for the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED, a nonprofit research group. “They see a convoy of transport vehicles or people doing business, and they attack. They kill men, women and children. Then they loot the goods.”

Russia's Defense Ministry, Wagner and the Malian government did not respond to requests for comment for this article.

In recent months, Ag Mohamed said, the men in his area had developed a grim ritual: hiding in the trees when they heard a military convoy approaching, and then, when it was safe, following the gunshots they had heard to collect the dead.

His eyes were blank as he scrolled through videos he said he and his friends had taken. One showed seven bloodied corpses sprawled on the ground. In another was a decapitated man, his head placed between his hands. The bodies of women and children were visible in a third video, lying in the ashes of a burned home.

“It is death that made me flee,” Ag Mohamed said. “I saw death everywhere.”

When Mali's junta extended the invitation to Wagner — it always said its contract was with the Russian state, not the Kremlin-linked mercenary group — violence by Islamist extremists was on the rise. One of Wagner's goals, an operative recounted in a recent interview, was helping the army take back bases and territory that had fallen under the control of extremists.

The Malian government pays about $10 million a month for Wagner's services, analysts say, a boon to Moscow as it weathers international sanctions over its war in Ukraine. Russia has also been awarded concessions at several gold mines, giving the country a material stake in Mali's security.

Although Malian forces have made some gains since the arrival of the Russian mercenaries, now believed to number around 1,500, experts say military operations in areas beyond state control have been characterized by overwhelming brutality.

“It's a policy of ‘kill them all,'” said Wassim Nasr, a Sahel specialist and senior research fellow at the Soufan Center. “They are trying to terrorize the local population.”

ACLED estimates that at least 925 civilians were killed last year in attacks involving Wagner — more than double the 400 civilians the group estimates were killed by Islamist militants.

Andrew Lebovich, a research fellow with the Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands, said that Mali's military has long been accused of human right violations but that the scale and ferocity of abuses have increased since Wagner entered the picture.

The mercenaries have adopted “dirty-war tactics,” Lebovich said, including kidnapping, torture and decapitation. Multiple refugees told The Post that corpses were often mutilated before the army withdrew.

Even before the crush of new arrivals, the Mbera refugee camp in Mauritania's southeastern desert had become the third-largest population center in the country.

Tens of thousands of Malians arrived here in 2012, when extremists and separatists overran much of their country, and the camp continued to grow over the next decade as Mali lurched from one crisis to the next. But the exodus last year was unprecedented; there are now some 149,000 people in and around Mbera — triple the number in 2023, according to the United Nations. The camp itself is long past capacity and sprawls in every direction.

In more than two dozen interviews, refugees who have arrived since 2023 said it was attacks by Mali's military and its Russian allies — not Islamist militants — that made them flee. Al-Qaeda's regional affiliate, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin, or JNIM, controls large amounts of territory in Mali and competes for influence with a local branch of the Islamic State, which is smaller but more brutal.

Some refugees said that they had experienced intimidation years ago from extremists who sought to impose their rule but that village life had largely returned to normal before the army came.

“They consider everyone who wears a turban a terrorist,” said 45-year-old Cherfe ag Mama, who said his brother was killed by Wagner mercenaries in the Timbuktu region.

A women's leader in the camp, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject, described a whisper network of women who have shared stories of sexual assault committed by Wagner operatives.

Aïssata Kelli, a 40-year-old mother of two, recounted the moment gunmen burst into her home in November. She was too terrified to look at them for long, but she said she saw they were White, wore masks and shouted a version of the same two questions, again and again.

“Where are the jihadists?” Kelli remembered the men yelling in French at her and a few other women nearby. “Where are your husbands?”

Most of the men in their village, including Kelli's husband, had fled when they heard the military was en route. Kelli told the men that her husband was not a jihadist and that she did not know where he was. The White men screamed and hit her as they stripped off her clothes, she recalled, searching for a phone they thought she was hiding.

“I am even scared at the memory,” said Kelli, as she sat beside her husband, a partly blind herder, in their recently erected tent. “I thought they were going to kill me.”

The attack on their village lasted for three agonizing days, according to Kelli and her friend, 35-year-old Siray Bah. Wagner mercenaries and Malian soldiers ransacked homes and businesses, the women said, then set them on fire.

Five men, including the village imam, were killed, and several others were kidnapped. Among them was Bah's husband, father to her seven children, taken by gunmen from the market where he had gone to buy food for the family.

Bah, nursing her newborn baby, said she called his phone repeatedly in the days after he disappeared. No one ever answered.

While Wagner's initial focus was on central Mali, analysts say, the group has increasingly expanded its operations into the north — the epicenter of a long-running fight between the state and ethnic Tuareg rebels, who have fought for decades to establish an independent state.

One of Wagner's most significant victories in Mali was taking back the historic rebel stronghold of Kidal in 2023; the group suffered its largest setback last summer, losing dozens of men in a battle with Tuareg fighters near the Algerian border.

Analysts said the losses were controversial in Russia, and prompted questions about the future of the group in Africa. But in recent months, there has been a spike in military equipment coming from Russia into Mali, according to analysts and visuals.

Jennifer Jun, an associate fellow for imagery analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said satellite images show signs of recent expansion at a military base at Bamako's Modibo Keita International Airport, where Wagner has been known to operate since 2021.

There have also been more recruitment efforts by Wagner, and more chatter on social media from the mercenaries themselves.

“Mali was really a black box,” said Lou Osborn, the founder of All Eyes on Wagner, a nonprofit that investigates the mercenary group. “The images we saw of Wagner in the country were not from Russians. Now Russians are communicating.”

In a video published on Telegram in December, two veterans of the Wagner Group — Alexander Kuznetsov, known by the nom de guerre “Ratibor,” and Ruslan Zaprudsky, or “Rusich” — drive through a crowded street in Bamako, Mali's capital, with their faces unmasked and un-blurred.

On Feb. 16, a Wagner-affiliated Telegram account posted photos of a fire blazing near Kidal, with a caption that says the town “has undergone a slight transformation.” Planet Labs satellite imagery between Feb. 15 and 17 shows a burn scar almost two miles long running beside the village.

Analysts said the location of the fire on the edge of a community suggests a strategy of intimidation, likely intended to force people out.

In most places, the border between Mali and Mauritania is no more than a line in the sand.

When Wagner is conducting an operation, the displaced cross the border throughout the day, said Ibrahim Sidi Mohamed, the local leader in Douankara, a once-sleepy village on the Mauritanian side, about 30 miles from Mbera.

The number of families living in Douankara has exploded since 2023, from 380 to 4,020, he said. They come in pickup trucks, bringing only the things they can carry. The lucky ones have room for their livestock.

People live in tents, or in one-room structures they've cobbled together from wood and tin. Even for those who make it to the village, there is no promise of safety.

Ould Bacana, a 30-year-old refugee who had been living in Douankara, was killed by a Wagner patrol three miles from the village, according to Mohamed and Bacana's mother.

Bacana, the family breadwinner, had been on his way to sell goods at a cattle market just across the border in Mali when he and a handful of other men were killed by Russian mercenaries, witnesses later told Mohamed. Locals found the bodies and buried them in shallow graves covered with branches and twigs.

“It is only women that are left — they have killed all the men,” Bacana's mother, Izi Sidi Ahmed, said as she sat curled in her tent. The tiny woman nodded at her teenage son, saying she did not let him venture across the border, even though the family now has little to eat.

“What are we supposed to do?” she asked, repeating the question as if to herself.

“What are we supposed to do?”

Syrian doctors have established themselves in Germany, filling critical health-care gaps. But Assad's fall and anti-migrant sentiment have some torn.

HAMBURG — Amid rising calls in Germany for Syrians to return home after the fall of Bashar al-Assad, one group of professionals is being encouraged to stay: doctors.

Germany opened its doors a decade ago to nearly 1 million Syrians, taking in more than any other country in Europe. Today, some 6,000 Syrian doctors make up the single largest group of foreign-born physicians, filling vital gaps in care at hospitals and clinics from the Alps to the Baltic Sea. That is especially true in rural areas, where attracting doctors can be hard. But even in big cities, Syrian doctors now make up the majority of attending physicians at some medical practices.

“Whole areas in the health sector would fall away if all the Syrians who work here now were to leave our country,” Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said.

In interviews with The Washington Post, four Syrian doctors said they shared the adrenaline rush experienced by many of their countrymen on the December night that Assad fled. They danced for joy in their homes and made homemade Syrian flags to wave alongside the throngs who celebrated in German streets.

But they were quickly gripped by conflicting sentiments. Syria — where over half the hospitals are now nonfunctional, and even more are facing the threat of closure due to funding shortfalls — desperately needs them. For many of them, though, even with all the anti-migrant sentiment, Germany has begun to feel like home.

They now face a painful dilemma: To stay or go.

Ibrahim Musawel, 30, vividly recalls the day he left his hometown of Hama in 2020. “I looked around the street where I grew up and said, ‘Goodbye, I'm never going to see this street again.' I was so sure that I would never return, not even to visit,” he said, pausing to hold back tears at the hospital in Hamburg where he now works.

He arrived in Germany by plane, on the cusp of the pandemic. He worked on his language skills while waiting for approval of his asylum claim (which took 10 months) and recognition of his Syrian medical license (another eight months). He has built a full life. Outside work, he regularly hits the gym and then meets friends at a bar to watch a local Bundesliga soccer club.

The night Assad fell, he joined other Syrian friends in a sort of digital vigil. “I had my laptop and tablet open with different channels on YouTube. We were all waiting to see who would break the news first.”

He texted his brother, who resettled in Egypt at the start of the Arab Spring. “I haven't seen him in 14 years. I said … ‘Are we really all going back? Can it really be that we all go home? That we're all in the same city again?'”

But as the days passed, Musawel grew reluctant. “I still have three years of advanced training ahead of me, and it's still difficult for me to imagine returning right now to live and work in Syria.”

“I'd like to visit. But to carry on living there … the country needs more time. I would like to help rebuild the country. But I'm not sure yet whether I would continue living there.”

Rania Kadib Alban — an ear, nose and throat specialist in her late 30s — speaks in Arabic on her comedic Instagram account. Addressing an audience back in Syria, she performs multicharacter skits poking fun at old wives' tales about medicine. In one reel about how to treat a nosebleed, she dons a wig to play a grandmother who thinks she knows better than a trained medical professional.

But the ENT's German is now so good that an elderly patient at the Berlin practice where she works recently mistook her for a native-born local before railing against foreigners — an interaction Alban described as “funny, sad, racist.”

When Assad fell, she put together a homemade Syrian flag for her son before the whole family made their way to central Berlin. They celebrated with other Syrians in the streets. Since then, she and her husband, also a Syrian doctor, have talked about what to do.

“Of course, we have thought about [the possibility of returning], but it's not so easy,” she said. “We've built up stable professional lives here in Germany.”

From her home in the southern reaches of Berlin, she's begun offering free remote consultations to patients in Syria. For now, that's the most she's likely to do.

Her children, both born here, prefer German food to Syrian. After reading an article about racism in the workforce, she had opted to give them Western-sounding names: Stefan is 6 and Ella Sofie is 2. They speak German far better than Arabic.

Syria was her home, not theirs.

Yet the political winds in Germany frighten her, too. The co-leader of the Alternative for Germany party, which placed second in last month's election, recently said all Syrians who had celebrated Assad's fall should go home. Such calls are often followed by more nuance: There are good Syrians and bad Syrians; the good ones, like doctors, should stay.

“As doctors we're a little safer, because the German health-care system needs us,” she said. But she added, “If my family and friends aren't allowed to stay, then I don't want to either.”

Like other Syrian doctors his age, Mohamad Ghazal, 32, left Syria in part to avoid military service. Now that the Assad regime is gone, he said he feels a duty to help his broken country rebuild.

He will start small. He is renegotiating his labor contract so he can work in Syria several months this year. The Syrian Health Ministry, he said, has approved a special work permit allowing him to care for patients. He is hoping to advise on the modernization and rebuilding of Syria's devastated health sector and hospitals.

He and other Syrian doctors who once fled are moving forward with plans to open six medical centers that will provide a first point of contact for patients with minor illnesses, build networks with larger medical facilities and offer online appointments. The project will be partially supported by the German Development Ministry, which is providing $16 million to aid organizations and hospitals.

As much as he feels “obliged” to help Syria rebuild, he still sees himself remaining in his adopted home long term. He has been living in Germany since 2017, when a family reunification program helped unite him with his brother, a Syrian doctor working in the eastern state of Thuringia.

“I'm part of the German health-care system, and that will remain the case,” he said.

After arriving in Germany in 2019, Mouhammad Dekkeh, 32, was shocked to realize that despite months of German lessons to secure a visa for advanced medical training, he couldn't understand much. “I arrived here and realized that in real life, everyone sounds very different from the teacher speaking high German,” he said, laughing, at the Hamburg hospital where he works.

The state of health care in Germany made him think about how much had been lacking when he worked in Syria. “We had many patients who also needed diagnostics, but unfortunately we didn't have the right machines,” he said. “There were supposed to be three CT machines available on standby, but we only had one — and it wasn't even fully functional.”

Assad's state security, he said, had cast a long shadow over the work of medical staff. Strict rules obliged medical professionals to report accidents to authorities, and falsifying causes of death was common practice, he said.

As the rebels advanced there in December, Dekkeh didn't sleep for two days, he said, as he anxiously awaited the final word that Assad had fallen. When the news came, he broke down. “I cried at first, because I had that feeling that I have a home country again,” he said.

“My first thought was, I could go home. Of course I was so glad in those first moments. Syria is free. But that was more the initial euphoria that was in my head.”

The reality of the destruction eventually caught up with the initial exhilaration. “I can't return right now. I can't just leave my advanced training and life here. My advanced medical training here just isn't possible in Syria, because the infrastructure has been destroyed,” he said.

“I want to go back on vacation, but reaching a decision is very difficult for me. I first have to see how the situation in Syria develops.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Numerous rivers are still in major flood stage, and there's widespread beach erosion.

Cyclone Alfred struck the east coast of Australia late Friday, unleashing strong winds, rough surf and dangerous rip currents along popular beaches over the weekend. An estimated 10 to 15 inches fell around Brisbane and on Moreton Island during the storm.

Widespread beach erosion and coastal wind damage affected parts of Queensland and New South Wales, while inland areas also felt the effects of heavy rain and freshwater flooding. In addition to the 15 inches in those areas, northeastern New South Wales also saw heavy rain, with 4 to 10 inches from Newcastle to the Queensland border. Sydney only saw an inch or two in most of its suburbs.

Meanwhile, nearly 5 inches of rainfall was recorded in a single hour at Cracow in New South Wales between 6:22 p.m. and 7:22 p.m. on Monday evening. In Pine Hills, 2 inches was recorded, and the Durah Homestead Alert saw 3 inches in two hours during the afternoon.

Before Alfred formed, the instigating system initially formed northeast of Australia over the Coral Sea on Feb. 20. It was upgraded to a tropical storm two days later, and began quickly intensifying. On Feb. 27, the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded Alfred to a Category 4-equivalent cyclone with winds of up to 130 mph at its core. The system was still offshore but exhibited a pinhole eye on satellite.

Alfred lingered offshore for another week and a half before weakening and making landfall on Moreton Island, South East Queensland, late Friday evening. Moreton Island is just east of Brisbane. A named storm hasn't passed this close to Brisbane — the country's third-largest city, with 2.7 million people — since Zoe in 1974.

Winds were estimated at 45 mph, meaning the system was the equivalent of a low-end tropical storm. Still, the slow-moving nature of the storm caused serious erosion.

Tropical cyclones (and all low-pressure systems) spin clockwise in the southern hemisphere, so the heaviest rain totals — associated with onshore flow — hit south of the storm's center.

Meanwhile, scattered strong to severe thunderstorms continue to affect Australia; most of Queensland was under a severe thunderstorm warning Monday evening local time.

The Bureau of Meteorology warned of additional “major flood warnings” in effect for the following rivers:","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Follow:


            Former President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested by the Philippine government on Tuesday after it said it received an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant accusing him of crimes against humanity.
    


            Duterte has been investigated by the ICC over his brutal anti-drugs crackdown during his time in office that killed more than 6,000 people based on police data, though independent monitors believe the number of extrajudicial killings could be much higher.
    


Duterte, 79, was taken into custody amid chaotic scenes at the main airport in the capital Manila after returning to the Philippines from Hong Kong on Tuesday.
    


            Interpol's Manila office had received “the official copy of the arrest warrant from the ICC” on Tuesday morning, according to a statement from the Presidential Communications Office.
    


            “Upon his (Duterte's) arrival, the Prosecutor General filed an ICC notification for an arrest warrant against the former President for crimes against humanity,” the statement said, adding that Duterte is currently in the custody of authorities.
    


            Duterte questioned the basis for the warrant.
    


            “What is the law and what is the crime that I committed?” he said in a video posted online by his daughter Veronica “Kitty” Duterte.
    


            CNN has reached out to Interpol and the ICC for comment.
    


            Previously labeled “Asia's Trump” by some commentators due to his unorthodox leadership style and bombastic rhetoric, Duterte swept to power in 2016 on a promise to wage war against drugs and drug pushers in the Southeast Asian nation.
    


            The ensuing brutal crackdown killed thousands – many of the victims were young men from impoverished shanty towns, shot by police and rogue gunmen as part of a campaign to target dealers.
    


            The bloodshed prompted an investigation by the ICC and a monthslong House of Representatives inquiry, as well as a separate Senate inquiry led by the cousin of the current president.
    


            Duterte has repeatedly denied the extrajudicial killing of alleged drug suspects, although he also openly admitted to ordering police to shoot suspects who resist arrest.
    


            Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the ICC, but under the ICC's withdrawal mechanism, the court keeps jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period of a state – in this case, between 2016 and 2019, when the Philippines' pullout became official.
    


            Meanwhile, the government of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who was elected in 2022, has indicated that Duterte could be handed over to the court, Reuters reported.
    


            “Our law enforcers are ready to follow what law dictates, if the warrant of arrest needs to be served because of a request from Interpol,” Presidential Communications Undersecretary Claire Castro told reporters on Monday, according to Reuters.
    


            At Sunday's event in Hong Kong, Duterte lashed out at the ICC amid speculation the global body would issue a warrant for his arrest over his role in the drugs crackdown.
    


            “From my own news, I have a warrant … from the ICC or something,” Duterte told his supporters in Hong Kong.

            “What did I do wrong? I did everything that I could in my time, so there is a little bit of quiet and peace for the lives of the Filipinos.”
    


            Responding to reports that the former president was in custody, his former spokesperson Harry Roque said: “The warrant of arrest has no basis because it was issued at a time when we are no longer a member of the ICC.”
    


            “What is happening right now is unlawful detention,” Roque said in a livestream on Facebook. “We have not seen the warrant of arrest from the police or Interpol.”
    


            But rights groups welcomed Duterte's detention and urged the Philippines to hand the former president over to the ICC.
    


            Duterte's detention “is a critical step for accountability in the Philippines,” said Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “His arrest could bring victims and their families closer to justice and sends the clear message that no one is above the law.”
    


            Before becoming president, Duterte laid the groundwork for his bloody war on drugs that pitted police armed with impunity against drug users, small-time dealers and kingpins.
    


            As mayor of Davao City, a metropolis of 1.5 million people on the southern island of Mindanao, Duterte built a national reputation over two decades for his no-nonsense approach to crime.
    


            He advocated a hardline approach to criminals and claimed to have drastically reduced Davao's previously high rates of violent crime. But along with this reputation came allegations that he was connected to extrajudicial killings by a well coordinated group of vigilantes.

            In his last campaign speech before the 2016 election he told a crowd to “forget the laws of human rights.”
    


            “If I make it to the presidential palace, I will do just what I did as mayor. You drug pushers, hold-up men and do-nothings, you better go out. Because as the mayor, I'd kill you,” Duterte said.
    


            As president, Duterte embraced the same unfiltered rhetorical style he displayed on the campaign trail. Shortly after taking office, he referred to then-US President Barack Obama a “son of a bitch” – though later apologized and said he was referring to a journalist.
    


            Despite frail health and the looming threat of an ICC arrest warrant, Duterte in October registered to run for mayor of his southern home city. The move was widely seen as an attempt to to strengthen his scandal-hit political dynasty amid a bitter falling out between his daughter Vice President Sara Duterte and Marcos Jr.

            A Syrian military operation against remnants of the former Assad regime has now ended, having sparked some of the worst violence seen in the country in years.
    


            Hundreds of people have been killed in the crackdown and fighting between the security forces and supporters of former President Bashar al-Assad since Thursday.
    


            What began as clashes between armed groups loyal to Assad and forces loyal to the new Syrian regime quickly spiraled into communal killings, with a war monitor saying at least 803 people had been killed.
    


            Eyewitness testimonies and video verified by CNN showed government loyalists carrying out field executions, with some speaking of “purifying” the country.
    


            Here's what we know about the bloodshed.
    


            The violence erupted in the heartland of former ruler Assad, where the Alawite leader drew most of his support.
    


            Alawites are a minority Shiite Muslim sect living predominantly in Sunni-majority Syria. The Assad family, members of the sect, ruled Syria for over half a century until Bashar was ousted in December by Sunni Islamist militants who sought to reshape the country's political and sectarian order.
    


            Throughout Assad's rule, the Alawite sect became increasingly linked, in the eyes of his opponents, to the atrocities committed by his regime during the Syrian civil war.
    


            Interim Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who once led the al Qaeda-linked group that toppled Assad late last year, has previously promised political equality and representation to the various sects of Syria's diverse ethnic and religious populations.
    


            The fragility of the new Syria was nonetheless laid bare by the events of recent days. On Thursday, Syria's state-run SANA news agency reported deadly clashes erupting between Syrian government forces and pro-Assad groups in the coastal Latakia province.
    


            SANA reported that “remnants of Assad militia groups” attacked government checkpoints and patrols, killing and wounding many.
    


            Over the weekend, the operation against Assad loyalists spiraled into communal killings. Armed men linked to the new regime carried out field executions and spoke of purifying the country, according to eyewitnesses and video verified by CNN.
    


            The UK-based Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) said on Tuesday that among the 803 killed, “non-state armed groups” loyal to Assad were responsible for the deaths of 383 people, including 172 members of state security forces and 211 civilians. Government forces and affiliated groups were responsible for the deaths of at least 420 people, including “civilians and disarmed militants,” according to SNHR, including 39 children, 49 women, and 27 medical workers.
    


            Sharaa has blamed the violence on the remains of Assad's forces, claiming they were trying to incite sectarian strife.
    


            On Sunday, he said his government would hold accountable anyone involved in the deaths of civilians during the heavy fighting. Sharaa had previously described the violence as “expected challenges.”
    


            Syria's interim government vowed to form an independent committee to “investigate and ascertain the facts,” and submit a report to the presidency within 30 days.
    


            The committee will “uncover the reasons, circumstances, and conditions that led to these events,” a statement by the Syrian interim presidency said, adding that it will “investigate the violations committed against civilians and identify those responsible.”
    


            It will also “investigate attacks on public institutions, security forces and the military, and determine accountability.” Those found guilty will be referred to the judiciary, it added.
    


            In an interview with Reuters Monday, Sharaa said that “Syria is a state of law.”
    


            “The law will take its course on all,” he told Reuters from Damascus.
    


            Sharaa blamed the outbreak of violence on a former military unit loyal to Assad's brother and an unspecified foreign power, according to the agency. The president also said that, in response, “many parties entered the Syrian coast and many violations occurred,” Reuters reported.
    


            “It became an opportunity for revenge,” Sharaa added.
    


            The killings in Syria threaten to undermine Sharaa's efforts to end the country's isolation and rebuild diplomatic ties that could ease the heavy sanctions imposed since Assad's rule.
    


            The former jihadist-turned-president has repeatedly told Western media that he envisions an inclusive Syria and has vowed to prevent revenge killings and sectarian violence.
    


            Several countries have condemned the violence in the strongest terms.
    


            The United States on Sunday denounced what it said were “radical Islamist terrorists, including foreign jihadis, that murdered people in western Syria in recent days.”
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US stands with religious and ethnic minorities in Syria, and that “interim authorities must hold the perpetrators of these massacres” accountable.
    


            The European Union, which last month removed some restrictions on Syria in order to “support an inclusive political transition,” also condemned the recent violence, saying “civilians have to be protected in all circumstances in full respect of international humanitarian law.”
    


            The bloc also called “on all external actors to fully respect the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Syria.”
    


            Following Syria's civil war over a decade ago, regional actors and world powers – including Saudi Arabia, Iran, the US, Russia and Turkey – vied for influence, escalating the conflict into what some observers described as a “proxy war.” ISIS was also able to gain a foothold in the country before suffering significant blows.
    


            Syria has been home to a number of foreign fighters over the years. It is unclear how many remain.
    


            Several videos appeared on social media showing convoys of armed men in vehicles in the run-up to the violence, with some speaking in foreign Arabic dialects.
    


            As the latest violence erupted, several foreign powers also traded blame.
    


            Turkey, which made significant gains in Syria after Assad was toppled, had previously warned Iran against attempts to destabilize Syria in comments that later triggered Tehran to summon Turkey's ambassador, Reuters reported, citing state TV.
    


            Speaking at a news conference Sunday in Amman, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said there has been an “effort to derail the Syrian government's weeks-long policy of not reacting to provocations,” according to the state news agency Anadolu.
    


            “We are, of course, committed to fully supporting the newly formed government in Syria and backing all of its efforts to stabilize the country,” he said.
    


            Meanwhile, some people appear to be seeking protection from Russia, with satellite imagery captured on March 10 and shared by Maxar Technologies showing throngs of people crowding an entrance to the Russian-run Khmeimim Air Base, less than 20 kilometers from central Latakia.
    


            The effects of the recent bloodshed are unlikely to disappear, experts said, especially as triggers of this violence are deeply rooted in Syria's past.
    


            Unless core issues are addressed by the government – including inclusivity, political participation and unequal living conditions throughout the country – Syria may not recover from its ongoing sectarian strife, according to analysts.
    


            “Syria has gone through more than 13 years of horrific, debilitating conflict that has created the kind of social fissures, anger, fury, thirst for revenge amongst many that just isn't going to realistically go away for a long time,” Charles Lister, a senior fellow and head of the Syria Initiative at the Middle East Institute in Washington, DC, told CNN, adding that the pro-Assad insurgency is also unlikely to completely disappear.
    


            Syria's future in relation to Western countries may also rest on the new government's ability to address recent events and guarantee accountability, other experts said.
    


            In his interview with Reuters, Sharaa recognized the violence of the past days “will impact” his attempt to bring Syria together, but vowed to “rectify the situation as much as we can.”
    


            Haid Haid, a Syrian columnist and a consulting fellow with the Middle East and North Africa program at the Chatham House think tank in London, said that many of Syria's next steps will depend on whether Sharaa holds all those involved in the violence accountable.
    


            “Dealing with the root causes of the problem, at least some of them, will be crucial,” Haid said, including making sure that the Alawite community does not feel marginalized.
    


            Some Alawite residents who fled coastal areas in Syria amid the clashes told CNN Monday they are too afraid to return to their homes despite the government's announcement that the military operation is over.
    


            How Western countries perceive Syria's transitional period after the violence is yet to be seen. Lister said that while recent events may exacerbate US skepticism on Syria's new government, European countries are keen to see the interim government stabilize the country.
    


            “From the Europeans, we're hearing a very different language, obviously criticism and concern about civilian killings, but also doubling down on the idea that the interim government needs to stabilize,” he said.
    


            Regional players have also shown support for the lifting of sanctions despite the violence. On Sunday, Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon held a meeting with Syrian officials in Amman, where they called for the lifting of sanctions on Syria “to enhance its capabilities for rebuilding Syria and meeting the needs of the Syrian people,” according to a joint statement.
    


            Haid added that to move forward, Syria must not isolate “the security incidents from the wider fragile and worsening context.”
    


            “Addressing what's happening through security measures alone will not be enough, even if they are able to stop those attacks in the near future,” he said. “The root causes will remain there.”

Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo predicts a 'momentous battle' in the courts over President Donald Trump's pause on funding for USAID and discusses the DOJ's request to the Supreme Court to allow Trump's desired firings.

A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to pay the remainder of foreign aid owed to contractors for completed work, noting in a new court ruling that the administration likely violated the separation of powers doctrine by ""unlawfully impounding"" nearly $2 billion in funds appropriated by Congress.

U.S. District Court Judge Amir Ali, a Biden appointee, said in the ruling that the Trump administration likely exceeded its constitutional authority in attempting to block the payments owed by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to grant recipients and foreign aid contractors.

""Here, the executive has unilaterally deemed that funds Congress appropriated for foreign aid will not be spent,"" Ali said.

""The executive not only claims his constitutional authority to determine how to spend appropriated funds, but usurps Congress' exclusive authority to dictate whether the funds should be spent in the first place.""

SCOTUS RULES ON NEARLY $2 BILLION IN FROZEN USAID PAYMENTS

Ali said the limits of the case, which focuses solely on projects completed before Feb. 13, prevent him from ordering the administration to make payments on other work, or ordering the reinstatement of other contracts. 

As of last Friday, that amount owed by the government stood at around $671 million. It is unclear whether additional payments have been made, though Ali ordered the plaintiffs to file a joint status report by March 14 apprising the court of the Trump administration's compliance with the order.

Plaintiffs were also told to propose a schedule for next steps in this matter. ""The Court is prepared to hold a prompt hearing at the request of the parties to address any feasibility concerns,"" Ali said in the 48-page order.

Ali also dedicated a large portion of the 48-page ruling to arguments that the Trump administration likely usurped its executive authority under the Constitution in ordering a blanket freeze on nearly all foreign aid payments in a Jan. 20 executive order, and a memo just four days later that curtailed foreign aid funding and restructured existing contracts. 

White House and State Department officials did not immediately respond to the Fox News's request for comment on the status of the remaining payments, or if the amount owed still stands at $671 million.

Ali had previously ordered the Trump administration to pay all owed foreign aid funds for previously completed work, totaling $1.9 billion, by Feb. 26 at 11:59 p.m. 

The Supreme Court took up the case for emergency review last week, but ruled 5-4 to reject the administration's request to extend the freeze. Instead, the court remanded the case back to the D.C. federal court and Ali to hash out the specifics of what must be paid and when.

But the bulk of last week's hearing in D.C. federal court, which stretched on for more than four hours, focused largely on the government's role and review of all foreign aid contractors and grants, which Trump administration lawyers told Ali they had already completed and made final decisions for.

Lawyers were also pressed over whether the Trump administration can legally move to terminate projects whose funds are allocated and appropriated by Congress – something Ali referenced specifically in his ruling.

""The provision and administration of foreign aid has been a joint enterprise between our two political branches,"" he said. ""That partnership is built not out of convenience, but of constitutional necessity.""

These arguments – and the ruling from Ali – could eventually kick the issue back up to the Supreme Court, should the government move to appeal any part of the memo or the allegations.

CBS aired one part of a Kamala Harris answer to a question about Israel from its 60 Minutes correspondent on Oct. 6, and then aired a shorter, different part of the answer a day later.

FIRST ON FOX -- The Fair Election Fund, a national election integrity watchdog group, urged the Federal Communications Commission to ""hold CBS accountable for its unlawful conduct"" related to the infamous ""60 Minutes"" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. 

Trump has alleged election interference over CBS' handling of a ""60 Minutes"" interview, and feels the network aided his Democratic rival, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, through deceptive editing one month before they faced off in the presidential election. The October 2024 sit-down with Harris has been at the center of controversy for months, with Trump taking legal action and FCC chairman Brendan Carr forcing CBS to release an unedited transcript and raw footage. 

CBS and its parent company, Paramount Global, insist the network did nothing wrong, but the Fair Election Fund believes the editing job constituted ""an improper contribution"" to the Harris campaign. 

""Upon review of the video and transcript referenced in the Public Notice, we find it prudent to inform the Commission that CBS has not only engaged in improper news distortion, but has also exploited the ‘media exemption' under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974, as amended (FECA),"" James Tyrell, counsel to the Fair Election Fund, wrote in the letter to the FCC that has been obtained by Fox News Digital. 

FCC CHAIR CALLS CBS NEWS' CONDUCT 'HARD TO EXPLAIN' FOLLOWING RELEASE OF KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

""We respectfully request that the Commission hold CBS accountable for its unlawful conduct,"" Tyrell continued. ""By substantively editing Ms. Harris' answers to questions in the CBS Interview, CBS has engaged in activities that exceed the scope of the ‘legitimate press function' and, therefore, constitute an improper contribution to Ms. Harris' campaign.""

Tyrell wrote that ""the heavily edited CBS Interview went well beyond CBS' legitimate press function"" and urged the FCC to act.

""The results of the 2024 Presidential Election clearly demonstrate that the American public has lost confidence in the media, and, no matter what this Commission decides with respect to this matter, that lost confidence will not immediately be restored. The question is whether this Commission will further undermine the American public's confidence in the U.S. government by giving a biased media company a ‘free pass,"" Tyrell wrote. 

Tyrell also believes that ""news distortion"" is not an isolated incident.

""For example, journalists and the media were publicly criticized by Americans for ‘covering up' former President Joe Biden's mental decline and for failing to even conduct any sort of questioning of the White House regarding the same,"" Tyrell wrote. 

""This repeated pattern 33 of behavior is precisely why the American public no longer trusts the media,"" Tyrell added. ""It is unfortunate that media personnel continue to push their own political agendas at the expense of providing the American public with complete information and exploit FCC and Federal Election Commission rules and regulations for their own benefit. Such manipulative behavior should not be countenanced by this Commission."" 

Carr, who was appointed by Trump and has called CBS' conduct ""hard to explain,"" previously asked for the public's feedback as it conducts a review of the ""60 Minutes"" saga. Last month, Carr ordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript as part of its investigation into whether the network violated the FCC's ""news distortion"" policy after a complaint was filed. CBS had refused to release a transcript until Carr got involved.

""Every data point you look at shows that the American people have lost trust in the legacy national news media. They feel like those outlets are just trying to sheepdog people towards preferred political narratives, rather than playing it straight. With respect to CBS, the FCC is running a transparent process that lets every American participant. I would welcome the Federal Election Commission's views on the FEC issues raised here,"" Carr told Fox News Digital. 

FCC CHAIR BRINGS RECEIPTS ON BIDEN ADMIN'S ‘EXPERTISE IN INCOMPETENCE' IN BLISTERING MESSAGE TO BUTTIGIEG

The raw transcript showed CBS News had aired only the first half of Harris' response to ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker's question about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not ""listening"" to the Biden administration in a preview clip that aired on ""Face the Nation,"" but aired only the second half of her response during the primetime special. 

""But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening,"" Whitaker said in the exchange. ""The Wall Street Journal said that he -- that your administration has repeatedly been blindsided by Netanyahu, and in fact, he has rebuffed just about all of your administration's entreaties.""

""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. And we're not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end,"" Harris responded. 

In the preview clip that aired on ""Face the Nation,"" Whitaker asked his Netanyahu question to Harris about him not ""listening"" to the U.S. 

""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region,"" Harris responded in the ""Face the Nation"" clip. 

Harris was mocked by conservatives for offering a lengthy ""word salad"" to Whitaker. But when that same question aired the following night in the primetime election special, a shorter, more focused answer from the vice president followed.

""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end,"" Harris said.

Critics accused CBS News of editing Harris' ""word salad"" answer to shield the vice president from further backlash. 

PARAMOUNT FILES MOTION TO DISMISS TRUMP'S CBS LAWSUIT, CALLS IT 'AN AFFRONT TO THE FIRST AMENDMENT'

CBS parent company Paramount Global on Friday responded to the news distortion complaint that is on file with the FCC. 

""The Complaint filed against CBS for ‘news distortion' envisions a less free world in which the federal government becomes a roving censor—one that second guesses and even punishes specific editorial decisions that are an essential part of producing news programming,"" Paramount Global executives wrote. 

""The protections of the First Amendment apply to all Americans, including broadcasters like CBS and its stations.  A broadcaster engages in protected speech activity whenever it ‘exercises editorial discretion in the selection and presentation of its programming,'"" they continued. ""Indeed, the mere investigation of allegations premised on disputes over editorial judgments constitutes ‘a venture into a quagmire inappropriate for' a government agency like the Commission—though it is not too late for the Commission to turn back by promptly closing this proceeding.""

Paramount Global feels the First Amendment would not permit the government to substitute its judgment for that of a broadcaster as to the specific footage from an interview to be aired.

""None of the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence around broadcasting has ever recognized a sweeping right by the government to second guess editorial decision-making,"" Paramount Global wrote. 

The FCC has not yet formally responded to Paramount Global. 

Trump filed a $20 billion lawsuit against CBS alleging election interference over its handling of the interview, accusing the network of aiding his Democratic rival through deceptive editing just days before the election. 

According to court documents reviewed by Fox News Digital, Paramount argued last week that the lawsuit was wrongly filed by Trump's legal team in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas, despite the fact that neither Paramount nor CBS News are located in the Lone Star State, nor did any production of the ""60 Minutes"" interview at the center of the lawsuit have any affiliation with the state. 

TRUMP AMPS UP THE PRESSURE ON CBS WITH MASSIVE DISCOVERY DEMAND AS '60 MINUTES' LAWSUIT MOVES FORWARD

In a separate filing, Paramount argued Trump's lawsuit is ""an affront to the First Amendment and is without basis in law or fact,"" seeking to ""punish a news organization for constitutionally protected editorial judgments they do not like.""

Trump's legal team remains confident. 

""President Trump is committed to holding those who traffic in fake news, hoaxes, and lies to account,"" Trump attorney Ed Paltzik told Fox News Digital in a statement. 

""CBS and Paramount committed the worst kind of election interference and fraud in the closing days of the most important presidential election in history,"" Paltzik added. ""President Trump will pursue this vital matter to its just and rightful conclusion.""

Founder and CEO of American Majority Ned Ryun discusses President Donald Trump placing a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

At two points in his autobiography, ""My Early Life,"" Winston Churchill pauses to reflect on political parties:

""It is not the slightest use defending government or parties unless you defend the very worst thing about which they are attacked.""

Much later in his account of his first 25 years, after he had been elected to Parliament and a group of like-minded young MPs got opposite of a senior figure on his Party's Front Bench, Joe Chamberlain, they invited Chamberlain to dine. He accepted. 

TRUMP TEASES TARIFFS AGAINST MEXICO, CANADA MAY GO HIGHER IN THE FUTURE

""I am dining in very bad company,"" Chamberlain remarked as he entered. When the young MPs challenged him on what they thought to be a rotten policy, Chamberlain responded, ""What is the use of supporting your own government only when it is right? It is just when it is in this sort of pickle that you ought to have come to our aid.""

After a fine dinner, as Chamberlain took his leave, he paused at the door, ""You young gentlemen have entertained me royally, and in return I will give you a priceless secret. Tariffs! There are the politics of the future, and of the near future. Study them closely and make yourself a masters of them and you will not regret your hospitality to me.""

Churchill would bolt the Conservatives for the Liberals over protectionism in 1904. He would return to the Tories in 1924. ""Anyone can rat, but it takes a certain amount of ingenuity to re-rat,"" he would declare.

Churchill ""ratted"" over his belief in free trade. He re-ratted because of national security. Let's skip the drama over tariffs and stay focused on defending the country and the Constitution. Give Trump the time (and the votes in Congress when he needs them) to enact what he ran on. Give the Party and its president a chance. Most Republicans from the Reagan-era have been ""Free Traders,"" just as most of the Lincoln-to-McKinley era Republicans were supporters of tariffs. Many have now settled on the ""tariffs-as-part-of-national-security-good, tariffs as revenue producers bad.""

The president of Hillsdale College, Dr. Larry Arnn, likes to say ""The Natural Law does not speak to me on tariffs,"" and in that quip is great wisdom. I leave the field to others, save for full-throated backing of tariffs on the critical goods necessary to the country's security and health which should be made here in whole or large part, but the supply chains for which are in the People's Republic of China in shop or critical part. To depend upon the only other superpower for our national security is nuts. President Trump wants to lay on 20% of such goods coming to the U.S. from China? Fine by me, and yes, I know some Americans will pay a price such ad many farmers who sell their products to the vast China market. 

I don't get tariffs on Canada. I do on Mexico. Fentanyl is flowing into the U.S. because of the cartels. The drugs kills tens of thousands of Americans every year. Mexico doesn't want us striking at cartel operations? Fine. Crush them yourselves, but crush them. 

Which brings us round-a-bout to the big ""Continuing Resolution"" Speaker Johnson unveiled and President Trump endorsed this past weekend.

Bravo. I don't know what is in the 99-page bill save for the beginning of a defense build-up, but it will allow the government to stay open while Trump and the GOP figure out the budget and reconciliation package(s) —there can be one or two. I am in favor of whatever the GOP passes just as I will support the president's approaches on trade and peace negotiations at least for year one. 

Because I'm a party man. Always have been. Always will be. Parties are the only way to advance political agendas and, in this era, the Republican Party is the only way to protect the Constitution as the Democrats want to pack the Supreme Court and crush the rule of law in the process of doing so. So, yes, join the GOP if you like a free and prospering USA. Don't like tariffs, or CRs, or pressure on Ukraine? That's not the point. Trump won, leads the GOP and he is doing exactly what he promised to do.

Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo predicts a 'momentous battle' in the courts over President Donald Trump's pause on funding for USAID and discusses the DOJ's request to the Supreme Court to allow Trump's desired firings.

One of the newest federal judges in the U.S. has found himself squarely in the crosshairs of the Trump administration's battle over foreign aid spending after the Supreme Court tasked him with determining how, and when, the government must pay nearly $2 billion owed to foreign aid groups and contractors.

Judge Amir H. Ali, a Biden appointee, has served on the court for less than four months and is among the 25 newest federal judges confirmed by the Senate to serve on a federal district court.

Despite his short tenure, Ali, a U.S. district judge in Washington, D.C., is already at the center of some of the most high-profile court cases to date, presiding most recently over the lawsuit seeking billions in unpaid invoices for USAID-funded projects. 

The case is the first significant case of President Donald Trump's term to be heard by the Supreme Court – and Amir's handling of it has brought renewed scrutiny from conservatives over his previous work as a litigator, including for progressive legal groups.

SCOTUS RULES ON NEARLY $2 BILLION IN FROZEN USAID PAYMENTS

Judge Amir H. Ali is a Biden appointee on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. (United States District Court for the District of Columbia)

Far from being a wallflower, Ali has had a prolific and high-profile career as both a professor and litigator, including arguing civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, and serving as the director of Harvard Law's Criminal Justice Appellate Clinic. His work has earned awards or recognition from groups such as the NAACP, the American Constitution Society – where he was a finalist for the David Carliner Public Interest Award – and Bloomberg, among others. 

Much of Ali's work prior to his confirmation to the bench focused closely on police and prosecutorial misconduct and civil rights protections, some of which made headlines during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year.

In 2017, Ali helped open the Washington, D.C., branch of the MacArthur Justice Center, where he represented dozens of plaintiffs, including before the Supreme Court, where he argued and won two separate civil rights cases. The MacArthur Justice Center was formed in 1985 to challenge the death penalty in Illinois, and it has since expanded to support reductions in over-incarceration and the elimination of racial disparities in the criminal justice system, among other reforms, with offices in four states and Washington, D.C. 

Ali's first case, Garza v. Idaho, expanded the constitutional right to counsel for defendants under the Sixth Amendment. His second, Thompson v. Clark, made it slightly easier for individuals who claim they were wrongfully arrested to sue police for malicious prosecution. (Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, authored the 6-3 majority opinion.)

He was later appointed executive director of the Washington, D.C., branch, a role he held through 2024, when he was appointed to the federal bench.

During his Senate confirmation hearing last February, Ali was grilled by Republicans over remarks made by his MacArthur Justice Center colleague, Cliff Johnson – who suggested during a podcast interview in 2020 that defunding the police is the first step in a ""movement toward making police departments obsolete.""

Ali stressed in response that he did not share those views, and that the views were not endorsed by the MacArthur Justice Center. 

""Let me be very clear about this,"" Ali said. ""I have never advocated for taking away police funding. I would not take that position, and the MacArthur Justice Center has not taken that position.""

US JUDGE ORDERS TRUMP ADMIN TO PAY PORTION OF $2B IN FOREIGN AID BY MONDAY

Now, as a judge, Ali has been tasked with presiding over some of the most consequential cases to come up during Trump's second term. 

Last month, he sided with foreign aid groups and contractors who sued the Trump administration for roughly $1.9 billion owed for previously completed projects that were funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. 

Ali gave the Trump administration just two weeks to pay the outstanding funds, prompting Justice Department lawyers to file an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. 

The Supreme Court ultimately rejected the Trump administration's request to extend the freeze in 5-4 vote, remanding it back to D.C. federal court, and Ali, to hash out the specifics of what must be paid, and when – a role Ali stressed that he takes ""very seriously.""

Plaintiffs sued over the Trump administration's executive action earlier this year that froze nearly all foreign aid spending, changes made in the name of government ""efficiency"" and eliminating waste, according to administration officials. 

President Donald Trump has stated plans to cut some 90% of USAID foreign aid contracts and to slash an additional $60 billion in foreign aid spending and at issue in the case is how quickly the Trump administration must pay the outstanding invoices from completed projects. 

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X Monday that roughly 83% of USAID programs are slated to be canceled following a six-week review process led by DOGE.

The canceled contracts, Rubio wrote, amount to ""tens of billions of dollars"" that were being spent in ways he alleged ""did not serve"" U.S. national interests. He added that the rest of the USAID programs and contracts will be transferred to the State Department to be managed. 

LAWSUIT TRACKER: NEW RESISTANCE BATTLING TRUMP'S SECOND TERM THROUGH ONSLAUGHT OF LAWSUITS TAKING AIM AT EOS

Most recently, Ali ordered the Trump administration Monday evening to pay by March 14 all owed funds to USAID contractors and other international groups for previously completed projects. Ali said the Trump administration's withholding of the funds, which had already been appropriated by Congress, was likely ""unlawful"" and a violation of the separation of powers doctrine under the Constitution.

It is unclear whether the Trump administration will move to challenge that ruling in court.

Last week, Ali moved expeditiously on the Supreme Court directive, ordering both parties back to court last week for an hours-long hearing to weigh plausible repayment options. He heard from both plaintiffs in the case, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, who argued that the Trump administration ""never took steps towards compliance"" with Ali's order requiring the administration to unfreeze the federal funds to pay the $1.9 billion in owed project payments.

During the hearing, which stretched on for nearly five hours, Ali also focused heavily on other issues, including the government's role in reviewing all foreign aid contracts and grants. 

Lawyers for the Trump administration told Ali they had already completed and made final decisions for these contracts. Stephen Wirth, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, objected to the administration's ""breakneck"" review of the contracts and grants, arguing that they ""had one objective – to terminate as many contracts as possible.""

Lawyers were also pressed by Ali over whether the Trump administration can legally move to terminate projects whose funds are allocated and appropriated by Congress. This could eventually kick the issue back up to the Supreme Court.

At the end of the hearing, Ali ordered the government to pay at least a portion of the owed funds by Monday at 6 p.m. – taking what he described as a ""concrete step"" forward in resolving some of the confusion surrounding the Trump administration's freeze on most foreign spending.

""I think it's reasonable to get the plaintiffs' invoices paid by 6 p.m. on Monday,"" Ali said.  

It is unclear what payments the government has made since last week.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is cutting two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers, part of what the agency said was a decision to ""return to long-term, fiscally responsible initiatives.""

The move cancels about $660 million in funding this year for the Local Food for Schools program, which is active in 40 U.S. states, as well as about $420 million for a second program called the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement, which helps food banks and other local groups provide food to their communities. 

The decision comes as the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, say they are slashing federal spending to reduce government waste. The USDA programs were funded through the agency's Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era fund created to buy products directly from farmers.

""Unlike the Biden Administration, which funneled billions in [Commodity Credit Corporation] funds into short-term programs with no plan for longevity, USDA is prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact,"" a USDA spokesperson said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. 

In recent days, schools were alerted that they were set to lose $660 million in federal funding for the current year, according to Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations for the School Nutrition Association, which represents thousands of school meal employees. The withdrawal of funding will affect schools across the U.S. at a time when they're already grappling with high food costs, she said. 

One of those school districts said the USDA's decision will wipe out $100,000 in funding that it had planned to spend on local beef and produce for students' school meals. 

""It's a pretty big hit, and that's mostly fresh fruits and vegetables,"" said Patti Bilbrey, director of nutrition services at the Scottsdale Unified School District in Arizona. ""It wasn't just about keeping food costs low — it meant supporting your community and your local farmers in your state.""

While the $100,000 represents about 2% of the school district's roughly $6 million in annual spending on food, Bilbrey noted that it allowed the district to buy food ffrom small farmers and introduce produce like microgreens to their students. She added that the funding loss comes as her district, like many others, are struggling to keep school meals affordable amid rising food and labor costs. 

The Local Food for Schools program ""was a godsend to us,"" Bilbrey said. ""It keeps our meal costs down, and we're helping our community, which improves the perception of school meals.""

Getting overpaid by Social Security will soon come at a high cost, with the agency saying Friday it's reinstating a plan to take 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check to claw back the money, up from the current 10% rate. 

The policy change highlights an issue that had caused financial hardship for some beneficiaries in years past, prompting the Social Security Administration under the Biden administration to limit clawbacks to 10% of a person's monthly benefit check. 

But the Trump administration's reversal could lead to deep financial strain for some senior citizens who find themselves caught up in the overpayment issue. While overpayments are rare, they are often the result of Social Security's own miscalculations — and can come as a surprise to beneficiaries, given that it can be difficult to know if you have been overpaid. 

""People generally do not know they are overpaid — you were receiving benefits, assuming that the government was giving you the proper amount,"" Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the benefit, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""People are really desperate when they get a letter from the government saying, 'You owe $10,000' that they don't have.""

The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for comment.

Here's what to know. 

Fewer than 1% of the Social Security Administration's payments are what the agency terms as ""improper,"" which can include both over- and underpayments, according to a 2024 report from its inspector general. As the report noted, while it's a small share of the overall $1.6 trillion in benefits paid each year, it still adds up to billions of dollars. 

From fiscal year 2015 to 2022, the Social Security Agency paid about $72 billion in improper payments, most of which were overpayments, the report noted. That represents 0.84% of total Social Security payments during that time. 

The agency says that they are usually due to two issues:

Sometimes beneficiaries may not understand that they need to update the agency with new information, partly due to the complexity of the Social Security system, which has more than 20,000 pages of rules, the inspector general said in its 2024 report.  

And sometimes SSA employees, who must in some cases manually calculate complex benefits, also make mistakes, the report added.

However, there are cases where seniors receive ""strategic overpayments,"" said Ed Weir, a former Social Security manager who runs a YouTube channel about the benefit. 

In a recent webcast about the issue, Weir noted that sometimes seniors who are under the full retirement age but who are still working after having claimed Social Security aren't sure if they'll bump up against the earnings limit of $23,400. Under its rules, Social Security will hold back $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings above that threshold.

Some seniors decide, ""'I'll let it ride, because I won't know until November or December if I'm going over"" that limit, Weir said.

But seniors who now opt for a ""strategic overpayment"" could end up losing one or two months of benefits due to the new clawback policy, Weir added. 

The SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. 

The withholding rate for people who had been overpaid before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.

Medicare coverage could be another pitfall for seniors whose benefit checks are subject to the 100% clawback, experts said. That's because most seniors pay for their Medicare Part B premiums by having it automatically deducted from their Social Security monthly checks. 

The Social Security Administration didn't respond to requests for clarification about the issue. 

It's unclear if seniors would have to arrange to pay for their Medicare premiums through another payment system, or if the SSA would allow them to pay for their health care first before clawing back the remaining money, Altman of Social Security Works said. 

""If you are on Medicare, it means you might not pay your Medicare possibly, so you might lose your Medicare,"" Weir said. ""It's a trickle down effect.""

Prior to the Biden reform to pare clawbacks to 10% of a person's benefit check, some Americans had encountered financial hardship after receiving shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars. Some people were even driven into homelessness after their benefits were stripped away, KFF reported in 2023. 

Beneficiaries have the right to request a waiver of overpayment recovery through SSA form 632, Weir noted. 

""Two things have to be met for the payment to be waived: No. 1, it's not your fault, and No. 2, you don't have the ability to pay,"" he said.

You can also appeal the overpayment, in case you think the overpayment amount is incorrect or you disagree that you were overpaid, through SSA form 561. 

Lastly, you can also request a different payment amount if you can't meet your living expenses due to the repayments, the SSA says.

""With Social Security, if you disagree with the decision, appeal it,"" Weir said on his webcast. ""Always appeal everything.""

The Social Security Administration (SSA) said it is reinstating a plan to recover 100% of overpayments to beneficiaries, a policy the agency abandoned last year after an outcry over cases in which the practice led some Americans to receive shock bills amounting to thousands of dollars.  

In a statement, SSA said late Friday that it will increase the default overpayment withholding rate for Social Security recipients to 100% of a person's monthly benefit, the same level that it had in place before last year's reform. The agency is required by law to claw back overpaid benefits.

Because of public backlash over the 100% recovery policy, the agency last year had capped the withholding rate for someone who had been overpaid at 10% of the person's monthly benefit. On Friday, the SSA said it will start claiming 100% of benefit checks to cover new cases of overpayments, while the withholding rate for people with overpayments before March 27 will remain at 10%, as will the rate for overpayments for Supplemental Security Income, a program for low-income seniors and disabled Americans.

""People who are overpaid after March 27 will automatically be placed in full recovery at a rate of 100% of the Social Security payment,"" the agency said.

The 100% clawback policy had sparked an outcry after instances in which beneficiaries were hit with surprise bills that demanded repayment within 30 days. In some cases, the bills were for tens of thousands of dollars. If beneficiaries were unable to immediately pay the bill, the agency could dock their entire monthly Social Security payment, leaving some people financially destitute, as reported by ""60 Minutes,"" KFF Health News and other media outlets,

In many cases, the overpayments were the fault of SSA. A 2022 report by the agency's inspector general found that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of ""effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.""

In the agency's new statement, SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said it is the agency's ""duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding.""

He added, ""We have the significant responsibility to be good stewards of the trust funds for the American people.""

Raising the clawback rate to 100% from its current 10% will increase the amount of recovered funds by $7 billion over the next decade, the agency said. SSA pays out about $1.6 trillion in benefits each year. 

The revised policy will lead to financial hardships for many people faced with Social Security overpayments, according to the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare. 

""This action, ostensibly taken to cut costs at SSA, needlessly punishes beneficiaries who receive overpayment notices — usually through no fault of their own,"" a spokesperson for the advocacy group said in a statement. ""Many overpayments are the result of errors on SSA's part.""

Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, noted the advocacy group supports the government recouping improper overpayments, but said an immediate 100% cut in benefits would take a toll on older Americans. 

""The 'clawback' of payments is especially unfair to seniors who do not have external support to help manage their finances and track their benefits,"" she told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. ""Many beneficiaries may not be aware of an overpayment and could suddenly find themselves without a check.""

The reversal comes as the Social Security Administration is undergoing widespread job cuts and a reorganization under the Trump administration. With its staff already at a 50-year low, employees at the agency have told CBS News that the cuts could disrupt or delay services, including customer service delays and longer waits to qualify for some benefits.

While on the campaign trail, President Trump vowed not to touch Social Security, a promise he repeated Sunday on Fox News, although he added that his administration wants to root out ""fraud"" from the benefit system. 

""I'm not going to touch Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. Now, we're going to get fraud out of there,"" he said. ""We have people 250 years old and all, you know, tremendous fraud,"" he added, referring to a false claim that people who are beyond the human lifespan are receiving benefits.""

The cuts to Social Security's workforce could mean that more beneficiaries are subject to overpayment errors, the National Committee to Protect Social Security & Medicare said in the statement. 

""Trump's SSA also is closing field offices across the country, meaning beneficiaries will have to wait longer and possibly travel farther to resolve their overpayment cases,"" the group said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal investigators looking into the cause of the January collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people recommended a ban on some helicopter flights Tuesday, saying the current setup “poses an intolerable risk.”

National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy laid out frightening statistics about near misses to underscore the danger that has existed for years near Ronald Reagan National Airport and expressed anger that it took a midair collision for it to come to light.

In just over three years, she said, there were 85 close calls when a few feet (meters) in the wrong direction could have resulted in the same kind of accident that happened Jan. 29 when the military helicopter collided with an American Airlines jet over the Potomac River as the plane was approaching the airport.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he'll adopt the NTSB's recommendations for the route where the midair collision occurred. He noted there will be some modifications in the guidelines to be released Wednesday, including allowing presidential flights and lifesaving missions.

Helicopters no longer will be “threading the needle” flying under landing planes, he said.

The National Transportation Safety Board is recommending a ban on some helicopter flights in the area where a military chopper and a passenger jet collided near Washington, D.C. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.

The Federal Aviation Administration also will use artificial intelligence to analyze data from every airport to make sure there aren't similar dangers elsewhere, he said, adding that there are other airports with cross-traffic.




Homendy and Duffy both said the hazards at Reagan airport should have been recognized earlier by the FAA.

“The data was there. It wasn't effectively analyzed to see we had this risk,” Duffy said.

The NTSB determined that the existing separation distance between planes and helicopters at Reagan airport is “insufficient and poses an intolerable risk to aviation safety,” Homendy said. 

She said she was devastated for families that are grieving because they lost loved ones. Among the victims were 28 members of the figure skating community.

“It shouldn't take tragedy to require immediate action,” she said.

Members of several families who lost loved ones said in a statement that the NTSB's preliminary report showed this was not an isolated incident.

“It also reinforces what we, as the families of the victims, already suspected: serious, systemic failures in air travel safety cost our loved ones their lives and continues to threaten public safety,” the statement said.

Aviation lawyer Robert Clifford, who represents at least six families, said the airline had a responsibility to address known problems.

“Those charged in transportation with the highest duty of care can't run yellow lights, and they've been running flashing red lights for years, it sounds like, and it's just pathetic,” he said.

Under current practice helicopters and planes can be as close as 75 feet (23 meters) apart from each other during landing, Homendy said. Investigators have identified 15,000 instances of planes getting alerts about helicopters being in close proximity between October 2021 and December 2024, she said.

Investigators determined that planes got serious alerts to take evasive action because they were too close to a helicopter at least once a month between October 2011 and December 2024, Homendy said. In over half those instances, the helicopter may have been above its established altitude restriction for the route.

Safety advocate Mary Schiavo, a former Inspector General of the U.S. Transportation Department, called it a “shocking dereliction of duty” for the FAA to have failed to act on data the NTSB gathered in just a few weeks since the crash. She noted that the FAA had pledged to warn pilots about places with higher collision risk.

“They were going to really be proactive to warn pilots about these hotspots. I mean, this is beyond a hotspot,” Schiavo said. “This is absolutely radioactive, to have 15,214 close proximity events in three years, it's unbelievable.”

Following the midair collision, the FAA took steps to restrict helicopter flights around the airport to ensure that planes and helicopters are no longer sharing the same airspace. Now flights are put on hold temporarily when helicopters need to pass by.

The NTSB's proposal would close a vital route for law enforcement, Coast Guard patrols and government operations flights at times, but only when the runways in question are in use, and they account for only about 5% of flights at Reagan.

Homendy said the NTSB is recommending that the FAA find a “permanent solution” for alternate routes farther away for helicopter traffic.

Investigators have said the helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers. The radio altitude of the helicopter was 278 feet (85 meters), which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for the location. 

The helicopter pilots may have also missed part of another communication, when the tower said the jet was turning toward a different runway, Homendy said last month. And the crew was wearing night-vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision.

The Black Hawk crew was made up of an instructor pilot with 968 hours of flight experience, a pilot with about 450 and a crew chief with nearly 1,150. Army officials have said the crew was familiar with the crowded skies around Washington.

The NTSB in its ongoing investigation will look at the amount of traffic at Reagan and the staffing in the control tower to determine if either of those factors played a role. It will take more than a year to get the final NTSB report.

Aviation safety expert John Cox said he piloted in and out of Reagan in all different kinds of planes since the late 1970s and sometimes received collision alerts about helicopters, but it was usually easy to see that they were going to pass behind him.

“That's just something that occurred going in and out of there, and it worked successfully for decades,” said Cox, who is CEO of aviation safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Multiple things had to go wrong for this collision to happen, he added.

Within just a month's time earlier this year, there were four major aviation disasters in North America, most recently in mid-February when a Delta flight flipped and landed on its roof at Toronto's Pearson Airport, injuring 21 people. 

Those accidents and close calls left some worried about the safety of flying, though fatal crashes are rare and U.S. airlines' track record is remarkably sound.

President Donald Trump blamed the midair collision on what he called an “obsolete” air traffic control system and promised to replace it. He also faulted the helicopter for flying too high. 

Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls at airports. 

Doug Lane, whose wife Christine Conrad Lane, and their 16-year-old son Spencer, died in the crash, said Tuesday he hopes the way the near-misses are reported gets a closer look and that NTSB recommendations will be implemented.

“If we're going to invest in an organization like this, it needs to be outfitted with state of the art technology and given staffing at a level that's going to set them up for success,” Lane said.

Duffy said Tuesday that he will present an expensive plan to Congress within the next few weeks to overhaul the system with new technology. He hopes to complete it within four years.

Israel said Tuesday it killed a senior Hezbollah militant responsible for drones and missiles, even as it freed Lebanese prisoners as a ""goodwill"" gesture to the country's new president.

Despite a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, Israel has continued to carry out air strikes in Lebanon, claiming they are necessary to prevent the Iran-backed militant group from rearming or re-establishing a presence along its northern border.

""Earlier today, the IAF (air force) conducted a precise intelligence-based strike in the area of Nabatieh in southern Lebanon, eliminating Hassan Abbas Ezzedine, the head of Hezbollah's aerial array in the Bader regional unit,"" the military said in a statement.

It said it carried out a second strike on Tuesday in the Froun area, targeting several militants.

""Several terrorists were identified in a site used by Hezbollah in the area of Froun in southern Lebanon,"" the military said. ""An IAF aircraft struck the suspects.""

Lebanon's official National News Agency reported that two people were killed in the Israeli strikes.

""An enemy Israeli drone strike targeting a car on the Deir El-Zahrani road resulted in one fatality,"" the news agency said, citing the health ministry.

It later reported that a second person was killed in an Israeli air strike on a vehicle in the Froun area.

Although a truce reached on November 27 largely ended more than a year of hostilities — including two months of full-scale war in which Israeli ground troops crossed the border — Israel has continued to launch periodic strikes in Lebanese territory.

Israel was initially expected to withdraw from Lebanon by February 18, after missing a January deadline, but it has maintained a presence in five strategic locations.

The ceasefire also required Hezbollah to pull back north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the border, and to dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in southern Lebanon.

- Border disputes -

In a separate development on Tuesday, Israel announced it had agreed to release five Lebanese citizens detained during its war with Hezbollah.

""In coordination with the United States and as a gesture to Lebanon's new president, Israel has agreed to release five Lebanese detainees,"" a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said.

Lebanese President Joseph Aoun's office said four of the prisoners had been freed on Tuesday and the fifth would follow on Wednesday.

Their release followed a meeting earlier Tuesday in the Lebanese border town of Naqoura, attended by representatives of Israel, Lebanon and mediators France and the United States.

""During the meeting, it was agreed to establish three joint working groups aimed at stabilising the region,"" the prime minister's statement said.

""These groups will focus on the five points controlled by Israel in southern Lebanon, discussions on the Blue Line and remaining disputed areas, and the issue of Lebanese detainees held by Israel.""

The Blue Line is the UN-patrolled demarcation line that has served as de facto border since 2000.

In an interview with Lebanese news channel Al Jadeed, US Deputy Special Envoy for the Middle East Morgan Ortagus emphasised Washington's efforts to resolve the border issue.

""We want to get a political resolution, finally, to the border disputes,"" Ortagus said.

""When it comes to the border agreement, the land border agreement, there are 13 points -- I think that six are still problematic,"" she said.

Ortagus said Israel had ""withdrawn from over 99 percent of the territory"".

""I feel fairly confident that... we can have final resolution on the five points and ultimately on the remaining issues related to the Blue Line"".

Pope Francis remains stable after almost four weeks in hospital with pneumonia, the Vatican said on Tuesday, declining to speculate on when he might go home, the day after doctors indicated he was no longer in danger.""It is clear that the situation remains stable... and with these slight improvements within a framework for doctors that remains complex,"" the Vatican said.

CAIRO (Reuters) -Israel said on Tuesday it had agreed to hold talks to demarcate its border with Lebanon, adding it would release five Lebanese held by the Israeli military in what it called a ""gesture to the Lebanese president"".  A statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel had agreed with Lebanon, the U.S. and France to establish working groups to discuss the demarcation line between the two countries.  Lebanon said it had received the four Lebanese hostages from Israel, with a fifth to be handed over on Wednesday, according to a statement by the Lebanese president's office on X.

Even in Lebanese villages that incurred heavy losses during Hezbollah's war with Israel, support for the militant group remains strong despite some dissent.

The Trump administration has urged Republicans to back the measure, which would avert a government shutdown on Friday night.

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is likely subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), a federal judge ruled late Monday, rejecting the Trump administration's position that the group does not have to respond to public records requests.

A judge appeared convinced that the best medicine for DOGE may be a bit of sunlight on its records.

STORY: Sheep are stolen in the dead of night from a Bedouin community in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.Activists and local residents said armed Israeli settlers took hundreds of them in one of the biggest incidents they'd seen of settler harassment of the Bedouin.The incident was filmed by Israeli activist group Mistaclim, whose name means Looking the Occupation in the Eye. ""I'm shocked, poor things,"" they can be heard saying. One told Reuters it happened fast - they saw settlers break into homes then herd the sheep from their pens.Residents said about 1,500 sheep and goats were herded away under the eyes of police and soldiers.Hani Zayed said he lost 70 sheep in Friday's attack.""The kids told us that they saw two men carrying lights coming from the settlement. When we went to check on them, they shone the light towards us. His idea was to distract us, because we found out that he mixed his sheep with our sheep.""An Israeli police statement denied the incident took place as described. Israel's military did not comment, nor did a group representing settlers in the area.Mistaclim set up a monitoring point following previous attacks, which have increased since the Gaza war broke out. For Bedouin herders, the loss of a flock usually means the loss of their livelihood.And like many Palestinians, the semi-nomadic herders in Ein al-Auja believe the larger goal is to force them from the land and allow a full takeover by Israel.:: July 2023Two years ago, Palestinians enjoyed swimming in Ein al-Auja's spring.Now it's reserved for use by settlers.The Bedouin encampment, which locals say was established around 40 years ago, has to bring in water by tanker. Local resident Tareq Obaiat says settlers covet the area for its terrain and climate and that Israel has been trying to displace people here for years.U.S. President Donald Trump has lifted sanctions on violent settlers.Fueled by speculation that he'll give Israel the green light to annex the West Bank, Israeli ministers have spoken openly about taking over the territory......which Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East war and has occupied ever since.For mother of five Nayfeh Salameh, the situation means her family ""sleeps with fear.""She described the Friday attack as ""terrifying"" and said closing your door won't keep you safe.They broke through the doors and entered people's homes, she says, beating women and children while they slept.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -An Indian appeals authority ruled that the city of New Delhi must reconsider its refusal of a liquor license request by France's Pernod Ricard, rejecting its justification the company had a criminal background, the order seen by Reuters showed.  India accounts for a tenth of Pernod's group sales, and its business in New Delhi - an urban tourist hub considered a showcase market for premium brands - had previously contributed around 5% of its sales in the country.  Retail sales of Pernod's brands, which include Chivas Regal, have been prohibited in the Indian capital since 2022, however, with authorities repeatedly denying it a license citing ongoing investigations into suspected violations of liquor regulations.

The United States and Canada traded angry tariff warnings Tuesday, as trade tensions soared and President Donald Trump doubled down on provocative plans to annex his country's northern neighbor.Early Tuesday, Trump threatened to double the rate on imports of both metals from Canada, after its province of Ontario imposed an electricity surcharge on three US states.

Colombia's newly appointed defense minister said Tuesday that he will focus on taking back territory lost to rebel groups that have forced thousands to flee their homes this year.  In an address to the nation's troops, Defense Minister Pedro Sánchez said that it was time for Colombia's military to “strengthen national sovereignty and protect” the nation's population.  The retired general hinted that Colombia's military, which had been recently asked to refrain from attacking rebel groups by the nation's government, will now take a more offensive role.

Romanian far-right politician Calin Georgescu on Tuesday stopped short of endorsing any other potential candidate after being definitively barred from standing in May's presidential election rerun, adding to uncertainty over who would replace him.  Whether another far right candidate succeeds in swaying Georgescu's voters will determine whether another central European country swings closer to Moscow beside Hungary and Slovakia in the election scheduled on May 4 and May 18.  The 62-year-old pro-Russian contender ran as an independent in last year's presidential election which was annulled in December by the country's top court due to undeclared funding and suspicion of Russian meddling in his favour, denied by Moscow and Georgescu.

Ukrainian and US officials met behind closed doors for hours of talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to find a path towards ending the war with Russia, with Kyiv pushing for partial ceasefire in the sky and at sea.

Separatist militant group the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed that they had taken hostages during an attack on a train carrying hundreds of people, including paramilitary troops, in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday and threatened to kill them.  The BLA is the strongest of a number of insurgent groups long operating in the area bordering Afghanistan and Iran, a mineral-rich region that is home to Beijing's investment in Gwadar deep water port and other projects.

Pakistani insurgents attacked a passenger train carrying several hundred people as it passed through a tunnel on Tuesday and claimed to have taken more than 100 hostages, though officials later said at least 104 were rescued.  The fate of the other passengers wasn't immediately known.  Security officials said the attackers blew up the railroad track in southwestern Balochistan province, and exchanged fire with security guards aboard the train while using women and children as human shields.

Kyiv signaled that it was open to a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia, pending Moscow's agreement.

Three people were killed and around a hundred hostages freed by Pakistani troops on Tuesday after armed militants attacked a train carrying over 450 passengers in the country's southwestern Balochistan province.Muhammad Kashif, a senior railway government official in Quetta, the capital of the province, earlier told AFP that ""over 450 passengers onboard"" had been taken hostage.

A Trump administration plan to lay off 80,000 employees at the VA without clear details on how it will continue providing services has raised serious concerns among veterans groups.

VA Job Cuts Hit as Rush, Not Reform

People walk past the Department of Veterans Affairs headquarters a block from the White House, March 6, 2025, in Washington, D.C.

A plan to axe 80,000 jobs at the Department of Veterans Affairs – nearly one-fifth of its workforce – has sparked backlash from lawmakers and veterans groups, who warn that those who served their country may ultimately pay the price for a rushed attempt to reform the agency.

Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins said last week the massive layoffs amounting to more than 17% of current employees, many of whom are veterans, were needed for efficiency. The layoffs are in addition to the 2,400 job eliminations at the department in recent weeks. VA Assistant Secretary Mark Engelbaum told lawmakers Tuesday that the cuts were an effort to reform the agency. He said that, though thousands of employees were hired in the last four years, the VA has increased its inventory backlog, increased processing time for claims and decreased accuracy.

When pressed for details by lawmakers, Engelbaum said it will take VA leadership four months to conduct an analysis and determine where cuts will be made. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut criticized the VA's decision to announce the 80,000 cuts before conducting an analysis.

“You're just willy-nilly firing people without a plan. Your approach seems to be: Fire them now, plan later,” Blumenthal said during a Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing Tuesday.

The layoff announcement, without clear details on how the department plans to continue providing services, has raised serious concerns among veterans and veterans groups about the immediate and long-term impact of cuts.

The VA's mission is based on a promise from President Abraham Lincoln “to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan.” The department provides health care, disability compensation, training and education benefits, housing assistance and memorial services to those who've served.

Pat Murray, legislative director at the Veterans of Foreign Wars, says it's important to remember the service the VA provides is “not charity, it's contractually obligated.”

READ: 



“In our enlistment contract, one of the lines is we are entitled to receive pay, allowances and other benefits as provided by law and regulation. That's in contract. We've earned the care and benefits afforded by that contract,” he says. “We earned it through our honoring of our contract, and we expect our leaders to do the same.”

Downsizing the department by 80,000 would bring the VA workforce to around the same size it was in 2019. But the mission of the VA has expanded since then. The bipartisan 2022 PACT Act expanded health care and benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange and other toxic substances and led to an increase in disability claims and medical appointments. Murray says the recent layoff of 2,400 VA employees has already produced delays at clinics and health centers, and he anticipates laying off 40 times that amount will likely exacerbate the problem.

“There's no scenario in which simply reducing the VA workforce by 17% or 18% is going to be positive for the health care and benefits for veterans,” he says.

Joy Ilem, national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, says the organization has received many calls from concerned service-disabled veterans worried about the potential for delayed benefits, decreased health care and limited disability compensation. Many are also worried about losing their jobs, since veterans make up a quarter of VA employees.

“It just seems counterintuitive to downsize,” Ilem says. “Even if you cut what they consider nonessential people, look at who those are. Those are the support staff who are working with the clinicians, the doctors and nurses who provide care. It takes a whole system to make things run efficiently.”

Steven Ross JohnsonFeb. 20, 2025



Ilem questions whether the long-term costs of downsizing the VA will impact recruitment and retention in both the department and the military in general. She says that when someone joins the military, they are told in return that if they become “disabled or ill or injured while serving, they're going to have access to timely benefits and services and world-class care.”

Engelbaum told senators VA leadership is currently looking at what technology and systems they can put in place to improve services and accountability. He said they will also ask employees what they need to do their job efficiently. The VA did not respond to a request for comment.

House Republicans will vote today on a stopgap funding bill, which will keep funding the government at current levels until September but will offer steep cuts that could upend several areas.

What's in the Stopgap Funding Bill?

Julia Demaree Nikhinson|AP

House Speaker Mike Johnson of La., holds the gavel before President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress in the House chamber at the U.S. Capitol, March 4, 2025, in Washington, D.C.

House Republicans are voting today on their 99-page “clean” continuing resolution to largely keep funding the government at current levels in most areas through September while offering some steep spending cuts in a handful of other places.

The temporary spending bill comes as Congress is facing another potential government shutdown this week. Lawmakers are now on a strict schedule to get the measure to the House Rules Committee and then to a floor vote. But complicating that is what's expected to be “no” votes from a unified Democratic caucus and at least one Republican.

With a razor-thin 218-214 majority, Speaker Mike Johnson cannot afford another defection from his members. But with several still on the fence, the pressure is on and the threat of a failed vote is real.

While the largest fight facing the chambers is the funding bill, also facing it on a separate track is the budget process. Both chambers have passed frameworks, and Republicans in the House and Senate are working together to merge them. The finished product, which has to be adopted by both chambers, seeks to enact larger parts of President Donald Trump's sweeping agenda. While that blueprint is proceeding parallel to the spending bill, some of the disputes involved have bled over to harden divisions between the parties as they attempt to pass the stopgap bill.

Aneeta Mathur-Ashton March 10, 2025



Here's what's in the stopgap bill and what could tank it.

If passed, the bill will keep funding the government at the current levels set last year by former President Joe Biden until September, which is a major concession for House Republicans. It will also notably bypass the yearly appropriations process in which Congress directs how to allocate the funds, allowing the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency wide leeway in deciding how money is spent.

House Republicans plan to cut $13 billion in discretionary spending on areas other than defense and increase defense spending by $6 billion. An additional $6 billion for veterans' health care is included.

Disaster relief for California was not included, and several programs – including international peacekeeping and National Institutes of Health research – will be hit. Add-ons include a $20 billion cut to IRS enforcement and an increase for Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation operation.

Most importantly, though, the cuts in spending do not touch key programs like Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare, which notably drew the ire of Republican voters when cuts to Medicaid were included in the budget blueprint.

Proposed cuts to DOGE were also left out, with Johnson saying they can be addressed in next year's spending talks.

Tim SmartMarch 10, 2025



The proposed bill will also affect Washington, D.C., the local budget of which is overseen by Congress.

If passed, the spending bill would effectively undo the District's 2025 budget, doling out an estimated $1 billion in cuts and forcing it to go back to its 2024 budget until Oct. 1. Such a move would likely affect everything from law enforcement to schools.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser's administration warned over the weekend that the proposed budget could result in layoffs and furloughs for teachers and other front-line workers as an estimated 16% of the remaining budget would need to be trimmed to comply.

The stopgap bill would cut funding mid-way through the fiscal year, when the District is already spending at its ostensibly congressionally approved fiscal 2025 levels, a memo from her office on Saturday said.

“This means a nearly $945 million cut for the District, impacting teachers, firefighters, and law enforcement,” it added.

Coming back to bite Johnson once again is his narrow majority.

Democrats have already said they will not be voting for it, with Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar saying in a statement Saturday that it would expose “the American people to further pain throughout this fiscal year.”

House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut called the proposal “a power grab for the White House” and said on Saturday that it “further allows unchecked billionaire Elon Musk and President Trump to steal from the American people.”

""By essentially closing the book on negotiations for full-year funding bills that help the middle class and protect our national security, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have handed their power to an unelected billionaire,"" she added.

With all Democrats united against it, Johnson will now have to rely on his already undependable and deeply fragmented caucus to get the job done. He can only afford to lose one Republican vote and it appears he has already lost it.

DECISION POINTS: 



Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who has almost always opposed stopgap bills during his time in office, came out against the measure on Sunday. He then doubled down on his position on Monday in a social media post.

“Unless I get a lobotomy Monday that causes me to forget what I've witnessed the past 12 years, I'll be a NO on the CR this week,” he wrote.

Many hard-line Republicans oppose continuing resolutions in principle because they are often late, dense and crafted by a select few lawmakers. That could also complicate Johnson's whip count as it has on other short-term spending measures in which he's relied on Democratic votes. With Massie a definite no, Johnson will require total unanimity from his caucus if all members are voting and present, a feat that has yet to be achieved on his watch.

But one thing working in Johnson's favor is Trump's support of the measure. The president endorsed Saturday's bill text in a social media post, calling it “a very good funding bill” and urged all Republicans to vote yes, adding “Please!”

“We have to remain UNITED — NO DISSENT — Fight for another day when the timing is right. VERY IMPORTANT. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”!”

The fate of the measure now rests in the hands of four undecided Republicans: Rep. Cory Mills of Florida, Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania.

President Donald Trump has escalated his trade war with Canada, doubling tariffs on metals to 50 per cent and threatening to “substantially increase” levies on the automotive industry. 

In a post on his own Truth Social network, the US President threatened to “permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada” if Canadian retaliatory tariffs are not dropped. 

Trump has offered Canada a simple way out: Join the US as its 51st state. 

The US president said: “This would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.”

“Canadians' taxes will be very substantially reduced, they will be more secure, militarily and otherwise, than ever before, there would no longer be a northern border problem.”

This latest announcement follows Ontario's premier Doug Ford announcing counter-tariffs on electricity late on Monday – warning, “I will not hesitate to shut off electricity completely”. 

Trump's press secretary warned on Tuesday afternoon that there would be “grave consequences imposed on Canada” if Ontario were to sever electricity supply.

Weeks into Trump's trade war – in which the US has most heavily targeted its Northern and Southern neighbours – rolling political shocks have dented global stocks and the US economy. 

The latest row erupted just a day after Mark Carney was named as the new prime minister of Canada, winning the Liberal Party leadership election by a landslide to replace Justin Trudeau. Carney said yesterday that his country's tariffs on the US will stay in place until “Americans show us respect”.

Following the announcement of Trump's latest metals levies, US government borrowing costs have seen a slight rise – up 4.23 per cent on 10-year US Treasury bonds

Shockwaves from the heated tariff war continue to undermine markets, particularly in the US, where concerns are mounting over business confidence, market volatility and the chances of a recession.

Trump claimed on Monday that the US economy is in a “period of transition”, when asked about the possibility of imminent recession. 

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) – known as the “central bank for central banks” – says that the US will dodge recession in 2025, but that its financial system is sensitive to Trump's outbursts. 

Frank Smets, deputy head of the BIS's monetary department, said: “Policy uncertainty on tariffs, [US] fiscal policy, immigration and regulation … work like a negative demand shock. They would have negative effects on spending, investment — and we see some signs of that.”

“If tariffs are implemented — and some have been — then the negative demand shocks can become supply shocks and give rise to inflationary pressure.”

It may be a coincidence, but the recent decline in the Nasdaq and bitcoin (BTC) coincides with a sharp rise in Japanese government bond yields and the strengthening of the safe-haven Japanese yen (JPY), reminiscent of the market dynamics seen in early August.

There could be a causation here, as, for decades, the low-yielding yen propped up global asset prices. The ongoing rise in the Japanese yen may have had a hand in the recent risk aversion on Wall Street and in the crypto market.

That said, the bullish positioning in the Japanese yen looks overstretched, with speculators holding record longs last week, according to the CFTC data tracked by MacroMicro. Such extreme bullish positioning, representing a collective belief in a continued move higher in the asset, sets the stage for disappointment, following which, a mass unwinding of longs unfolds, leading to a quick bearish reversal.

In other words, the yen's rise could stall for now, offering relief to risk assets, including Nasdaq and bitcoin.

""We are now cautious on chasing further JPY strength, given stretched speculative positioning as well as strong dip-buying appetite from the domestic community,"" Morgan Stanley's G10 FX Strategy team said in a note to clients late Friday.
		



Strategists explained that many Japanese investors use the Nippon Individual Savings Account (NISA) scheme to snap up foreign assets during risk-off, inadvertently slowing the pace of JPY appreciation. Additionally, the public pension system tends to go against the trend, rebalancing out of JPY assets.

""Indeed, such scenario happened in last August after a sharp appreciation of the JPY and the pronounced sell-off in equities,"" strategists noted.

Let's see if history repeats itself, triggering a renewed risk-on sentiment for Nasdaq and bitcoin. The USD/JPY pair turned up following the July and early August slide to 140, eventually rising to 158.50 by January. BTC turned up as well from the early August crash to $50,000, rising to new record highs above $108,000 in January. 

At press time, bitcoin traded near $80,300, representing a month-to-date decline of nearly 5%, extending February's 17.6% slide. At one point early Tuesday, prices dipped to $76,800, according to CoinDesk data.

Meanwhile, USD/JPY traded at 147.23, having put in a five-month low of 145.53 early Tuesday, TradingView data show.
		



While the stretched bull positioning and institutional flows suggest relief ahead, these factors may do little to alter the broader bullish outlook for JPY, which is backed by a narrowing U.S.-Japanese bond yield differential.

So, risk asset bulls need to be vigilant for signs of volatility in the yen and the broader financial markets.

The chart shows the spread between yields on the 10-year U.S. and Japanese government bonds.

The spread has narrowed to 2.68% in a JPY-positive manner, reaching the lowest since August 2022. Plus, it has dived out of a macro uptrend, suggesting a major bullish shift in the JPY outlook.

An ether (ETH) whale, who has held the token since its initial coin offering (ICO), made waves on Monday as it moved ETH worth millions to crypto exchange Kraken, according to blockchain sleuth Spot on Chain.

The whale deposited 7,000 ETH, worth $13.8 million at press time, to Kraken as the token's price plummeted along with the broader market on U.S. recession fears. Ether tanked to $1,760, reaching the lowest since October 2023, and last changed hands at $1,900.

Large inflows into exchanges are said to represent investors' intention to liquidate the asset or deploy the same as margin/collateral in derivatives trading. This often breeds price volatility.

The ether ICO whale still holds 30,070 ETH worth over $50 million.

It's happening: Southwest Airlines will start charging passengers to check bags for the first time.

It's a stunning reversal that shows the low-cost pioneer is willing to part with a customer perk executives have said set it apart from rivals for more than half a century of flying in hopes of increasing revenue.

Southwest's changes come after months of pressure from activist Elliott Investment Management. The firm took a stake in the airline last year and won five board seats as it pushed for quick changes at the company, which held on for decades — until now — to perks like free checked bags, changeable tickets and open seating.

For tickets purchased on or after May 28, Southwest customers in all but the top-tier fare class will have to pay to check bags, though there will be exceptions. Elite frequent flyers who hold A-List Preferred status will still get two bags, and A-List level members will get one free checked bag. Southwest credit card holders will also get one free checked bag.

""Two bags fly free"" is a registered trademark on Southwest's website. But its decision to about-face on what executives long cast as a sacrosanct passenger perk brings the largest U.S. domestic carrier in line with its rivals, which together generated more than $5 billion from bag fees last year, according to federal data.

Southwest didn't say how much it plans to charge to check bags, but a single bag costs $35 to check on Delta, American and United.

Southwest shares rose 8% Tuesday after its baggage fee announcement and investor update, while other large carriers' shares and the broader market fell.





Southwest executives have long said they didn't plan to charge for bags, telling Wall Street analysts that it was a major reason why customers chose the airline.

At an investor day in September, Southwest said that it would gain between $1 billion and $1.5 billion from charging for bags but lose $1.8 billion of market share. Southwest said its ""rigorous research"" found that ""our 'bags fly free' policy generates market share gains in excess of potential lost revenue from bag fees.""

Some airline executives see an opportunity.

""I think, clearly, there are some customers who [chose Southwest] because of that, and now those customers are up for grabs,"" Delta Air Lines President Glen Hauenstein said at an investor conference on Tuesday, after Southwest's announcement. ""We'll see how that plays out over the next period of time as they continue to implement multiple changes to their products.""

United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, speaking at the same conference, likened Southwest's baggage policy change to ""the slaying of a sacred cow"" and said lower-paying customers will be most affected.

""I view it as a big deal because it's more — it feels more financially driven — a results-driven airline than it's ever been before,"" he said.

Southwest CEO Bob Jordan had cited the company's long-standing bag policy in an earnings call last July.

""After fare and schedule, bags fly free is cited as the No. 1 issue in terms of why customers choose Southwest,"" Jordan said.

But Southwest has changed its tune.

""What's changed is that we've come to realize that we need more revenue to cover our costs,"" COO Andrew Watterson said in an interview with CNBC about the baggage fee changes. ""We think that these changes that we're announcing today will lead to less of that share shift than would have been the case otherwise.""

Jordan said Tuesday that the new baggage policy will likely help drive sign-ups for its co-branded credit card and that it made sense because of its commercial reach, listing its tickets through outside platforms like Google Flights and Expedia.

""In contrast to our previous analysis, actual customer booking behavior through our new booking channels such as metasearch, did not show that we are getting the same benefit from our bundled offering with free bags, which has led us to update the assumptions,"" he said.

Jordan said the carrier has new executives with ""direct experience implementing bag fees at multiple airlines and that's also helped further validate the new assumptions.""

Southwest said the changes it announced Tuesday will add $800 million in earnings before interest and taxes this year and $1.7 billion in 2026, bringing 2026 total increases, including other initiatives, to $4.3 billion, up from a $2.6 billion target it shared at its investor day in September.

During those presentations in September, Southwest's then chief transformation officer, Ryan Green, told analysts that an analysis showed Southwest would lose more money from passengers defecting to rivals if it started charging for bags than it would make from the fees.

""The fact that free bags is a key driver of choice creates the risk that customers may choose the competition if we change the policy,"" he said.

Southwest said last month that it had parted ways with Green.

The airline also said Tuesday that it will launch a new, basic economy fare, something rivals have offered for years.

Southwest, in addition, will change the way customers earn Rapid Rewards: Customers will earn more of the frequent flyer miles depending on how much they pay. Redemption rates will vary depending on flight demand, a dynamic pricing model competitors use.

And flight credits for tickets purchased on or after May 28 will expire in one year, or earlier, depending on the type of fare purchased.

It's the latest in a string of massive strategy changes at Southwest as its performance has fallen behind rivals.

Last July, Southwest shocked passengers when it announced it would ditch its open seating model for assigned seats and add ""premium"" extra legroom options, ending decades of an single-class cabin.

The airline is also looking to slash its costs. Higher expenses coming out of the pandemic have taken a bite out of airline margins.

Last month, Southwest announced its first mass layoff, cutting about 1,750 jobs roughly 15% of its corporate staff, many of them at its headquarters, a decision CEO Jordan called ""unprecedented"" in the carrier's more than 53 years of flying.

""We are at a pivotal moment as we transform Southwest Airlines into a leaner, faster, and more agile organization,"" he said last month.

Earlier this year, Southwest announced the retirement of its longtime finance chief, Tammy Romo, who was replaced by Breeze executive Tom Doxey, and its chief administrative officer, Linda Rutherford. Both executives worked at Southwest for more than 30 years.

Southwest has also cut unprofitable routes, summer internships and employee team-building events its held for decades.

Oops, something went wrong

President Trump's latest threat of 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum upended markets Tuesday, but his plan for an increase of any level could be heartily welcomed by American manufacturers of those products.

""We stand fully behind your leadership,"" nine US steel industry executives said in a recent letter to the president about a set of 25% duties planned on all steel and aluminum imports from all countries set to come into force tomorrow.

Trump surprised markets on Tuesday by announcing that he would by going higher and imposing ""an ADDITIONAL 25% Tariff, to 50%,"" on steel and aluminum from Canada on top of the previously announced 25% duties that start Wednesday.

He then suggested later in the day that those tariffs may not happen after Ontario's premier said it would suspend a surcharge on exports of electricity.

""I'll let you know,"" Trump told reporters as Philip Bell, the Steel Manufacturers Association president, added in a live Yahoo Finance interview Tuesday afternoon that he hopes at least the 25% duties stay in place.

Stocks quickly sold off Tuesday morning as the president also elevated his war of words with Canada but then whipsawed up and down on the competing headlines.

""It's more uncertainty, it's more chaos, he changes his mind on a whim,"" Slatestone Wealth chief market strategist Kenny Polcari said in another Yahoo Finance live appearance at one point.

But Tuesday morning's fresh round of agita belies a more nuanced view of Trump's 25% duties within the steel and aluminum industry after years of executives expressing concern about things like ""steel dumping"" from China.

And there is now bipartisan ire about subsidized Chinese steel undercutting world markets, leading many CEOs in the sector to actively cheer on Trump's most protectionist impulses.

Executives also have a familiar legal and political playbook for this week's steel and aluminum tariffs after Trump undertook similar actions during his first term — even though the duties do represent a mixed bag for some with closer economic ties to Canada.

One example of the industry support for Trump has come in the form of the recent letter sent to the president from the heads of US Steel (X), Nucor (NUE), and Cleveland Cliffs (CLF), among others, touting the plan for 25% blanket duties.

""We urge you to resist any requests for exceptions or exclusions and to continue standing strong on behalf of American steel,"" the letter said, according to a copy reviewed by Yahoo Finance.

""We stand fully behind your leadership,"" it added.

The letter also touted Trump's similar 2018 action on steel and aluminum that imposed 25% duties but mostly focused on China. The letter said it allowed American producers to reinvest and drive up capacity by nearly 80%.

Some in the aluminum industry have also spoken favorably about Trump's plans, with White House aides also touting the support of the industry in remarks this week about why the duties would be going forward.

But the reaction has been somewhat more mixed among some CEOs in a reflection of greater interrelationships between the US and Canada.

Alcoa (AA) CEO William Oplinger recently said that his aluminum-manufacturing company would be hurt by the tariffs, given both increased prices and because of the company's extensive operations in Canada.

""This is bad for the aluminum industry in the US,"" Oplinger said at a conference, adding that the bottom line is that 100,000 US jobs were at stake even before Trump's latest threat this week doubled the tariffs on Canadian aluminum.

The final consumers of steel and aluminum products are also likely to be less enamored with Trump's move as evidence mounts that it could raise an array of prices.

Domestic steel prices jumped in February when Trump announced his plan, with the price of a ton of domestic steel now nearly $1,000 a ton from around $700 previously.

A recent Bloomberg report found that consumer products from aluminum baseball bats to stainless steel pans to fishing reels could see higher prices as a result.

Still, the language from many of these pro-tariff executives is also very similar to Trump's own reasoning for his focus on steel and aluminum.

Trump has described this week's action as a sort of unfinished business after he imposed 25% duties on steel and aluminum in his first term but with exceptions that, in his view, allowed cheap Chinese products to continue undercutting the market by moving through third-party countries.

""It's 25% without exceptions or exemptions and that's all countries, no matter where it comes from,"" the president said when announcing his plan in February.

Increased steel tariffs were also often advocated by then-President Biden, who talked about tripling them and told a Pittsburgh crowd in 2024 of China, ""They're not competing. They're cheating.""

The bulk of this week's move is also being made using presidential tariff authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, making it a formal continuation of the steel and aluminum tariffs that Trump launched during his first term.

These ""Section 232"" tariffs are much more familiar to business leaders than the tariffs Trump has imposed so far using emergency authority derived from the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.

Trump also announced Tuesday he would be declaring a national emergency on electricity in response to Canadian moves to impose an additional fee on US electricity consumers.

Trump promised that ""this will allow the US to quickly do what has to be done to alleviate this abusive threat from Canada.""

Oops, something went wrong

This year's stock market sell-off has been dramatic, but it also contains almost all of the same characters that have featured in the biggest market disruptions we've seen over the last two years.

Both on the way up and now, the way down.

During Monday's market rout, shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) all fell, with Tesla falling a whopping 15% to lead losses.

It marked the latest sign that the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks that drove the S&P 500 to back-to-back 20% gains over the past two years have now become the ""lag seven,"" according to T. Rowe Price science and technology portfolio manager Tony Wang.

Whether stocks are going up or down these days, it seems, it's all one big AI trade.

And right now, it doesn't appear like a market in which investors are looking to bet big on future AI growth, particularly with the overall earnings story for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) coming into question.

""The S&P 500's forward earnings estimates, a key pillar of this bull market, have flatlined over the past month,"" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner wrote in a note to clients on March 4, explaining why he'd downgraded equities to a neutral portfolio weighting.

Through this bull market run, Big Tech has served as a key earnings driver, helping support overall profit growth for the S&P 500 while non-technology companies have struggled. At times, that's helped the sector play as a flight to safety to trade amid market uncertainty.

But now, as Wang notes, not only are these companies' spending plans facing some investor skepticism, but also ""[earnings] results are becoming more in line.""

""And if we look forward, they're likely going to be not accelerating,"" Wang added.

The macro backdrop, with concerns about Trump's tariff policy pushing both interest rates and the dollar around, is also a challenge for these stocks.

""The lagged impact of higher rates and a stronger dollar, as well as the debate around AI capex have come together to pressure earnings revisions,"" Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote in a note to clients on Sunday.

""As a result, we've seen very choppy index performance with the S&P 500.""

The sectors that host all the Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Information Technology (XLK), Consumer Discretionary (XLY), and Communication Services (XLC) — were the worst-performing sectors on Monday.

Over the past month, the equal-weighted S&P 500 (^SPXEW), which isn't as overly influenced by significant swings in large stocks — has outperformed the market cap-weighted index (^GSPC) by about 3 percentage points, also reflecting that much of the recent selling action has come in the market's largest names.

That's not to say the AI trade is over, but its predominance has certainly hit a speed bump.

""In [the] bigger picture, AI-driven outperformance of the US not done yet, but that is for the long term, not for the next few months,"" Citi strategists led by Dirk Willer wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

Still, the firm downgraded its view on US equities to Neutral from Overweight as weak economic growth data continues to weigh down the stock market.

And in this environment, the drop we're seeing in these Big Tech leaders doesn't necessarily make the stocks cheap, even with their earnings firepower.

""So when you think about the setup here,"" T. Rowe Price's Wang said, ""there are suggestions that perhaps these valuations are a lot more attractive, [but] I think that you have to know what kind of market you're in.""

Oops, something went wrong

Amid a broader market meltdown that has rocked the foundation of the often popular ""Magnificent Seven"" trade, shares of one key component have avoided falling off a cliff.

That is Mark Zuckerberg's Meta (META).

Meta's stock is the only Magnificent Seven member to be up in 2025, notching a minuscule gain. One could argue that gain isn't so insignificant when stacking it up with other Mag 7 members — all of which are down for the year.

Apple (AAPL) is off by 9% year to date, Microsoft (MSFT) 10%, Amazon (AMZN) 11%, Google (GOOG) 12%, Nvidia (NVDA) 20%, and Tesla (TSLA) a stunning 45%.

""Meta is not impacted by tariffs and has no China exposure,"" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives told me.

Watch: Gap CEO is monitoring tariffs every hour

To Ives's point, the Mag 7 is littered with companies overly exposed to the geopolitical risks hammering the go-to investing complex for retail and institutional investors.

Tesla counts on China as an important sales outlet, while Amazon's third-party sellers source cheap goods from the country. And a macroeconomic slowdown that could happen due to Trump tariffs may lead to businesses buying Nvidia chips at a more measured pace in 2025.

Ives added, ""Meta has become a defensive tech name in this Trump jigsaw puzzle.""

To be sure, it could be much uglier for Meta at the moment.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slumped 890 points, or about 2.1%, on Monday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell by 2.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 4%.

The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) tanked 5.2%, its largest one-day drop since July 24. Tesla crashed 20% during the session.

Year to date, the MAGS ETF is down 16%.

All three major stock indexes are off by more than 5% in the past month, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way with an 11% plunge.

Also helping sentiment on Meta is that it had a strong fourth quarter, unlike several of its Mag 7 rivals (see Tesla).

Earnings and revenue easily beat analysts' estimates. Profits were up 50% from a year ago.

Meta's app family (Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp) saw sales improve by about $7 billion year over year. The business also added close to $7 billion in operating profits.

Pros say Meta's investments in new technologies are juicing its performance at a critical time

""They're analyzing more instances of when you scroll up and down the feed, where do you stop, where do you stall, where do you scroll faster? And they're using more data points to essentially improve the relevancy of all the content that their users see by daypart,"" Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

Or is it are you more likely to click on ads in the evening when you're scrolling through your daily catch up or your sports?""

The last time Amazon's stock (AMZN) looked this cheap on a price-to-earnings multiple basis, CEO Andy Jassy was still a relative newcomer to the seat.

Shares of the e-commerce and cloud computing giant are trading on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 30 times, their lowest P/E in three years, according to data from FinChat. While that's cheap for Amazon, it's not the cheapest on a relative basis to other ""Magnificent Seven"" stalwarts.

That distinguished honor goes to fellow cloud competitor Microsoft (MSFT), whose stock trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18.9 times.

Lower valuations for these top tech names come amid a broader rout in markets as traders digest the potential for a recession under tariff-wielding president Trump.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slumped 890 points, or about 2.1% on Monday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell by 2.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 4%.

All three major indexes are off by more than 5% in the past month, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way with an 11% plunge. Amazon shares have tanked 16.5% in the last month.

""After a historical bull market led by the AI Revolution over the past two years we are now seeing major investor worries as the Trump tariff news, perceived recession fears, and tech growth concerns have sent tech investors for the exits and heading for the hills,"" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said.

Not helping sentiment on Amazon (and to a lesser extent, Microsoft) is a mixed fourth quarter that stoked concerns about near-term demand for Amazon Web Services (AWS).

AWS sales cooled a touch to a 19% year-over-year growth rate. This result was consistent with cloud growth slowdowns at Microsoft and the like.

Amazon guided to first quarter revenue of between $151 billion and $155 billion. Analysts were anticipating $158 billion; the miss was partially due to a $2.1 billion expected hit from currency fluctuations.

""Our discussions w/investors suggest the quarter & outlook were not thesis-changing for the well-owned name, but there are incremental concerns around the trajectory of AWS growth, & to a lesser degree the macro impact on Stores,"" JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a client note.

It remains to be seen if investors view Amazon's stock as cheap enough at current valuation levels given economic growth fears. But it's worth nothing the Street hasn't lost confidence in Amazon, at least not yet.

Yahoo Finance data shows that 95% of sell-side analysts continue to rate Amazon's stock a Strong Buy or Buy. The average price target is $264.71, well above the current trading price of $195.69. Earnings per share estimates for 2025 and 2026 have stayed fairly consistent since Amazon reported its latest results in early February.

Added Ives, ""Despite much criticism, that is how we have always called our tech winners and many times over the years with Tesla, Apple, Google, Nvidia, Amazon, Palantir among others our backs were against the wall and the times appeared dark at that moment ... but yet those were the golden opportunities and that is our view today.""

Oops, something went wrong

A sharp sell-off in US stocks this year has seen European stocks take their place as the hottest trade in global markets.

""Prior to the US elections, we assumed that a Trump victory would reinforce US exceptionalism,"" HSBC global equity strategist Alastair Pinder wrote on Monday.

""Today, we are upgrading Europe (ex-UK) to overweight (from underweight) and downgrading the US to neutral.""

After Monday's market meltdown, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is down over 4% this year and 7% from its record high, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) is off 9% in 2025 and more than 11% from its latest peak.

Across the pond, France's CAC 40 (^FCHI), Germany's DAX (^GDAXI), and the Euro Stoxx 50 (^STOXX50E) have each gained more than 10% this year. Britain's FTSE 100 (^FTSE), the laggard of the group, is still up better than 5% in 2025.

""What we underestimated was how the US's wavering support for NATO and Ukraine would trigger a watershed moment for the eurozone — with Germany expected to also follow through with sizeable fiscal stimulus,"" Pinder wrote. ""It is important to stress that we are not turning negative on US equities — but tactically, we see better opportunities elsewhere for now.""

The German DAX touched a record high earlier this month as Europe's largest economy prepares to boost infrastructure and defense spending, while the Trump administration signals it will be less expansive in its military support of its European counterparts.

And Pinder's call coincides with a growing number of voices on Wall Street avoiding the ""US exceptionalism"" playbook and turning to European equities for a win against this new fiscal backdrop.

""The regional change is additional to our style call since last summer that Growth style, US Tech, and Mag-7, are all unlikely to work this year,"" JPMorgan head of global and European equity strategy Mislav Matejka wrote in a note on Monday.

""Less US exceptionalism on these fronts helps the International/Value trade.""

At UBS, strategists also recently noted that the scale of a fiscal boost in Germany could provide a lift to confidence in the region, even before increased spending hits the economy.

""The strong pro-growth signal from the move has the potential to support consumer and business sentiment well before funds start to be deployed,"" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Financial Services, wrote last week.

However, JPMorgan's Matejka cautioned that ""tactically, near term, a lot has repriced very quickly.""

In February, Bank of America's global fund manager survey showed a notable shift in how investors are thinking about markets worldwide.

Last month's survey showed 34% of fund managers said global stocks will be leading the asset class this year. US equities dropped to third in the rankings, with 18% of respondents saying the asset class will lead returns this year. Gold placed second, with 22% of respondents expecting it to lead global markets.

Given the speed of the move into European stocks, US tariff uncertainty also looms as a potential risk to the outlook.

""Eurozone P/E has rerated to 15% [a] premium to [its] historical [level], and if bond yields keep spiking, the valuation case would further erode,"" Matejka added. ""Eurozone short term looks overbought.""

Small business owners were feeling uncertain about the future in February as they continued to deal with lingering inflation and labor challenges.

The National Federation of Independent Business' optimism index fell by 2.1 points in February to 100.7, just below economist forecasts for a reading of 101, according to Bloomberg data.

This reading did mark the fourth straight month the index held above its 51-year average of 98 but is a drop from a post-election high of 105.1 reached in December.

""Uncertainty is high and rising on Main Street, and for many reasons,"" the NFIB's Bill Dunkelberg and Holly Wade said in the report. ""How future developments are resolved will shape the economy's future.""

Tuesday's report showed 7 out of the 10 components of the index declined, led by a 10-point loss from owners expecting better market conditions in the next six months. Meanwhile, the NFIB's uncertainty index rose four points to 104, reaching a record high in February.

Among the owners who reported lower profits, 40% blamed weaker sales, 11% said the decline was due to labor costs, and 9% cited rising materials costs.

Some 16% of owners reported that inflation was a major dilemma weighing down their business.

“Inflation remains a major problem, ranked second behind the top problem, labor quality,” Dunkelberg added.

As a result, 32% of business owners raised their average selling prices, according to the report, marking the largest monthly increase since April 2021 and the third highest in the survey's history. And 29% plan to hike prices in the next three months.

Labor remains another top headache, with 38% of all small business owners reporting job openings they could not fill in February, marking the highest reading since August 2024. And the cost to keep staffing has also pressured owners, with 12% citing this issue.

Notably, the report made no reference to tariffs, which have been the stock market's big worry over the last few weeks as these new duties take effect at a time when the broader economy is showing some signs of weakness.

In a research note on Monday, for instance, Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius slashed their 2025 GDP forecast to 1.7% from 2.4%.

""The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse,"" the firm wrote.

Monday's market meltdown coincided with a major shift in how Wall Street is thinking about the health of the US economy and the current bull market run.

""You're seeing a complete upending in virtually every single consensus trade that was common at the beginning of the year, everything in stocks, in bonds, in currencies,"" Queens' College, Cambridge, president and former PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian told Yahoo Finance on Monday.

""We've had a complete upending of the conventional wisdom.""

After two consecutive years of strategists chasing the market higher as the US economy outperformed expectations, consensus entered 2025 positioned for another year of above-trend growth in the US economy.

Now, economic growth forecasts are moving lower, and strategists are discussing the likelihood that their year-end targets for the S&P 500 might've been too optimistic.

""We have seen the US equity market on a rocky path higher through year-end, and have believed that our 6,600 can absorb a 5-10% drawdown,"" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Sunday.

""The risks of a drawdown of more than 10% have admittedly grown, however. If that occurs, we see a 'growth scare' of a 14-20% decline from peak as most likely, which could shift us into our bear case.""

In recent weeks, economic forecasting teams from the likes of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and others have moved their 2025 GDP projections lower — Morgan Stanley now forecasts 1.5% growth in 2025, and Goldman sees 1.7%.

Wall Street's view of where the economy could be headed this year is not out of step with political consensus, either.

Which may be part of what's been bothering investors of late.

Last week, President Trump told Congress there could be ""a little disturbance"" to the economy from his tariff policies, but added, ""we're OK with that. It won't be much.""

In an interview with Fox Business on Sunday, Trump said, ""There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big ... We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing ... it takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.""

But signs of a slowing economy had already been brewing before Trump took office and will likely continue to muddy the economic picture regardless of how the president's tariff plans evolve.

""The economy was slowing before Trump was sworn in,"" Renaissance Macro head of economics Neil Dutta wrote in a note to clients on Monday. ""He inherited an economy with deep imbalances and a frozen housing and labor market.""

Dutta points out that since the market's last growth scare in August 2024, stronger economic data points have coincided with rising equity prices and vice versa. In recent weeks, however, ""the economic and corporate earnings data have deteriorated,"" Dutta wrote.

Still, no major Wall Street firm is directly calling for an outright downturn in which GDP turns negative for two consecutive quarters. For financial markets, however, the rate and direction of the change in the economy's growth rate, rather than the absolute level, is most important for setting prices today.

Research from Calvasina at RBC has shown that the two worst GDP environments for stocks are when the US economy grows at an annualized pace between 0% and 2%, suggesting the market's most lackluster performances often come as investors price in the slowdown.

Once GDP is actually negative, stocks typically perform well as the rebound — not the slowdown — drives price discovery.

And just as economists aren't yet calling for a recession, neither are equity strategists dramatically cutting forecasts for where stocks end the year, even with the median forecast of those tracked by Yahoo Finance calling for the S&P 500 to reach 6,600 by year-end, or about 17% higher than current levels.

""Our year-end 2025 base case price target remains 6,500, though the path is likely to be volatile as the market continues to contemplate these growth risks for the time being,"" Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote in a note on Sunday.

""This fits with our long-standing view that policy would likely be sequenced in a more growth-negative way to start the year before lower deficits/rates and less crowding out of the private economy benefit the market later in the year — No Pain, No Gain.""

Oops, something went wrong

President Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, now largely agree on a major point that has the potential to reshape the tech world: Google should be broken up.

But there is an important difference that emerged in a filing last Friday: Trump's Justice Department wants to let Google (GOOG, GOOGL) keep its investments in artificial intelligence. It notably has a stake in OpenAI rival Anthropic worth billions.

Backing off the Biden administration's request to force Google to sell off its AI bets was ""significant"" and ""very justified,"" said Mark McCareins, a business law professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.

It ""may be an indication that the government worries about deterring AI advances in the global race with China,"" added David Olson, associate law professor at Boston College Law School.

The stock of Google's parent, Alphabet, dropped more than 4% Monday as other tech stocks also sold off on macroeconomic concerns.

The final decision on what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire in court will be in the hands of federal judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

No matter what Mehta decides, Google is expected to appeal, and the DOJ can too. Hearings to decide on remedies in this case are slated for April and May.

Final remedy recommendations from the government and Google were due to the judge Friday, giving a Trump-led DOJ one last chance to alter the prior Biden-era suggestion to the judge that Google be broken up with the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser or contingent sale of its Android operating system.

It didn't do so, despite being lobbied by the company to reconsider the Chrome proposal on national security concerns.

""Google must divest the Chrome browser — an important search access point,"" the DOJ stated in its final proposal on Friday.

It argued that under a different owner, new rivals would have an “opportunity to operate a significant gateway to search the internet, free of Google's monopoly control.”

They also retained part of a request to leave the door open to a possible divestiture of Google's Android operating system.

But prosecutors did drop the Biden DOJ's push for Google to sell off its AI bets, instead suggesting a setup where federal authorities could keep tabs on proposed AI investments that could threaten search competition.

Anthropic has argued to the judge that forcing Google to relinquish its stake would tilt the AI playing field in favor of OpenAI and its backer, Microsoft (MSFT).

“Plaintiffs no longer seek the mandatory divestiture of Google's AI investments,” the DOJ said Friday in its revised proposal.

Derek Mountford, a shareholder in Gunster's business litigation practice group who specializes in antitrust litigation, said while the Trump administration's AI rollback is a concession, it comes with a hook.

""They're asking for some reporting requirements to be attached to it,"" he said.

""I think one of the [antitrust] themes you might see in a second Trump administration is even if they're walking back some of the proposed sanctions, there's still that element of control and monitoring and enforcement that's going on in the background.""

The tension for the Trump administration, Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance last week, is that it is engaged in an existential fight with China for the future of AI and Google can still be an important weapon for the US.

""What are we going to do, hobble one of our main US runners in that race by breaking up that company?” asked Kovacevich, who previously led Google's US policy strategy and external affairs team.

""It seems ill-timed to do that.""

The DOJ did stick with another expected remedy proposal that strikes at a major contention in the case.

It asked the judge to block Google from contracts that secure its search engine as the default across dozens of internet-connected devices, such as mobile phones made by Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and others, and browsers, including Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox.

That is not good news for Apple, jeopardizing a major revenue stream. In 2021, Google paid $26 billion for default search placements, and the lion's share of that went to Apple.

Bernstein analysts have estimated Apple's revenue from Google Search defaults is somewhere between $18 billion and $20 billion per year.

Google countered the DOJ's request on Friday by asking that it still be free to enter into contracts to make Google search a default — so long as it does not condition search licensing based on device manufacturers also agreeing to distribute, preload, place, display, use, or license its AI Gemini Assistant Application.

McCareins, the law professor at Kellogg, said the DOJ has little to lose at this stage by holding on to Chrome divestment as a negotiating chip, given that both the underlying case and the judge's decision on remedies are subject to appeal.

""Just from a bargaining negotiating position, at this stage of the proceedings, I am not shocked or stunned that the new sheriffs in town have continued to argue for divestiture of Chrome,"" McCareins said.

Oops, something went wrong

Delta Air Lines (DAL) cut its outlook for the current quarter on Monday, citing a dip in consumer and corporate confidence as well as softening domestic demand amid ""macro uncertainty.""

The company's warnings serve as one of the earliest reads on how recent volatility in markets and worries over the economic outlook are weighing on corporate performance in the first quarter of the year.

In a release ahead of an investor presentation set for Tuesday, the company said revenue growth is now expected to come in at 3%-4% for the first quarter, down from a range of 7%-9% Delta previously forecasted.

Profits are also expected to take a hit, with earnings per share expected to be in a range of $0.30-$0.50 in the first quarter, down from $0.70-$1.00 previously.

Delta stock fell 10% in premarket trading on Tuesday, after dropping as much as 13% following the news.

Shares of Delta were down more than 16% before Monday's news amid a difficult year for the industry. The deadliest crash in the US in 16 years took place in January and then another crash in Toronto in February saw 21 passengers injured but no fatalities.

The company's comments about deteriorating sentiment among American consumers also come after stocks plunged on Monday due in part to increasingly cautious views about the US economy.

Notably, Delta highlighted that softness in domestic demand led to the lower guidance, while ""premium, international and loyalty revenue growth trends are consistent with expectations.""

This update also fits another key market narrative, where US growth forecasts have been sliding while similar outlooks in Europe have been rising. 

In recent months, consumer sentiment data has tumbled and spending data has also begun to track lower. In January, consumer spending fell for the first time in nearly two years, and separate data showed retail sales saw the largest monthly decline in a year.

Meanwhile, consumer confidence saw its largest monthly decline in nearly four years during the month of February. Uncertainty about the impact of President Trump's policies has been key in driving the weakening consumer mood.

Given the market's recent drawdown amid weakening confidence from the consumer, investors have been closely watching for connections between a souring consumer and the outlook for American corporates.

""Weak confidence coincided with outflows in passive US equity funds in early February to begin the risk-off period,"" Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser wrote in a note to clients on Monday. ""The clear link between policy uncertainty and retail/consumer confidence remains [an] area of concern for us with no clear source of data relief.""

Oops, something went wrong

Southwest Airlines will begin charging customers to check their bags, ending a long-standing ""bags fly free"" policy that inspired loyalty and differentiated the brand from its competitors.

Starting with flights booked on or after May 28, only customers with certain qualifications will receive free checked bags, the airline announced Tuesday.

This includes preferred members of Southwest's Rapid Rewards program, those flying business class and holders of the airline's credit card.

For decades, Southwest offered two free checked bags to every customer and built advertising campaigns around the policy. At Southwest's investor day in late September, executives said free bags were key in helping the budget-friendly airline stand out from its rivals. All other major U.S. airlines charge fees for checked bags.

""We have tremendous opportunity to meet current and future Customer needs, attract new Customer segments we don't compete for today, and return to the levels of profitability that both we and our Shareholders expect,"" Chief Executive Bob Jordan said in a statement accompanying the announcement.

Southwest will also offer a new basic fare on its lowest-priced tickets starting in May, in advance of offering assigned seating and extra legroom. The basic price is intended to ""reach consumers who value fare above everything else,"" the announcement said.

The airline announced last summer that it would do away with its open seating policy, a decades-long practice that allowed customers to select seats on a first come, first served basis. Some Southwest customers expressed disappointment that the company was straying from features that once defined the brand.

Read more: After 57 years of open seating, is Southwest changing its brand? 

The end of free checked bags is another perk that Southwest is eliminating in an attempt to increase profits. The airline has struggled recently and is under pressure from activist investors to boost revenue.

Last month, Southwest announced its plan to eliminate 15% of its corporate workforce, or 1,750 jobs, in the first major layoffs in the company's history. The layoffs are part of a larger plan to cut costs and create a “leaner, faster, and more agile organization,"" Jordan said at the time.

The airline estimated in September that charging fees for checked bags would bring in about $1.5 billion a year but would cost the company $1.8 billion in lost business from customers who were drawn to the free bag policy. Southwest stock rose more than 8% on Tuesday.

Rapid Rewards A-List preferred members and customers flying business class will still receive two free checked bags; regular A-List members, credit card holders and other select customers will receive one free checked bag.

The changes are intended to ""deepen and reward loyalty between Southwest and its most engaged customers,"" the airline's announcement said.

The recent crypto market downturn has caused the once-popular $120,000 bitcoin (BTC) options bet to lose its crown to the $100,000 bet in a sign that traders are reassessing their bullish expectations.

At press time, the $100,000 call was the most popular BTC options contract on the exchange, boasting a notional open interest of $1.55 billion. The notional open interest represents the dollar value of the number of active option contracts at a given time.

Meanwhile, the $120,000 call, the former leader up until last month, stood at the number two position, with a notional open interest of $1.33 billion.

A call gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market. Hence, a significant built-up of open interest in higher strike out-of-the-money calls, such as $100,000 and $120,000, reflects bullish expectations.

The shift lower in the most preferred call to the $100,000 strike likely shows traders opting for a more conservative bet in the wake of the recent price crash to under $80,000. Additionally, it may signal a broader reassessment of bullish sentiment.

The 25-delta risk reversals, which measure the difference between implied volatility (demand) for higher strike calls relative to lower strike puts, show negative readings or bias for protective put options out to the May end expiry. It's representative of fears of an extended price slide in the market.

The pricing remains bullish in favor of call options after May. Besides, the dollar value of the total number of calls open at press time was over $16 billion – nearly twice more than $8.35 billion in put options.

 Bitcoin's correction may be over, supported by derivatives markets, a weak dollar and contagion from the US budget crisis. 

Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to a four-month low of $76,700 on March 11, following a 6% weekly decline in the S&P 500 index.

The stock market correction pushed the index to its lowest level in six months as investors priced in higher odds of a global economic downturn.

Despite Bitcoin's 30% drop from its all-time high of $109,350, four key indicators suggest that the correction may be over.

Some analysts argue that Bitcoin has entered a bear market. However, the current price action differs significantly from the November 2021 crash, which started with a 41% drop from $69,000 to $40,560 in just 60 days.

A comparable scenario today would imply a decline to $64,400 by the end of March.

The current correction mirrors the 31.5% drop from $71,940 on June 7, 2024, to $49,220 over 60 days.

Additionally, during the late 2021 bear market, the US dollar was strengthening against a basket of foreign currencies, as reflected in the DXY index, which surged from 92.4 in September 2021 to 96.0 by December 2021.

This time, however, the DXY started 2025 at 109.2 and has since declined to 104. Traders argue that Bitcoin maintains an inverse correlation with the DXY index, as it is primarily viewed as a risk-on asset rather than a safe-haven hedge against dollar weakness.

Overall, current market conditions show no signs of investors moving to cash positions, which supports Bitcoin's price.

The Bitcoin derivatives market remains stable, as the current annualized premium on futures stands at 4.5%, despite a 19% price drop between March 2 and 11.

For comparison, on June 18, 2022, this indicator fell below 0% after a sharp 44% decline from $31,350 to $17,585 in just 12 days.

Similarly, the Bitcoin perpetual futures funding rate is hovering near zero, signaling balanced leverage demand between longs and shorts. Bearish market conditions typically drive excessive demand for short positions, pushing the funding rate below zero.

Several publicly traded companies with market values exceeding $150 billion have seen sharp declines from their all-time highs, including Tesla (-54%), Palantir (-40%), Nvidia (-34%), Blackstone (-32%), Broadcom (-29%), TSM (-26%), and ServiceNow (-25%). Investor sentiment, especially in the artificial intelligence sector, has turned bearish amid growing recession fears.

Traders are concerned about a potential US government shutdown on March 15, as lawmakers must pass a bill to raise the debt ceiling. However, according to Yahoo Finance, the Republican party remains divided.

The key points of contention in House Speaker Mike Johnson's proposal are increased spending on defense and immigration.

Risk-on markets, including Bitcoin, are likely to react positively if an agreement is reached.

Early signs of a real estate crisis could accelerate capital outflows into other scarce assets. According to Feb. 27 data from the US National Association of Realtors, home contract signings fell to an all-time low in January.

Additionally, a Feb. 23 opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal revealed that over 7% of Federal Housing Administration-insured loans are at least 90 days past due, surpassing the peak of the 2008 subprime crisis.

In essence, Bitcoin's path to reclaiming $90,000 is supported by a weaker US dollar, historical evidence that a 30% price correction does not signal a bear market, resilience in BTC derivatives markets, contagion from government shutdown risks, and early signs of a real estate crisis.

 The US strategic crypto reserve featuring Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana and Cardano legitimizes these platforms, enabling ecosystem growth, investment and innovation across DeFi, infrastructure and blockchain gaming. 

Opinion by: Tim Haldorsson, founder of Lunar Strategy

When US President Donald Trump announced the US strategic crypto reserve on March 2, the immediate focus fell on the price surges of the included coins. Behind the market excitement lies a much bigger story that extends far beyond the named assets themselves. 

The real opportunity lies not in holding Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) — it's in building on these newly legitimized platforms.

This government endorsement creates fertile ground for an entire ecosystem of projects, unleashing innovation across multiple sectors while creating investment opportunities that could define the next wave of blockchain adoption.

The strategic reserve announcement fundamentally changed the risk profile for projects building on these networks. Developers quietly building on Ethereum, Solana and Cardano now find themselves on government-approved foundations. This validation removes significant uncertainty — a crucial factor for attracting users and capital.

When a nation plans to hold these assets in reserve, it signals a long-term commitment to their viability. For projects building on these networks, this increases confidence that their underlying platform won't face existential regulatory threats. Infrastructure projects particularly stand to benefit; layer-2 scaling solutions for Ethereum, developer tooling for Solana and interoperability solutions for Cardano can now operate with greater certainty about their foundation's future.

The early evidence already supports this shift. After the announcement, Cardano's ecosystem saw renewed attention, with significant whale accumulation and increased trading volume across its decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. 

Projects such as Minswap and Liqwid Finance experienced growing interest as users gained confidence in the network's long-term viability. Ethereum and Solana ecosystems are seeing similar effects, with capital flowing to projects that leverage their unique strengths.

Not all projects will benefit equally from this validation. Specific sectors are positioned to capture disproportionate growth as retail and institutional investors recalibrate their approach to these now-endorsed chains.

DeFi applications stand out as immediate beneficiaries. With multiple networks now government-backed, crosschain DeFi protocols that facilitate liquidity between Ethereum, Solana and Cardano are seeing renewed interest. The government's implicit endorsement of multiple chains reinforces the vision of a multichain future rather than a winner-take-all scenario.

Infrastructure projects that connect these networks will also thrive. Crosschain bridges, already vital for a fragmented blockchain landscape, become even more critical when multiple networks have official backing. Projects building on identity solutions could also see significant interest — these government-approved networks make ideal foundations for digital identity systems requiring trust and stability.

Recent: Does XRP, SOL or ADA belong in a US crypto reserve?

Finally, the blockchain gaming sector, which had already shown strong growth with 7.4 million daily active wallets by the end of 2024, could accelerate as developers flock to these legitimized platforms. Games built on Solana's speed or Cardano's security can point to government endorsement as a credibility booster when seeking partners or users.

For investors looking to capitalize on this ecosystem growth, several key metrics separate promising projects from mere speculation.

Total value locked (TVL) provides a window into genuine usage and trust. Projects showing significant TVL growth after the announcement demonstrate real traction. Developer activity remains another critical indicator: Ethereum remains the most important developer ecosystem, with thousands of active monthly contributors. At the same time, Solana experienced the fastest developer growth in 2024, particularly in emerging markets like India.

User adoption metrics tell an equally important story. Daily active wallets, transaction volumes and community growth reveal whether a project captures actual market share or generates hype. Strong partnerships also signal project strength — those securing collaborations with established institutions gain credibility and distribution channels.

The most promising projects combine these metrics with robust security measures and regulatory compliance — increasingly important factors now that these networks have government attention. Projects anticipating and addressing compliance requirements position themselves to benefit from institutional adoption.

Historically, government endorsements have led to increased institutional investment. The strategic reserve announcement could recalibrate how venture capital flows through the crypto ecosystem if this pattern holds. Venture capitalists, who were previously cautious about regulatory uncertainty, now have more precise signals about what networks have an unofficial blessing.

We may see venture firms double down on projects building on Ethereum, Solana and Cardano at the expense of alternative chains. New dedicated funds focusing specifically on government-endorsed networks could emerge, similar to how funds reorient around policy shifts in other sectors.

This shift extends beyond where capital flows and influences what types of projects are funded. Compliance-focused startups, infrastructure plays and enterprise-ready applications will attract more attention than purely speculative projects. VCs will increasingly favor teams that understand how to navigate the intersection of innovation and regulation.

For startups, this creates both opportunity and challenge. Building on these endorsed networks offers a more straightforward path to funding, but expectations around compliance and security will rise accordingly. The days of raising millions on concepts alone are giving way to the demand for solid execution and regulatory awareness.

With multiple chains now part of the strategic reserve, interoperability solutions take center stage. Projects enabling seamless movement between Ethereum, Solana and Cardano stand to benefit tremendously from this new multichain reality.

Crosschain bridges like Wormhole, initially connecting Ethereum and Solana, will likely expand to include Cardano as the demand for connectivity between all endorsed networks grows.

Protocols facilitating crosschain governance or identity will similarly find increased relevance as assets and users flow between networks.

The government's endorsement of multiple chains effectively validates the multichain thesis — that different networks serve different use cases rather than one blockchain dominating all activity. This creates space for infrastructure that connects these specialized systems into a cohesive whole.

The effects of this government endorsement will unfold over multiple time horizons — the immediate price rallies and attention spikes we've already witnessed. The more substantial ecosystem growth will develop over months and years.

Expect new project announcements and funding rounds in the next three to six months, explicitly citing the strategic reserve to validate their approach. Development activity on these networks will accelerate as previously hesitant teams about regulatory risk jump in.

Within a year, we'll likely see the first major institutional products built on these networks launch with formal regulatory approval. The venture funding deployed now will begin producing tangible applications across DeFi, identity, gaming and enterprise sectors.

By the two-to-three-year mark, if historical patterns from other government-validated technologies hold, these blockchain ecosystems could become mainstream infrastructure, extending far beyond their current use cases. As the internet grew from a government project to a commercial ecosystem, these networks could evolve from reserve assets to fundamental digital infrastructure.

The strategic reserve announcement might begin a new phase of worldwide blockchain adoption for investors, developers and users.

 A House bill filed by a Texas Democrat proposed the state's comptroller wouldn't be able to invest more than $250 million in crypto. 

A member of the Texas legislature has proposed a bill that could limit the amount local and state authorities invest in cryptocurrency as a reserve asset.

In a bill filed on March 10, Texas Representative Ron Reynolds proposed the state's comptroller not be allowed to invest more than $250 million of its Economic Stabilization Fund — otherwise known as a “rainy day” fund — in Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies. The legislation also suggested that Texas municipalities or counties could not invest more than $10 million in crypto.

The proposed bill followed the Texas Senate passing legislation on March 6 to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state. The SB 21 bill seemingly could allow the Texas comptroller to have no limit on purchasing BTC for a reserve, based on the most recent draft.

The plan for a strategic Bitcoin reserve in Texas was one of many separate bills proposed in US state governments following the inauguration of President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers winning control of the US House of Representatives and Senate. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said in January that the state's legislative priorities for 2025 would include a proposal to establish a Texas Bitcoin Reserve.

It's unclear if Rep. Reynolds, a Democrat, intended to support the BTC reserve bill introduced by State Senator Charles Schwertner, a Republican, or propose restrictions in the event the legislation becomes law. If passed and signed by Governor Greg Abbott, the bill would take effect on Sept. 1. Cointelegraph reached out to Rep. Reynolds' office for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication. 

Though Trump signed an executive order on March 7 to create a federal “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and “Digital Asset Stockpile,” many legal experts have questioned the US president's authority to enact specific policies through EOs. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced legislation on March 11 to codify the proposed BTC reserve into law in the Senate.

 At the peak of the outage, Downdetector recorded nearly 40,000 users unable to access X; however, Elon Musk says user functionality was quickly restored. 

A hacking group with ties to Russia has claimed responsibility for the massive cyberattack on X, which saw the social media platform unable to be accessed by thousands of users, although user functionality was quickly restored. 

Cybersecurity group SpyoSecure said in a March 10 post to X that hacker group Dark Storm made a Telegram post taking credit for the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, which was posted by the group's leader. 

“To anyone wondering why X (Twitter) was down, it was under attack by Dark Storm Team,” SpyoSecure said. 

Source: SpyoSecure

The Telegram channel has since been deleted for violating the platform's terms of service. Screenshots shared on X show them stating they “took Twitter offline,” alongside a screenshot of failed connection attempts from various global locations.

Ed Krassenstein, a social media personality and co-founder of NFT marketplace NFTz.me, said in a March 10 post to X that he had also been investigating the attack and was in touch with Dark Storm's leader, who again claimed they were behind it. 

“The reason he gives me for the attack is just a demonstration of our strength, with no political motives,” Krassenstein said.

The pro-Palestinian hacker group Dark Storm has been active since 2023, has ties to Russia, and is known for targeting NATO countries. 

Platform owner Elon Musk confirmed the social media platform had been hit with a cyberattack preventing some users from accessing the site on March 10.

He said in a March 10 interview with Fox Business's Larry Kudlow he had a rough idea of where the IP address of the hackers originated.

It comes amid violence at Tesla facilities around the US as part of a broader “Take down Tesla” movement protesting Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is taking the axe to many government departments. 

Musk told Kudlow that regardless of the protests, he still thinks they are “doing the right thing here” because DOGE is cutting spending to initiatives “very few taxpayers would agree make sense.” 

Tesla stock is also suffering. In the most recent trading session, Tesla is down over 15% to $222 per share. In the after-hours session, it's down a further 3% to $215, according to Google Finance.

This isn't the first time X has suffered a DDoS attack. Last August, Musk claimed the platform was hit by hackers prior to his interview with then-presidential hopeful Donald Trump.

 While Bitcoin may experience a retracement to $70,000, this remains part of an organic “correction within a bull market,” Nansen analysts told Cointelegraph. 

Bitcoin's potential retracement to $70,000 may be an organic part of the current bull market, despite crypto investor concerns of an early arrival of a bear market cycle.

Bitcoin (BTC) fell more than 14% during the past week to close around $80,708 after investors were disappointed with the lack of direct federal Bitcoin investments in President Donald Trump's March 7 executive order that outlined a plan to create a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases.

Despite the drop in investor sentiment, cryptocurrencies and global markets remain in a “macro correction” as part of the bull market, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at the Nansen crypto intelligence platform.

Most cryptocurrencies have broken key support levels, making it hard to estimate the next key price levels, the analyst told Cointelegraph, adding:

“We are still in a correction within a bull market: Stocks and crypto have realized and are pricing; a period of tariff uncertainty and fiscal cuts, no Fed put. Recession fears are popping up,” added the analyst.

Other analysts have also warned that Bitcoin may experience a deeper retracement toward the “low $70,000's range,” which Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset investment platform Nexo, told Cointelegraph could “provide a foundation for a more sustainable recovery.”

Bitcoin's potential retracement to the $70,000 psychological mark would still fall within the regular price movement of a bull market, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and chief investment officer of Maelstrom.

“Then we get Fed, PBOC, ECB, and BOJ all easing to make their country great again,” added Hayes, referring to quantitative easing, a monetary policy where central banks increase the money supply by buying government bonds and other financial assets.

Quantitative easing has historically been positive for Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin's price rose over 1,050% during the last quantitative easing period, from just $6,000 in March 2020 to $69,000 by November 2021, after the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing policy was announced during the COVID-19 pandemic on March 23, 2020, buying over $4 trillion worth of assets such as treasuries.

 The S&P 500, tech-heavy Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average all fell heavily this week. 

Crypto and tech stocks saw large selloffs on March 10 as fears of a US recession heightened despite efforts from the White House to temper concerns. 

Economists at Wall Street investment bank JPMorgan have raised their recession risk this year to 40%, up from 30% at the beginning of 2025. “We see a material risk that the US falls into recession this year owing to extreme US policies,” wrote the analysts, according to The Wall Street Journal. 

Analysts at Goldman Sachs economists also raised their 12-month recession probability to 20%, up from 15%. They said that the forecast could rise further if the Trump administration remains “committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data.” 

Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley economists lowered their economic growth forecasts last week and raised inflation expectations. The bank predicted a GDP growth of just 1.5% in 2025, falling to 1.2% in 2026. 

It comes despite a key economic adviser to US President Donald Trump pushed back against talks of a recession. Speaking to CNBC on March 10, Kevin Hassett, who heads the National Economic Council, said there were many reasons to be optimistic about the US economy. 

“There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward. But for sure, this quarter, there are some blips in the data,” he said. 

Meanwhile, in an interview with Fox News on March 9, Donald Trump responded to a question about the possibility of a recession by saying the US economy was going through “a period of transition.”

Blockchain betting platform Polymarket quipped that recession odds are “the best looking chart in finance right now.”

The Magnificent 7 — America's top tech firms — have had a tumultuous start to the week, collectively shedding more than $750 billion in market cap in one day. Tesla tanked a whopping 15%, becoming the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year.

AI giant Nvidia lost 5.1%, Apple shed 4.9%, Meta fell 4.4% and Alphabet lost 4.5% on the day.

 Altseason may be over as ETFs, perps and structured products keep capital locked in Bitcoin and high-cap assets. 

Bitcoin exchange-traded products may have fundamentally altered the concept of a crypto “altseason.”

For years, the crypto market followed a familiar rhythm, a near-predictable dance of capital rotation. Bitcoin (BTC) surged, bringing mainstream attention and liquidity, and then the floodgates opened to altcoins. Speculative capital rushed into lower-cap assets, inflating their values in what traders euphorically deemed “altseason.”

However, once taken for granted, this cycle shows signs of a structural collapse. 

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have shattered records, funneling $129 billion in capital inflows in 2024. This has provided unprecedented access to Bitcoin for both retail and institutional investors, yet it has also created a vacuum, sucking capital away from speculative assets. Institutional players now have a safe, regulated way to gain exposure to crypto without the Wild West risks of the altcoin market. Many retail investors are also finding ETFs more appealing than the perilous hunt for the next 100x token. Well-known Bitcoin analyst Plan B even traded in his actual BTC for a spot ETF. 

The shift is happening in real time, and if the capital remains locked in structured products, altcoins face a diminishing share of market liquidity and relevance. 

Bitcoin ETFs offer an alternative to chasing high-risk, low-cap assets, as investors can access leverage, liquidity and regulatory clarity through structured products. The retail crowd, once a major driver of altcoin speculation, now has direct access to Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) ETFs, vehicles that eliminate self-custody concerns, mitigate counterparty risk and align with traditional investment frameworks. 

Institutions have even greater incentives to sidestep altcoin risk. Hedge funds and professional trading desks, which once chased higher returns in low-liquidity altcoins, can deploy leverage through derivatives or take exposure via ETFs on legacy financial rails.

With the ability to hedge through options and futures, the incentive to gamble on illiquid, low-volume altcoins diminishes significantly. This has been further reinforced by the record $2.4 billion in outflows in February and arbitrage opportunities created by ETF redemptions, forcing a level of discipline into crypto markets that did not previously exist.

Venture capital (VC) firms have historically been the lifeblood of alt seasons, injecting liquidity into nascent projects and spinning grand narratives around emerging tokens. 

However, with leverage being easily accessible and capital efficiency a key priority, VCs are rethinking their approach. 

VCs strive to make as much return on investment (ROI) as possible, but the typical range is between 17% and 25%. In traditional finance, the risk-free rate of capital serves as the benchmark against which all investments are measured, typically represented by US Treasury yields. 

In the crypto space, Bitcoin's historical growth rate functions as a similar baseline for expected returns. This effectively becomes the industry's version of the risk-free rate. Over the last decade, Bitcoin's compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past 10 years has averaged 77%, significantly outperforming traditional assets like gold (8%) and the S&P 500 (11%). Even over the past five years, including both bull and bear market conditions, Bitcoin has maintained a 67% CAGR. 

Using this as a baseline, a venture capitalist deploying capital in Bitcoin or Bitcoin-related ventures at this growth rate would see a total ROI of approximately 1,199% over five years, meaning the investment would increase nearly 12x. 

Related: Altcoin ETFs are coming, but demand may be limited: Analysts

While Bitcoin remains volatile, its long-term outperformance has positioned it as the fundamental benchmark for evaluating risk-adjusted returns in the crypto space. With arbitrage opportunities and reduced risk, VCs may play the safer bet. 

In 2024, VC deal counts dropped 46%, even as overall investment volumes rebounded in Q4. This signals a shift toward more selective, high-value projects rather than speculative funding. 

Web3 and AI-driven crypto startups are still drawing attention, but the days of indiscriminate funding for every token with a white paper may be numbered. If venture capital pivots further toward structured exposure through ETFs rather than a direct investment in risky startups, the consequences could be severe for new altcoin projects.

Meanwhile, the few altcoin projects that have made it onto institutional radars — such as Aptos, which recently saw an ETF filing — are exceptions, not the rule. Even crypto index ETFs, designed to capture broader exposure, have struggled to attract meaningful inflows, underscoring that capital is concentrated rather than dispersed.

The landscape has shifted. The sheer number of altcoins vying for attention has created a saturation problem. According to Dune Analytics, over 40 million tokens are currently on the market. 1.2 million new tokens were launched on average per month in 2024, and over 5 million have been created since the start of 2025.

With institutions gravitating toward structured exposure and a lack of retail-driven speculative demand, liquidity is not trickling down to altcoins as it once did.

This presents a hard truth: Most altcoins will not make it. The CEO of CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju, recently warned that most of these assets are unlikely to survive without a fundamental shift in market structure. “The era of everything pumping is over,” Ju said in a recent X post. 

The traditional playbook of waiting for Bitcoin dominance to wane before rotating into altcoins may no longer apply in an era where capital stays locked in ETFs and perps rather than free-flowing into speculative assets.

The crypto market is not what it once was. The days of easy, cyclical altcoin rallies may be replaced by an ecosystem where capital efficiency, structured financial products and regulatory clarity dictate where the money flows. ETFs are changing how people invest in Bitcoin and fundamentally altering liquidity distribution across the entire market.

For those who built their strategies on the assumption that an altcoin boom would follow every Bitcoin rally, the time may have come to reconsider. The rules may have changed as the market has matured.

 Its largest holding is Strategy's stock, MSTR, and it also holds shares in several Bitcoin miners. 

Bitwise has launched an exchange-traded fund (ETF) holding stocks of companies with large Bitcoin (BTC) treasuries, the asset manager said on March 11. 

The Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF (OWNB) “seeks to track the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations Index, a new equity index of companies with at least 1,000 bitcoin in their corporate treasuries,” Bitwise said. 

The ETF is the latest in a flurry of new investment products aimed at offering exposure to companies with large Bitcoin treasuries. 

“A lot of people wonder: Why do companies buy and hold bitcoin? The answer is simple: For the exact same reasons people do,” Matt Hougan, Bitwise's chief investment officer, said in a statement.

“These companies perceive bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset that's liquid and scarce — and not subject to the whims or money printing of any government.”

As of March 11, the ETF's largest holdings include Strategy (MSTR), Michael Saylor's de facto Bitcoin fund, and Bitcoin miners such as MARA Holdings (MARA), CleanSpark (CLSK), and Riot Platforms (RIOT).

It also includes stocks such as gaming company Boyaa Interactive and investment manager Galaxy Digital (GLXY). 

Bitwise's index is weighted based on the amount of Bitcoin held, with the largest holding capped at 20%, the asset manager said.

In 2024, rising Bitcoin prices sent shares of Strategy soaring more than 350%, according to data from FinanceCharts. The move prompted dozens of other companies to start accumulating Bitcoin treasuries. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, corporate Bitcoin holdings exceed $54 billion as of March 11. 

Strategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with a treasury worth more than $41 billion, the data shows. 

Even the US government has created a strategic Bitcoin reserve, initially comprising only Bitcoin seized by law enforcement. 

Other asset managers are launching similar investment products to Bitwise's. In December, asset manager Strive, founded by former US presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy, asked United States regulators for permission to list an ETF investing in convertible bonds issued by Strategy and other corporate Bitcoin buyers. 

The ETF seeks to offer exposure to “Bitcoin Bonds,” described as “convertible securities” issued by companies that plan to “invest all or a significant portion of the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin,” according to the filing. 

Asset manager REX Shares is also preparing to launch a Bitcoin corporate treasury ETF, it said on March 10.

 The Republican-led GENIUS Act saw a raft of changes after bipartisan discussions, and the Senate Banking Committee will vote on the stablecoin bill on March 13. 

US Senate Banking Committee is set to vote on a Republican-led stablecoin framework bill on March 13, after it was updated following consultation with committee Democrats.

GOP Senator Bill Hagerty, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said on March 10 that he introduced an update of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which would go to a Banking Committee vote on March 13.

He added that the updated bill saw bipartisan consultation. The bill is co-sponsored by Republican Senators Cynthia Lummis and Tim Scott, who is also chair of the Banking Committee chair, along with Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand and Angela Alsobrooks.

“The updated version of the GENIUS Act makes significant improvements to a number of important provisions, including consumer protections, authorized stablecoin issuers, risk mitigation, state pathways, insolvency, transparency, and more,” Gillibrand said in a statement.

Hagerty first introduced the bill in early February. It aims to bring issuers of US dollar stablecoins with market caps over $10 billion — currently only Tether (USDT) and Circle's USDC (USDC) — under Federal Reserve regulations. Those under $10 billion could opt into state-level regulation.

Web3 learning app EasyA co-founder Dom Kwok said on X that the latest version of the GENIUS Act, shared by FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, gives “US-issued stablecoins a competitive advantage.”

He added that the bill now holds foreign stablecoin issuers to “extra high standards” in areas such as reserve and liquidity requirements, money laundering checks and sanctions checks.

“Most foreign issuers will find these standards hard to meet,” which gives Circle's USDC and Ripple Labs' Ripple USD (RLUSD) “an upper hand,” he said.

Crypto lawyer and Hogan & Hogan partner Jeremy Hogan came to the same conclusion in a separate X post, saying the bill's requirements, particularly around reserves and Anti-Money Laundering checks, “all fall neatly for RLSUD and USDC.”

The GENIUS Act still has a way to go before becoming law. The Senate Banking Committee will have to vote to pass the bill and it will then be put to a full Senate floor vote where it could be debated.

If it passes the Senate, it will head to the House. If the House doesn't change the bill, then it will be sent to President Donald Trump to sign into law or veto.

 California's Department of Justice says it took down 42 crypto scam websites in 2024 that haad stolen $6.5 million from users. 

A California financial regulator says users reported seven new types of crypto and AI scams that it hadn't seen before through thousands of complaints in 2024. 

The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) said in a March 10 statement that it received 2,668 complaints in 2024 and found seven types of scams they didn't have on record yet, such as fake Bitcoin (BTC) mining schemes, where fraudsters offer fake investments in mining. 

The DFPI also received complaints about fake crypto gaming schemes, where users are encouraged to deposit funds only to have their wallets drained, and fraudsters offering fake jobs that require victims to transfer crypto and provide private information.

Victims also reported the theft of private keys through fake airdrops, fake investment group scams in WhatsApp or Telegram, AI Investment scams offering unusually high returns and losing their crypto after interacting with certain sham websites. 

The AI industry experienced significant growth in 2024, reaching a market cap of $638 billion, according to Precedence Research. 

There was also a notable rise in crimeware-as-a-service (CaaS), where experienced hackers and cybercriminals sell their tools and services to less experienced offenders for a price.

DFPI Commissioner KC Mohseni said the regulator is urging caution when interacting with unknown platforms and to “verify website domains to avoid fraudulent imitations, and stay wary of crypto recovery scam sites.”

Through its partnership with the State, the DFPI says it shut down more than 26 fraudulent crypto websites and uncovered $4.6 million in user losses last year. 

California's Department of Justice (DOJ) took down 42 crypto scam websites in 2024 that stole $6.5 million from victims, with an average loss per person of $146,306.

In a March 10 statement, the California DOJ said that because international fraudsters often carry out scams, they are difficult to prosecute and arrest.

Common threads among the scam websites were promises of high returns, no contact information, offers of prizes for signing up, and no listings on legitimate crypto industry websites such as CoinMarketCap, the California DOJ said.

Meanwhile, blockchain security firm CertiK's annual Web3 security report flagged crypto phishing attacks, which cost users $1 billion across 296 incidents, as the most significant security threat of 2024.

 For CoreWeave, the deal may supplement lost income from the contracts Microsoft cancelled. 

CoreWeave announced on March 11 that it had struck a five-year deal worth up to $11.9 billion with OpenAI, the nonprofit research and development company that created ChatGPT. Through the deal, OpenAI will become an investor in CoreWeave through the issuance of $350 million of stock, while CoreWeave will deliver AI infrastructure.

The deal comes ahead of the anticipated CoreWeave initial public offering (IPO). According to its offering filing, the company, founded in 2017 in Livingston, New Jersey, reported $1.9 billion in revenue with a net loss of $863 million in 2024. CoreWeave provides cloud-based GPU infrastructure to AI developers.

The new deal may provide a boost to CoreWeave, as roughly two-thirds of the company's revenue came from Microsoft, which had planned to spend $10 billion on CoreWeave by 2030. According to a report from the Financial Times, Microsoft has canceled some contracts with the AI company due to missed deadlines, though CoreWeave has denied this.

In 2022, the size of the market was estimated to be $46.7 billion. By 2030, it is expected to be $398 billion. The compound annual growth rate during that time period is estimated to be 30.9%.

Cloud AI involves a combination of cloud computing and artificial intelligence services that businesses can use to theoretically increase their revenue. Some of the aspects of a business that these services touch on include scalability, predictive analytics and cost savings by not having to build their own AI model.

 The filing is the latest effort by a US exchange to integrate staking into Ether ETFs. 

Securities exchange Cboe BZX is seeking permission from US regulators to incorporate staking into Fidelity's Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to a March 11 filing. 

The filing marks Cboe's latest attempt to support staking for the Ether (ETH) funds traded on its US exchange. 

Cboe's proposed rule change would allow Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) to “stake, or cause to be staked, all or a portion of the Trust's ether through one or more trusted staking providers,” the filing said.

The Fidelity Ethereum Fund is among the most popular Ether ETFs, with nearly $1 billion in assets under management, according to data from VettaFi. 

In February, Cboe asked permission to add staking to another Ether ETF, the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF.

Staking Ether enhances returns and involves posting ETH as collateral with a validator in exchange for rewards.

As of March 11, staking Ether yields approximately 3.3% APR, denominated in ETH, according to Staking Rewards.

Other popular cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), also feature staking mechanisms.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission must still approve Cboe's proposed rule changes before staking can commence.

In February, the SEC acknowledged more than a dozen exchange filings related to cryptocurrency ETFs, according to records.

The SEC's acknowledgments highlight how the agency has softened its stance on crypto since US President Donald Trump started his second term on Jan. 20. 

In addition to staking, the filings, submitted by Cboe and other exchanges, addressed proposed rule changes concerning options, in-kind redemptions and new types of altcoin funds.

Cboe has also asked permission to list Canary and WisdomTree's proposed XRP (XRP) ETFs and support in-kind creations and redemptions for Fidelity's Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH ETFs, among other proposed changes.

This dramatic shift set the foundation for Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve. 



 One of Trump's headline proposals is creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the US, treating Bitcoin as a national reserve asset akin to digital gold. The plan centers on stockpiling Bitcoin seized in criminal cases rather than purchasing it with taxpayer funds.Key componentsBitcoin as a reserve asset: The US government would officially recognize Bitcoin as a strategic holding, similar to gold in Fort Knox, leveraging its fixed supply and decentralized nature.Seized crypto, not taxpayer purchases: Instead of selling confiscated Bitcoin at auction (as has been past practice), the government would retain it in a central reserve account. Trump's executive order explicitly states that any Bitcoin deposited “shall not be sold.”No immediate buying spree: The plan does not include direct federal purchases of BTC but allows for “budget-neutral” methods to expand reserves, such as using proceeds from other seized assets.Does the US already have a Bitcoin stockpile? Yes, indirectly. Over the past decade, agencies have seized large amounts of BTC but historically auctioned it off rather than holding it. Trump's policy would change that, aiming to preserve Bitcoin as a national asset.Supporters believe this could strengthen US finances and ensure the nation isn't left behind in a Bitcoin-driven global economy. However, critics warn of Bitcoin's volatility and the risks of integrating a decentralized asset into government reserves.

 Crypto exchange OKX has denied ongoing investigations by the European Union on its social media channels. 

European Union regulators are reportedly looking into a service offered by crypto exchange OKX that may have played a role in the laundering of $100 million in funds from the Bybit hack, according to Bloomberg.

A March 11 Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter claims that national watchdogs from the EU's member states discussed the issue during a March 6 meeting hosted by the European Securities and Markets Authority's Digital Finance Standing Committee. The issue appears to be OKX's decentralized finance platform and wallet service.

On Jan. 27, OKX announced that it had secured a full Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license to operate across all EU member states under a unified regulatory framework. The question for EU regulators is whether two OKX services fall under the MiCA framework and, if so, whether the exchange could be penalized.

According to Bybit CEO Ben Zhou, nearly $100 million, or 40,233 Ether (ETH), from the $1.5 billion hack had been laundered through OKX's Web3 proxy, with a portion of the funds now untraceable.

OKX's wallet service has reached 53 million addresses and is able to connect to 100 blockchains. Fully decentralized platforms may be exempt from MiCA regulation, but according to the Bloomberg report, regulators from at least Austria and Croatia said OKX's Web3 service should fall under EU rules.

In a statement posted to X, OKX refuted the claim there were any ongoing investigations by the EU, adding that “Bybit's statements are spreading misinformation” and defending its Web3 wallet services.

Haider Rafique, OKX Global's chief marketing officer, added his own take: “We spoke to Bloomberg today and provided our statement refuting some of the alleged claims. It is preposterous to suggest that WE as a company would be involved in laundering stolen funds.”

The theft of $1.5 billion in ETH and ETH-related tokens from Bybit is the largest crypto hack to date. Crypto investigators have said that the Lazarus Group, a North Korean hacking ring, was responsible for the attack. According to Zhou, who declared war on the Lazarus Group after the hack, 3% of the stolen funds have been frozen, while 20% have gone dark.

 Meteora claims Ben Chow's X account was hacked after it posted accusations against memecoin founders. 

The X account of Meteora co-founder Ben Chow was reported to have been hacked after it posted a tweet reigniting the controversy around the launch of the Libra (LIBRA), Melania Meme (MELANIA) and Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin tokens that ultimately led to his resignation.

On March 11, Chow's X account posted an “official statement” about his departure from Meteora. The post called out DefiTuna founders Vlad Pozniakov and Dhirk, claiming the duo's sole intention was to extract the maximum funds possible from various memecoin token launches, including MELANIA, Mates (MATES) and a Raydium launch.

However, Meteora's official X account flagged the post as fraudulent, claiming that Chow's X account was compromised and urged users to refrain from clicking on any links.

Chow did not respond to Cointelegraph's request for comment. The fraudulent tweet has since been deleted after the account was recovered by Meteora.

Chow's message contained alleged screenshots of WhatsApp conversations between Kelsier Ventures CEO Hayden Davis, Kelsier Ventures' chief operating officer Gideon Davis, and Pozniakov discussing the MATES token, where one was quoted saying: “Yeah fellas tbh we are trying to max extract on this one.”

The legitimacy of the conversations could not be verified.

Milei dismissed rug pull allegations, claiming that he regularly promotes business projects as part of his free-market philosophy. His endorsement of the KIP Protocol, the developers behind LIBRA, was a part of the broader policy.

 Global investment firm VanEck appears to be one of the first issuers to hint at a spot Avalanche ETF with its registration in Delaware. 

Global investment firm VanEck registered an Avalanche exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, hinting at a forthcoming filing for a spot AVAX ETF.

VanEck, on March 10, registered a new cryptocurrency investment product called VanEck Avalanche ETF in Delaware, according to public records on the official Delaware state website.

Similar to other crypto ETF filings by VanEck, the potential new product under filing number 10125689 was registered as a trust corporate service company in Delaware.

The filing comes amid a major market sell-off, with Avalanche (AVAX) dropping 55% year-to-date, while Bitcoin (BTC) is down around 17% in 2025, according to CoinGecko.

With the new filing, Avalanche became the fourth crypto asset to see a standalone ETF registration by VanEck in Delaware, following Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL).

As previously reported, VanEck filed for a spot Solana ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June 2024, becoming one of the first issuers to file for such a product.

VanEck —  among the first spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the US in 2024 — has emerged as one of the major ETF players in the crypto market, known for being the first ETF provider to file for a futures Bitcoin ETF in 2017.

Launched in 2020 by Emin Gün Sirer's Ava Labs, Avalanche is a multichain smart contract and decentralized app launch platform that was created to rival the speed and scalability of Ethereum.

Avalanche's native utility token AVAX made it to the top 10 largest crypto assets by market capitalization in 2021. At the time of writing, the token is the 20th largest crypto asset with a market cap of $7 billion, according to CoinGecko.

 Ether has fallen over 53% since December, as analysts warn of lower lows amid trade war concerns and mounting ETF outflows. 

Ether is struggling to reverse a near three-month downtrend as macroeconomic concerns and continued selling pressure from US Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) weigh on investor sentiment.

Ether (ETH) has fallen by more than 53% since it began its downtrend on Dec. 16, 2024, after it had peaked above $4,100, TradingView data shows.

The downtrend has been fueled by global uncertainty around US import tariffs triggering trade war concerns and a lack of builder activity on the Ethereum network, according to Bitfinex analysts.

“A lack of new projects or builders moving to ETH, primarily due to high operating fees, is likely the principal reason behind the lackluster performance of ETH. [...] We believe that for ETH, $1,800 will be a strong level to watch,” the analysts told Cointelegraph. 

“However, the current sell-off is not being seen solely in ETH, we have seen a marketwide correction as fears over the impact of tariffs hit all risk assets,” they added.

Crypto investors are also wary of an early bear market cycle that could break from the traditional four-year crypto market pattern.

 European Stability Mechanism managing director Pierre Gramegna says a potential flood of US dollar-denominated stablecoin payment solutions could impact Europe's monetary sovereignty. 

Finance officials in the European Union are concerned US President Donald Trump's embrace of digital assets could affect Europe's monetary sovereignty and financial stability.

“The US administration is favorable toward cryptocurrencies and especially dollar-denominated stablecoins, which may raise certain concerns in Europe,” European Stability Mechanism (ESM) managing director Pierre Gramegna said at a Eurogroup press conference on March 10. 

Gramegna cautioned that the US crypto pivot “could eventually reignite foreign and US tech giants' plans to launch mass payment solutions based on dollar-denominated stablecoin,” adding, “And if this were to be successful, it could affect the euro area's monetary sovereignty and financial stability.”  

The ESM “supports the ECB's urgency in making the digital euro a reality to safeguard Europe's strategic autonomy — this digital euro is today more necessary than ever,” he added.

The ESM is an intergovernmental organization established by member states of the euro area, helping countries overcome financial crises and maintain long-term financial stability and prosperity.

“Policy developments in other jurisdictions can have important consequences for us here in Europe,” concurred Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe. 

“These discussions are fundamentally linked to our own autonomy and to the resilience of our currency,” he added, stating that a European central bank digital currency (CBDC) was now critical to staying ahead of the curve.

In February, the European Central Bank said it was expanding the development of its CBDC payment system to settle transactions between institutions. The ECB has been exploring CBDCs since 2020, including a consumer-facing retail digital euro and wholesale cross-border settlement between central banks.

Meanwhile, Trump has spoken out against a Federal Reserve CBDC, signing an executive order in January to establish a crypto working group while prohibiting the “establishment, issuance, circulation, and use” of a US CBDC.

The ECB has also rejected the idea of adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its monetary reserves or allowing other European central banks to do so. 

In late January, ECB President Christine Lagarde said that the reserves of central banks have to be “liquid, secure and safe,” implying that they would not include crypto assets. 

She added that she was “confident” that Bitcoin would not enter the reserves of banks under the European Council.

 Stablecoin firm Paxos is worried that the adoption of its USDG stablecoin may be affected by global regulatory arbitrage related to stablecoins. 

US lawmakers are set for a heated debate on stablecoin regulation, with key industry leaders expected to outline their vision for the future of digital asset oversight.

Charles Cascarilla, co-founder and CEO of stablecoin issuer Paxos, is scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee, where he will urge lawmakers to establish “cross-jurisdictional reciprocity” in stablecoin regulations.

In his prepared testimony, Cascarilla flagged concerns about the existing hurdles in the adoption of Paxos' Global Dollar (USDG) stablecoin due to it being issued via a regulated affiliate in Singapore.

“We fear that products like Paxos' Global Dollar (USDG) stablecoin, issued by a regulated affiliate in Singapore, will languish while departments and agencies make their determinations,” Cascarilla wrote in his speech.

Cascarilla recommended US lawmakers strengthen the current “international reciprocity language” to include clearly defined, accelerated timelines for the US Treasury Department to designate overseas jurisdictions for stablecoin regulation.

“This timeframe would force swift action and prevent bureaucratic delays while guaranteeing thorough scrutiny of foreign regulatory regimes,” the executive said.

Cascarilla emphasized that potential delays in applying such action would be a major hurdle in the adoption and distribution of stablecoins like USDG in the US as well as cross-border operations. 

“Reciprocity is not about lowering standards — it's about raising them globally,” Cascarilla said, adding:

Cascarilla's remarks come amid some Paxos-issued stablecoins facing compliance issues in the European Union following the enforcement of its crypto regulation framework, Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA).

Since the MiCA framework went into full force in December 2024, multiple crypto asset service providers in the EU — including Crypto.com and Coinbase — have announced the delistings of Paxos stablecoins, including Pax Dollar (PAX) and Pax Gold (PAXG).

While Paxos' Cascarilla is now calling for the US to take urgent action in forcing a global framework for stablecoin issuers that are regulated outside of the US, some industry CEOs have urged all stablecoin firms to get regulated domestically instead.

In February, Circle co-founder Jeremy Allaire argued that all dollar-based stablecoin issuers should register in the US, citing consumer protection and fair competition in the crypto market. He stated:

Issued and regulated in the US, Circle's USDC (USDC) stablecoin was officially approved as the first MiCA-compliant stablecoin in 2024.

 Deutsche Boerse's Clearstream to offer crypto custody and settlement services for institutional clients, expanding its Bitcoin and Ether offerings in 2025. 

Deutsche Boerse's trading unit, Clearstream, is preparing to launch cryptocurrency custody and settlement services for institutional clients in 2025 amid increasing demand for regulated digital asset infrastructure.

The German exchange group plans to offer Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) custody to its more than 2,500 institutional clients, with services expected to begin in April, according to a Bloomberg report on March 11.

Clearstream will provide these digital asset services through Crypto Finance AG, a Switzerland-based subsidiary in which Deutsche Boerse acquired a majority stake in 2021.

Deutsche Boerse's trading unit also aims to launch support for other cryptocurrencies and diversified services such as staking, lending and brokerage capabilities.

“With this offering, we are creating a one-stop shop around custody, brokerage and settlement,” Jens Hachmeister, head of issuer services and new digital markets at Clearstream, told Bloomberg.

The move aligns with a growing institutional push toward regulated crypto services in Europe following the implementation of Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which went into full effect for crypto asset service providers on Dec. 30, 2024.

The institutional offering came nearly two months after Boerse Stuttgart Digital Custody became Germany's first crypto asset service provider to receive a full license under MiCA, Cointelegraph reported on Jan. 17.

Boerse Stuttgart's license was part of the firm's efforts to become a regulated infrastructure provider for banks, brokers and asset managers.

While the regulation is a significant step toward a more mature industry, it also seeks to identify the “weak points of control” in the crypto space, which could mean more scrutiny for retail investors and the end-users of crypto platforms, according to Dmitrij Radin, the founder of Zekret and chief technology officer of Fideum, a regulatory and blockchain infrastructure firm focused on institutions.

“Retail users will be way more obligated to provide information, data which will be screened. They will be accounted for. Most Europeans will see taxation,” Radin told Cointelegraph.

The regulation also raises the possibility of enforcement actions against blockchain protocols that fail to comply with MiCA standards. European governments may pursue legal cases against noncompliant platforms during the early implementation phase.

Other blockchain regulatory experts fear that MiCA will introduce consolidation among crypto firms with limited capital, leading to a potential crypto firm exodus to the Middle East due to more lenient regulations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22crypto%20news%22%20site%3Acointelegraph.com","SEC looking to abandon effort requiring crypto firms to register as exchanges","https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-looking-abandon-requiring-crypto-firms-register-exchanges","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 03:23:18 GMT","

 Acting SEC chairman Mark Uyeda has asked SEC staff for ways to abandon a rule change that would expand the definition of alternative trading systems to include crypto firms. 

A proposed rule change pushing for some crypto firms to register as exchanges could be abandoned under a new directive from the acting chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. 

During a March 10 speech at the Washington Conference of the Institute of International Bankers, acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda said he had “asked SEC staff for options on abandoning” part of the proposed changes that would expand regulation of alternative trading systems (ATSs) to include crypto firms.

“In light of the significant negative public comment received on the definition of exchange with respect to crypto, I have asked SEC staff for options on abandoning that part of the proposal,” he said.

Uyeda says the rule was initially crafted in 2020 under former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton to establish more straightforward rules for alternative trading systems; the guidance was intended to mainly impact US Treasury market participants.

However, when it fell to former SEC Chair Gary Gensler to implement the rule, he took a “very different direction” by expanding the list beyond just ATSs.

“Rather than focusing on the narrow issues relating to Government Securities ATSs, a new iteration of the rule was proposed in 2022 that would redefine the regulatory definition of an exchange,” Uyeda said.

“The new definition of the term exchange included communications protocols without clearly defining what that term meant. Effectively, the vastly expanded definition of an exchange would have picked up various protocols used with respect to crypto assets,” he added.

Gensler's time at the SEC came with an aggressive regulatory stance toward crypto. 

He brought upward of 100 regulatory actions against firms from 2021 until his resignation on Jan. 20, the same day as Donald Trump started his second term as US president. Trump had promised to fire Gensler if elected. 

After Genlers' resignation, the SEC has since taken a new friendlier approach toward crypto. A growing number of firms facing legal action from the regulator have had their cases dismissed, including crypto exchange Gemini on Feb. 26, Kraken on March 3 and crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW on March 4.

Meanwhile, the agency has also launched a crypto task force dedicated to developing a framework for digital assets led by crypto-friendly Commissioner Hester Peirce.

 The investment firm is finally rolling out its Bitcoin financing business, which allows institutional investors to leverage their crypto holdings. 

Investment banking firm Cantor Fitzgerald has selected Anchorage Digital and Copper as its Bitcoin custodians and collateral managers as it launches its new digital asset financing business targeting institutional investors.

In a March 11 announcement, Cantor Fitzgerald said it is rolling out its Bitcoin (BTC) financing business with $2 billion in initial capital to help institutional investors borrow against their crypto holdings. 

Anchorage Digital and Copper will safeguard clients' digital assets by acting as custodians and collateral managers, the company said.

Anchorage Digital is an institutional cryptocurrency platform that operates the only federally chartered digital asset bank in the United States.

Copper is a crypto custodian backed by Barclays, the British multinational financial institution.

Copper CEO Amar Kuchinad said Cantor Fitzgerald's new offering will help institutional investors “diversify their portfolios” into digital assets. He cited the “growing demand for sophisticated financing solutions” in the Bitcoin space. 

Cantor Fitzgerald unveiled plans for its BTC financing business in July of last year “to provide leverage to investors who hold Bitcoin,” the company said at the time.

Since then, the company has broadened its exposure to the digital asset market, including acquiring a 5% stake in stablecoin issuer Tether.

Cantor Fitzgerald has more than $5 billion in assets under management, based on the latest regulatory filings.

The successful launch of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) more than one year ago revealed the huge pent-up demand for BTC among institutional investors. By February, Bitcoin exchange reserves had fallen to more than two-year lows thanks to institutional buying pressure.

Despite the recent market sell-off that was triggered by the US-led tariff war and recession fears, institutional Bitcoin investments continue to grow, with more Wall Street firms moving into the custody business. 

As Forbes reported, Citi and State Street are planning to offer crypto custody services by 2026. 

A separate Bloomberg report on March 11 revealed that German exchange group Deutsche Boerse is planning to launch Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) custody beginning next month.

 India's Web3 ecosystem, driven by Gen Z developers, saw rapid growth in 2024, with investments surging 224% despite stringent crypto tax policies. 

India's contribution to the global Web3 ecosystem — primarily in software development, gaming, investments and startup funding — increased year-on-year despite an absence of locally tailored crypto regulations.

India's share of global Web3 developers grew from 5% to 12% in the last 10 years, second only to the United States as of 2024, according to the India Web3 Landscape Report 2024 by Hashed Emergent, shared with Cointelegraph.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Tak Lee, CEO and Managing Partner at Hashed Emergent, pointed out four key factors driving India to the top of global crypto adoption: retail crypto transactions on centralized services, highest trading volumes, institutional adoption and retail DeFi transactions.

The growth is driven by the younger generation, as roughly 80% of all blockchain developers in India are between 18 and 27 years of age. The Indian developers in DeFi, Payments, AI and SocialFi prefer Solana as the go-to blockchain.

Ton, Aptos and Base are steadily gaining momentum across other key sectors, driven by the expanding presence of layer-1 and layer-2 ecosystems, the report noted.

While funding opportunities and builder initiatives like hackathons support initial growth, Indian developers have pointed out employers' lack of willingness to pay salaries that match global industry standards. 

The challenges faced by Web3 gaming projects are the extremely high cost of customer acquisition (CAC) to onboard Web3 users and the lack of quality gameplay beyond financial incentives to retain Web2 gamers. “Therefore, several of these games are now focusing on having great quality games before integrating blockchain mechanics or tapping into Indian gamers' craze for RMG,” Lee explained.

In contrast, investments into the Indian Web3 landscape saw a 224% increase in 2024 compared to the previous year — sourced from various avenues such as local funds, ecosystem funds and corporate venture arms of leading exchanges.

Lee told Cointelegraph that the lack of growth capital in the Web3 world, along with the absence of traditional venture/growth/private equity funds, makes it difficult for Indian firms to raise capital, adding:

Compared to the previous years, the substantial growth in Web3 investments in 2024 “signals a gradual recovery, with investors focusing on emerging areas of decentralized finance,” the report said.

India is a global hub for founders and developers, currently home to the second-largest developer market and third-largest founder base globally. 

Some of the main barriers preventing large-scale investments, according to Tak, have to do with the “slower than anticipated growth of some of these startups .“ Unclear regulations and compliances also hinder Web3 investments in India.  

Despite an active high-tax environment on cryptocurrency, small-scale crypto investments saw an uptick in India. Traders generally preferred small, frequent trades, with 96% maintaining positions less than $12 with an average of 11x-20x leverage. Females represented 1 in 10 futures traders in India, highlighting the scope for greater participation. 

The report called for reforms in crypto tax deductions and reporting in addition to the need for federal guidance and tax implications:

The policy wish list for the Indian Web3 includes the regulatory framework for virtual asset service providers (VASP), tax rationalization, streamlined banking and payment access for Web3 companies, exemptions from VASP regulations and clarity on existing regulations.

Recent regulatory initiatives like URL blocking of locally unlicensed crypto exchanges have resulted in the influx of funds to self-custodial solutions (decentralized exchanges) or domestic exchanges, which are regulated under Indian law.

 The US cryptocurrency exchange appears poised to reenter the Indian market three years after its first attempt. 

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is one step closer to relaunching its services in India after securing a license with the country's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). 

On March 11, the crypto exchange revealed on social media that “we're approved to launch in India,” which prompted a follow-up from Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal.

“Coinbase is now FIU-registered,” said Grewal. “It's a major step towards empowering Indian entrepreneurs to build, innovate and scale global onchain businesses — all from home.”

A Coinbase blog post confirmed that the exchange plans to offer cryptocurrency trading services in the country but did not specify a timeline for service rollout. 

In addition to crypto traders, India's developer community could benefit from the availability of Coinbase and its related tools, including its Base network, according to the company's APAC regional managing director, John O'Loghlen.

Cointelegraph contacted Coinbase for more information about its India launch plans but did not receive an immediate response.

Coinbase's first foray into India in 2022 lasted mere days after it ran into issues with the country's central bank. Coinbase said at the time that it was “committed to working with [...] relevant authorities to ensure that we are aligned, with local expectations and industry norms.”

India has had a complicated history with cryptocurrency, with the FIU banning several crypto exchanges over the years. 

Legal expert Amit Kumar Gupta told Cointelegraph that many lawmakers view the industry negatively, associating it with gambling and illegal activities. This partly explains why some elements of the Indian government want to purge the sector by implementing harsh tax laws.

Nevertheless, the tides appear to be shifting as global crypto adoption heats up, which has prompted fears that India will be left behind. 

In February, Reuters cited India's economic affairs secretary Ajay Seth as saying that cryptocurrencies “don't believe in borders,” suggesting that the country needs to get ahead of the adoption curve.

Despite the controversy, India has emerged as the leading country in terms of crypto adoption within the Central, Southern Asia and Oceana (CSAO) region, according to a 2024 report by Chainalysis. India received especially high marks for retail and decentralized finance adoption, the report said.

 Scam reporting in the US is fragmented and needs to come under one system to give better insights into attacks, Coinbase security chief Philip Martin tells Cointelegraph. 

The reporting of crypto scams in the United States is currently handled by a patchwork of agencies that should be streamlined to better protect consumers, says Coinbase chief security officer Philip Martin.

“It's a very fragmented ecosystem. Where do you report these things? Well, you go here, you go there, you go somewhere else,” Martin told Cointelegraph at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas.

“That then helps drive resources from the whole federal government to do more to address some of the underlying causes, he added. 

The US has dozens of federal and state-level agencies that handle reports of financial and internet crimes, one of which is the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), which gives victims a way to report cybercrime.

Martin said that crypto scam victims are reporting to authorities, but it “feels like they're screaming into the void to like IC3 or some of the government reporting websites.”

He added the various reporting sites should be consolidated “into a single reporting system that not only has all the data in one place but that also, in a perfect world, gives victims some visibility.”

On an earlier panel regarding online fraud, in which Martin took part, retired FBI agent Roger Campbell said many victims of crypto romance scams search the internet for how to report the crime and “all kinds of information comes up.”

“It's kind of frustrating,” he said. Campbell gave the example of the UK as a country with an “awesome reporting system” where one portal is used to report all crimes, and victims can follow the status of their complaints.

“You report something to the IC3, you never hear anything back 99% of the time,” he added. “It gets frustrating again for the victim. They almost feel victimized again.”

Coinbase's Martin told Cointelegraph that scams have a “lag in reporting,” and the way that attackers carry out schemes today won't be known for months.

“A scam may have happened six months ago, and we might hear about it tomorrow,” he said.

Another difficulty in policing crypto scams, according to Martin, is that they're “by and large” conducted from outside the US in countries including Myanmar and Laos, where “it can be hard for law enforcement to reach into those areas and really sort of strangle the stuff at the root. “

He said combatting crypto scams should focus on international relations and the US, “making it a priority to work with governments around the world so that there's no safe haven for these scammers.”

Meanwhile, on March 10, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation said it received over 2,600 complaints last year and found seven types of scams it hadn't yet discovered, including crypto mining, gaming, jobs and giveaway scams.

US JOLTS job openings data delivered a slight overshoot versus expectations, but it was confirmation of further trade tariffs on Canada by US President Donald Trump that spoiled risk-asset relief.

 Anthony Pompliano speculates US President Donald Trump may be taking matters into his own hands in an attempt to lower interest rates. 

The Trump administration may be intentionally creating uncertainty in the stock markets to corner Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell into lowering interest rates, according to a market commentator. 

Doing so increases the likelihood that the US won't need to refinance around $7 trillion in debt it owes over the next few months, Bitcoin commentator Anthony Pompliano said in a March 10 X post.

US President Donald Trump and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent are “taking matters into their own hands; they're crashing asset prices in an attempt to force Jerome Powell to cut interest rates,” said Pompliano, who serves as the founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management and host of The Pomp Podcast. 

The President and his team are intentionally crashing the market.Is this a master plan or are we watching uncontrolled destruction?! pic.twitter.com/Tbc0M9Rjxu

In late January, Powell announced the Fed was not lowering interest rates from the current target range of 4.25% to 4.5% despite calls from Trump to do so.

Pompliano said the recent market panic has been driven in part by Trump's tariffs — and has been used to create a more favorable bond market while lowering the 10-year Treasury yield.

He noted that the 10-year Treasury yield is already down from nearly 4.8% in January to 4.21% now — a sign that Trump's purported strategy is “heading in the right direction.”

Whether Pompliano's theory is correct or not, the stock market has been tanking of late, and crypto has been hit even harder.

Broad market index funds such as State Street's Standard & Poor's 500 index fund (SPY) fell 2.66% on March 10 alone, while the Nasdaq-100% fell 3.8%, Google Finance data shows.

Both indexes are down 7.32% and 10.7% over the last month, while Bitcoin (BTC) is down 27.4% from its $108,786 all-time high, and over $1.2 trillion has been wiped from the cryptocurrency market cap since Dec. 17. 

If the stock market continues to tank, it will come down to a “who blinks first” contest between Trump and Powell, Pompliano said.

While Trump hasn't confirmed such a strategy, Pompliano pointed to a Fox News interview on March 9 where Trump said: “Nobody ever gets rich when the interest rates are high because people can't borrow money.”

Pompliano added that lowering interest rates would also benefit American consumers:

CME FedWatch, a tool used to measure expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate change, has tipped a 96% probability that the target rate will remain between 4.25% and 4.50% following the Federal Reserve's next meeting on March 19. 

However, it's near 50-50 odds for the target rate to be lowered in the Federal Reserve's following meeting on May 7.

The Federal Reserve typically avoids lowering interest rates when inflation is high, as one of its primary objectives is to maintain price stability.

However, a Trump-inflicted recession, or “Trumpcession,” as some call it, could force America's top bank to start cutting again.

 Ethereum community members dismissed rumors of a $56 million transfer into lending protocol Sky from the Ethereum Foundation. 

An Ethereum developer rejected speculation that the Ethereum Foundation (EF) was behind a recent deposit of more than 30,000 Ether into the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Sky, formerly known as MakerDAO.

On March 10, a wallet address deposited 30,098 Ether (ETH), worth about $56 million, into Sky. Crypto intelligence platform Arkham labeled the address “Ethereum Foundation?,” raising speculation that the EF may have moved funds into the lending protocol — a strategy recommended by the community — instead of directly selling ETH to fund its operations. 

However, community members quickly dismissed the claims, clarifying that the wallet in question does not belong to the Ethereum Foundation. Eric Conner, the co-author of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-1559), called a Wu Blockchain report “completely fake,” implying that the address doesn't belong to the EF. 

Anthony Sassano, host of The Daily Gwei, also cited the report, saying that the wallet does not belong to the EF. 

Source: Anthony Sassano 

Wu Blockchain later clarified that while the account was suspected of belonging to the Ethereum Foundation, transaction history suggested it was more likely associated with an early Ethereum investor.

The address received a 4 million Dai (DAI) transfer from the EF ETH Sale in May 2022, and initial ETH funding was traced back to a wallet called jonny.eth. 

The address deposited the $56 million into the Sky vault to avoid liquidation as ETH prices tumbled. On March 10, ETH dropped from a high of $2,138 to $1,813, a 15% decline. 

The move allowed the wallet to avoid liquidation, lowering its liquidation price to $1,127.14, 40.19% below ETH's price of $1,896 at the time of writing.

While the recent deposit into Sky was not linked to the Ethereum Foundation, the EF has faced criticism in the past for selling ETH for stablecoins to fund team salaries and operations. In January, community members suggested that the foundation could instead borrow stablecoins against its ETH holdings rather than sell the assets.

At the time, Sassano said that instead of swapping ETH for stablecoins, the foundation should consider using Aave to borrow stablecoins against ETH. Sky allows users to do something similar. By depositing ETH, users can borrow DAI. 

On Feb. 13, the EF listened to the community and deployed 45,000 ETH, about $120 million at the time, to DeFi protocols Aave, Spark and Compound. 

Community members celebrated the move, with Aave founder and CEO Stani Kulechov saying, “DeFi will win.” The EF also said there's “more to come,” suggesting this is not their last foray into DeFi.

 The bearish sentiment emerged as Ether whales scrambled to avoid being liquidated amid a 22% price decline over the last seven days. 

Yuga Labs' vice president of blockchain warned that Ether could drop as low as $200 in a prolonged bear market, a 90% decline from its current price.

In a March 11 post on X, the executive, known as “Quit,” pushed back against analysts who suggested $1,500 as the possible bottom for Ether (ETH). Instead, Quit argued that a true bear market could see ETH fall significantly lower, similar to previous market cycles.

The executive said he's in a “comfortable” position if things go south. Quit told followers to consider selling their stash if they're uncomfortable with the asset going down. 

Source: Quit

Quit's post drew mixed reactions from the crypto community. Some investors agreed that ETH could drop further, while others said such a scenario would require a major systemic collapse.

One X user said they set $1,800 as the bottom. However, when the price reached $1,800, they contemplated whether it could go to $1,200. The ETH holder agreed with Quit's prediction and said, “It could very well go lower” if Bitcoin (BTC) goes to $66,000.

Meanwhile, another X user disagreed with the prediction, saying it would only be possible if there were a systemic collapse similar to 2018. The ETH investor said that, unlike previous cycles, Ether has been adopted by institutions and has a maturing ecosystem. 

“Positioning for both scenarios is what every smart investor should done, but being too bearish at the wrong time can cost just as much as being overly bullish,” they wrote.

Quit's sentiments came as ETH whales scrambled to avoid liquidation as Ether prices collapsed. On March 11, CoinGecko data showed that ETH prices went to a low of $1,791 on a 22% decline in the past seven days. 

Because of the sharp price changes, ETH whales moved millions of dollars in ETH to protect their positions against potential liquidation. 

Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain flagged an ETH whale dumping $47.8 million and losing $32 million to avoid being liquidated. The whale still has over $64 million at the lending protocol Aave with a liquidation price of $1,316. 

Another ETH investor who had already used over $5 million in assets to lower the liquidation price to $1,836 started to be liquidated. Lookonchain said the whale's $121 million balance was being liquidated as the price dropped below $1,800. 

A whale account suspected of being linked to the Ethereum Foundation also used $56 million in ETH to avoid liquidation amid the price drop. The address deposited over 30,000 ETH to the Sky vault, bringing its liquidation price to $1.127.14. The account was later determined to be unrelated to the foundation.

The latest crypto news is about mounting tariff tensions under the Trump administration, with Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) both facing renewed downward pressure. In this situation, the majority of investors are searching for new possibilities.

One project, in particular, that is worth mentioning is Remittix, a cross-border DeFi platform that is also gaining traction and has been referred to as the Best Crypto To Buy Now for those who are keen to witness a market bounce in 2025.

In this article, we examine ADA, SOL and why Remittix's real-world use case makes it an interesting choice.



Table of Contents

Cardano (ADA) is still struggling with resistance in the range of $0.7100 – $0.7500. The sellers have persistently pushed the price down, thwarting any effort towards a breakout that can be sustained.

Although there is aggressive buying pressure around $0.7100, this support has yet to trigger any strong upward movement.

Technical indicators are providing mixed signals. RSI has crossed above 61.58, reflecting increasing bullish pressure, but ADA is in a falling trend channel. The recent golden cross in the MACD is pointing towards positivity, but strong resistance close to $0.7500 limits upside movement.

If Cardano can break above $0.7500, a more robust recovery can be expected. Otherwise, further selling pressure can persist and ADA will be susceptible to further declines.

Solana (SOL) is recovering from a multi-wave downtrend that bottomed out in the area of $128 support, after previously hitting a high at $294. The failure of the $190 pivot accelerated the bearish momentum, analysts say and SOL's effort to bounce back hinges on its ability to stay above $118 – $128.

Technically, SOL has touched the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, a zone in line with historical support. Oversold RSI levels indicate a local bottom is being established. Near-term charts view $151 and $185 as important retracement levels.

Traders view Solana's next bull wave as viable if it can pierce $152, though failing to hold $118 would invalidate this setup. While SOL is still a favorite among many, others are looking to the Best Crypto To Buy Now on the chance that newer DeFi projects can outperform older altcoins in a volatile market.

While ADA and SOL grapple with technical challenges, Remittix emerges as a strong DeFi contender with its focus on cross-border remittances. It has already sold over 517 million tokens during presale worth $13.8 million. That is reflected in over 1000% returns for early investors, even in the context of broader market sluggishness, a testament to the real-world use of Remittix.

Built to cut out hidden charges and multi-day waiting periods, the Remittix platform facilitates conversions from more than 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat, transferring money to bank accounts worldwide. Consider a freelance web designer in Nairobi, Kenya, who bills a client in Paris.

Using Remittix, the freelancer is able to receive any of the major cryptos as payment and convert immediately to local currency bypassing traditional wire delay and outrageous transaction fees.

This ease of use, combined with the Remittix business pay API, highlights the reasons why analysts call RTX the Best Crypto To Buy Now for those investors who seek coins that solve persistent problems.

Security is also a selling point. Remittix records all transactions on an open ledger, so fraud and manipulation are less possible. Locked liquidity and ultimate relinquishment of contract ownership are designed to assure investors that Remittix is committed to long-term stability.

Remittix is likened by some to previous cross-border tokens such as XRP, but with the argument that Remittix's retail-friendly focus would hasten adoption, making it a frontrunner in the DeFi space.

Cardano and Solana have potential if they break through major resistance levels, but recent tariff news and volatile trading conditions continue to push these altcoins back.

People watch as both ADA and SOL rallied in the past, only to flag against technical resistance. Remittix, meanwhile, is accessing a real use case of quick, inexpensive remittances that can resonate with ordinary users well outside the crypto community.

Should Remittix keep up its momentum and consolidate more extensive partnerships, it could well outstrip more established tokens which are fighting to escape bear channels.

	The Trump administration has said it will weigh in on the use of the drugs

Antidepressants called SSRIs can treat a variety of mental health conditions. The Trump administration, which has announced that the drugs will be newly scrutinized, is seeking to evaluate how these medications affect children in particular.

Millions of Americans take antidepressants to help manage everything from depression and anxiety to post-traumatic stress disorder. Now, the Trump administration has announced that these drugs, which have been in use for decades and gone through rigorous testing, will be subject to new scrutiny.

Invoking a burden of chronic disease, including in children, the administration has pledged to, in its words, “assess the prevalence of and threat posed by” certain commonly prescribed medications. In the coming months, its “Make America Healthy Again” commission plans to review a slew of existing medications, including SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

More than 10 percent of U.S. adults took antidepressants over the previous 30 days, data from 2015 to 2018 show. And SSRIs are among the most widely prescribed of those drugs. 

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long questioned the safety of antidepressants and other psychiatric medicines, making misleading and unsubstantiated claims about the drugs. For instance, as recently as his January confirmation hearings, he likened taking SSRIs to having a heroin addiction. He also has suggested — without evidence — that SSRIs play a role in school shootings. 

With the executive order and statements like these, “it's implied there is something nefarious or harmful” about antidepressants and related medications, says Lisa Fortuna, chair of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Children, Adolescents and Their Families. “People may think that they're dangerous drugs.”

Like any pharmacological treatment, SSRIs can come with side effects, which can range from mildly annoying but tolerable to rare and serious. And the drugs don't work for everyone. But there's strong scientific evidence that they can be very helpful for many people, including children and adolescents, says Fortuna, who's also a psychiatrist at the University of California, Riverside School of Medicine.

Science News spoke with Fortuna and two other psychiatrists about the science behind SSRIs, what's known and unknown about the drugs, and how the recent rhetoric — unsupported by mainstream scientific research — can stigmatize people with mental illness. 

Zoloft, Prozac, Celexa. These are brand names of some common SSRI antidepressants. These drugs are called antidepressants, but they are used for a wide range of conditions, including anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and eating disorders, says psychiatrist Awais Aftab of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.

Across all of these disorders, Aftab says, numerous clinical trials have generally shown that SSRIs, which have been around for decades, perform better than a placebo. But nothing in medicine is absolute. With depression, for instance, about half of people who try one or several antidepressants ultimately respond well, Aftab says. Other people see minor improvements and still others aren't helped. “It's a kind of mixed bag,” he says. 

While SSRIs are called antidepressants, they are used to treat a wide range of disorders. Here's a partial list:

Though the drugs often take weeks to work, they can improve people's mood, ability to sleep and decrease their anxiety, says Giuseppe Guaiana, a clinical psychiatrist at Western University in London, Canada, and the chief of psychiatry at the nearby St. Thomas Elgin General Hospital. His team recently reviewed 37 clinical trials that evaluated antidepressants in people with generalized anxiety disorder. Bottom line: The researchers are highly confident that antidepressants are more effective than placebo, Guaiana's team reported in January. 

But that doesn't mean SSRIs are a good choice for every patient. “It's a little bit more complicated than that,” he says. 

Before SSRIs, doctors often relied on a class of medications called tricyclic antidepressants. Those came with all sorts of unpleasant side effects, including cardiac issues like sudden drops in blood pressure. 

“Antidepressants are not addictive, because people don't get high.”

SSRIs are a step up from those older drugs, Guaiana says. Still, “no medication is perfect,” he says. SSRIs can cause upset stomachs, headaches and reduced sexual desire. And that's no small thing. Estimates vary quite a bit; the percent of people taking SSRIs who experience negative sexual side effects, such as a loss of libido, range from 25 to over 70 percent. For context, more than 8 million people in the United States were estimated to take one kind of SSRI, sertraline (sold as Zoloft), in 2022. 

With multiple SSRIs currently available in the United States, doctors can try different options and doses to find a regimen that works — and one that patients find tolerable. That's standard practice, Aftab says. Much of medicine requires assessing the risks and benefits of a particular treatment. Even something as commonplace as aspirin, for example, can be iffy for some patients and helpful for others. The same trade-offs exist for SSRIs. 

Addiction has a specific definition. With drugs like heroin or painkillers or cocaine, Aftab says, “there's a sense of euphoria, there's a kind of pleasant, psychoactive effect that the person is seeking and craving.” 

Once people stop using an addictive drug, he says, “they desire that drug, they think about it, they want to obtain it.” People struggling with substance use disorders will often go to great lengths to get their drug of choice, which leads to problematic behavior. That doesn't happen with SSRIs. 

“So in that classic sense, antidepressants are not addictive, because people don't get high,” Aftab says. “They don't get a euphoric feeling. They don't crave them. They don't chase them or engage in theft or dishonesty.”

But like many medicines, SSRIs can cause dependency. Think of a heavy coffee drinker going cold turkey, and suffering through splitting headaches. Their body has gotten used to the caffeine; quitting it requires a period of adaptation. 

A similar sort of physical adjustment can happen when some people stop taking SSRIs, Aftab says. Symptoms include depression, anxiety and irritability. That overlap in psychological symptoms can make it hard to distinguish the original illness from signs of withdrawal. There can be physical symptoms too, like nausea, dizziness, restlessness and palpitations. Some people's symptoms are a bit unusual, Aftab says. “They might experience brain zaps,” unpleasant jolts that feel like electricity. 

Still, these physical symptoms seem to be relatively rare, occurring in only about 15 percent of people who discontinue SSRIs, researchers reported in 2024 in the Lancet Psychiatry. And they are not the same as an addiction. 

What's more, SSRIs might actually help people avoid addiction to heroin or other drugs, Fortuna says. That's because mental illnesses like depression and anxiety are risk factors for addiction. If we treat those underlying conditions, she says, that could prevent substance use disorder. 

Mental illness among young people is a major problem in the United States. In 2023, more than half of girls in high school reported feelings of hopelessness and persistent sadness; the same was true for over a quarter of boys.

Psychiatrists have many ways to help kids cope. That includes evidence-based options such as individual therapy, family therapy and educational support, as well as medication. And the number of adolescents and young adults on antidepressants has been on the rise. In 2022, pharmacies in the United States dispensed one or more antidepressant prescriptions to nearly 6.8 million people ages 12 to 25. That's compared with about 4.6 million people in 2016, researchers reported in Pediatrics in 2024. But, Fortuna says, “there's this misconception that if you come to us, all we're going to do is push medication.” 

In 2023, some 40 percent of U.S. teens reported stretches of more than two weeks of feeling so sad or hopeless that they stopped doing their regular activities. The feeling was more prevalent for girls than boys, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2023 Youth Risk Behavior Survey. 

In reality, she takes a comprehensive approach, walking patients and their parents through different treatment options and discussing the risks and benefits of each. Antidepressants, for example, carry what's known as a black box warning about suicide. According to U.S. Food and Drug Administration analyses, antidepressants were linked to an increase in suicidal thoughts and behavior in people under 25. That sounds scary, but the science isn't so clear-cut, Fortuna says. The warning has been controversial. What scientists do know is that “untreated depression is definitely related to suicidality,” she says. 

Still, doctors make sure to monitor young patients closely. And overall, she says, “the field is not fast or hasty to provide SSRIs to children and adolescents.”

In many ways, society still struggles to accept depression as a serious medical condition. Naysayers sometimes think that people suffering from depression “just need to suck it up,”Aftab says. 

Treatments often bring judgment too. SSRIs in particular have been questioned since they gained popularity in the 1990s. Perspectives that these drugs create artificial happiness or change a person into someone else still exist. “Stigmatizing attitudes about psychiatric medications are still fairly common,” Aftab says. “We're in this weird kind of phase where large chunks of the population are pretty comfortable with taking these medications, but we also have large chunks of people that have really negative and stigmatizing views of them.”

SSRIs are medications for mental illness, just like insulin is medication for diabetes, Fortuna says. She's concerned that the current round of antidepressant negativity could make parents of children on the medications feel like they're doing something wrong by treating their kids. Mental illness is a medical condition, she says, “and it's something that our medical profession can treat.”

Guaiana worries that some mentally ill people might avoid treatment and go on to harm themselves. Undertreatment of depression has been linked to suicide, he says. Results from a 2024 study, for example, suggest that SSRIs offer short-term protection against suicidal thoughts. 

The first SSRI — fluoxetine, or Prozac — was launched in the late 1980s. But scientists still have questions about how this family of drugs works. “We're not completely in the dark,” Guaiana says, “but there is definitely much more we need to know.” For instance, it's not clear why these drugs take weeks, or even months, to start helping with symptoms. It's also unclear how they perform over years of use, or whether long-term use brings its own side effects. And aspects of withdrawal, including how common it is and what the main symptoms are, remain relatively understudied. 

That's also true for how SSRIs work for people with multiple mental health issues, like severe anxiety combined with a trauma-related disorder. It's not just an academic question; Guaiana sees and treats patients like that in the clinic. “This is something we need to have more data on,” he says. 

Still, it's clear that these drugs are essential medicines for many people. What's not helpful is blanket statements about these drugs' value, Guaiana says. We shouldn't say, “antidepressants are wonderful and work for everybody,” or that “antidepressants are horrible and don't work.” Instead, he says, “we need to be nuanced.”

	All four of the sun's giant planets emit more energy than they receive from the sun

Like the sun's other giant worlds, Uranus (seen in this 1986 photo from the Voyager 2 spacecraft) radiates more energy than the sun gives it, though not nearly as strongly as its massive peers do.

Uranus emits more energy than it gets from the sun, two new studies report — a discovery that contradicts findings from the venerable Voyager spacecraft.

When Voyager 2 sped past Uranus on January 24, 1986, the spacecraft detected no significant excess heat from the planet, making it seemingly unique among the sun's giant worlds. However, new observations from space- and ground-based telescopes reveal that Uranus does in fact radiate more energy than sunlight provides, two research teams report in work submitted to arXiv.org in late February.

“Uranus is not as odd as we thought it was,” says planetary scientist Patrick Irwin of the University of Oxford, a coauthor on one of the studies.

Both teams say that Uranus, which takes 84 years to orbit the sun, reflects a bit more sunlight into space than Voyager had found. This means that the sun heats the planet less than previously thought, suggesting that Uranus must generate some heat to explain its temperature.

The upshot: “Uranus does indeed have internal heat,” says Liming Li, a planetary scientist at the University of Houston and coauthor on the other study. This heat is presumably left over from the planet's birth.

Li's team estimates that Uranus emits 12.5 percent more energy than it receives from the sun. Irwin's team pegs the excess at 15 percent, consistent with the other team's result.

“Uranus is still an outlier,” Irwin says, because the other giant planets — Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune — radiate more than twice as much energy as they get from the sun.

No one knows why Uranus is so subdued. But the planet has another oddity: It rotates on its side, with an axial tilt of 98 degrees — compared with 3 degrees for Jupiter, 27 degrees for Saturn and 28 degrees for Neptune.

Planetary scientists have long suspected that a giant object knocked Uranus over. If so, the impact may have dredged up hot material from the interior, Irwin says, causing Uranus to lose much of its heat during its youth.

	Testing for AGI may not be the best measure of AI's abilities and impacts

A display at the March 2025 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona touts advances in artificial intelligence. The goal of artificial general intelligence, however, remains ill-defined and controversial.

14 hours ago

When Chinese AI startup DeepSeek burst onto the scene in January, it sparked intense chatter about its efficient and cost-effective approach to generative AI. But like its U.S. competitors, DeepSeek's main goal is murkier than just efficiency: The company aims to create the first true artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

For years, AI developers — from small startups to big tech companies — have been racing toward this elusive endpoint. AGI, they say, would mark a critical turning point, enabling computer systems to replace human workers, making AI more trustworthy than human expertise and positioning artificial intelligence as the ultimate tool for societal advancement.

Yet, years into the AI race, AGI remains a poorly defined and contentious concept. Some computer scientists and companies frame it as a threshold for AI's potential to transform society. Tech advocates suggest that once we have superintelligent computers, day-to-day life could fundamentally change, affecting work, governance and the pace of scientific discovery.

But many experts are skeptical about how close we are to an AI-powered utopia and the practical utility of AGI. There's limited agreement about what AGI means, and no clear way to measure it. Some argue that AGI functions as little more than a marketing term, offering no concrete guidance on how to best use AI models or their societal impact.

In tech companies' quest for AGI, the public is tasked with navigating a landscape filled with marketing hype, science fiction and actual science, says Ben Recht, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley. “It becomes very tricky. That's where we get stuck.” Continuing to focus on claims of imminent AGI, he says, could muddle our understanding of the technology at hand and obscure AI's current societal effects.

The term “artificial general intelligence” was coined in the mid-20th century. Initially, it denoted an autonomous computer capable of performing any task a human could, including physical activities like making a cup of coffee or fixing a car.

But as advancements in robotics lagged behind the rapid progress of computing, most in the AI field shifted to narrower definitions of AGI: Initially, this included AI systems that could autonomously perform tasks a human could at a computer, and more recently, machines capable of executing most of only the “economically valuable” tasks a human could handle at a computer, such as coding and writing accurate prose. Others think AGI should encompass flexible reasoning ability and autonomy when tackling a number of unspecified tasks.

“The problem is that we don't know what we want,” says Arseny Moskvichev, a machine learning engineer at Advanced Micro Devices and computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute. “Because the goal is so poorly defined, there's also no roadmap for reaching it, nor reliable way to identify it.”

To address this uncertainty, researchers have been developing benchmark tests, similar to student exams, to evaluate how close systems are to achieving AGI. 

For example, in 2019, French computer scientist and former Google engineer Francois Chollet released the Abstract Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence, or ARC-AGI. In this test, an AI model is repeatedly given some examples of colored squares arranged in different patterns on a grid. For each example set, the model is then asked to generate a new grid to complete the visual pattern, a task intended to assess flexible reasoning and the model's ability to acquire new skills outside of its training. This setup is similar to Raven's Progressive Matrices, a test of human reasoning.

The test results are part of what OpenAI and other tech companies use to guide model development and assessment. Recently, OpenAI's soon-to-be released o3 model achieved vast improvement on ARC-AGI compared to previous AI models, leading some researchers to view it as a breakthrough in AGI. Others disagree.

“There's nothing about ARC that's general. It's so specific and weird,” Recht says.

Computer scientist José Hernández-Orallo of the Universitat Politécnica de València in Spain says that it's possible ARC-AGI just assesses a model's ability to recognize images. Previous generations of language models could solve similar problems with high accuracy if the visual grids were described using text, he says. That context makes o3's results seem less novel. 

Plus, there's a limited number of grid configurations, and some AI models with tons of computing power at their disposal can “brute force” their way to correct responses simply by generating all possible answers and selecting the one that fits best — effectively reducing the task to a multiple-choice problem rather than one of novel reasoning.

To tackle each ARC-AGI task, o3 uses an enormous amount of computing power (and money) at test time. Operating in an efficient mode, it costs about $30 per task, Chollet says. In a less-efficient setting, one task can cost about $3,000. Just because the model can solve the problem doesn't mean it's practical or feasible to routinely use it on similarly challenging tasks.

It's not just ARC-AGI that's contentious. Determining whether an AI model counts as AGI is complicated by the fact that every available test of AI ability is flawed. Just as Raven's Progressive Matrices and other IQ tests are imperfect measures of human intelligence and face constant criticism for their biases, so too do AGI evaluations, says Amelia Hardy, a computer scientist at Stanford University. “It's really hard to know that we're measuring [what] we care about.”

Open AI's o3, for example, correctly responded to more than a quarter of the questions in a collection of exceptionally difficult problems called the Frontier Math benchmark, says company spokesperson Lindsay McCallum. These problems take professional mathematicians hours to solve, according to the benchmark's creators. On its face, o3 seems successful. But this success may be partly due to OpenAI funding the benchmark's development and having access to the testing dataset while developing o3. Such data contamination is a continual difficulty in assessing AI models, especially for AGI, where the ability to generalize and abstract beyond training data is considered crucial.

AI models can also seem to perform very well on complex tasks, like accurately responding to Ph.D.-level science questions, while failing on more basic ones, like counting the number of r's in “strawberry.” This discrepancy indicates a fundamental misalignment in how these computer systems process queries and understand problems.

Yet, AI developers aren't collecting and sharing the sort of information that might help researchers better gauge why, Hernández-Orallo says. Many developers provide only a single accuracy value for each benchmark, as opposed to a detailed breakdown of which types of questions a model answered correctly and incorrectly. Without additional detail, it's impossible to determine where a model is struggling, why it's succeeding, or if any single test result demonstrates a breakthrough in machine intelligence, experts say.Even if a model passes a specific, quantifiable test with flying colors, such as the bar exam or medical boards, there are few guarantees that those results will translate to expert-level human performance in messy, real-world conditions, says David Rein, a computer scientist at the nonprofit Model Evaluation and Threat Research based in Berkeley, Calif.

For instance, when asked to write legal briefs, generative AI models still routinely fabricate information. Although one study of GPT-4 suggested that the chatbot could outperform human physicians in diagnosing patients, more detailed research has found that comparable AI models perform far worse than actual doctors when faced with tests that mimic real-world conditions. And no study or benchmark result indicates that current AI models should be making major governance decisions over expert humans.

The benchmarks that OpenAI, DeepSeek and other companies report results from “do not tell us much about capabilities in the real world,” Rein says, although they can provide reasonable information for comparing models to one another.

So far, researchers have tested AI models largely by providing them with discrete problems that have known answers. However, humans don't always have the luxury of knowing what the problem before them is, whether it's solvable or in what time frame. People can identify key problems, prioritize tasks and, crucially, know when to give up. It's not yet clear that machines can or do. The most advanced “autonomous” agents struggle to navigate ordering pizza or groceries online.

Large language models and neural networks have improved dramatically in recent months and years. “They're definitely useful in a lot of different ways,” Recht says, pointing to the ability of newer models to summarize and digest data or produce serviceable computer code with few mistakes. But attempts like ARC-AGI to measure general ability don't necessarily clarify what AI models can and can't be used for. “I don't think it matters whether or not they're artificially generally intelligent,” he says.What might matter far more, based on the recent DeepSeek news, is traditional metrics of cost per task. Utility is determined by both the quality of a tool and whether that tool is affordable enough to scale. Intelligence is only part of the equation.

AGI is supposed to serve as a guiding light for AI developers. If achieved, it's meant to herald a major turning point for society, beyond which machines will function independently on equal or higher footing than humans. But so far, AI has had major societal impacts, both good and bad, without any consensus on whether we're nearing (or have already surpassed) this turning point, Recht, Hernández-Orallo and Hardy say.

For example, scientists are using AI tools to create new, potentially lifesaving molecules. Yet in classrooms worldwide, generative chatbots have disrupted assessments. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that more and more U.S. teens are outsourcing assignments to ChatGPT. And a 2023 study in Nature reported that growing AI assistance in university courses has made cheating harder to detect.

To say that AI will become transformative once we reach AGI ignores all the trees for the forest.

The recent discovery of a stupendously powerful neutrino has left scientists scratching their heads. New research suggests it could be evidence that Stephen Hawking was right about the nature of black holes and the early universe.

Five decades ago, famed astrophysicist Stephen Hawking theorized that the Big Bang may have flooded the universe with tiny black holes. Now, researchers believe they may have seen one explode.

In Feb. 2025, the European collaboration KM3NeT — which consists of underwater detectors off the coasts of France, Italy and Greece — announced the discovery of a stupendously powerful neutrino. This ghostly particle had an energy of around 100 PeV — over 25 times more energetic than the particles accelerated in the Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful atom smasher.

Physicists have struggled to come up with an explanation for such an energetic neutrino. But now, a team of researchers who were not involved in the original detection have proposed a surprising hypothesis: The neutrino is the signature of an evaporating black hole. The team described their proposal in a paper that was uploaded to the arXiv database and has not been peer-reviewed yet.

In the 1970s, Hawking realized that black holes aren't entirely black. Instead, through complex interactions between the black hole event horizon and the quantum fields of space-time, they can emit a slow-but-steady stream of radiation, now known as Hawking radiation. This means black holes evaporate and eventually disappear. In fact, as the black hole gets smaller, it emits even more radiation, until it essentially explodes in a firestorm of high-energy particles and radiation — like the neutrino spotted by the KM3Net collaboration.

Related: Stephen Hawking's black hole radiation paradox could finally be solved — if black holes aren't what they seem

But all known black holes are very large — at least a few times the mass of the sun, and often significantly larger. It will take well over 10^100 years for even the smallest known black holes to die. If the KM3NeT neutrino is due to an exploding black hole, it has to be much smaller — somewhere around 22,000 pounds (10,000 kilograms). That's about as heavy as two fully grown African elephants, compressed into a black hole smaller than an atom.

The only known potential way to produce such tiny black holes is in the chaotic events of the early Big Bang, which may have flooded the cosmos with ""primordial"" black holes. The smallest primordial black holes produced in the Big Bang would have exploded long ago, while larger ones might persist to the present day.

Unfortunately, a 22,000-pound black hole should not survive all the way from the Big Bang to the present day. But the authors pointed out that there might be an additional quantum mechanism — known as ""memory burden"" — that allows black holes to resist decay. This would allow a 22,000-pound black hole to survive for billions of years before it finally exploded, sending a high-energy neutrino toward Earth in the process.

—'Cosmic Horseshoe' may contain black hole the size of 36 billion suns — one of the largest ever detected

—Scientists may have just discovered 300 of the rarest black holes in the universe

Primordial black holes might be an explanation for dark matter — the invisible substance that accounts for most of the matter in the universe — but so far, searches for them have turned up empty. This new insight may provide an intriguing clue. The researchers found that if primordial black holes of this mass range are abundant enough to account for all the dark matter, they should be exploding somewhat regularly. They estimated that if this hypothesis is correct, the KM3NeT collaboration should see another showstopping neutrino in the next few years.

If that detection happens, then we may just have to radically rethink the way we approach dark matter, high-energy neutrinos and even the physics of the early universe.

Scientists in China have created a satellite with laser-imaging technology powerful enough to capture human facial details from more than 60 miles (100 kilometers) away.

This breakthrough represents a performance increase of 100 times or more compared to leading spy cameras and traditional telescopes, according to a report on the new technology in the South China Morning Post.

Amongst a broad gamut of potential applications, the technology could allow operators to surveil foreign satellites to a previously impossible level of detail. The researchers at China's Academy of Sciences' Aerospace Information Research Institute outlined their findings in a new study published in the Chinese Journal of Lasers (Issue 52, Volume 3).

According to the South China Morning Post, the scientists conducted a test across Qinghai Lake in the northwest of the country with a new system based on synthetic aperture lidar (SAL), a type of laser radar capable of constructing two-dimensional or three-dimensional images.

SAL relies on the motion of an object (like a satellite) to provide finer resolution images than other, beam-scanning radar imagery systems. Previous SAR systems have relied on microwave radiation, which has longer wavelengths, which results in lower resolution images.

However, this new system operates at optical wavelengths, which have much shorter wavelengths than microwaves and produce clearer images (though microwaves are better for penetrating into materials, because their longer wavelengths aren't scattered or absorbed as easily).

During the test, which targeted arrays of reflective prisms placed 63.3 miles (101.8 km) away from the lidar system, the device detected details as small as 0.07 inches (1.7 millimeters) and measured distances to within 0.61 inches (15.6 mm).

This is a huge leap forward from previous milestones, like a 2011 test conducted by defense firm Lockheed Martin that was able to achieve an azimuth resolution of 0.79 inches (2 centimeters) from only 1 mile (1.6 km) away, or a Chinese test where scientists achieved a then-best 1.97 inch (5 cm) resolution at a distance of 4.3 miles (6.9 km).

To achieve this latest breakthrough, the Chinese team split the laser-beam driving the lidar system across a 4x4 micro-lens array, which in turn expanded the system's optical aperture — the opening that controls the amount of light entering a camera system — from 0.68 to 2.71 inches (17.2 mm to 68.8 mm). In this way, researchers could bypass the tradeoff of field of vision versus size of aperture, which has historically restricted such camera systems.

It's important to note that testing took place during near perfect weather and atmospheric conditions with steady wind and limited cloud cover. Inclement weather or other impairments to visibility could significantly impact the system's precision and reliability.

Perovskite cells are much cheaper and more flexible than their silicon alternatives, but they have major durability problems. A new breakthrough could be about to change that.

Scientists have made a cheap and flexible solar cell that lasts nearly 10 times longer than others of its type, an advance that could one day help to revolutionize solar energy production.

Often referred to as the ""holy grail"" of solar power, perovskite cells offer a lightweight alternative to traditional silicon-based solar technology. Their flexible structure enables them to be applied to cars and phones in the form of a printable layer so they can charge on the go.

Sounds too good to be true? So far, you're right. Perovskites come with some major flaws. Notably, they degrade quickly due to chemical reactions with moisture in the air that make them leak iodine.

But now, a team of researchers has found a solution to this problem. By embedding nanoparticles within the perovskites, they produced a new cell that lasts for 1,530 hours, a near-tenfold increase on previous perovskite solar cell designs. The researchers published their findings Feb. 20 in the journal EES Solar.

""By addressing these common challenges we see with perovskite solar technology, our research blows the doors wide open for cheaper, more efficient and more widely accessible solar power,"" study co-author Imalka Jayawardena, an engineering researcher at the University of Surrey's Advanced Technology Institute in the U.K., said in a statement. ""What we've achieved here is a critical step toward developing high-performance solar cells that can withstand real-world conditions — bringing us closer to their commercial use at a global scale.""

As the fastest-growing and cheapest form of renewable energy, solar power is key to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. But the technology's growth is hampered by its reliance on silicon, a finite and non-renewable resource that, in its purest form, is costly to produce.

To get around this bottleneck, scientists have looked to develop perovskite alternatives — synthetic versions of naturally occurring calcium titanium oxide crystals that can be made at a fraction of the cost. But unlike pure silicon cells, which can last for decades, solar cells made from perovskite only last for 100 or so hours, drastically limiting their utility.

In the new study, the scientists looked for a way to trap the iodine that leaks from perovskites. Their solution was to embed tiny nanoparticles of aluminum oxide within the cells as they were manufactured. This not only prevented the iodine from leaking but also created a more uniform and electrically conductive structure.

After testing these cells under extreme heat and humidity, the researchers found that the modified cells maintained a high performance for more than two months (1,530 hours), a significant improvement on the 160-hour lifespan of unenhanced perovskite cells.

The researchers plan to continue investigating their new technique to see if these gains can be built upon further.

""A decade ago, the idea of perovskite solar cells lasting this long under real-world conditions seemed out of reach,"" study lead author Hashini Perera, a researcher at the Advanced Technology Institute, said in the statement. ""With these improvements, we're breaking new ground in stability and performance, bringing perovskite technology closer to becoming a mainstream energy solution.""

Unique versions of the lactase gene found in the genomes of East Asian people may have increased in prevalence within the population over time because they bolstered immune responses against pathogens, new data reveal. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A large proportion of East Asian people carry unique versions of the lactase gene that enables humans to digest the sugars in milk, new research hints.

These genetic variants were likely inherited from humans' extinct cousins, the Neanderthals, tens of thousands of years ago, according to a study published Mar. 10 in the journal PNAS. And it may be that the variants offered an evolutionary advantage by helping early hunter-gatherers thwart infections, new data suggest.

In some people of European or African descent, the lactase gene helps carriers digest a sugar called lactose in milk after they're weaned off of breast milk; this phenomenon is known as ""lactase persistence."" Many people who carry alternative versions of the gene can't continue breaking down lactose after infancy, so they become lactose intolerant.

The versions of the lactase gene behind lactase persistence are believed to have emerged in populations in Europe and Africa between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago, around the same time humans on these continents began rearing animals and consuming their milk.

Related: Papua New Guineans, genetically isolated for 50,000 years, carry Denisovan genes that help their immune system, study suggests

This has led scientists to theorize that the lactose-tolerance variants were selected for within these populations, meaning they became more common over the course of evolution because they offered an advantage. In this case, they may have increased survival rates by allowing adults to absorb nutrients from milk.

However, until now, little was known about the genetic mechanisms behind lactase persistence and lactose intolerance in East Asians. About 65% of adults worldwide are thought to be lactose intolerant, but this figure rises to between 70% and 100% in East Asian populations.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

In the new study, scientists compared thousands of genomes sampled from modern humans, including those with East Asian, European or African ancestry. The data came from individuals in a range of countries, such as China, Japan, Spain, Italy and Nigeria.

The analysis revealed that around 25% of the people with East Asian ancestry carried versions of the lactase gene that are not found within the European or African populations. That's around the same proportion of people who have lactase persistence in East Asian populations. These genetic variants trigger an increase in the activity of the lactase gene in the body, the researchers found.

At first glance, this suggests that these genetic variants may have also been selected for during evolution for dietary reasons, the researchers said. However, further analyses in the same study revealed that this may not have been the case.



Indeed, the researchers went on to compare samples of East Asian genomes with the genome of a Neanderthal who lived in the Altai Mountains in Siberia around 120,000 years ago. This led them to discover that the East Asian variants of the lactase gene were likely inherited by hunter-gatherers from Neanderthals as a result of interbreeding events between the two groups.

Neanderthals and Homo sapiens are known to have interbred on multiple occasions over the millennia. This happened after both species came into contact with one another following the migration of the latter group out of Africa into Eurasia, possibly up to 250,000 years ago.

The new results suggest that the lactose-intolerance variants started being selected for between 25,000 and 28,000 years ago — more than 10,000 years before dairy culture emerged in the Altai Mountain region.

In other words, the variants emerged before people in the region started regularly consuming milk. This suggests that the selective pressure on these variants was not related to improving people's ability to digest lactose.

To figure out what other advantages these variants might offer, the team scoured a database chronicling gene activity in different cells. They discovered that the lactase gene variants seen in East Asian people altered the activity of three genes in immune cells, causing them to expand in number.

Based on this result, the study authors think it's possible that these variants were selected for because they somehow enhanced the ability of East Asian hunter-gatherers to combat infections.

""Neanderthals — having inhabited Eurasia for approximately 400,000 years — likely carried alleles [genetic variants] adapted to local pathogens and environmental challenges,"" study co-author Shuhua Xu, a professor of human population genetics at Fudan University in China, told Live Science in an email.

Taken together, the findings imply that variants of the lactase gene may have been selected for different reasons across the world, the researchers concluded. These findings may prompt scientists to question why selection of the lactase gene occurred in European and African populations, they added; perhaps the answer isn't solely about drinking milk.

Giant regions of the mantle where seismic waves slow down may have formed from subducted ocean crust, a new study finds. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


We finally know where two giant blobs in Earth's middle layer came from — and they're a mismatched pair.

These strange regions in Earth's mantle, known as ""large low velocity provinces"" (LLVPs), are actually chunks of Earth's crust that have sunk into the mantle over the past billion years, new research suggests.

Scientists have long known that there are LLVPs — one below the Pacific Ocean and the other below Africa. In these regions, seismic waves from earthquakes travel 1% to 3% more slowly than they do in the rest of the mantle. Scientists believe they may affect the planet's magnetic field because of the way they influence heat flow from Earth's core.

There's a lot of debate about what LLVPs are. Some studies have suggested that they're material from the ancient Earth — either a layer of primordial unmixed rock from the planet's formation or a leftover hunk of the giant space rock that hit Earth 4.5 billion years ago, forming the moon.

Related: Scientists discover Earth's inner core isn't just slowing down — it's also changing shape

Others have suggested that the blobs are huge chunks of oceanic crust that were pushed into the mantle when one tectonic plate slipped under another — a process known as subduction.

The crust hypothesis had not been subject to as many studies as the ancient-material idea, said James Panton, a geodynamicist at Cardiff University in the U.K. In a new study, published Feb. 6 in the journal Scientific Reports, he and his colleagues used computer modeling to determine where subducted crust entered the mantle over the past billion years and to find out whether that subducted crust could form features similar to the LLVPs.

""We found that the recycling of the oceanic crust can indeed generate these LLVP-like regions beneath the Pacific and Africa without the need for a primordial dense layer at the base of the mantle,"" Panton told Live Science. ""They are evolving by themselves, simply through the process of subduction of oceanic crust.""

That doesn't mean there isn't dense material from Earth's youth at the bottom of the mantle, Panton said; there may be a thin layer of ancient material that contributes to the LLVPs as well. But if subduction alone can explain the LLVPs, that could hint at their age.

""That potentially means that shortly after we started having subduction on Earth, then maybe that's when we started to have LLVPs,"" Panton said. (The advent of subduction is itself a complicated question. Some scientists think it began more than 4 billion years ago, while others think it started around a billion years ago.)

—Weird blobs lurking near Earth's core may have been dragged from the surface

—2 giant blobs in Earth's mantle may explain Africa's weird geology

—Continent-size blobs in Earth's mantle are a billion years old, ancient crystals reveal

The subduction process has resulted in two different types of blobs, the authors said in the study. The LLVP under Africa doesn't get as much crustal material currently as the LLVP under the Pacific, which is fed by the subduction zones of the Pacific Ring of Fire, which is a horseshoe-shaped line of subduction that circles the Pacific Ocean.

The African LLVP is thus older and better mixed with the rest of the crust, the team said. It also has less of a volcanic rock called basalt, which means it is less dense than the Pacific LLVP. This may explain why the African LLVP extends 342 miles (550 kilometers) higher in the mantle than the Pacific LLVP.

One question for the future, Panton said, is how hot regions of the mantle called mantle plumes may help drive the subduction process in the Pacific and influence the LLVPs. These plumes stretch from the very bottom of the mantle to volcanic hotspots at the surface, such as the Hawaiian islands.

What's in the photo? A plume of discolored water rising up from an undersea eruption

Which satellite took the photo? Landsat 9

When was it taken? May 14, 2022

This unusual image shows a large plume of discolored water rising toward the Pacific Ocean's surface from the Kavachi volcano, also known as ""sharkcano,"" during an undersea eruption.

Kavachi is a submarine volcano that is part of the Solomon Islands, around 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Vangunu Island. Its peak stands roughly 3,600 feet (1,100 meters) above the seafloor and lies just 65 feet (20 m) below the waves. The volcano is named after the sea god of the Vangunu people and is also referred to as ""Rejo te Kvachi,"" or ""Kavachi's Oven,"" according to NASA's Earth Observatory.

In 2015, a research expedition discovered multiple scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) and silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) living within the volcano's central crater. The surprising presence of the oceanic predators at the volcano raised ""new questions about the ecology of active submarine volcanoes and the extreme environments in which large marine animals exist,"" the researchers wrote.

It is unclear whether any of the sharks at Kavachi were hurt by the outburst that triggered the plume in the image or if they were able to sense the incoming eruption and evacuate the crater.

The image was first released in May 2022 by NASA Goddard on the social media platform X along with the caption: ""You've heard of sharknado, now get ready for sharkcano.""

The plume in the photo is part of an eruption that began in October 2021 and lasted for just a few weeks after the aerial image was taken. Similar plumes occurred during subsequent eruptions in August 2023 and April 2024, according to the Global Volcanism Program at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.

Before then, the volcano's most recent major eruptions were in 2016, 2014, 2007 and 2003. In the past, researchers also sighted ephemeral islands up to half a mile (1 km) wide being birthed by the eruptions and then sinking. A similar ghostly landmass recently emerged after an undersea volcano in Japan blew its top in 2023.

Kavachi experiences ""phreatomagmatic eruptions,"" which occur when magma meets water and ejects steam, ash, volcanic rock fragments and chunks of magma known as ""incandescent bombs,"" according to the Earth Observatory.

A study conducted in the wake of the 2007 eruption found that the volcanic plumes are made of warm, acidic water that also contains particulate matter and sulfur, which ""attracts microbial communities that thrive on [the chemicals],"" the researchers wrote.

The volcano can also launch jets of heated water without any visible plumes or other signs of erupting.

Residents of neighboring islands have frequently reported that they regularly see steam and ash on the water's surface between eruptions, further confirming that the so-called sharkcano is percolating beneath the surface.

A tornado has torn through central Florida, destroying homes and sending broadcasters ducking for cover live on air. And experts have warned more tornadoes may hit the southwest in the coming days, with severe storms forecast.

The twister hit Seminole County in the Orlando metropolitan region on Monday (March 10) with peak wind speeds of up to 115 mph (185 km/h), weather website AccuWeather reported.

The tornado raced over a distance of around 4 miles (6 kilometers) in 15 minutes, destroying two homes, uprooting trees and damaging vehicles. There weren't any serious injuries reported as a result of the tornado, according to FOX 35 Orlando.

FOX 35 Orlando staff confirmed the tornado's location live on air when it hit their studio. Brooks Garner, a meteorologist at the TV station, was tracking the storm when a camera showed a gray mass of wind and rain approaching the FOX building.

""Take shelter!"" Garner said as the tornado hit. ""Everybody in the FOX 35 building, get to your safe space, under your desk if you're not in a designated area. We're catching debris right now on the roof.""

FOX 35 Orlando staff said they felt the building shake and heard debris hit the roof as the tornado passed over them, FOX Weather reported. Nobody in the building was hurt, according to the report.

Tornadoes are narrow, rapidly rotating columns of air that stretch from clouds down to the ground during a thunderstorm. They are among the most violent storms on Earth, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Severe Storms Laboratory.

Scientists categorize a tornado's strength using the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale), which ranges from EF0 to EF5. The Florida tornado was EF2, meaning winds of 111 to 135 mph (179 to 217 km/h). For context, the most powerful EF5 tornadoes have winds of more than 200 mph (322 km/h). The last twister to reach EF5 was the 2013 Moore tornado, which killed 24 people and devastated the city of Moore in Oklahoma.

More tornadoes could hit the central and southeastern U.S. later this week. A powerful storm is expected to sweep across the country from west to east, with a risk of severe thunderstorms that could spawn tornadoes in 12 states, including Florida, on Friday and Saturday (March 14 to 15), according to a statement released by AccuWeather.

""All of the ingredients are coming together for a significant severe weather outbreak,"" Bernie Rayno, chief on-air meteorologist at AccuWeather, said in the statement. ""We could end up with two dozen tornadoes or more by the end of the weekend.""

A ton of dominos has fallen during the first two days of the NFL's legal tampering period, with several big-name free agents reportedly coming to terms on new deals. A lot of marquee players have found new homes, but there are still a lot of good players available as we gear up for the first official day of free agency. 

The tampering period kicked off on Monday with two quarterbacks finding new NFL homes. Justin Fields, after deciding to test free agency despite the Steelers' attempts to re-sign him, reportedly agreed to a two-year, $40 million deal with the New York Jets that includes $30 million guaranteed. Shortly after Fields landed with the Jets, the Seattle Seahawks reportedly signed Sam Darnold to a three-year, $100.5 million deal just days after trading former Pro Bowler Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders. 

More notable players found new NFL homes on Tuesday, including former Dolphins safety Jevon Holland, who reportedly came to terms on a three-year, $45.3 million deal with the New York Giants. Will Fries, the former Colt and the top-available offensive lineman going into Tuesday, reportedly agreed to a five-year, $88 million deal with the Vikings. Former Chiefs safety Justin Reid reportedly came to terms on a three-year, $31.5 million deal with the New Orleans Saints. 

Here's a look at the top-10 players who are still available. It should be noted that the following ranking is not solely about talent, it's also about market demand and the position they play. 

Rodgers is technically not a free agent until his official release from the Jets on Wednesday. He might not be the best player still available, but he is a future Hall of Famer who plays the most important position in all of sports, so him taking the top spot was kind of a no-brainer. 

It appears that the Steelers have the inside track at landing Rodgers after missing out on Fields. But the Giants (who re-signed receiver Darius Slayton on Monday) are also still in the mix. There are rumblings that Rodgers' third NFL team will be revealed at some point on Tuesday. 

Like Rodgers, Wilson is probably not the second-best player still available. But he is a possible future Hall of Fame quarterback who was named to his 10th Pro Bowl in 2024. 

At this point, it appears that Wilson will sign with whomever doesn't land Rodgers. That could mean a return to Pittsburgh for the 2025 season. A dark-horse candidate for both Rodgers and Wilson is the Vikings after Minnesota watched Darnold leave for Seattle. 

Oddly, one of the lone bright spots for the 2024 Dallas Cowboys hasn't been re-signed by the team. A former undrafted rookie, Dowdle won the starting job last year and literally ran with it. He racked up 1,079 yards on the ground while averaging a solid 4.6 yards per carry. 

Dowdle would be a good fit for several teams (including the Steelers, who reportedly lost Najee Harris to the Los Angeles Chargers), but his market is likely being hindered by the fact that this year's draft class is considered to be littered with talented players at his position. J.K. Dobbins is another notable running back who is also looking for a new NFL home. 

A former first-round pick who didn't pan out with the Jets, Becton enjoyed a career rebirth last year while helping the Eagles win the Super Bowl. A big reason for Becton's success last year was him moving from tackle to the interior of the offensive line. Becton is only 26 and has shown considerable growth at both run blocking and in pass protection. 

Like former teammate and 2021 draft classmate Fields, Jenkins is hoping to revive his career with a new team after things didn't necessarily pan out in Chicago. Like Becton, Jenkins' play has improved after transitioning from tackle to guard. He's also young (27) and already has 40 starts under his belt. 

As you can see, offensive line is probably the deepest position group in this year's free agency class. The top-rated center available, Myers started in each of his first 56 NFL games. A 2021 second-round pick, Myers also has four playoff starts under his belt while playing with Rodgers and current Packers starting quarterback Jordan Love. Myers could return to the Packers if he doesn't find a desirable deal in free agency. 

Several defensive backs reportedly found new teams on Monday, but Douglas is still available. Arguably the best cornerback still available, Douglas' career so far includes a Super Bowl win with the Eagles (in 2017, his rookie season) and a year that saw him record a league-best two interception returns for scores (in 2021 as a member of the Packers). Douglas is a good fit for teams that like to play zone. 

Age might be the main reason why the 35-year-old Zeitler hasn't been signed yet. Despite his age, Zeitler has continued to play well in recent seasons. He was named to his first career Pro Bowl with the Ravens in 2023 and made 16 starts for the Lions last season. 

Cooper is looking to rebound following a disappointing 2024 season that saw him produce the lowest stat lines of his career. Cooper, though, is just two years removed from his 2023 campaign that saw him record a career-best 1,250 yards receiving. A receiver-needy team should take a chance on him if the price is right. 

The 38-year-old Campbell hasn't officially confirmed whether or not he wants to play in 2025. But if he does decide to return for an 18th season, Campbell may get signed by a team that has a realistic shot at winning a Super Bowl, something that has alluded him to this point in his career. The Lions have recently been named by multiple outlets as a possible landing spot for Campbell, who had five sacks and a dozen tackles for loss last season as a member of the Dolphins.

The Toronto Blue Jays failed to reach an extension with star first baseman and impending free agent Vladimir Guerrero ahead of his self-imposed deadline earlier this spring. Now, details are starting to surface on what, exactly, the Blue Jays offered and how much far apart that was from Guerrero's demands.

Guerrero is seeking a contract that runs 14 years and fetches him $500 million in present day value, or about $35.7 million in average annual value, according to The Athletic, The Blue Jays, conversely, were willing to pay him $500 million with significant deferrals that would have reduced the present day value to somewhere between $400 and $450 million, according to the New York Post.

""They had their numbers, I had my numbers,"" Guerrero said in February after his self-imposed deadline. ""It's just business, like I always say. Things happen. We're all good.""

Last month, CBS Sports published an early preview of the upcoming free-agent class. We ranked Guerrero as the top available player, noting that his career numbers to date lined up shockingly well with Miguel Cabrera, the two-time Most Valuable Player Award recipient that he was often compared to during his prospect days. CBS Sports predicted that Guerrero would sign a 12-year contract worth $456 million, a pact that would give him an average annual value of $38 million. Here was our explanation:

Guerrero will be a fascinating case study: the public estimates about his next deal are at odds with the history of how front offices view his general profile (i.e. right-handed first basemen). To wit, Pete Alonso's $27 million is the richest ever for a free-agent first baseman; Guerrero will make more ($28.5 million) in his final arbitration-eligible season. On top of his skill set and age, his distinction as the closest thing to an elite hitter the market will feature for a few years ought to work in his favor. I assume he'll become the seventh free-agent hitter to clear a $35 million AAV, and he might soar even higher than that. For now, I'll err on the conservative side. Prediction: 12 years, $456 million ($38 million AAV)

The Blue Jays had previously submitted an offer to Guerrero worth around $340 million, suggesting they had significantly upped their offer ahead of the deadline in an effort to get a deal done. Alas, Guerrero will now enter his walk year with his eyes on securing some big numbers after the season.

Guerrero, 25, heads into the 2025 season a career .288/.363/.500 (137 OPS+) hitter with 160 home runs and 21.5 Wins Above Replacement.

The US men's national team roster is set for the Concacadf Nations Leauge finals. The USMNT will kick off on March 20 Panama at SoFi Stadium on Paramount+ with the first trophy of the Mauricio Pochettino era in their sites. Injuries to Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi along with Serginio Dest returning to health, but not deemed ready for this roster means the USMNT's depth has been tested, but Pochettino will still have a strong starting XI to choose from along with players who can step up in the right conditions.

Antonee Robinson, Christian Pulisic, and Josh Sargent could be among the first names on the team sheet with their strong form for their clubs in 2025, but the impact of January camp is also showing. Six players who were in that camp are now here for the Concacaf Nations League. Some like Diego Luna, Brian White and Patrick Agyemang could have chances to make an impact considering the lack of depth in their positions.

Gio Renya has also made the squad despite only starting three matches for Borussia Dortmund in 2025 in all competitions. He has scored a goal off the bench, but struggling for playing time at his club, Renya will have to show that he deserves to be in the starting XI under Pochettino despite his immense talent.

GOALKEEPERS (3): Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew; 3/0), Zack Steffen (Colorado Rapids; 30/0), Matt Turner (Crystal Palace/ENG; 49/0)

DEFENDERS (8): Cameron Carter-Vickers (Celtic/SCO; 18/0), Marlon Fossey (Standard Liege/BEL; 1/0), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse/FRA; 17/0), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC; 67/1), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace/ENG; 23/1), Antonee Robinson (Fulham/ENG; 50/4), Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach/GER; 19/0), Auston Trusty (Celtic/SCO; 4/0)

MIDFIELDERS (6): Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/ENG; 42/2), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis/ESP; 18/0), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake; 3/0), Weston McKennie (Juventus/ITA; 58/11), Gio Reyna (Borussia Dortmund/GER; 31/8), Tanner Tessmann (Olympique Lyon/FRA; 6/0)

FORWARDS (6): Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte FC; 2/2), Yunus Musah (AC Milan/ITA; 45/1), Christian Pulisic (AC Milan/ITA; 76/32), Josh Sargent (Norwich City/ENG; 27/5), Timothy Weah (Juventus/ITA; 42/7), Brian White (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; 3/1)

When looking through the roster, you may almost miss Musah's inclusion in the squad, but he's there, just listed as a forward. He has played some on the wing for Milan and the USMNT but this tips Pochettino's hand a little toward an attacking band of Musah, Pulisic and Weah all supporting Sargent as the lone forward. It's a setup that the USMNT can be dynamic in after Pochettino's eye tests determined that Weah was left eye dominant while using the forward there in the quarter finals against Jamaica. Weah responded with a goal in a resounding victory so there's no reason not to see if it can continue during this window.

Facing Jamaica, the trio were in support of Ricardo Pepi with McKennie and Tessmann in midfield behind them but with Tyler Adams back that could shift a little. Pochettino will have a chance to push his attack even more because of how much ground the Bournemouth midfielder can cover behind them. Adams hasn't appeared for the USMNT since Copa America in 2024, but now Pochettino will have all of his top midfielders providing even more flexibility for moving Musah around.  

While this isn't the final competitive international break before the Concacaf World Cup qualifying -- which the USMNT won't take part in -- kicks into gear for players of Borussia Dortmund and Juventus, Pochettino likely won't have them during the summer due to the Club World Cup. Unlike standard FIFA international breaks, where national teams get priority to players who are selected, during the CWC, clubs get priority. 

""We decide to call him because it's the only opportunity we have now. He won't be available in the future due to club World Cup,"" Pochettino said on Reyna's inclusion in the squad. ""That's why we decided to call him and see him in the squad. He's not playing much but he's a good player to consider.""

This camp will be Reyna's first under Pochettino due to missing the Nations League quarter finals with a groin strain. Pochettino otherwise would need to take his first look at Reyna in games where something isn't on the line, unlike players who he has seen like Brenden Aaronson and Alejandro Zendejas, both of whom, missed out. These rosters are always a numbers game and Pochettino was constrained with only bringing in 23 players for this camp. The manager did have more to say about Reyna's inclusion despite the minutes that he has logged under Dortmund's management.

""He's deserved to be here. He's improving, but he can still do better. We need to push him. We need to understand how he thinks, how he likes to play. We want to win this competition, and we think he can help,"" Pochettino said. ""We're going to try to create this relationship with him and see how he can help us.""

Only Reyna can show that he deserves to be here and Pochettino does understand that, but it's always easier to push a player when something is on the line.

A big takeaway of Pochettino's roster press conference is how much depth he has at his disposal. ""It's about numbers,"" was Pochettino's response when asked about the exclusion of Aaronson and Zenedejas. With players like Diego Luna and Reyna coming into the fold, Pochettino needs to figure out what the best balance is for what he wants. There's a chance that may not include players like Aaronson and the midfielder's versatility can work against him.

While Aaronson's able to play the wing, 10 or as a deeper lying midfielder but his true position is somewhere in between. With Pochetino shifting to more of a 4-2-3-1 than a 4-3-3, that may not be room for that in the current setup,p especially with Musah on the wing. It doesn't mean that any player is out of Pochttino's view. If anything given the three players who are making their first major squad after impressing in January camp. Brian White, Patrick Agyemang and Diego Luna will all get their shots to show what they can do against top opposition. 

Lack of depth was previously a concern but if the younger players can step up and help the USMNT, Pochettino is on the road to turning that into a strength. That's what he was brought here to do and for this team to be competitive in the 2026 World Cup, it will need to happen.

Gardner-Johnson trade grades: Eagles betting on future upside, Texans add more physicality to defense","https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/c-j-gardner-johnson-trade-grades-eagles-betting-on-future-upside-texans-add-more-physicality-to-defense/","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 16:50:28 GMT","

The Philadelphia Eagles said goodbye to another piece of their Super Bowl-winning defense on Tuesday, agreeing to send safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson to the Houston Texans in a surprise trade for former first-round draft pick Kenyon Green. The deal comes just one year after the Eagles reunited with Gardner-Johnson in free agency, and marks the Texans' second trade of a starting offensive lineman in as many days.

Gardner-Johnson, who's going to Houston along with a 2026 sixth-rounder in exchange for Green and a 2026 fifth-rounder, was a ball hawk with six interceptions during the Eagles' Super Bowl LIX run. He also had six picks during his first stint with Philadelphia back in 2022, when the team also advanced to the Super Bowl. 

Yet he may have angled for a new contract in the near future, according to PHLY, and the Eagles needed insurance along the offensive line with starting guard Mekhi Becton reaching free agency this week.

Which party registers as the initial winner of the surprise trade? Here are our initial grades:

Acquired: OG Kenyon Green, 2026 fifth-round pick

General manager Howie Roseman is known for squeezing value out of his frequent trades, but this one doesn't necessarily feel designed to come out like a clear victory for the Eagles; it's more of a ""necessary evil,"" like the club letting Super Bowl starters Milton Williams and Josh Sweat cash in elsewhere via free agency. Gardner-Johnson is a tone-setting playmaker, but he's bounced between teams in part due to his outsized personality and volatile contract talks. The Eagles also have plenty of young defensive backs to help offset his departure, with Cooper DeJean, Quinyon Mitchell and Reed Blankenship all held in high regard. 

More than that, Philly needed another O-line investment with Becton headed for the open market, and Green comes cheap on a rookie deal, with first-round tools that revered assistant Jeff Stoutland should be able to mold. Is it a step back for the roster at this moment? Yes. Does it have the potential to work out better for the Eagles in the long run? Also yes.

Grade: C+

Acquired: S C.J. Gardner-Johnson, 2026 sixth-round pick

On one hand, the Texans need all the linemen they can get, especially after shipping longtime left tackle Laremy Tunsil to the Washington Commanders earlier this week. Dumping Green just three years after picking him 15th overall doesn't necessarily help quarterback C.J. Stroud, who regressed behind shoddy protection in 2024. Yet Green mostly floundered while in Houston, in part due to injuries. And the Texans may have already replaced him with the more proven Laken Tomlinson via free agency. 

Gardner-Johnson has been a mercenary more than a long-term fixture, but his tenacious play style fits right into DeMeco Ryans' defense. He should help Derek Stingley Jr. keep the Texans feisty in the 2025 playoff hunt.

Grade: B-

We are just five days from Selection Sunday, but who's counting?  Me. And the selection committee, which begins its meeting Wednesday. And the teams that need some help down the stretch to hear their name called on that day.

Several of the conferences that expect multiple bids start their tournaments on Tuesday and there are some compelling story lines to watch. Before I get to that, here are a couple of reminders. Conference tournament games are no more important to the selection committee than regular season games with one exception. The committee needs to know which team is the automatic qualifier, which is decided by the tournament. Also, most conference tournament games are played on neutral courts and wins away from home carry a little more weight with the committee.

For teams on the bubble, these games can be vital. For others, it is all about seeding or trying to win to get in.

Here is a Bracketology breakdown of each conference with a chance at landing multiple bids to the NCAA Tournament tournament  noting that the West Coast Conference will be a multibid league as well, with Gonzaga and Saint Mary's playing in Tuesday night's conference championship game.

  

Check out Palm's bracket and full field of 68 at the Bracketology hub.   

Locks to make NCAA Tournament: Clemson, Duke, Louisville

On the bubble: North Carolina

Remember the days when the ACC would routinely put half their league in the NCAA Tournament?  Lately, it has been only a third of the conference. The ACC has had only five teams in the field for three straight seasons. That number may be a stretch this season.

Duke is a juggernaut, of course. The Blue Devils could be the top overall seed, but they only have seven Quad 1 wins, four of which were nonconference games. That means they are more likely the No.2 overall seed.

Clemson and Louisville have had good seasons and figure to be seeded around the bottom part of the top 25. For the Cardinals, it is an amazing turnaround from a season ago, when they were one of the worst teams in a major conference.

After that?  Not much. North Carolina sits at 1-11 in Quad 1 games. Nothing screams ""we're not an NCAA Tournament team"" quite like that. The Tar Heels first chance at a quad 1 game in the ACC Tournament would be a potential semifinal matchup with Duke.

Wake Forest is the third team out, but I do not see a realistic path to the field for the Demon Deacons, so I don't even have them on the bubble.

Locks to make NCAA Tournament: Arizona, BYU, Houston, Iowa State, Kansas, Texas Tech

On the bubble: Baylor, West Virginia

Houston is on course to be a No. 1 seed for the third straight NCAA Tournament. The Cougars ran away with the conference title, winning by four games over Texas Tech. They will look to reach the Sweet 16 for the fifth straight NCAA Tournament, although they have higher aspirations than that.

The Red Raiders and Iowa State are in the hunt for top four seeds as well.

Preseason No. 1 Kansas has struggled to play at that level since the calendar turned to December, which it started with back-to-back losses to Creighton and Missouri. The Jayhawks have had only one three game winning streak since then. That was from Jan. 5-11, which was right after the first of their three home losses this season. BYU beat them 91-57 on Feb. 18, which is the worst loss ever handed to a preseason No. 1 team.

Speaking of the Cougars, BYU finished the regular season on an eight-game heater, which followed an ugly loss at Cincinnati. That stretch includes all five of the Cougars' Quad 1 wins.

At the bubble end of the league, West Virginia has had trouble with consistency. The Mountaineers have shown they can beat the likes of Arizona and Iowa State. They also won at Kansas, but lost to four teams that are not NCAA Tournament contenders.

Baylor has suffered from a tough conference schedule, which included home-and-homes with Houston and Arizona and road games only with Texas Tech and BYU. IF the Bears miss the tournament, it will likely be because of a home loss to TCU.

Locks to make NCAA Tournament: Creighton, Marquette, St. John's, UConn

On the bubble: Xavier

St. John's has been one of the big stories in college basketball this season. The Red Storm won their first outright Big East title in 40 years in coach Rick Pitino's second season. They played too soft of a schedule to be in play for a No. 1 seed, but a No. 2 seed is not out of reach.

I guess that is just one of the things that has made this a weird season for the Big East. Back-to-back champion UConn has had a pretty fair-to-middling season that sees the Huskies in the middle of the bracket. And it wasn't just a bad start, which included a lost weekend at the Maui Invitational. They lost to Seton Hall just a couple of weeks ago. Consistency has been hard to find.

Creighton lost leading scorer Pop Isaacs early on, but still fought its way into the field, albeit in the middle of the bracket.

Marquette looked like the class of the league early, but only won four of its last ten games and will likely be seeded outside the top four.

Xavier won seven straight to finish the regular season and put itself squarely on the bubble. Most of those wins came against noncontenders, but a lot of bubble teams would have found a way to lose one or two of those.

Locks to make NCAA Tournament: Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Michigan State, Oregon, Purdue, UCLA, Wisconsin

Probable NCAA Tournament teams: Indiana

On the bubble: Ohio State

Michigan State was the outright conference champion in the regular season and has a shot to be a No. 1 seed, but it needs to win out and get help.

The conference could dominate the Nos. 3-5 seed lines with six teams that could possibly end up there, including Michigan, Wisconsin and last year's national runner-up Purdue.

Indiana got hot as soon as it was announced that coach Mike Woodson would not return next season. The Hoosiers are not safely in the bracket yet, but a win over Oregon in their first round Big Ten Tournament game would seal it.

Ohio State needs to go on a bit of a run. They sit at just 17-14 overall and only 11-14 vs. the top three quadrants. That has never been rewarded with an at-large bid before. The Buckeyes have three losses to tournament non-contenders. That is also true of two of their Quad 1 wins. Suffice it to say that the game with Iowa is a must-win and the next one against Illinois likely is as well.

Locks to make NCAA Tournament: None.

Other probable NCAA Tournament teams: New Mexico, Utah State

On the bubble: Boise State, Colorado State, San Diego State

Last season was the best season the Mountain West has ever had and the selection committee sent them a clear message: ""We are not impressed.""

Six teams did get into the field, but tournament winner New Mexico was considered a bid-stealer. Only San Diego State, which was tied among the league tournament teams for fewest Quad 1 wins and most losses, was seeded above No. 8. Four were double-digit seeds.

So you can forgive the league office if they are a little nervous this season. Regular season champ New Mexico is just 3-3 in Quad 1 and has three other losses to nontournament teams, two of which are Quad 3. Utah State is just 2-3 in Quad 1 with three Quad 2 losses. Each has a high number of Quad 2 wins though. No conference home wins are Quad 1 games. I have both of them seeded as a No. 9.

I have Boise State and San Diego State among the ""last four in"" the bracket. They will play each other to start the Mountain West Tournament. That is probably an elimination game.

Colorado State has made a strong run at the end of the season and I have added them to the bubble, but more likely than not, a conference championship is the Rams' only path to the NCAA Tournament.

Locks to make NCAA Tournament: Alabama, Auburn, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi State, Missouri, Ole Miss, Tennessee, Texas A&M

Other probable NCAA Tournament teams: Georgia, Vanderbilt

On the bubble: Arkansas, Oklahoma

What a dominant season the SEC has had. Auburn has been living as the overall No. 1 seed for most of the season, having piled up a whopping sixteen Quad 1 wins. Michigan State is second with 12, but three other SEC teams have hit double-digits already and Florida is right behind them with nine.

The Tigers will likely be the overall No. 1 seed on Selection Sunday as well. Alabama, Florida and Tennessee have all spent time on the top line of my bracket this season and are the leading contenders for the fourth No. 1 seed behind Duke and Houston. If one of them wins the SEC Tournament, that team will get it. If none of them do, Michigan State is in play.

Missouri has had a great turnaround from a year ago. Last season, the Tigers were 0-18 in conference play, but this season will find them in the bracket in the neighborhood of a top 25 seed.

Thirteen teams total are in my bracket as of this writing and things would have to go pretty sideways to get it down to 11, which is where I thought it would end up until about a week ago. Needless to say, 13 out of 16 in the tournament would be a record both in the raw number of teams from a conference and percentage of teams from a conference. The Big East had 11 of its 16 in 2011.

For Arkansas, avoiding a first loss to last-place South Carolina in the opening round of the SEC Tournament should be enough to land the Razorbacks a place in the field.

Oklahoma has a tougher task with Georgia as its opening opponent, but a win should seal the deal for them as well.

Some have said that winning the SEC tournament will be harder than winning the NCAA Tournament. I won't go that far, but it will be a grind, especially for those teams starting on Wednesday.

Sixteen national coaches associations have written the NCAA Division I Board of Governors in support of the National Junior College Athletic Association's effort to change decades-long eligibility requirements for junior college athletes. 

Calling those eligibility standards ""inexplicably more stringent"" for junior college athletes transferring to NCAA schools, the NJCAA asked for ""immediate change."" The letter was sent to the NCAA on Monday. 

The coaches associations from football (AFCA) as well as men's and women's basketball (NABC and WBCA) did not sign the letter and may be working on its own communications with the NCAA. 

Specifically, the NJCAA is questioning why junior college athletes are required to have a higher grade-point average (2.5) than athletes transferring between four-year institutions (2.0). 

In addition, the NJCAA is questioning these ""different standards"" for JUCO athletes … 

The NJCAA has basically taken the stance that two-year athletes are being discriminated against academically. 

""Student-athletes should not be punished or treated adversely because they have enrolled in a two-year institution before transferring to an NCAA institution,"" the letter asserts. 

The fate of junior college athletes has been highlighted lately amid a lawsuit by Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia, who won a preliminary injunction in district court allowing him a sixth year of eligibility after playing at New Mexico Military Institute, a junior college. The NCAA is appealing. 

There is also an emerging feeling that NJCAA schools could monetize and formalize their relationship as a ""minor league"" to Division I.

The percentage of athletes from junior colleges that make up Division I rosters is not clear because of the sport and roster size. However, one report reflected the impact of the transfer portal on JUCO players.

In 2018, Power Five football schools averaged about two JUCO players per team (129), according to one report. By 2021, the year one-time transfer rules started, that number dropped to 45. 

The letter is signed by Carol Bruggeman, CEO of the National Fastpitch Coaches Association. She represents the coaches associations from field hockey, wrestling, men's and women's golf, cheerleading, track, baseball, men's and women's lacrosse, swimming and diving, equestrian, volleyball, tennis, water polo and acrobatics. 

The first junior college was founded in 1901. Some four-year college presidents back then concluded the first two years of college were not necessarily broad-based, ""university-level"" classes. Over time, JUCOs became a haven for students who couldn't afford or weren't academically ready for a four-year college. 

Before the impact of the portal, junior colleges were seen as recruiting stops for quick replacements to shore up a roster. Some of the most famous names in American sports have attended junior colleges. Among those are Jackie Robinson, Albert Pujols, Bryce Harper as well a pair of Heisman winners, Roger Staubach and Cam Newton. Georgia's Stetson Bennett won a pair of championships after attending Jones College in Ellisville, Mississippi. 

The NJCAA has been around since 1938. Its 514 schools are about half of the NCAA total, and its budget is just a fraction of the NCAA's $1 billion. The state of California has a separate community college athletic association. 

NJCAA president and CEO Christopher Parker describes his relationship with NCAA president Charlie Baker as ""nonexistent.""

""I have made efforts to connect with Charlie Baker to work together for the good of all students,"" Parker recently told CBS Sports, ""But we haven't received any indication of Charlie's willingness to do so collaboratively.""

The Board of Governors is the NCAA's highest governance body and is responsible for making long-term strategic decisions.

Gardner-Johnson to Texans for former first-round OL Kenyon Green, draft pick swap","https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/eagles-trading-safety-c-j-gardner-johnson-to-texans-for-former-first-round-ol-kenyon-green-draft-pick-swap/","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:45:37 GMT","

C.J. Gardner-Johnson returned to the Philadelphia Eagles and promptly won a Super Bowl to wrap up the 2024 season. Now the outspoken safety is headed elsewhere again. One day ahead of the official start of 2025 NFL free agency, the Eagles are trading the veteran defender to the Houston Texans, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones confirms.

In return for Gardner-Johnson and a 2026 sixth-round draft pick, the Texans are sending offensive guard Kenyon Green and a 2026 fifth-rounder to the Eagles. It marks the second trade of a starting offensive lineman for Houston in as many days, after the Texans reportedly agreed to send left tackle Laremy Tunsil to the Washington Commanders, the Eagles' NFC East rivals.

Gardner-Johnson initially joined the Eagles via trade in 2022 and immediately brought both physicality and playmaking to Philly's secondary, logging six interceptions in just 12 games en route to a Super Bowl appearance. A contract dispute saw him leave for the Detroit Lions in 2023, only to return to the Eagles on a three-year deal last offseason. Gardner-Johnson emerged as a leader for the Eagles' top-ranked defense in 2024, once again securing six interceptions and this time helping the Birds win the Super Bowl.

Green, who comes to the Eagles as part of Gardner-Johnson's latest relocation, was a first-round pick of the Texans in 2022. Still just 23, he's missed extensive time due to injury over the last two seasons, including the entire 2023 campaign, but logged 23 combined starts for Houston's front out of Texas A&M. He figures to step in as a starter in place of interior veteran Mekhi Becton, who hit free agency this week.

The clocks have been set forward. The sun is sitting in the sky later into the evening. The birds are chirping. You can stand outside for longer than 10 minutes in the Midwest without the need to stuff your hands into your pockets. Everything is muddy.

It's spring in the Big Ten, and while fans are paying attention to March Madness, they're also keeping an eye on their football teams. After all, life is pretty good for the Big Ten on the football field these days. The league has won consecutive national titles, and last year saw standout seasons from Indiana and Illinois, both of which won 10 games. That's something you don't typically see.

As we enter spring practice for the 2025 season, everyone is a little optimistic about their team, because what else are you supposed to be five months before the season begins? Still, there are also questions everywhere you look, and we'll start getting hints to their answers in the coming weeks. As spring practices begin, here's a look at the biggest questions surrounding all 18 Big Ten schools.

Who steps in at receiver? The Illini are coming off their first 10-win season in nearly a quarter century and enter 2025 with nearly their entire roster from last season remaining intact. The returning production, combined with a relatively friendly schedule have people wondering if this team, which came close to a playoff berth last season, is a legit contender to get there this season.

While having Luke Altmyer and the entire offensive line is a great start on offense, Altmyer still needs receivers to throw to, and Pat Bryant and Zakhari Franklin are gone. Illinois hit the portal to snag Hudson Clement (51/741/5) from West Virginia to fill some of the void but will need in-house options like Hank Beaty, Collin Dixon and Malik Elzy to take a step forward in 2025.

Can the Hoosiers strike transfer gold again? A quick overhaul of a roster through the transfer portal has varying results. As we saw at Indiana last season, when Curt Cignetti showed up and brought in almost an entirely new team, sometimes it works out better than anybody could've imagined. However, sometimes it goes the other way. Just ask Florida State.

The Hoosiers were extremely active in the portal again this offseason, bringing in a new QB (Francisco Mendoza, Cal), running back (Roman Hemby, Maryland), receivers (Tyler Morris, Michigan; Makai Jackson, Appalachian State) and multiple offensive linemen (Pat Coogan, Notre Dame; Zen Michalski, Ohio State; Khalil Benson, Colorado). And that's just the offense!

Spring practice will serve as a sort of freshman orientation in Bloomington and give us our first hint as to how effective this group can be.

Is the offense fixed for real this time? It may not have felt like it given the overall results, but Iowa's offense improved significantly under new offensive coordinator Tim Lester. After averaging 17.7 points in 2022 and a paltry 15.4 in 2023, the Hawkeyes scored 27.7 points per game last season. Kaleb Johnson and the run game were responsible for most of it, but Johnson is gone and the Hawkeyes have made another change at QB.

QB Mark Gronowski may have the name of a Chicago Bears linebacker, but the suburban Chicago native comes to Iowa via South Dakota State, where he was a prolific passer. Will he be the one who brings a passing offense back to Iowa City?

Will a new roster lead to better results? On the surface, it's hard to say losing 21 players to the transfer portal, as well as others to graduation, is a good thing. Nor is losing your top three quarterbacks on last year's depth chart, as well as key players like running back Roman Hemby and receiver Tai Felton. However, we shouldn't forget that the Terps went 1-8 in the Big Ten play last season, so maybe starting over isn't the worst thing in the world.

And Maryland is, for all intents and purposes, starting over. Eyes will be on the QB battle, as well as the offensive line this spring. UCLA transfer QB Justyn Martin will be competing with incoming freshman Malik Washington, who was one of the stars of a recruiting class that ranked 25th nationally. 

Is the future now with Bryce Underwood? There's no question that the 2024 season, even with a win over Ohio State, was not an overly successful one for the Wolverines. They followed up a national title with an 8-5 mark. There's a lot of optimism heading into Sherrone Moore's second season, and Bryce Underwood is a big reason why, but will the freshman phenom win the starting job?

Michigan brought in veteran transfer Mikey Keene from Fresno State. It's unclear whether Keene is seen as a solid backup plan or if he's a bridge to an Underwood future. Perhaps even Michigan isn't sure what the plan is, and this spring will be the start of making a decision.

Will Aidan Chiles make the leap? If you look around the Big Ten as a whole, there are plenty of questions about QBs. In theory, having strong QB play could help a team take a significant step forward. Spartans fans are paying far more attention to their basketball team right now than the football team, but perhaps a spring without the microscope could be good for Aidan Chiles.

I was one of the biggest offenders when it came to overhyping Chiles last offseason; his season was up and down with far too many downs. He threw only 13 touchdowns to 11 interceptions and completed only 59.4% of his passes, but it was his first season as a starter. Another year in the system and further development could see Chiles cut down on the mistakes and dial in for 2025. 

Will the lack of consistency at defensive coordinator have an impact? Minnesota plays complementary football, and that means it needs a strong defense to win games. The Gophers have had that under PJ Fleck. The problem is their success on that side of the ball has grabbed plenty of attention.

Joe Rossi had an excellent five seasons running the defense and left last year to join Jonathan Smith's staff at Michigan State. He was replaced by Corey Hetherman, who lasted only one season before Miami poached him to be their new defensive coordinator. Danny Collins is an in-house promotion, which is good for continuity, but he'll still be the third defensive play-caller in three seasons. That's a lot of change after a lot of continuity under Rossi.

Can the defense handle its losses? While it wasn't elite, Nebraska's defense was a strong suit last season. The Cornhuskers finished No. 23 nationally in points allowed per possession and No. 12 in pressure rate. And now that defense loses a lot, and not just in personnel. 

While Bill Connelly's returning production rate has Nebraska's defense ranked No. 74 nationally in returning production, defensive coordinator Tony White left to take the same gig at Florida State. In his place is John Butler, who was promoted from secondary coach. This will be his first spring in charge of the defense, and he has a lot of new faces in key spots. 

Will the portal class pay dividends? While there weren't any attention-grabbing headliners in Northwestern's portal class, there could be plenty of sneaky-good upgrades. Grabbing the experienced Preston Stone at QB from SMU should provide an immediate upgrade to an offense that also sees leading rusher Cam Porter return.

Still, while Northwestern wasn't prolific offensively last year, the bigger reason for the drop-off was the fact a normally reliable defense fell off a cliff. The Wildcats have overhauled their secondary through the portal this offseason, bringing in defensive backs Fred Davis (Jacksonville State) and An'Darius Coffey (Memphis). They're also hoping Yanni Karlaftis (Purdue) will provide a spark for the pass rush.

Rebuild or reload? For years, there was little question of what a program like Ohio State would do after losing so much talent. It would simply replace all those studs with more studs, but the transfer portal and NIL have changed things a bit. Teams can't horde depth the same way they once did. So, with the Buckeyes coming off a national title season but losing so many contributors to the NFL, can they simply replace all that production?

Complicating matters is the fact both coordinators have left. Chip Kelly's back in the NFL, while Jim Knowles jumped to Penn State. Spring practice will be the first time a lot of people are in new roles, and while plenty of attention will be placed on the QB battle, it's far from the only interesting change happening in Columbus.

Is Dante Moore ready for the big time? Dan Lanning has been successful at Oregon. He's 35-6 overall and won the Big Ten his first season in the league. But that success has come with two quarterbacks closing in on their pensions: Bo Nix and Dillon Gabriel. Unless the Ducks go QB shopping in the spring portal, all signs point to Dante Moore being the man this fall.

Moore certainly has the pedigree as a recruit, and this will be his third season in college. What he does not have is much experience. He appeared in nine games with UCLA, with mixed results. He'll now be at the helm of a program with lofty expectations of competing in the Big Ten and getting back to the College Football Playoff. 

Can QB Drew Allar get this team over the hump? In 2023, Michigan went all in to retain key players and won the national title. In 2024, Ohio State went all in to retain key players, brought in transfers and won a national title. In 2025, Penn State is all in. It has retained key players. It's brought in new transfers at receiver it believes to be upgrades. It poached Jim Knowles from Ohio State.

It's clear what the goal is, but Penn State won't pull it off unless Allar performs better in big moments. His performance in three playoff games was not spectacular, and while none of those concerns will be answered in the spring, it'll be pivotal to develop rapport with his new weapons in the passing game. After all, there's no more Tyler Warren easy button.

It can't be any worse, right? OK, so this isn't a question about any specific area of the team, but in my defense, this is Purdue. How can you look at one specific area when everything went wrong last year? Barry Odom has taken over for Ryan Walters after turning UNLV into a legit Group of Five power the last few seasons, but he has a lot of work to do in West Lafayette. It's a lot easier to make up ground in the Mountain West than in the Big Ten.

This spring will be the start of the work.

Can the offense improve on last year's performance? Kyle Monangai is gone, and while we'll all miss that cannonball of a running back, just about everybody else on the Rutgers offense returns. Athan Kaliakmanis is back at QB, and he'll be behind an offensive line with plenty of experience. Kaliakmanis was a serious upgrade at QB last season, and another year in the system should theoretically lead to better results.

You probably don't realize this, but Rutgers averaged 28.9 points per game last season. That ranked sixth in the Big Ten, behind only Indiana, Ohio State, Oregon, Penn State and USC. If the Scarlet Knights can maintain that or slightly improve upon it, this is a team that could catch a lot of people off guard in 2025.

What will Tino Sunseri bring to the offense? UCLA was a win away from getting to a bowl last season, which would've been an outstanding result in DeShaun Foster's first year in charge. And the Bruins did that while scoring only 18.4 points per game. That finished ahead of only Northwestern and Purdue (a combined 2-16 in B1G play).

So it's no surprise there's a new offensive coordinator in Sunseri. He's well-respected in coaching circles and did a great job with Kurtis Rourke at Indiana last season. Now, the 36-year-old former quarterback will look to revitalize the Bruins offense with Appalachian State transfer Joey Aguilar as the presumed starter.

How are we looking on the lines of scrimmage? Last offseason, USC overhauled its entire defensive staff and brought in transfers to fill some of the holes. The results weren't drastic in the win column, but at the end of the day, the Trojans went from allowing 34.4 points per game in 2023 to 24.1 last season. 

Now the makeover continues, with new bodies coming in along the lines of scrimmage through the portal, plus the hope that development elsewhere will lead to further progress. The Big Ten is not a league where you can win consistently with skill talent. Oregon was ahead of the schedule last year. USC wasn't, but we know Lincoln Riley is trying to address it. The spring will give us an early hint of what's coming.

What does Demond Williams Jr. have in store? Will Rogers was a perfectly serviceable quarterback for the Huskies last year, but he came with a defined ceiling. He's a primarily stationary pocket passer without elite arm strength. The offense should look a lot different this year with Demond Williams Jr., who is not stationary!

Williams was used as a change of pace most of last year before taking over late in the season, but the flashes were promising. He threw for five touchdowns and 575 yards in the final two games of the season against Oregon and Louisville. He also rushed for 282 yards on the season. If Washington improves on its 6-7 record last year under Jedd Fisch, it will almost certainly be because of Williams. All eyes will be on him in Seattle this spring.

What does the offense look like? It's Luke Fickell's third season at Wisconsin, and it feels as if he's starting over. The Badgers 22-year bowl streak came to an end last season, and it led to the dismissal of Phil Longo as offensive coordinator and a lot of turnover in the transfer portal. The Badgers lost a lot of contributors on both sides of the ball and brought in plenty of potential replacements, as well as a new offensive coordinator in Jeff Grimes.

You get the sense Fickell is looking to distance himself from the ""Dairy Raid"" narrative and get a bit closer to Wisconsin's former identity. Will we have a better idea of how that looks this spring? Wisconsin ranked No. 63 nationally in rush rate last year, and while some of that was situation-dependent (they trailed a lot), that's a lot of throwing for a team that lost its starting QB early in the year. Billy Edwards threw for 2,881 yards with Maryland last year, so we know he can be an effective passer (certainly more so than Braedyn Locke), but I'd bet the plan is for him to hand off more frequently.

Wide receiver Cooper Kupp was on the trading block, but the Los Angeles Rams' plan has changed. General manager Les Snead is planning to release the 2021 NFL Offensive Player of the Year on Wednesday at the start of the new league year if the Rams can't find a trade partner, per ESPN. 

The motivation for the Rams to dump Kupp and save $7.52 million in cap space likely increased after they signed three-time first-team All-Pro wideout Davante Adams to a two-year, $44 million contract with $26 million guaranteed on Sunday.

Kupp, who will turn 32 years old on June 15, initially broke the news via social media that he was on the block on Feb. 4. In his post, Kupp shared that while he doesn't agree with the Rams' decision to move on from him, he looks back on his time with the franchise with ""so much pride."" Kupp also made it clear that he is highly motivated to resume his career elsewhere. 

I was informed that the team will be seeking a trade immediately and will be working with me and my family to find the right place to continue competing for championships. 

I don't agree with the decision and always believed it was going to begin and end in LA.   Still, if there's one thing that I have learned over the years: there are so many things that are out of your control, but it is how you respond to these things that you will look back on and remember. 

I have taken so much pride in playing alongside my teammates for the LA community, so thank you for embracing my family and making this such a special place for us. 

2024 began with one of the best training camps of my career. Preparations start now for 2025. Highly motivated, as healthy as ever, and looking forward to playing elite football for years to come. 

Love you guys ..  But coming for it all. 

A 2017 third-round pick, Kupp became an immediate contributor inside Rams head coach Sean McVay's offense. He helped the Rams reach the Super Bowl in 2018, McVay's second year on the job. 

In 2021, Kupp had one of the greatest seasons of all-time regardless of position. He won the NFL's ""triple crown"" after leading the league in receptions (145, second-most in a season in NFL history), receiving yards (1,947, second-most in a season in NFL history) and receiving touchdowns (16) in the regular season. He is only one of five to win the receiving triple crown in a season since the AFL/NFL merger in 1970, which is why he was named the 2021 season's NFL Offensive Player of the Year. 

In that postseason, Kupp again led all receivers in catches, receiving yards and touchdown catches. He was named Super Bowl LVI MVP after catching the game-winning score in the Rams' 23-20 win over the Bengals. 

Injuries have slowed Kupp down in recent years, however, as he's missed a combined 18 games since the Rams won the Super Bowl. Kupp's injuries are surely part of why the Rams are moving on from him. He has averaged 67 catches, 753 yards receiving and six receiving touchdowns in an average of 11 games played since his historic 2021 campaign. Kupp average 59.2 receiving yards per game in 2024, his fewest since his rookie year in 2017 (57.9).

Despite his recent injury issues, expect several teams to be interested in bidding for Kupp's services, especially those that could use a sure-handed veteran wideout with playoff experience. He is due $5 million in guaranteed salary from the Rams in 2025, so his contract with his new team may not break the bank.

Here's a look at five teams who might be interested in Kupp's services. 

Dallas needs some reinforcements around CeeDee Lamb, especially with Brandin Cooks hitting the open market. Kupp's addition would free things up for Lamb while also giving Dak Prescott another established weapon to throw to. 

The Seattle Seahawks desperately need help at the wide receiver position after cutting Tyler Lockett and trading DK Metcalf to the Pittsburgh Steelers within the past week. Kupp wouldn't be the sole focus of opposing defenses either in Seattle with Jaxon Smith-Njigba catching 100 passes in 2024, which tied the Seahawks franchise single-season record (also set by Lockett in 2020). 

Seattle also lured the top free agent quarterback available in Pro Bowler Sam Darnold, who agreed to a three-year, $100.5 million contract. Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak is a disciple of the Shanahan-McVay tree, so the offense he runs will be similar to one Kupp ran with the Rams and the attack Darnold ran with the Vikings. 

Baltimore isn't afraid to go after big names in free agency. Just a year ago, the Ravens signed Derrick Henry to a two-year deal, and we all see how that's worked out for them. Kupp would join a loaded Ravens offense that also includes two-time league MVP Lamar Jackson, fellow wideouts Zay Jones and Rashod Bateman and tight ends Isaiah Likely and Mark Andrews. 

Bo Nix thrived last year despite not having the most proven of receiving crops outside of Courtland Sutton. In Denver, Kupp would play with an up-and-coming quarterback and inside Sean Payton's pass-happy offense. Kupp's ability to make plays over the middle would certainly aid Nix, who routinely makes plays outside the pocket. 

The Chargers could use another receiver to fill out their line alongside 2023 first-round pick Quentin Johnston and 2024 second-round pick Ladd McConkey after the Buffalo Bills lured away Josh Palmer in free agency on Monday. They also have the second-most cap space in the NFL ($93.8, per Spotrac), so they could outbid anyone for Kupp. Plus, they're a team that made the postseason last year with a fun, young quarterback in Justin Herbert, and Kupp wouldn't even have to move.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Acbssports.com","NFL free agency 2025: Top 10 free agents available include Aaron Rodgers, Justin Reid, Rico Dowdle","https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-free-agency-2025-top-10-free-agents-available-include-aaron-rodgers-justin-reid-rico-dowdle/","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 13:36:50 GMT","

A ton of dominoes fell on the first full day of the NFL's legal tampering period, with several big-name free agents reportedly coming to terms on new deals. A lot of marquee players have found new homes, but there are still a lot of good players available as we gear up for the second and final day of the league's legal tampering period. 

Quarterback is the NFL's marquee position, so it makes sense to review what transpired at that position on Monday. Justin Fields, after deciding to test free agency despite the Steelers' attempts to re-sign him, reportedly agreed to a two-year, $40 million deal with the New York Jets that includes $30 million guaranteed. Fields will get another chance to be a starting quarterback after going 4-2 as the Steelers' starter in 2024. 

Shortly after Fields landed with the Jets, the Seattle Seahawks reportedly signed Sam Darnold to a three-year, $100.5 million deal just days after trading former Pro Bowler Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders. Like Fields, Darnold will get another opportunity to lead an offense after helping lead the Vikings to a 14-3 record this past season. 

Fields and Darnold headlined the players who reportedly inked deals on Monday, but as we alluded to earlier, there are still a slew of big names still available, including at quarterback. Here's a look at the top-10 players who are still available. It should be noted that the following ranking is not solely about talent, it's also about market demand and the position they play. 

Rodgers is technically not a free agent until his official release from the Jets on Wednesday. He might not the best player still available, but he is a future Hall of Famer who plays the most important position in all of sports, so him taking the top spot was kind of a no-brainer. 

It appears that the Steelers have the inside track at landing Rodgers after missing out on Fields. But the Giants (who re-signed receiver Darius Slayton on Monday) are also still in the mix. There are rumblings that Rodgers' third NFL team will be revealed at some point on Tuesday. 

Like Rodgers, Wilson is probably not the second-best player still available. But he is possible future Hall of Fame quarterback who was named to his 10th Pro Bowl in 2024. 

At this point, it appears that Wilson will sign with whoever doesn't land Rodgers. That could mean a return to Pittsburgh for the 2025 season. A dark horse candidate for both Rodgers and Wilson is the Vikings after Minnesota watched Darnold leave for Seattle. 

Still just 28 years old, Reid has already played seven seasons and has been played an integral role in the Chiefs' success over the past four years. A hard-hitting safety, Reid is capable of making plays all over the field. In 2023, Reid recorded 95 tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble and an interception while helping the Chiefs become the first team in nearly 20 years to win back-to-back Super Bowls. 

The best offensive tackle left on the market. He's on the better side of 30 (29 years old). For the Jaguars and Vikings last season, he played 999 offensive snaps, allowed seven sacks and seven quarterback hits while recording a 70.4 pass blocking grade from PFF.

Oddly, one of the lone bright spots for the 2024 Dallas Cowboys hasn't been re-signed by the team. A former undrafted rookie, Dowdle won the starting job last year and literally ran with it. He racked up 1,079 yards on the ground while averaging a solid 4.6 yards-per-carry. 

Dowdle would be a good fit for several teams (including the Steelers, who reportedly lost Najee Harris to the Los Angeles Chargers), but his market is likely being hindered by the fact that this year's draft class is considered to be littered with talented players at his position. J.K. Dobbins is another notable running back that is also looking for a new NFL home. 

A former first-round pick who didn't pan out with the Jets, Becton enjoyed a career rebirth last year while helping the Eagles win the Super Bowl. A big reason for Becton's success last year was him moving from tackle to the interior of the offensive line. Becton is only 26 and has shown considerable growth at both run blocking and in pass protection. 

Like former teammate and 2021 draft classmate Fields, Jenkins is hoping to revive his career with a new team after things didn't necessarily pan out in Chicago. Like Becton, Jenkins' play has improved after transitioning from tackle to guard. He's also young (27) and already has 40 starts under his belt. 

As you can see, offensive line is probably the deepest position group in this year's free agency class. The top-rated center available, Myers started in each of his first 56 NFL games. A 2021 second-round pick, Myers also has four playoff starts under his belt while playing with Rodgers and current Packers starting quarterback Jordan Love. Myers could return to the Packers if he doesn't find a desirable deal in free agency. 

Several defensive backs reportedly found new teams on Monday, but Douglas is still available. Arguably the best cornerback still available, Douglas' career so far includes a Super Bowl win with the Eagles (in 2017, his rookie season) and a year that saw him record a league-best two interceptions returns for scores (in 2021 as a member of the Packers. Douglas is a good fit for teams that like to play zone. 

Zeitler is 35, but is still a reliable guard for any team looking for veteran help on the offensive line. He had an elite run-blocking grade of 87.2 and a strong pass protection grade of 71.8 in 2024.

Welcome to Snyder's Soapbox! Here, I pontificate about matters related to Major League Baseball on a weekly basis. Some of the topics will be pressing matters, some might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, and most will be somewhere in between. The good thing about this website is that it's free, and you are allowed to click away. If you stay, you'll get smarter, though. That's a money-back guarantee. Let's get to it.

One of my favorite old movies is ""12 Angry Men"" (I promise, this will get to our topic at hand, so just bear with me). If you've never heard of the movie, it's a jury of men on a murder case and you don't need to know more about it for the purposes of this discussion. I bring it up because there is one part where a few of the jurors are lamenting the kids of that era and how they -- you know how this one goes -- haven't earned a thing.

Yawn. We've heard it all a million times, right? 

The movie was made in 1957. Now, yes, I'm fully aware that it's fictional, but screenwriter Reginald Rose wouldn't have included it unless it was a familiar thought. That same criticism still lingers today and it surely always has.

For one reason or another, every generation loves to bitch and moan about how the generations after them just don't understand. They have everything far too easy! They don't respect their elders! They don't even know what hard work is! The list of shaming goes on and on. 

Sports are no different here. As I'm a baseball writer -- I'm 46, so I obviously don't work as hard as any of the writers in their 60s but definitely work far harder than any of those damn, spoiled kids in their 20s, right? -- I'll stay in my lane here. 

It has long driven me crazy that a large swath of former players feel the need to talk about the generations of baseball players that came after them in such a negative light. 

The latest? C'mon down, Barry Bonds!

In discussing Shohei Ohtani specifically but more as a vehicle to just complain about how much easier everyone has it these days, Bonds offered up the following on the ""All the Smoke"" podcast: 

""Ohtani is not gonna hit two home runs without seeing one go (by his ear) in my generation. I don't care what he does. He's not gonna steal two bases without someone decapitating his kneecap to slow him down. It's a different game back then.""  

***

""They should be better than us hitting-wise because they can hit a home run, throw their bat up in the air, run around, get a taco, come back down and have a limo drive them around,"" Bonds said. ""All these antics that we weren't allowed to do. If I did anything like that, I'm gonna see a star. I'm gonna see a hospital, but I ain't gonna see baseball that day.""

We can ignore the obvious hyperbole and get to the actual points. 

A player couldn't steal two bases during Bonds' career without a team trying to injure him? That's far funnier than his limo and taco ""jokes."" There were certainly more contact plays from the 1980s through 2005 or so, but those were double-play turns at second and collisions at home plate. I'm hard pressed to find an example where a team punished a baserunner for stealing multiple bases by physically assaulting his knee on the bases. There's no evidence that, say, Rickey Henderson routinely had pitches aimed at his knees on as many occasions as it would have called for, given Bonds' comments. 

As for pitchers throwing at heads, yeah, it used to happen a lot more. It happened a lot more in the eras before Bonds than during Bonds' era, too. It's been a gradual decrease as pitchers have thrown harder and harder and people have realized we maybe shouldn't mess around with a player's safety over hurt feelings. 

The weird thing about Bonds' comments was that he didn't discuss how much better pure stuff the pitchers have now, because they inarguably do. They throw much harder than they used to and the breaking stuff moves more -- again, while traveling faster -- by physical measurement. Even if Bonds' assertion is that the threat of a pitch in the ear hole makes it harder to hit, shouldn't the much better raw stuff in 2025 even things out a bit? 

Let's also keep in mind that MLB through the '90s and early 2000s was playing with baseballs that were very likely juiced (to the gills), producing a power onslaught like nothing we saw before and nothing we've seen since. There wasn't PED testing. The league expanded by four teams in the '90s, diluting the pool of pitchers much further than previous generations. The result of all this? A veritable explosion. The numbers were outrageous. 

And you're gonna say hitters now have it easier? 

Regardless, no need to get further in the weeds, because the specifics are beside my main point. 

My main point is this: quit being so insecure about your own era that you feel the urge to talk down about everyone else. It's been happening forever in all walks of life and it's so dumb. In MLB, we've heard so many times from grumps like Goose Gossage about how much more baseball sucks now. I found a quote from four-time All-Star Andy Pafko, in ""Banks to Sandberg to Grace"" by Carrie Muskat, where someone asked him if he wished he was still playing baseball. His answer? 

""Yes and no. Yes for the salary. But no, because when I played it was real baseball."" 

Ooooh. You hear that, all? They used to play real baseball, but they didn't in...2002, apparently, because that's when the book was published. That's also the era in which Bonds played. 

How much would Bonds have scoffed at that when he was playing? Do you really want to be that guy now, Barry? 

You know who you should strive to be these days? CC Sabathia does nothing but speak in positive fashion about today's game. I interviewed him two years ago and he was gushing about how amazing Ohtani is. In general, he had nothing to say to detract from the current players. It was so much more fun to hear than someone sitting there and claiming everyone now has it easy. 

To the former players out there who strongly disagree with me and think their era was the absolute best and every era that came later was somehow worse and easier to play: Feel free to continue deluding yourselves. You could always just keep it to yourself. If you feel it's very important to speak out, just know that it's a very unbecoming look to talk down on those who follow. It sounds incredibly insecure, too. If that's who you want to be, you do you. I guess.

16 days until Opening Day ... 

One nice thing about baseball is even the worst teams will have something work getting excited about. The White Sox were historically bad last year, and yet Garrett Crochet was one of the most exciting stories of the first half; the Marlins weren't much better, but there was Xavier Edwards, hitting .328 and swiping 31 bags in just 70 games last season.  

Team context matters in baseball, but great Fantasy players can still shine on terrible teams, in a way that isn't often true in Fantasy Football, let's say. Being on a bad team might suppress your counting stats, or limit the number of wins a pitcher can get, sure, but because baseball is a series of individual matchups masquerading as a team sport, you can still find plenty to get excited about from even the worst rosters.  

Today, we're looking for an overlooked reason to get excited about every single team in the league, good and bad. And what's fun about this exercise – looking for Fantasy sleepers outside of the top 450 in NFBC drafts in the past two weeks – is the bad teams might actually have even more to get excited about than the good teams. The Dodgers don't really have any room for little-known names to shine; the parade of superstars in the lineup and rotation have a way of sucking all the oxygen out of the room. 

But the Marlins and White Sox? Well, precisely because they are so bad, they actually have lots of opportunities for names to come out of nowhere. Crochet and Edwards were former top prospects who might not have even gotten the opportunity to do what they did last season on teams with more options. Their presence in their rotations and lineups wasn't necessarily the product of desperation, but a lack of more proven options gave them the runway and security to take off.  

We're going through all 30 teams today to find the best deep sleeper on each roster, and you'll want to pay special attention to those teams you might otherwise ignore. Because that's where some of 2025's league-winning talents could emerge from.  

Before we get there, if you missed yesterday's newsletter, that's where you'll find my thoughts on what we learned Monday will be a season-ending injury for Gerrit Cole -- and if you already drafted, you can find some replacement options here from when we first learned about the injury. 

The path is less clear with Geraldo Perdomo's contract extension, but by all accounts, Lawlar still has a chance to make the Opening Day roster. It would likely be as a super-utility infielder, and he's going to see time at three different infield positions this spring. Lawlar has missed so much time over the past few years with injuries, but he remains a dynamic talent who could be a Fantasy contributor if anything happens to Perdomo, Eugenio Suarez, or Ketel Marte.  

I'm actually surprised Baldwin's price hasn't risen much in the aftermath of Sean Murphy's rib injury, because it sure looks like he's got a chance to be the team's Opening Day catcher. Murphy should be back sometime in April, but the Braves have been willing to use him in close to a 50-50 split with Travis d'Arnaud in the past, so Baldwin could still have a role even when Murphy is healthy – especially if he forces the issue with his play early on. Baldwin is a top prospect who hit .276/.370/.423 between Double-A and Triple-A, and he could be a viable starting option in two-catcher leagues to open the season, at least.  

With Grayson Rodriguez opening the season on the IL with an elbow injury, it sure looks like Povich should have a rotation spot to open the season. I have some concerns about his ability to miss bats consistently, but he didn't have that problem in Triple-A, sporting a 28.2% strikeout rate at the level last season. With a good defense and supporting cast around him, I'm willing to give Povich a chance to open the season.  

Fitts has seen a nice bump in velocity this spring, which makes me think there might be more strikeout upside than he showed in his four-start cameo last season – something he talked about making a priority at the end of the season. Injuries have opened a path to the No. 5 spot, which he is currently competing with Quinn Priester for. There's some sleeper appeal for both of them, but I'd rather see Fitts get the chance, personally.  

Honorable mention: Marcelo Mayer, SS -- Obviously. He seems to be behind Kristian Campbell and Roman Anthony on the prospect hierarchy, but an injury to Trevor Story could open an opportunity for Mayer, who is hitting very well this spring.  

Brown's curveball might be one of the best pitches in baseball, and he's going to sit in the high 90s with that fastball too. That might be enough to make him a viable option for the Cubs rotation, though I'm also hopeful he can develop his changeup enough to really take off. The talent and feel for spin here is remarkable, and he showed it can work at the MLB level last season, putting up a 3.58 ERA and 10.4 K/9 in 55.1 innings before a neck injury detailed things. I'd love to see him get an opportunity ahead of Colin Rea in the Cubs rotation.  

A Rule 5 pick out of the Brewers organization, Smith gives the White Sox another interesting young pitcher to keep an eye on. He had a 29.6% strikeout rate and solid control between Double-A and Triple-A last season, with a 3.05 ERA over 94.1 innings of work. There's some long-term relief risk in his profile thanks to command concern, but the stuff is impressive enough that I'm definitely rooting for him to make the rotation here.  

Lowder had a 1.17 ERA in six starts with the Reds last season, but with iffy strikeout skills that made it look especially unsustainable. But it was the first taste of the majors for a guy who speed-ran through the upper minors just a year after being drafted. I'm hoping the stuff was playing down at the end of his longest season ever in 2024, with the potential for more upside than he showed when he's a bit fresher. He's dealing with elbow soreness this spring and won't be in the Opening Day rotation, so he's more of a watch-list guy.  

Honorable mention: Chase Burns. The team's first-rounder in 2024, Burns is probably the better prospect, and I think there's a chance he blazes through the minors and forces the Reds to call him up sometime this summer. There's no such thing as ""The Next Paul Skenes"" but … Burns is definitely a name to keep in the back of your mind.  

The results have been mixed, but the stuff might look better than ever this spring, with McKenzie sitting around 94 mph with his four-seamer. McKenzie was a must-start pitcher back in 2022, and if he's healthy and can sustain these velocity gains, he could get back there backed by a good supporting cast in Cleveland.  

Honorable mention: Kyle Manzardo, DH -- After hitting 37 homers in 177 games at Triple-A, Manzardo doesn't have anything left to prove down here. Now, it's all about proving he can do it consistently in the majors. We saw flashes of it down the stretch last year when he hit .270/.333/.540 in September, and he's going to be a big part of the Guardians' plans to replace Josh Naylor's production, albeit mostly as a DH.  

Veen has cooled off a bit after a red-hot start to the spring, but he still has a chance to force his way onto the Rockies roster. He's a former top-100 prospect who has struggled with injuries and whiffs in recent years, but there are still some impact tools here with both speed and power, and Coors Field could help inflate the batting average enough to make him a useful Roto option.  

Mize's velocity is up yet again this spring, and he keeps searching for the right breaking ball to bring the arsenal together – he's working on three different slider looks this spring. The former top pitching prospect in the entire league, Mize is off to a great start this spring and has a chance to put it all together. I'm definitely looking into him with one of my last picks in most drafts the rest of the way.   

The primary prospect return in the Kyle Tucker trade, Smith has a chance to break camp with the Astros after fewer than 40 games in the minors. Christian Walker's injury could determine whether Smith ultimately gets the call, but the thing to keep an eye on over the next weeks is whether they get him any reps at right field in games. Right field is clearly the biggest position of need for the Astros, and if he can hack it there, it could be his path to immediate playing time.  

The tools have always been there for Melendez, who has been in at least the 80th percentile in average exit velocity in each of his three MLB seasons. The problem has been consistency and contact, and he revamped his swing this offseason with the hopes of solving those problems. He's still striking out plenty this spring, but he's also been very productive, so we'll see if that work ends up paying off. The raw power for 30-plus homers is here if he can cut the swing and miss out.  

The Angels might be more aggressive than any team in the league when it comes to promoting their top prospects, and Moore was already at Double-A just a few months after they made him the No. 8 pick in last year's draft. He hasn't torn the cover off the ball this spring, but MLB.com noted Monday he could be part of the team's 2B plan if Luis Rengifo's hamstring injury keeps him out to open the season. There's rare power for a second baseman here if he gets the chance.  

Given Will Smith's presence, it's been tough to figure out what Rushing's path to Fantasy relevance actually looks like. The Dodgers have given him time at first base and in the corner outfield, but Freddie Freeman, Teoscar Hernandez, and Michael Conforto won't cede a ton of playing time there, either. But there's very little doubt Rushing will hit, and there could be enough time across four positions to make him relevant for Fantasy – the bar is awfully low at catcher. Especially if Smith and Freeman need additional time off in-season as they manage ankle issues from last season.  

I had hoped either Max Meyer or Ryan Weathers would qualify, but their strong showings this spring have pushed their prices too high. So we'll go with one of the team's top prospects, a catcher who was the centerpiece of the Jazz Chisholm trade last summer. Ramirez hit .267/.358/.487 with 25 homers and, notably, 22 steals across 126 games between Double-A and Triple-A last season. I get the feeling the Marlins would prefer Ramirez start the season in Triple-A, but Nick Fortes and Liam Hicks shouldn't be any kind of roadblock if Ramirez proves he is ready. He has top-10 potential at the position, and could especially be a difference maker in Roto if the speed is real.  

Honorable mention: Deyvison De Los Santos, 1B -- The Marlins have already sent De Los Santos down to minor-league camp, so he won't break camp with the team. They'll cycle through Quad-A types like Matt Mervis, Kyle Stowers, and Jonah Bride to start the season, but we should see De Los Santos before too long. He hit 40 homers with a .294/.343/.571 line as a 21-year-old across Double-A and Triple-A last season, and could be a Jake Burger clone if things work out right.  

Durbin was getting, frankly, irresponsible levels of hype from some in the Fantasy Baseball community earlier this offseason, but that doesn't seem to have gone anywhere. He's an interesting player, a 5-foot-7 speedster with a lift-and-pull approach to hitting that generated 10 homers in 90 games last season despite pretty limited raw power. This type of prospect tends to get the bat knocked out of their hands by MLB-caliber pitching, and he's struggled this spring, making his chances of breaking camp with the club look pretty slim. But if he does, his speed makes him a perfect fit for an aggressive Brewers club, and there could be some mild five-category appeal.  

Honorable mention: Abner Uribe -- The Brewers have plenty of late-inning options even after trading Devin Williams – keep an eye on Craig Yoho, who has been striking out everyone this spring – but I'll just remind you that everyone was very excited about Uribe this time last year, and there's still impact upside in the late innings if he gets a chance.  

Matthews' ankle injury in his most recent start hurt his chances of breaking camp with the big league club, but he's definitely a name to watch after seeing a velocity jump this spring. He has elite command – 2.7% walk rate in the minors – but probably lived in the zone too much in his nine MLB starts, leading to a massive 6.69 ERA. You can mitigate that by throwing out of the zone more to try to generate whiffs, or you can mitigate it with better stuff – which is why the velo jump is interesting here.  

McNeil tried a weird trick last season as he was mired in the middle of a slump that threatened to cost him serious playing time on a contender: He just started swinging harder! He hit .289/.376/.547 in the second half, and while I don't think he's suddenly a power hitter or anything, it was a sign that there is more life left in McNeil's bat than you might think. As a cheap source of batting average in Roto leagues, you won't find many better options.  

Honorable mention: Brandon Sproat, SP -- It looked like Sproat might force his way to the majors last season before he finally hit a rough patch at Triple-A. The stuff looks awesome, and with the Mets' pitching depth already tested by injuries to Frankie Montas and Sean Manaea, he could be a few good starts at Triple-A from getting the call.  

Rice is less interesting having lost his catcher eligibility, but with Giancarlo Stanton (elbows) out for at least the start of the season, he still has a path to pretty consistent playing time. It didn't work out for him last season – he bopped a few homers, but hit just .171 in his 50 MLB games – but his pull-oriented swing from the left side should still make him a 20-plus homer threat in Yankee Stadium. As a CI in deeper leagues, there's some appeal here.  

Wilson is one potential better option for batting average in the later rounds than McNeil. He hit just .250 in 28 MLB games last season, but still struck out just 9.7% of the time – after he put up Ted Williams-esque numbers in his minor-league stint last season. There are at least plus hit tool abilities, and he creates more damage with his contact than someone like Nick Madrigal did. It's still not guaranteed to work out thanks to his below-average raw power, but he should be able to clear the .100 ISO marker that looked like a cliff to Madrigal. There could be a Luis Arraez-esque ceiling here.  

Painter isn't going to be in the majors until the summer at the earliest, but the Phillies just don't have many options for this exercise, so he'll have to do – even long-shot closer candidate Orion Kerkiering is going inside the top 400, one of 15 Phillies in that range. Painter might be the most talented pitcher in the world who hasn't made his MLB debut, and I'm including Roki Sasaki in that discussion – I'll take Sasaki, but it's close – and he could be a must-start pitcher as soon as he makes his debut.  

The Pirates are also short on viable candidates for this exercise, though I will note I considered Endy Rodriguez, Henry Davis, and Nick Yorke before settling on Hayes, a long-time favorite of mine. Hayes' skill set completely collapsed last season, but at his best, he combines plus contact skills and plus raw power, with flashes of putting that power into action in games. Hayes has dealt with recurring lower back injuries over the past two seasons, but if he's healthy, I still think there could be 15-15 upside with a good batting average here.  

Ornelas is still fighting for a corner outfield spot on the Padres roster, and he's doing everything he can this spring, hitting .370/.469/.630 with just two strikeouts in 12 games entering play Monday. He hit 23 homers with a .297 average in Triple-A last season and could be a factor if the Connor Joe/Jason Heyward experiment goes sideways.  

Ryan Walker is going to open the season as the Giants closer, but one reason I'm less bullish than most on Walker as a breakout candidate is because Doval is still there, looming. He struggled badly last season en route to losing the job to Walker, but Doval was an All-Star who led the NL in saves in 2023, and if he can get back to that level, Walker might not have nearly as much job security as you'd prefer. We saw it didn't take much for Doval to lose his job last season, so a couple of poor outings in a row for Walker could put Doval right back into the closing mix. And we know he's talented enough to run away with that job.  

The Mariners are a tough team to do this exercise for, so I'll go with a veteran bounceback candidate. Crawford followed up his best season with his first in 2024, so this one is mostly a low-cost bet on Crawford getting back to being a standout in OBP and runs. He still walked plenty last season, and while he isn't slated to hit leadoff to open 2024, he could get back there if Victor Robles struggles. The upside isn't terribly high here, but Crawford could certainly be a viable middle infielder in the right circumstances.  

The Cardinals never stopped producing interesting talents; they just haven't been very good at finishing them off. Scott looked like a potential difference-maker entering last season, but he fell flat on his face both in his MLB stints and at Triple-A, where he hit just .210/.294/.303. Maybe his slap-and-dash skill set got exposed in the high minors, but I remain intrigued by his speed and contact skills and will be adding him anywhere I can in Roto leagues if it looks like he has a shot at the MLB roster. 

Mead's numbers through eight spring games are hilarious: .714/.750/.905. It's amazing what 20 pounds of muscle can do for you. Mead is a career .292/.371/.499 hitter at Triple-A, so now it's time for the Rays to let the 24-year-old see what he can do in the majors with consistent playing time. It's always tough to earn an everyday job as a lefty in Tampa, but with what he's doing this spring, they may have no choice.  

Honorable mention: Chandler Simpson, OF -- ""What if we put Luis Arraez's hit tool into the fastest player in professional baseball?"" Simpson is trying to prove he can be the answer to that question coming off a season where he hit .355 with a minuscule 8.5% walk rate while stealing 104 bases in 110 games – that's not a typo, I swear, I double-checked. Again, this type of profile tends to struggle against higher-level pitching, but Simpson might be the kind of outlier who can make it work.  

Leiter was a disaster at the MLB level, but he showed some real promise at Triple-A before that, sporting a 3.51 ERA and 33.3% strikeout rate. He's throwing harder this spring, has added a sinker and a changeup, and is pitching quite well so far. Probably not well enough to make the rotation without an injury, but it's an open question whether he or Kumar Rocker would get the first opportunity when one inevitably arises, and Leiter is a lot cheaper.  

Roden is generating some hype this spring after hitting .293/.391/.475 across the high minors last season. There probably isn't a significant ceiling here, but he could be playing his way into serious playing time with a good approach at the plate (12.1% walk rate, 14.2% strikeout rate) and 15-15 potential.  

I've written a bunch about Soroka this spring, and while I still think he's primarily an H2H points option, there's potentially some upside here for deeper categories leagues. He showed real upside in a multi-inning relief role last season after switching to a four-seamer/slider focus, and now he's throwing harder this spring. If he can sustain that, Soroka might be a legitimate option in 2025.

The Dallas Cowboys showcased some of their selective aggression on the opening day of the NFL's legal tampering period by signing a replacement for free agent running back Rico Dowdle, who became the first undrafted running back in franchise history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in 2024. 

Owner and general manager Jerry Jones is signing Denver Broncos running back Javonte Williams to a one-year, $3 million contract, per NFL Media. Williams, who turns 25 years old on April 25, can earn up to $3.5 million with incentives as a Cowboy. His single-game career-high in rushing yards (111 on 17 carries) came his rookie year (2021) in Week 9 against Dallas at AT&T Stadium, his new home turf. 

The 2021 second-round pick out of North Carolina flashed early, but his brutal knee injury, in which he tore his ACL and LCL in 2022, has prevented him from growing into a game-changing running back. Williams' 4.4 yards per touch across the last four seasons is the third-fewest in the NFL (minimum 750 touches) and ahead of only Ezekiel Elliott's 4.1 and Najee Harris' 4.3 in that span. He was the Broncos' leading rusher in 2024 with 513 yards and four touchdowns on 139 carries (3.7 yards per carry), but that production wasn't anything remarkable. 

Perhaps Dallas is hoping that as more time that passes between now and that 2022 knee injury, more of his electric running ability will return. At a minimum, now the Cowboys don't have to reach for a running back with the 12th overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft with Williams on board. He should receive plenty of carries in 2025 with new head coach Brian Schottenheimer looking to prioritize the run game like his former boss and mentor Pete Carroll does.

The PGA Tour season is beginning to pick up steam, and with the 2025 Players Championship fast approaching, the key question everyone's asking is the same across the golf world: Who are you picking to win at TPC Sawgrass? With a tremendous field featuring most of the best golfers in the world in attendance, we should be in for an epic ride beginning with Thursday's first round.

While The Players does not hold a ""major championship"" designation, but it's nevertheless a huge event on the annual golf calendar as the PGA Tour's flagship tournament. The $25 million purse and $4.5 million winner's share is more than will be payed out at the Masters, PGA Championship, U.S. Open or Open Championship this year.

Scottie Scheffler, the defending Players champion, enters with plenty of momentum from another dynamite 2024, though his start to the 2025 season has been less than ideal. Collin Morikawa has been playing incredible golf of late, but he fell back Sunday at the Arnold Palmer Invitational to relinquish a lead he held for the better part of two rounds. Tiger Woods will not be in attendance at TPC Sawgrass, though Rory McIlroy will be looking to put his best foot forward with one month to go until he competes for the elusive green jacket at Augusta National Golf Club.

So, what is going to happen this week in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida? Let's take a look at a full set of predictions and picks from our CBS Sports experts.

Patrick McDonald, golf writer 

Winner -- Collin Morikawa (14-1): The Arnold Palmer Invitational loss may still sting, but Morikawa will get right back onto the horse and ride into the winner's circle after traveling a few hours North. The two-time major champion was sensational from tee to green at Bay Hill, and that will carry over to TPC Sawgrass where his blend of accurate driving and pinpoint iron play will allow him to rise to the top of the leaderboard. His Players Championship history is mixed, but he has a number of quality rounds under his belt. Given the way he is trending, he should be able to string four together this week.

Sleeper -- Justin Rose (150-1): The former world No. 1 can still keep up with the big boys on golf courses that require more than just physical skill. One of the best course managers in the game, Rose will rise to the challenge that is TPC Sawgrass like he has many times in the past. The Englishman has two top-10 finishes and two missed cuts since the tournament moved to March drawing parallels to his current season where he has two top 10s (Pebble Beach and Bay Hill) and two missed cuts (both at Torrey Pines).

Top 10 lock -- Scottie Scheffler: What's throwing me off the scent of Scheffler to take home the title is the level of difficulty involved in winning any golf tournament three years in a row, let alone the Players Championship where Scheffler became the first ever to successfully defend with his title last season. The world No. 1 figured out the big stick at Bay Hill where he led the field from off the tee and the rest of his game is now beginning to follow suit. His poor putting at Arnie's Place may introduce some questions, but his tee-to-green game is good enough to finish inside the top 10 without the aid of a cooperative flat stick.

Star who definitely won't win -- Justin Thomas: There have not been many to win The Players twice, and Thomas isn't going to add his name to that list (at least not this year). While the tee-to-green presence is strong, there are still some holes in his game -- big misses off the tee, big numbers on the scorecard and short misses on the greens -- especially when the test ramps up. Since his 2022 PGA Championship victory, Thomas has one top 10 (2024 PGA), six missed cuts and no other finishes inside the top 30 in the majors or The Players.

Surprise prediction -- Jordan Spieth contends: His Players form stinks, but something is clicking at the moment. Spieth continues to drive the ball effectively, and while his iron play can come and go, he is making putts again -- something he was not doing from 2022-24. A top-10 finish at the WM Phoenix Open was not all too surprising given his history at TPC Scottsdale, but another such result at PGA National in his debut appearance was more than welcomed. 

Lowest round: 64 (-8)Winning score: 268 (-20)Winner's Sunday score: 68 (-4)

Josh Mullenix, Early Wedge producer

Winner -- Scottie Scheffler (5-1): His start to 2025 has been a little turbulent by his standards, but he still has three top 11 finishes in four starts. He's going to make someone else stare him down and win the tournament, something only Stephan Jaeger has done the last two years. TPC Sawgrass will make the winner hit three to five well executed golf shots on Sunday down the stretch, and no one executes better than the World No. 1.

Sleeper -- Daniel Berger (55-1): He's done nothing but bank top 25 finishes since the RSM Classic in November. After a missed cut at the Farmers Insurance Open where the putter let him down, he's gaining across the bag and just finished T15 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational despite opening with a 78 on Thursday. It's his first Players Championship in three years, but he finished among the top 15 in both 2021 and 2022. One thing is for sure about Berger: He has the confidence to win this week and his game suggests the same. 

Top 10 lock -- Collin Moriakwa: There's a clear closing problem with Morikawa -- look no further than Bay Hill last Sunday. But that's basically his only problem at this juncture. He leads the PGA Tour this season in strokes gained tee to green and is a measly sixth in approach. As one of the best iron players in the world with the driving accuracy to hit from the fairway all week long, it's hard to see him not banking a quality finish. I just highly doubt he'll figure out how to win again with the pressure of TPC Sawgrass' closing stretch staring him in the face.  

Star who definitely won't win -- Patrick Cantlay: The golf world is perpetually underwhelmed by Cantlay even though last week's T31 was just his second finish outside of the top 25 since last year's Memorial Tournament. However, he also finished outside the top 30 at Pebble Beach. He's battling a different thing every week; lost strokes with the putter and off the tee at the Arnold Palmer, the short game was bad at the Genesis and the putter disappeared at Pebble Beach. Before that he started the year with some shaky iron play. More than anything, Cantlay isn't going to win this week because Cantlay doesn't win anywhere. We are now 933 days removed from his last victory at the 2022 BMW Championship.

Surprise prediction -- Two of the six betting favorites will miss the cut: The volatility of success at The Players is one of the reasons this tournament is so fun. Every year, past champions and big names find the water one too many times and miss the cut. Two of Scheffler, Morikawa, Thomas, Rory McIlroy, Ludvig Åberg and Tommy Fleetwood will not even play the weekend. Maybe McIlroy brings a wayward driver like he did last year. Thomas's putter is nonexistent. Åberg's short game and approach is a little sloppy. TPC Sawgrass is primed to turn little imperfections into a weekend off, even for the best in the field.

Lowest round: 64 (-8)Winning score: 272 (-16)Winner's Sunday score: 70 (-2)

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Acbssports.com","Gerrit Cole injury: Seven ripple effects for Yankees and others as their ace gets Tommy John surgery","https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/gerrit-cole-injury-seven-ripple-effects-for-yankees-and-others-as-their-ace-gets-tommy-john-surgery/","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 01:22:00 GMT","

It is the worst-case scenario for the New York Yankees and ace Gerrit Cole. Cole, the 2023 AL Cy Young winner, will have Tommy John surgery on Tuesday, the Yankees announced Monday evening. Cole experienced soreness in his elbow following his March 6 start and tests revealed the tear in his UCL. He will miss 2025 and, given the usual 14-18 month recovery, the start of 2026 as well.  

""There's no script for this. In any sport, injuries happen,"" Yankees righty Clarke Schmidt said this past weekend (via MLB.com). ""You have to make adjustments. There's no set plan in stone when you show up to spring training. The inevitable injuries are going to pop up. Sometimes when it rains, it pours a little bit, but we know we'll be able to weather the storm. I think that's why we play 162 games.""  

There is no sugarcoating it. Losing Cole is a devastating blow to a Yankees team that lost the World Series last year and Juan Soto in the offseason, and wants to get over the hump in 2025. He is on the short list of the best pitchers in baseball and I don't think it would have surprised anyone if Cole had come out and won another Cy Young this year. Guys like that are irreplaceable.  

Here are the ripple effects Cole's Tommy John surgery will have on him, the Yankees, and the rest of baseball.  

Cole turned 34 in September and that is on the older side for a first-time Tommy John surgery. For a lot of pitchers, Tommy John surgery at that age is a career-ender. Cole is not most pitchers though. He's starting at such a high talent baseline and is so smart and so cerebral that he's earned the benefit of the doubt when it comes to remaining effective into his mid-to-late 30s.  

Perhaps the best comparison for Cole is Justin Verlander, his former Houston Astros teammate. Verlander's elbow gave out in July 2020, during his age-37 season. He missed 2021 while rehabbing, then won the AL Cy Young in 2022, and helped the Astros win the World Series. The Yankees would sign up for a similar outcome with Cole no questions asked. Alas, it's not that simple.  

Here are the last few starting pitchers other than Verlander to have Tommy John surgery at age 34-plus, and then return to MLB:  

Hyun-Jin Ryu 

June 18, 2022 				 				

4.55 ERA in 196 IP 				 				

3.46 ERA in 52 IP 				 				

Bronson Arroyo 

July 14, 2014 				 				

3.88 ERA in 288 IP 				 				

7.35 ERA in 71 IP 				 				

Jason Marquis 

July 30, 2013 				 				

4.66 ERA in 245 1/3 				 				

6.46 ERA in 47 1/3 IP 				 				

Arroyo and Marquis were basically done after Tommy John surgery, though, in terms of pitching style, they were nothing like Cole. Ryu pitched effectively with his new elbow ligament, then returned to Korea once his contract expired. This list doesn't tell us much about what to expect from Cole when he return. It just shows how rare it is for a starter this age to have his elbow rebuilt.  

Several relievers Cole's age have had Tommy John surgery and returned to pitch well (David Robertson, etc.), but I would not count on the Yankees sticking him in the bullpen anytime soon. Jacob deGrom, now 36, returned from Tommy John surgery late last year and is heading into his first season back. That was his second Tommy John though, and the second carries more risk than the first.  

The Yankees will hope Cole returns as effective as his pal Verlander was in 2022. In terms of talent and pedigree and pitching style, Cole is certainly closer to Verlander than Arroyo and Marquis. Bottom line, every pitcher is a different person. Tommy John surgery is fairly routine -- ""routine"" -- but it is still a major surgery. Until Cole gets back on a mound, we just don't know.  

In addition to Cole, the Yankees also lost reigning AL Rookie of the Year Luis Gil to a lat strain this spring. He will be sidelined until at least late May or early June. Gil was terrific last year filling in for Cole, who missed the first two-and-a-half months of the season with a nerve issue in his elbow. Between Cole and Gil, the Yankees are down 275-300 good to great innings now. Maybe more.  

This is New York's rotation depth chart at the moment:  

It goes without saying now that Fried and Rodón must carry the load at the front of the rotation for the Yankees. They're the veterans with nine-figure contracts. Fried joined the Yankees on an eight-year, $218 million deal this past offseason. That is the richest contract ever given to a lefty. Rodón is entering Year 3 of his six-year, $162 million contract.  

Rodón's first two years with the Yankees were a mixed bag. He was hurt and ineffective in 2023. In 2024, he did not miss a start and mostly pitched like a mid-rotation starter, with several stretches where he was quite a bit better. Fried almost seems underrated -- his 141 ERA+ since 2019 is second best in baseball behind, well, Cole and his 143 ERA+.  

The Yankees signed Fried with the intention of pairing him with Cole in a short postseason series. Cole's injury changes things, and now the Yankees need Fried and Rodón to be the veteran stabilizers who allow manager Aaron Boone to get a good night's sleep two out of every five days. This is why these guys make the big bucks. To carry the team in times of crisis.  

Because losing Cole and Gil is not enough, the Yankees also will be without Giancarlo Stanton to begin the season. He is dealing with ""severe"" soreness in both elbows and is trying to avoid surgery that he said would be season-ending. The Yankees do not have a timetable for Stanton's return. He is receiving treatment and they're hoping for the best. It's possible he misses 2025, too.  

Stanton is no longer the hitter he was in his prime, but the guy hit 27 homers in 114 games last season, and has averaged 41 home runs per 162 games the last three years. Stanton can still change the game with one swing in any at-bat. It's a presence you can not easily replace. Without Stanton, New York's regular lineup figures to look something like this: 

Bellinger's swing is tailor-made for Yankee Stadium's short right-field porch, though the lineup drops off quite a bit after him, and even more after Chisholm. Goldschmidt is 37 and last year's issues with fastballs point to an aging hitter. Domínguez, Rice, Volpe, Cabrera ... who knows? Full of potential, all of them, but the Yankees need production, not potential.  

After losing Soto, the Yankees pivoted to run prevention and improved their rotation (Fried), bullpen (Devin Williams), and defense (Bellinger and Goldschmidt). The risk with building around run prevention team is you're vulnerable to pitcher injuries, and now Cole and Gil are hurt. The offense is not as imposing as last year without Soto. Regardless, the Yankees need their bats need to give their arms as much support as possible.  

The Yankees have not yet announced who will replace Cole in the rotation -- Opening Day is still more than two weeks away, they don't have to rush into anything -- though Warren is the odds-on favorite. He is New York's most MLB-ready pitching prospect. Last year's 10.32 ERA in 22 2/3 innings was ugly, but Warren's not the first rookie to struggle in his first taste of the big leagues.  

Warren, 25, has had a great spring while showcasing an improved changeup and a revived curveball as he looks for a way to keep lefties in check. Baseball America ranked Warren the Yankees' eighth-best prospect entering 2025, and said he ""fits as a classic innings-eater at the back of a rotation.""  

Gil beat out Warren for a rotation spot when Cole got hurt last spring and he did exactly what you hope a rookie will do when he steps in for an injured veteran. He had a fantastic season and won Rookie of the Year. Cole's injury opened the door for Gil last year. Now another Cole injury has opened the door for Warren. This is his chance to establish himself as an MLB starter.  

The timing of Cole's injury really could not be worse for the Yankees. Tommy John surgery comes with a 14-18 month rehab these days, meaning he will miss the start of 2026. One setback and there's a chance he misses 2026 as well. Furthermore, March is not a great time to need pitching. Free agency has been picked clean and few teams are willing to trade arms in spring training.  

Here's our look at the free agent and trade options available to the Yankees. Veteran innings guy Kyle Gibson is best available on the free agent market. Big names like Sandy Alcantara and Dylan Cease may be available in trades, but, if they are, there will be bidding wars, and the Yankees do not have a great farm system. They may not have the prospects to complete a significant trade.  

In all likelihood the Yankees will go into the season with what they have, and GM Brian Cashman will keep his ear to the ground for potential trades during the season. That's an unsatisfying answer, I know, but that is the reality this time of year. Decent pitching is hard to find, let alone impact pitching. The Yankees will see what's out there. Chances are, it ain't much.  

Entering spring training, the case could be made the Yankees were the best team in the American League even after losing Soto. That probably isn't the case after the Cole, Gil, and Stanton injuries. Whatever margin of error they had has been exhausted, and Opening Day is still two weeks away. Every team deals with injuries. Few get hit as hard in spring training as the Yankees have.  

With every new Yankees injury, the more the AL East door opens for the Baltimore Orioles and Boston Red Sox. It's simple math. Baseball is a zero sum game, there are only so many wins to go around, and every win you subtract from New York's roster via injury is a win available to the O's and Red Sox. At minimum, the injuries drag the Yankees further down the standings.  

The Orioles and Red Sox aren't healthy either, it should be noted. The O's will be without Kyle Bradish (elbow), Andrew Kittredge (knee), and Grayson Rodriguez (elbow) to start the season. The Red Sox won't have Wilyer Abreu (willness), Brayan Bello (shoulder), and Kutter Crawford (knee). Tough injuries, all of them, but not quite the same as losing Cole.  

The difference between Cole and his replacement could be on the order of 4-5 wins and that is plenty enough to swing the AL East race. It might even be enough to knock the Yankees out of the postseason, though three wild-card spots and a watered-down AL work in their favor. Point is, the AL East looks to be much tighter and more competitive than it was a few weeks ago.  

Looking further down the line, the injury will cut into Cole's Hall of Fame case. He is 47 wins short of 200 and 749 strikeouts short of 3,000, two milestones that would strengthen his case, and now he'll miss an entire season and part of another. Add in the time lost to the pandemic in 2020, and Cole's career totals will not be as impressive as they could have been had he stayed healthy.  

Starting pitchers are already held to a ridiculously high standard during the Hall of Fame voting process, a standard that was set decades ago. Voters have been slow to adjust even though teams ask less of their starters with each passing year. Cole is certainly one of the top starters of this generation, but he's not going to get to 300 wins, and now he might not reach 3,000 strikeouts either.  

Again, this is something to think about further down the road. Cole's contract runs through 2028, then there's the five-year waiting period before joining the Hall of Fame ballot. Cole's a decade away from Hall of Fame eligibility, give or take, and who knows what the voting body will look like then? The injury certainly won't help his case though. He has less time to strengthen his case now.

Let's face it: a lot has happened, both on and off the field, since we last saw a meaningful baseball game -- back on Oct. 30, when the Los Angeles Dodgers closed out the New York Yankees to win the World Series. Thankfully, a new Major League Baseball season is now just around the corner, with the Dodgers and Cubs slated to kick off the year with the Tokyo Series, a two-game set in Japan on March 18-19. MLB's traditional Opening Day will follow on March 27.

With precious time to spare, we here at CBS Sports thought it would be prudent to provide a refresher course on the offseason's biggest moves. Below, we've done just that by ranking and analyzing the 10 best players who changed MLB teams over the offseason -- be it through free agency or trades. Do note that we've omitted Dodgers right-hander Roki Sasaki from this exercise since the focus is only on players who were already with an MLB organization. 

Got it? Good, let's get down to business.

Soto, a fixture on everyone's shortlist for the title of ""best hitter,"" changed New York teams over the winter after signing the richest contract in the sport's history (15 years, $765 million). His generational wealth is merited. He's a 26-year-old who is very much on a Hall of Fame trajectory thanks to the interplay between his discerning eye, his elite strength, and his feel for the barrel. Soto isn't as blessed defensively, but the Mets will live with that component of his game provided he keeps stacking up 30-homer, .400-OBP seasons. Spoiler alert: He will.

The Diamondbacks improved their chances of returning to the postseason for the second time in three years by inking Burnes, a former NL Cy Young Award winner, to a six-year pact worth $210 million. He'll round out a rotation that now looks significantly stronger and deeper on paper than Arizona's recent iterations. To wit, Burnes compiled at least 190 innings and a 125 ERA+ in each of the last three campaigns. His odds of running that to four were fortified late last season, when he made some corrections to his cutter that boosted the pitch's effectiveness.

The Cubs traded for Tucker from the Astros ahead of his walk year. Who knows what the long-term future holds here, but in the short run, he could help deliver Chicago's first NL Central title since 2020. Based on statistical output alone, Tucker is one of the dozen or so best players in the sport. He's a well-rounded talent who contributes across the board -- notching quality triple-slash marks; hitting 25 to 30 homers a year; swiping nearly as many bags; and playing Gold Glove-caliber defense in a corner -- albeit without necessarily topping any leaderboards. 

Crochet enjoyed one of the sport's biggest breakout seasons in 2024, posting a 115 ERA+ and a 6.33 strikeout-to-walk across 32 appearances in what served as his first year as a big-league starter. Credit his ascent to both a rare clean bill of health and an improved arsenal (he added a cutter). The Red Sox acquired him from the White Sox in exchange for a prospect package to fortify the front of their rotation. If Crochet can stay healthy, that gambit should pay off. 

The Red Sox started the offseason with one splash (Crochet) and ended it with another, in the form of Bregman's three-year pact worth $120 million. (The deal includes opt-outs and deferrals and all that fun stuff.) Bregman's position is still to be determined, with incumbent third baseman Rafael Devers publicly stating his unwillingness to move to DH to accommodate Boston's new star. Bregman, for his part, seems open to playing at second base, and in our estimation he should possess the athleticism to make that work in due time. Offensively, he seems to have found one of the few optimal fits that exist for his game outside of Houston.

Snell, a two-time Cy Young Award winner, continued his tour of the National League West by joining the defending World Series champions on a five-year contract worth $182 million. Everyone knows his deal by now. Snell racks up a ton of strikeouts and misses oodles of bats and barrels, all the while handing out his fair share of walks and averaging just over five innings per pop. It's not a recipe that everyone will enjoy, but it is one that has resulted in a career 128 ERA+ all the same.

Another talented left-handed starter, Fried (and his eight-year, $218 million contract) was part of the Yankees' pivot after losing out on Juan Soto. He's been one of the best pitchers in baseball for a while now, amassing the highest ERA+ among left-handed starters since 2020 (min. 200 innings). Fried's game is based around limiting the quality of contact he surrenders and generating tons of ground balls. That combination served him well during his eight years in Atlanta, and there's no reason to think he'll find anything but success now that he's moved to New York.

Adames served as the first big free-agent of the Buster Posey Era in San Francisco, with the two parties agreeing to a seven-year deal worth $182 million. He's coming off a season that saw him set career highs in both home runs (32) and stolen bases (21). The Giants can only hope that he continues to feature that kind of dynamic offensive skill set moving forward. Alas, there is some real risk here since Adames reliably punches out more than 25% of the time. Another risk factor worth monitoring: the public-facing defensive measures also disagree on how good his glove is anymore. 

At one point this offseason, the Yankees found themselves with a glut of starters and in need of some late-inning help (closer Clay Holmes and setup man Tommy Kahnle left through free agency). Sensibly, they leveraged the former to address the latter, turning lefty Nestor Cortes (and a prospect) into Williams. When Williams has been healthy (and mind you, he was limited to 21 innings last year), he's been one of the best relievers in the sport. He's averaged more than 14 strikeouts per nine innings during his career, thanks in part to his signature ""Airbender"" changeup. Williams is entering his walk year, meaning that his production and his wellbeing this season could position him to challenge Josh Hader's record (five years, $95 million) for reliever contracts.

As noted above, Cortes was the main return in the deal that sent Williams to the Bronx. (The Brewers also landed infielder Caleb Durbin, who has a chance to help them this season as a pull-happy right-handed batter with wheels.) Cortes, too, is embarking on his final campaign before free agency. He's finished with a 105 ERA+ or better in three of the last four seasons, making him a nifty and valuable addition to the Brewers rotation.

Well, I hope you enjoyed that. The Champions League might not get any better than this between now and Munich. Over three and a half hours, there was nothing to settle the two best teams in the field but a battle of nerves from 12 yards out.

It was those of Darwin Nunez and Curtis Jones that crumbled, the top seeds crashing out of a competition that they had seemed strong favorites for right the way through the group stage. For all the difficulties that Paris Saint-Germain have just given them, this result should do nothing to disabuse anyone of the idea that Liverpool really could have won the Champions League. If Gianluigi Donnarumma were a bit shorter, if Nunez had gone a little higher or lower, they would thoroughly merit the favorites tag.

Over the course of this tie, the better team won. PSG's pinnacle in the first leg was exhilarating, and into the final moments, it was Luis Enrique's men who looked the fresher and more likely to find the winner. Still, the fact that some form of justice was done through the medium of penalties does not mean that Liverpool were anything other than unfortunate to have been drawn with one of this competition's gold-plated contenders.

It might be said that Liverpool rode their luck in the first leg. It might equally be said that they have employed the best goalkeeper in the world for nearly seven years, precisely so that when Khvicha Kvaratskhelia rained fire on their goal, Liverpool did not buckle. Anyway, some of the fortunes that came their way in the Parc des Princes was redressed in the first 90 minutes at Anfield. The expected goals (xG) might paint a picture of Parisian dominance but when Ousmane Dembele taps into an empty net from three yards out, your xG is going to look a little inflated.

Certainly, there were moments for the visitors but there was a whole wave of them for Liverpool too, starting with a slightly too nonchalant finish by Mohamed Salah, blocked to safety by Nuno Mendes, and ending with the Donnarumma defiance, setting the stage for his shootout heroics. 

""After 90 minutes, it felt clear to me that we deserved more than to be 1-0 down,"" said Arne Slot. ""We played the perfect game and didn't score.""

There will be time for Slot to pick the holes in his side's performances across the two legs. He will certainly need more of it than many might expect. The simple reality is that if Liverpool had met most of the field in the last 16 they'd have been cruising through, even allowing for their wobble early in the tie. Only the best could beat this team. Perhaps that is what PSG are.

Even if they were never behind in the tie until the shootout, Slot has been obliged to be the more reactive coach. For 45 minutes, his side were cooked as English league leaders are not supposed to be at this stage of the competition, at least not when they have not had a case of the Pep Guardiola galaxy brains. In the Parc des Princes, the Liverpool boss made the necessary adjustments that would quell PSG's incursions into the penalty area. Alisson might still have had to make some more outstanding saves -- the 17 that he ended this tie with is more than Arsenal's David Raya has made across the entire 2024-25 Champions League -- but they were off stunning strikes from range.

Liverpool would never have considered such caution in front of the Kop. It was to Slot's enormous credit that one of the first big tests of his European credentials as manager of this club saw his side play in a fashion that looked so redolent of his predecessor. In the first half in particular, the hosts were more of a Jurgen Klopp team than they had often been on many occasions in the last few years.

The remorseless aggression of their press meant that for the first 10 minutes, neither Dembele nor Bradley Barcola had a serious sniff at possession. The red wall forced PSG deeper and deeper, the high turnovers coming with remarkable frequency. Liverpool looked bigger, stronger and more mobile.

Such ferocity meant taking risks, the sort that Klopp would be more at ease with than Slot has seemed to be so far in his tenure. A bit of caution went out of Liverpool's game as they went hunting for possession and that meant abandoning coverage of the central space in front of the back four. Dembele only needed to spot it once, darting into the space like a true false nine, slipping Barcola through with a fine pass and sniffing out a poacher's chance when Ibrahima Konate had no choice but to dive in front of a cross.

Liverpool were not really taken out of their stride by the tie's equalizer. They were still prepared to gamble on Barcola piercing their high line, as the game wore on they slowed down the intensity but tightened their grip. A tight offside by Diogo Jota just before Trent Alexander-Arnold forced a string of chances that resulted in Dominik Szoboszlai turning the ball in, more excellent blocks from the obdurate Willian Pacho: any of these moments could have broken the Reds' way.

After 120 grueling and fruitless minutes, the fear will rightly be that this defeat will bleed into Sunday. Of all the neutrals entranced by this, few could have been crying out for one more minute of stoppage time, a few more penalties as loudly as those of a Newcastle persuasion. It will take a great deal for Slot to physically and emotionally raise his players for Sunday's EFL Cup final. Trent Alexander-Arnold's status must be in serious doubt after he was forced to limp off with what appeared an ankle injury. The best-case scenario for Ibrahima Konate might just be a cramp. He won't be the only one feeling the exertions of Tuesday for days to come.

If this does indeed become the week when a treble becomes 'just' a title then, it may lead to a curious tale being told about Liverpool's season, a sense of missed opportunity given the procession that the Premier League has become. That would be harsh indeed on Slot, who proved himself to be more than capable of adapting to the demands of a high-grade European tie. On another occasion, it might have swung their way, just as it might PSG's in those early exchanges. That is what made this a true clash of titans, one that would have been worthy of deciding any stage of this competition. It is only a pity that we will not get to see these two go at it again.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Acbssports.com","Najee Harris signs with Chargers: Fantasy football fallout, plus Javonte Williams to Cowboys, more free agency","https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/najee-harris-signs-with-chargers-fantasy-football-fallout-plus-javonte-williams-to-cowboys-more-free-agency/","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 03:30:34 GMT","

Najee Harris and Javonte Williams have new homes, and a couple of other free agent running backs are on the move. Fantasy managers should benefit from some of the deals that were announced Monday.

We'll start with Harris, who improved his Fantasy value by agreeing to a one-year deal with the Chargers for up to $9.25 million. This was one of the best landing spots for any running back since J.K. Dobbins and Gus Edwards are free agents, and Harris can now be the featured back in Los Angeles.

The Chargers can still select a running back in the upcoming NFL Draft, which could change Harris' Fantasy value. But if it's not someone with an early-round pick then Harris should be considered a No. 2 Fantasy option worth drafting as early as Round 5 in the majority of leagues.

During his time with the Steelers, Harris hasn't been explosive, but he's been consistent with four years in a row of at least 1,000 rushing yards and six touchdowns. He's also averaged at least 12.0 PPR points per game in three of four seasons, and he has three years on his resume with at least 36 receptions. 

Dobbins led the Chargers last season with 195 carries for 905 yards and nine touchdowns and 32 catches for 153 yards on 38 targets in 13 games. Edwards added another 101 carries for 365 yards and four touchdowns and three catches for 6 yards on five targets.

Dobbins averaged 14.8 PPR points per game for the Chargers, and hopefully Harris can fill that role. The nice thing about Harris is he has never missed a game and only has three fumbles in his career.

He's going to play behind a solid offensive line, and Jim Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Greg Roman want to run the ball. This is a great destination for Harris, and he might be in line for his best season since his rookie campaign in 2021 when he averaged 17.7 PPR points per game.

Williams going to Dallas on a one year deal for $3 million is also an upgrade for his Fantasy value -- if he gets the chance to start. But the Cowboys will likely add another running back in the NFL Draft or potentially bring back Rico Dowdle, who is also a free agent.

If Williams is No. 1 on the depth chart then he'll be a low-end No. 2 running back in the majority of leagues worth drafting in Round 7 at the earliest. Williams struggled to regain his pre-ACL tear form prior to getting hurt in 2022. He averaged 11.2 PPR points per game in 2023 and 9.7 PPR points in 2024 while playing for the Broncos. 

But Williams, who turns 25 in April, did average 12.1 PPR points per game as a rookie in 2021, and hopefully he can regain that form with the Cowboys. And the nice thing that Sean Payton did for Williams in Denver was highlight his receiving skills with 52 catches for 346 yards on 70 targets last season, and Williams could end up playing on passing downs in Dallas if another running back of prominence is added.

Two other signings of note so far are Elijah Mitchell to the Chiefs (one-year, $3.5 million) and Samaje Perine to the Bengals (two years, $3.8 million). I like both of these moves, especially Mitchell to Kansas City.

Mitchell missed his entire 2024 campaign with San Francisco after undergoing hamstring surgery last August, and he's struggled to stay healthy during his tenure with the 49ers. But he's had some standout games when given increased touches, including his rookie season in 2021 when he averaged 15.0 PPR points per game.

Kareem Hunt is a free agent, and Mitchell could be the No. 2 running back for the Chiefs behind Isiah Pacheco. Last season, Pacheco missed nine games with a broken leg suffered in Week 2, and he struggled upon his return in Week 13 through the playoffs.

Pacheco is still expected to be the starter, but we'll see if another running back is added in Kansas City for competition. However, if this is the only running back of note added for the Chiefs then that's great news for Pacheco, who is worth drafting in Round 5, while Mitchell should be selected with a late-round pick as the handcuff.

In Cincinnati, Perine will compete with Zack Moss to be the No. 2 running back behind Chase Brown, but Perine could be the third-down back for the Bengals even if he's not the direct backup. Perine did little with the Chiefs in 2024 with 20 carries for 92 yards and a touchdown and 28 catches for 322 yards and a touchdown on 35 targets.

He spent three years in Cincinnati from 2020-22, and his best season was 2022 when he averaged 8.9 PPR points per game. At 29, he's not going to make much of a Fantasy impact unless Brown were to miss any extended action.

Hopefully, no other running back of significance is added for the Bengals, which is great news for Brown. He had a breakout season in 2024 when he averaged 15.9 PPR points per game, and Brown is worth drafting in Round 2 in the majority of leagues.

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. -- PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan announced Tuesday that the league will begin implementing new pace-of-play policies starting next month. The rule change will first be introduced on the Korn Ferry Tour and PGA Tour Americas; it will include the assessment of stroke penalties for slow play violations.

Following the Masters, the PGA Tour itself will test a new policy allowing players to use distance-measuring devices during six tournaments between the year's first and second majors, the latter being the PGA Championship. The PGA of America currently allows competitors in the PGA Championship to use such devices. The PGA Tour also plans to publish player specific pace-of-play statistics later in the year.

Justin Thomas said making such data public would ""definitely"" be effective in helping curb pace-of-play issues.

""It's something I've said, if we put [the data] in the locker room or put it out [public], which would obviously end up getting out, but nobody wants to be known as [a slow player],"" he explained. ""I'm the first to admit I'm on the slow side of players. It bothers me, but I've talked to many officials about it, like I want to know why I'm slow because obviously the first thing that any slower player thinks is that they're not slow.""

The PGA Tour's pace of play came under fire during the West Coast Swing when the final group at The American Express took 5 hours, 40 minutes to complete its final round. One week later at the Farmers Insurance Open, a similar pacing issue occurred and drew further criticism.

Potential solutions were laid out during the week of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am by the PGA Tour, including the use of distance-measuring devices, increasing use of the video review center to expedite rulings and publishing pace-of-play data with accountability for slow players.

""After talking to some guys, I think you just have to start ... giving guys actual penalties, whether it be strokes or FedExCup,"" Collin Morikawa said. ""What I've learned is that monetary fines are useless. We make so much money, and some guys frankly could care less about -- I don't know how much the fines are, but whatever X amount they are, and I think they care more about playing good golf and making sure they make the playoffs and making sure they make, you know, 70, 50, 30. That's where it hits hard. 

""And I see no issue with it. I think what is there to hide, right? If you're slow, you know you're slow. I mean, if you don't know, then there's an issue. To me, there's no issue with letting it out, right? It's only going to make things better because then you're either going to have a target on you, put a little more pressure and hopefully you pick it up, or you get penalized. Like it's very simple.""

This past fall, the PGA Tour chose to adopt sweeping changes to its membership structure including the downsizing of tournament fields. One of the aims of this decision was to alleviate the pace-of-play problem on the PGA Tour. Although early returns were minimal, the league has seen improvement in recent weeks thanks to smaller fields and the utilization of twosomes.

""It's easy to identify the problem,"" Monahan said. ""It's a little bit harder to find the solution, just given the depth and breadth of everything that goes into pace of play. But we are committed to finding the right solutions and making progress on that front.""

The Boston Celtics have been without Kristaps Porzingis for the last six games, including Monday night's win over the Utah Jazz, as the big man has been dealing what he described as a ""viral illness"" that the team hasn't ""been able to fully identify yet.""

Porzingis last suited up on Feb. 26 when the Celtics lost in Detroit and has been listed as out with a ""non-COVID illness"" ever since. 

""I have been dealing with some viral illness that we haven't been able to fully identify yet,"" Porzingis posted on social media on Monday. ""I am recovering and getting better. But still working my way back to full strength to help this team. Thanks for support and Im hoping for a healthy return soon.""

Porzingis sat with the team on Thursday for Boston's win over the 76ers and went through warmups on Saturday prior to Boston's win over the Lakers. Porzingis was listed as questionable for the Lakers game and doubtful for Monday night's matchup with Utah, which the Celtics won, 114-108. 

Before Monday's game, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla told reporters that Porzingis is ""getting close"" to a return. Last Thursday, Mazzulla said Porzingis has been going to the team facility to get shots up ""every day,"" but hasn't been feeling well. 

Porzingis missed the first month of the season after undergoing offseason ankle surgery. Since his return, he has averaged 18.9 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.6 blocks in 32 games played. 

The Celtics have gone 5-1 over this latest stint without Porzingis, so there's no real reason to rush him back to action before he's ready. The Celtics, now 47-18, are basically locked into the No. 2 seed -- eight games back of No. 1 Cleveland and five up on No. 3 New York with 17 games remaining.  

The priority is the playoffs. Boston just needs to make sure Porzingis is right by then.

Barcelona, Bayern Munich Paris Saint-Germain and Inter have all booked their spots in the Champions League quarterfinals. PSG needed a penalty shootout and two saves from Gianluigi Donnarumma were enough to push them through to the quarters. It was level 1-1 on aggregate after regulation thanks to a goal from Ousmane Dembele but even with PSG being away from home at Anfield they didn't have an issue with the pressure that they faced. From Vitinha's stutter-step take to beat Alisson to Desire Doue's eventual winning penalty it was a clinique in penalties form Luis Enrique's team putting a dent in Liverpool's magical season to date.

With Raphinha grabbing a brace and Lamine Yamal becoming the youngest player ever to score and assist in the same Champions League game at 17 years and 241 days old, all Hansi Flick needed was a half to put this tie out of reach. Barcelona is a contender to win the entire tournament and for good reason after their strong performance versus Benfica. Harry Kane became the first English player to score 10 goals in a Champions League season with a goal and an assist in Bayern Munich's 2-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen while Inter took care of business in a 2-1 victory over Feyenoord.

Doue hits his pen and Donnaruma comes up big with two saves to end this.

Liverpool: ✅

PSG: ✅

PSG nails their first penalty with a confident take.

It's the first ever Champions League shootout for them as Alission gets ready.

There were chances for both sides to win the match but now it'll be decided from the spot with two top goalkeepers in net.

This could be quite something if he slips up during penalties.

Mohamed Salah went down in the box following a challenge from PSG in the box but there wasn't enough contact to draw a penalty.

Alisson is again there when needed which is so impressive considering Dembele's shooting skill. You never know where he'll strike the ball from but you don't get more in form than Alisson currently.

Harvey Elliott has now entered for Szoboszlai but neither team will want to lose this with only 13 minutes between them and a shootout. 

Both teams have had chances in extra time but neither keeper has been tested so far. Liverpool will earn a corner but Nuno Mendes is in pain which could be a blow after he's had a massive game. 

Curtis Jones is on for Alexis Mac Allister and Warren Zaire-Emery has entered for Fabian Ruiz.

Both teams have secured 1-0 victories away from home and with nothing to separate them, there will be at least 30 minutes more of soccer to come. Both teams have only made two changes so far so there will be plenty of space for more in extra time.

If Liverpool advances, he'll be suspended for their next match but the foul was needed to stop Dembele from scoring so he'll be okay with that.

Liverpool's throwing everything but the kitchen sink forward in this match as it continues. No one wants extra time but with PSG having made fewer changes, they'll at least have more potential for fresh legs if we get there.

Darwin Nunez and Jarell Quansah have entered the match for Diogo Jota and Trent Alexander-Arnold as Liverpool looks to avoid extra time in this clash. It's tense at Anfield. 

Aggregate score: Bayer Leverkusen 0, Bayern Munich 5

Harry Kane became the provider as Leverkusen's defense collapsed allowing Alphonso Davies to score. This was already out of reach but now it's ugly. 

With his finish, Kane has become the first English player to score 10 goals in one Champions League season. 

Aggregate score: Inter 4, Feyenoord 1

Initially, a free kick was given but after a review, the Feyenoord foul was judged to be in the box. Hakan Calhanoglu wouldn't miss his chance and Inter restored their aggregate lead. 

Aggregate score: Bayer Leverkusen 0, Bayern Munich 4

This one is done and dusted with Harry Kane hitting the back of the net continuing his European dominance finishing off a Joshua Kimmich free kick.

After picking up a yellow card in the second half, if PSG advances to the quarter finals, they won't have Marquinhos available for the match.

As things stand we're on track for extra time between Liverpool and PSG with Inter and Bayern Munich advancing. Can the second half of action change that?

Feyenoord has now cut the aggregate to two goals scoring only the second goal against Milan during their entire UCL run.

This Liverpool match has been played at an absurd pace with 13 shots and four on target from both sides. So far PSG has the advantage with Liverpool unable to take their shots when they fall but this could flip quickly in a first half that feels like another goal is coming.

Aggregate score: Liverpool 1, PSG 1

This time it's Ousmane Dembele after an unfortunate intervention from Ibrahima Kounate allowed Dembele and PSG to go coast to coast and level this match on aggregate. This is getting tasty at Anfield. 

Aggregate score: Inter 3, Feyenoord 0

It didn't take long for Inter to add an insurance goal via Marcus Thruam with quite a strike. Inter playing a natural fullback on the left is already playing dividends with Carlos Augusto getting the assist there.

The 2025 PGA Tour continues to ramp up as the 2025 Players Championship is set for Thursday at TPC Sawgrass. Known for its iconic 17th hole ""Island Green,"" this course will host a vast majority of the top players on tour this week, including 48 of the top 50 players in the OWGR. The latest 2025 Players Championship odds list Scottie Scheffler, the defending champion, as the +360 favorite. 

Rory McIlroy (+800), Collin Morikawa (+1600) and Xander Schauffele (+1600) are some of the other top Players Championship contenders teeing it up. In addition to picking the outright winner, there also PGA odds for top-five, top-10, head-to-head and more to consider this week. Before making any 2025 Players Championship picks, check out the PGA picks from SportsLine's proven golf model.

Built by DFS and betting pro Mike McClure, this model is up nearly $9,000 on its best bets since June of 2020 and has called 13 majors winners heading into the weekend. 

Now that the 2025 Players Championship field is locked in, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times. Here are the three best bets, according to the model:

Fleetwood has been efficient this season, finishing T22 or better in all three events he's played, all against strong fields. His best finish was a T5 at the Genesis Invitational. Slow starts have held him back as he's shot 71 or higher in the first round in all three events. Otherwise, he has just one round over 70 in Rounds 2-4 all season. He has elite strokes gained metrics this season, including ranking fourth in in both tee-to-green and approach-the-green, and the model has identified him as a top-five contender this week, making him a value at 30-1 at FanDuel Sportsbook:

The 15-time PGA Tour winner has been in a win drought since 2022, but he's getting close to a return to the top of a leaderboard. Though he took a slight step back with a T36 last week at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, he's also finished T9 or better three times already this season. If you're not ready to back him as an outright winner (+2000) yet, the top-five market still brings a big return for Thomas this week at +500, which you can get at Caesars Sportsbook.

The top-20 market has some more wiggle room and is a good fit if you're looking to go more conservative than winner or top-five. Here, the model is very comfortable with Matsuyama, who returns +110 and finishes ninth on the projected leaderboard. Matsuyama won the The Sentry to open the season and also recorded top-20s at the Sony Open and the Genesis Invitational. He ranks sixth on tour in strokes gained, making him a strong choice for the plus-money return. 

You've seen the latest best bets from the model. Now, see the full Players Championship leaderboard, including forecasted finishes for Scheffler, McIlroy and more. Visit SportsLine to see the projected leaderboard, all from the model that's nailed 13 golf majors, including the last three Masters and three majors in 2024.

The San Francisco 49ers are going to look a lot different in 2025. They've lost 10 starters this offseason, including their No. 2 edge rusher Leonard Floyd on Tuesday. 

That has Dallas Cowboys All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons, who has lost twice in the postseason to the 49ers in the first two years of his NFL career (2021 and 2022), tweeting with glee on Tuesday.

""No more rookie QB lol welcome to reality!"" Parsons posted on Tuesday after seeing news of Floyd's release. Parsons was referring to 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy entering the last year of his rookie contract in 2025, making him due for a major extension. The Cowboys are paying their own quarterback Dak Prescott an average annual salary of $60 million on a four-year, $240 million deal, which is the highest average per year salary in NFL history. 

Both San Francisco and Dallas need to start hitting on their draft picks and not just in the early rounds. That would help them make the leap back to NFC contender status with young, cheap talent while paying their respective quarterbacks at top of the market rates after both missing the postseason in 2024.

The new collection of MLB hats from New Era raised some eyebrows, and not just because of their curious designs. The Texas Rangers have already pulled their hat from shelves because of an unfortunate translation error.

On Monday, New Era dropped their ""Overlap"" series, which features MLB team names behind the primary logo. This created clunky and awkward aesthetics for most teams, but the Rangers had a bigger issue.

This hat collection for Major League baseball this year is certainly interesting... pic.twitter.com/dL59SjQlwk

The primary ""T"" logo was centered directly over the ""X"" in ""Texas."" Instead of repping the Rangers,  the hat simply spelled out vulgar term for breasts in Spanish.

According to The Dallas Morning News, the Rangers have since pulled their hat from the team store on account of the spelling mishap. Texas is the only team that's had to yank its hat out of the storefront, but there are some other unfortunate designs in the mix. They just don't spell out vulgarities in other languages.

This is now the second year in a row that an MLB team has been forced to shelf a hat due to a spelling gaffe. In 2024, the A's rolled out an ""ASS"" hat. We can only hope that 2026 will also bring some headwear hijinks courtesy of MLB.

Filed under:

Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek has already spoken to Grand Canyon's Molly Miller, sources confirmed to SB Nation. The Razorbacks are in the market for a women's basketball coach after Mike Neighbors resigned.





After eight years coaching at his alma mater, Mike Neighbors is out at Arkansas. Multiple sources confirmed to SB Nation that Neighbors and Arkansas were parting ways, and the Razorbacks officially framed his dismissal as a resignation on Tuesday afternoon.

The Razorbacks will owe Neighbors a buyout of north of $1 million. He came back to Fayetteville a year after taking Washington – then led on the court by WNBA All-Star Kelsey Plum – to the Final Four for the first time ever. But Neighbors was never able to reach that level of success with the Razorbacks.

He had three strong campaigns between 2019 and 2022, but the NCAA Tournament was canceled in 2020 and the Hogs were bounced in the first round of 2021 and 2022. Arkansas was left on the wrong side of the March Madness bubble in 2023, and Neighbors had a 9-23 record in SEC play over the past two seasons.

Overall, Neighbors went 148-114 at Arkansas, got the Hogs ranked as high as No. 10 in the AP Top 25 Poll, produced two WNBA Draft picks, and went to two NCAA Tournaments. But this season – where Arkansas had a 10-22 record, a winning percentage of .313 – was its worst since 1981.

Neighbors was not hired by current Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek in 2017 – back then, Jeff Long was still in charge of Hogs' athletics – but Yurachek did hand him an extension through 2028 in 2021.

Yurachek has been mulling over firing Neighbors for the past week, since Arkansas fell 79-74 to Georgia last Wednesday in the SEC Tournament. Multiple sources confirmed to SB Nation that Yurachek has already spoken to one potential candidate in Grand Canyon's Molly Miller, who is also expected to be in the mix for openings at Arizona State and Missouri.

While Miller is a Missouri native and currently coaches just a stone's throw away from Arizona State, Arkansas has the money. Neighbors' annual salary made him the eighth-highest paid coach in the SEC and he made more than both Robin Pingeton and Natasha Adair – the previous coaches at Missouri and Arizona State.

Miller, 38, is set to coach Grand Canyon on Wednesday in the WAC Tournament at 3 p.m. ET in Las Vegas, Nevada. She guided the Lopes to a 29-2 overall record in the regular season – with two Power 4 wins – and a perfect 16-0 mark in conference play. She's 114-37 in five seasons at Grand Canyon and went 180-17 during her time as a Division II head coach.

If Arkansas is unable to land Miller, here's who might be next in line:

A longtime assistant for Vic Schaefer, at Mississippi State and now at Texas, Lovato is widely respected in coaching circles and has a lot of experience as a head coach and assistant at different levels. In addition to helping Schaefer's teams reach high levels of success, Lovato was the head coach at Division II Arkansas-Fort Smith and led her team to the Division II NCAA Tournament in her second season. She also has a record of 113-8 as a junior college head coach and won two NJCAA National Championships. Lovato knows the SEC, knows how to win and knows the recruiting terrain around Arkansas.

It doesn't seem like Harper is going to get the Missouri gig, but she could be the right fit for Arkansas. Between four stops as a head coach – Western Carolina, N.C. State, Missouri State and Tennessee – Harper has a 60.2 winning percentage, nine NCAA Tournament appearances and five conference championships under her belt in 20 seasons on the sidelines. She took Missouri State to the Sweet 16 and helped turn it into a mid-major power, and led the Lady Vols to the second weekend of March Madness twice. Arkansas hasn't been to the Sweet 16 since 1998. While Harper didn't meet expectations at Tennessee, she's shown the ability to win consistently at a high level.

While this seems like a longshot on paper – and indeed, the jump from the Southland to the SEC is a big one – there is a connection between Guzzardo and Yurachek: when she was finishing her playing career at Akron, he was there as the executive senior associate athletics director. There's at least a small chance that they know each other. After the SE Louisiana Lions had losing records in 22 of their last 24 seasons, Guzzardo has guided them to five straight winning campaigns. Additionally, SE Louisiana's lone NCAA Tournament berth came under her watch in 2023, and she's eyeing a second bid to the Big Dance this week as the Southland Tournament begins. The Lions are the top seed in it after winning the regular season title.

Filed under:

These teams got much, much better on Monday.

One of the funniest things about the NFL is how the league still openly uses the term “legal tampering period.” It's inaccurate, makes no sense, and sounds far more nefarious than “negotiation period.”

These teams don't care what it's called, because they went into Monday with a lot of holes to fill, and immediately went about making huge moves that push their teams closer to either being competitive, or may have done enough to get over the hump and into contention. In no order, these are the teams who absolutely killed it on the first day.

It would have been really difficult to mess up free agency when you're the team that had over $120M in cap space to play with. Still, the Patriots showed serious restraint in not just signing players willy-nilly, but targeting key guys who can drastically assist one of the worst teams in the NFL in 2024.

Milton Williams is a massive win for the defensive line. For a while there were reports that Williams was shockingly headed to Carolina, but in the end the most obvious scenario was the outcome, with one of the best defensive players in free agency landing on the team with the most to spend. Williams is a plus-level pass rusher, and a guy who can collapse the middle of the pocket — taking pressure off edge rushers. He's young, wins one-on-one, and is the kind of difference maker this team needs.

It will be fascinating to see what New England does in the NFL Draft after signing Carlton Davis. A favorite to select Travis Hunter in April, Davis gives the Pats a tremendous cornerback duo with Christian Gonzalez. This could either signify that New England views Hunter as a primary wide receiver, part-time corner — or that they'll go in a different direction. Either way it was a brilliant signing landing Davis, an elite man corner.

It wasn't all perfect. Harold Landry was a definite overpay, but it can be forgiven because the organization made some other wily signings like Morgan Moses and Mack Hollins that were both added for fair market value, and can operate as bridges until the team finds youth through the draft.

This was a home run of a day for the Pats.

I love a team that has an identity and builds to it. The group of signings the Bears made on Monday have Ben Johnson's fingerprints all over them. Chicago is an organization that now understands the trenches are what wins football games, and built to that ideal in free agency.

Part of winning the day centers on deals already made. Trading for Jonah Jackson and Joe Thuney filled two massive needs on the offensive line, and adding Drew Dalman continued that trend. Protection for Caleb Williams is more or less set now, and that's a mammoth win — but it wasn't all Chicago has done.

While not as impressive as the work on offense, the additions of Grady Jarrett and Dayo Odeyingbo give much-needed teeth to the pass rush. It might be a touch hopeful to think that Jarrett can still perform at a high level, but overall this was a great tandem to put together.

If this is all for the Bears in free agency it's a massive win and this team should take leaps, not steps forward in 2025.

This definitely wasn't the sexiest free agent haul of the day, but it was a pure football nerd series of signings by new GM James Gladstone and HC Liam Coen — targeted, and intentional.

The team made a duo of signings on the offensive line in Patrick Mekari and Robert Hainsey. Both excel in pass protection, with Hainsey in particular being one of the best, most-underrated pass blocking centers in football. Making Trevor Lawrence's life easier in a priority, and the team gets that.

The secondary got a big lift too with Jourdan Lewis and Eric Murray. Lewis is a huge impact nickel back and this should cause major headaches for opposing quarterbacks that like to go three-wide at receiver — especially the Texans, who represent the Jaguars' biggest threat in the south.

Despite these moves my favorite might be the sneaky signing of receiver Dyami Brown. He will perfectly fill the role Christian Kirk had as a deep threat, but is much cheaper, more reliable, and better in a Coen offense.

The Bucs lost some pieces, sure — but this is about what they kept. Tampa Bay managed to retain Chris Godwin when many assumed he was going to be lost to another team, and added Haason Reddick as a pass rusher. 

When you combine these two deals with the team retaining OG Ben Bredeson, it positions the Buccaneers as one of the few playoff teams that managed to get better, while the vast majority of established winners retracted.

This is a testament to the culture in Tampa Bay that GM Jason Licht has cultivated. Players, especially stars, want to stay with the Buccaneers over chasing other opportunities. Few teams are able to accomplish this without drastically over-spending, but the Bucs keep finding ways to stay competitive while getting market value deals.

These teams blew it in NFL free agency.

NFL Free Agency is underway with the majority of top names agreeing to deals with teams during the legal tampering period. A lot of deals are being made as we speak, so this is by no means a finished product — but already we're getting a sense of who took strides forward, and which teams are stuck spinning the tires.

There are a lot of ways to “lose” during free agency. This can simple be the act of being forced to let talented players walk due to salary cap constraints, or overpaying players to the point where it's going to hurt teams in the future. Today we dive into the organization who either had no choice but to sit on their hands during the legal tampering period, or who made some terrible moves.

What are the Titans thinking? Correction: I don't know if the Titans know what they're thinking.

It takes a special amount of talent to be the worst team in the NFL and still find a way to get worse in free agency, but here we are. The Titans entered Monday with almost $60M in salary cap space, and still found a way to botch this process.

A lot of that centers on the horrific signing of Dan Moore Jr. It's expected that bad teams have to pay a premium to attract top talent, but Tennessee uniquely found a way to overpay a bad player to astronomical levels. Moore has been reviled by Steelers fans for years due to his terrible play and turnstile work at offensive tackle, yet the Titans seemingly missed this memo.

Tennessee signed Moore to a 4 year, $82M deal which was indicative of a weak talent pool at OT. That doesn't mean the Titans had to make this deal though, and they played themselves.

Moore wasn't in our list of Top 50 free agents. According to Pro Football Focus he was graded as the 46th-best offensive tackle in 2024, and allowed a league-high 12 sacks on the year. When you consider the fact this team is now paying a sub-par offensive tackle MORE money than Ronnie Stanley got from the Ravens it hurts even more — because Stanley is drastically better in every way.

There is a reason bad tams stay bad, and making free agent deals like this is the reason. Could the Titans somehow bounce back and salvage this period? Maybe a little, but the Moore signing is just so bad that it casts a shadow over everything else they do.

At this point it's fair to question whether or not the Texans have a plan. All Houston had to do was keep pouring gasoline on the fire after exploding as one of the hottest young teams in the NFL in 2023 — instead it's just been a series of steps backwards. 

Monday was marred by loading up on mediocre, fringe receivers like Braxton Berrios and Justin Watson, which comes after trading for another mediocre receiver in Christian Kirk. It's unclear what the organization thinks these guys will really add, but that wasn't remotely the worst move of the day by Houston.

Inexplicably the team chose to trade Pro Bowl LT Laremy Tunsil to the Washington Commanders for draft picks. It's the kind of move you see established winners with veteran rosters and plenty of depth make, not a team that struggled with protection last year and only had one decent pass blocker: Laremy Tunsil.

The Texans feel like a rudderless ship offensively. They're making moves and sawing at the wheel, but nothing is happening. Even without massive amounts of cap space this team needed to be trying to find value upgrades for its offensive line in free agency, not trading away its best player and loading up on receivers.

Houston is repeating the same mistakes the Bengals made when it came to Joe Burrow, and it's a damn shame.

I absolutely understand the superficial frustration fans were beginning to have with Geno Smith and the lack of offensive production, but this ain't it. Cutting Tyler Lockett was a necessary pain point. Being backed into a corner and having to trade D.K. Metcalf was rough.

To do those things AND THEN sign Sam Darnold to a $100M contract defies belief. Brass tacks there are serious, serious problems with moving forward with Darnold at QB: 

Now you're throwing him in with Jaxson Smith-Njigba as your only receiver, and hoping magically that Klint Kubiak can fix 20 different issues on offense with one wave of his hand. It's just not a recipe that spells success.

Is there a way it can work? Sure, but getting this right feels like trying to thread a needle from a satellite while in orbit. Apollo 13 taught me there's no margin for error.

This is a problem the Cowboys brought on themselves. We knew Dallas wasn't going to be a big player in free agency because of their ongoing cap issues, but God is this bad.

Dallas went 7-10 this season. Their moves to improve this team? Well, they signed Javonte Williams, and that's pretty much it. 

Every player who could improve the team is now gone. Every target who Dallas had interest in has committed elsewhere. All they can do is pick over the dregs like vultures when free agency is almost closed.

It was not a good day for the Cowboys.

Here are the best players remaining on the NFL free agent market.

The first day of the NFL's legal tampering period has come and gone, and day two is upon us.

After Monday's flurry of moves, who are the best available players? 

While the opening of the tampering period generates the most buzz, the days that follow are where rosters are truly built, and games can be won. For teams — and their fans — still looking for moves, here are some names to watch.

Cooper did not put up huge numbers for the Buffalo Bills last season, catching 44 passes for 547 yards and four touchdowns while struggling with drops. But he would still add talent to any wide receiver room, and put up big numbers during his 2023 campaign where he hauled in 72 passes for 1,250 yards and five touchdowns.

Samuel was placed on injured reserve early last season with a shoulder injury, but is just 25 years old and put together two solid seasons in 2022 and 2023. That youth and potential are going to serve him well in free agency.

Acquired by the Vikings at the trade deadline, Cam Robinson helped solidify the Minnesota offensive line as they pushed for the top seed in the NFC. With questions about the incoming tackle class in the draft, there should still be several teams interested in his services.

Stefon Diggs is working his way back from an ACL tear he suffered in November, although there are reports he will be ready for training camp. He caught 47 passes for 496 yards and three touchdowns a season ago over eight games, which brought to an end a streak of six consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. 

After starting out at tackle Teven Jenkins seemed to find a home kicking inside to guard. He's started 40 games over his career, but with the Chicago Bears completely rebuilding their interior offensive line, he'll be looking for a new home.

After dealing with injuries early in his career, Levi Onwuzurike has put together two solid seasons the past two years with the Detroit Lions. During the 2024 campaign Onwuzurike generated 45 quarterback pressures, according to charting data from Pro Football Focus, and teams looking for interior pressure would be wise to give him a look. 

Josh Myers was the starting center the past three years for the Green Bay Packers, developing into a solid option for the team at the heart of their offensive line. He allowed just a single sack during the 2024 season, according to charting data from Pro Football Focus, and would be a solid option for teams looking for help on the interior.

Over the past few seasons the Detroit Lions built one of the best offensive lines in football, and Kevin Zeitler was a big reason why. His skillset, particularly in the running game, may be highly desirable for many teams as the running game comes back into vogue. While his is on the older side, teams in a competitive window would be smart to give him a call. 

Several cornerbacks found new homes on Monday, but Rasul Douglas is perhaps the best option left at the position. Douglas has at least four interceptions in each of the last three seasons, and has broken up at least seven passes in six of his seven NFL campaigns. Those skills at the catch point should find him a home relatively quickly. 

Azeez Ojulari has dealt with injuries throughout his young career, which has limited his production off the edge. He has only completed one full season in the league, his rookie campaign back in 2021 when he recorded eight sacks, and over four seasons of limited action he's recorded 22 total sacks. 2024 was set to be a breakout season for him as he recorded six sacks over the first eight games of the season, but another injury cut his campaign short. Still, teams looking to bolster their pass rush might be smart to give him a look.

The madness before the madness is upon us. 

With first round action kicking off in the ACC and Big 12 tournaments on Tuesday, the madness of Championship Week is on the verge of enveloping all of us. 

Here are four things that could make this week even madder than most. 

When you hear the term “bid thief” this time of year, you typically think of a conference like the Atlantic 10 or the Missouri Valley; Ones where there is a team or two that are locks to make the NCAA tournament, and then everyone else is fighting to “steal” a bid from one of the at-large teams on the bubble. 

But the big boys can steal bids too. 

Multiple conference tournament winners from the old Pac-12 (RIP) were teams that were comfortably on the outside looking in at the field of 68 when Championship Week began. The Georgetown Hoyas won the 2021 Big East tournament despite beginning the week with a losing overall record. Just last year, NC State made an unbelievable five wins in five days run to claim the ACC tournament title and knock Oklahoma out of the Big Dance. 

So keep an eye out for someone getting hot in one of the power five tournaments this week and screwing everything up for a team that has been living on the edge for the last month. Actually, we can probably just call it the power four for this week, because unless LSU or South Carolina win the SEC tournament, we're almost certainly talking about a tournament champion that was already dancing. 

The most likely power conference to produce a bid thief? It has to be the ACC. 

Sure, Duke is incredible and has dominated the conference at a level rarely seen, but the ACC has not had a No. 1 seed win its postseason tournament since all the way back in 2018. If the Blue Devils get knocked off at some point this week in Charlotte, and anyone besides Louisville or Clemson cuts down the nets, the league's auto-bid representative is once again going to be a team earns a double-digit seed in the dance. 

Thanks in large part to the otherworldly strength of this year's SEC, Auburn has put together a historic NCAA tournament resume this season. 

The Tigers have a whopping 16 Quadrant-I victories, easily the most of any team in the country, and the most of any team since the NCAA went to the quadrant system. They are a combined 11-0 in games outside of Quadrant-I, they played the toughest schedule in America according to every metric, and they locked up an outright championship in the toughest league in the sport before the final week of the regular season even started. 

Understandably, there are plenty of people who made the claim that Auburn had locked up the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament before the calendar even flipped to March. 

They may have spoken too soon. 

As good as the Tigers have been, most advanced metrics utilized by the NCAA tournament Selection Committee believe Duke, at the moment, is better. The Blue Devils are No. 1 in the NET, No. 1 on KenPom, No. 1 in the BPI, and No. 1 on T-Rank. Duke has also lost just one time since last November, while Auburn dropped both of its final two regular season games. 

Oh yeah, and Duke beat Auburn head-to-head. 

Despite one of the strongest overall NCAA tournament resumes that we've seen in recent memory, if Auburn loses early in the SEC tournament and Duke takes care of business in Charlotte, there's a very real chance that the Tigers could be relegated to No. 2 overall seed status on Selection Sunday. 

Without question, one of the best stories of the 2024-25 college basketball season has been Rick Pitino and the St. John's Red Storm. The Hall of Fame head coach has injected life into the long dormant program from New York, leading the Johnnies to their first outright Big East regular season title in 40 years. 

St. John's is 27-4 overall and will begin this week's Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden as the 1-seed and clear favorite to win their first league tournament title since 2000. 

Let's take Pitino and all the hubbub about St. John's being back out of the equation for a moment. If you said that any team with any head coach had the potential to go into Selection Sunday as a dual Big East champion and with a 30-4 overall record, you would just assume that team was in the running for a No. 1 seed. At the very least, you would assume that team had locked up one of the top No. 2 seeds.

This may not be the case with St. John's. 

As stellar as the Red Storm's overall record may be and as sparkling as their No. 5 (coaches poll) and No. 6 (AP poll) national rankings are, they don't have the depth on their tournament resume that a lot the teams that they're jockeying for position with do. 

St. John's currently sits at No. 16 in the NET Rankings and has just four Quadrant-I wins. That's the fewest of any team in the top 20 outside of Gonzaga, which plays in the West Coast Conference and is projected at the moment to be a No. 8 seed. 

If St. John's wins the Big East tournament and earns a No. 2 seed, the Committee will have to justify it by invoking the infamous “eye test.” That will upset a handful of teams with more quality wins and better computer numbers. On the flip side, if St. John's wins 30 games before Selection Sunday and wins both Big East championships and doesn't earn a top two seed for March Madness, Pitino might stage a one man riot in the middle of Times Square. 

Both options are fun if you don't have any skin in the game. 

There are just two teams in the history of Division-I college basketball that have made the NCAA tournament by virtue of winning five games in five days to capture their conference tournament title. 

The first was UConn in 2011. Led by the unbelievable play of star guard Kemba Walker, the ninth-seeded Huskies made history with an incredible run that included a buzzer-beating win over top-seed Pitt in the quarterfinals, an overtime win over Syracuse in the semis, and a three-point win over Louisville to win it all. Walker and company then carried that success into the Big Dance, where they made a surprise run to claim the program's third national championship. 

Unlike UConn, last year's NC State team had no chance of making the NCAA tournament if it did't pull off a miracle run in its conference tournament. That's exactly what the Wolfpack did, winning five games in five days, a run highlighted by stunning upsets of in-state rivals Duke and North Carolina, as well as a thrilling overtime win over Virginia. The magic continued deeper into March as the Pack piled on four more victories, punctuated by another upset of Duke to send the program to its first Final Four since 1983. 

Championship Week is young, but we already have a team on the verge of joining UConn and NC State in the five-timers club. If they can get the job done and then match the success the Huskies and Wolfpack had in the Big Dance, well, it's safe to say it would be the biggest March Madness story of all-time. 

Delaware went into last Friday having lost six straight games to end its regular season, and 11 of its last 12. The Blue Hens (Blue Hens!) were ranked 267th on Ken Pom, were the 12th seed out of 14 teams in Coastal Athletic Association tournament, and were an extremely safe bet to not make it out of the weekend. 

Then, March happened. 

The Blue Hens (Blue Hens!) found their touch from the outside and squeaked out a first round win over 13th-seeded Stony Brook. Then they really found their touch from the outside. Delaware blasted 5th-seeded Campbell by 17, hung 100 points in a 22-point upset of fourth-seeded William & Mary, and then toppled top-seed Towson by 10. Now the only thing standing between the Hens and the NCAA tournnament is a Tuesday night tilt with second-seeded UNC Wilmington. 

The last time Delaware won five consecutive games over D-I opponents? December of 2023. Now, they're one win away from doing it in single five-game stretch on the biggest stage their conference has to offer. 

No one is saying pencil Delaware into your Final Four if they're able to get past Wilmington, but maybe bank on them advancing out of the First Four in Dayton.

The Golden State Warriors star is the latest high-profile investor for the new professional women's basketball league. 





Unrivaled, the new professional 3-on-3 women's basketball league co-founded by Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart, is wrapping up its inaugural season in Miami. The league promises the highest average salary of any women's professional sports league, in addition to offering players equity and revenue sharing. 

And, the day after its final regular season game, the league announced its latest high-profile investor: Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry. 

“I am incredibly proud to be joining the Unrivaled family as the league continues to set a new standard for how women's professional sports should operate—empowering athletes and ensuring they have a real stake in their own success,” said Curry. “Unrivaled is not just innovating the way we play basketball, but also how we value and invest in the athletes who drive the game forward.”      

We are absolutely thrilled to announce another champion has been added to the Unrivaled Investor family! Steph Curry is Unrivaled   pic.twitter.com/LIIjmEEGRV

Curry is the latest in a long list of investors to support the upstart league, a list that includes Alex Morgan and Trybe Ventures, Carmelo Anthony, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Coco Gauff, Michael Phelps, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, The Berman Family, Ann Sarnoff, Dawn Staley, Geno Auriemma, David Levy, John Skipper, Moira Forbes, Tyus and Tre Jones, Dan Rosensweig, and Gary Vaynerchuk, among others. 

In December, Unrivaled announced an oversubscribed, $28 million Series A investment round, in which Curry's investment was included. Prior to that, Unrivaled raised a $7 million seed round, totaling $35 million for the league to-date.

The 11-time NBA All-Star signed South Carolina star MiLaysia Fulwiley to Under Armour's Curry Brand, and became the first NBA player to compete against a WNBA player in last year's Steph vs Sabrina Three-Point Contest at All-Star weekend. 

“For MiLaysia, the way she carries herself — she's a basketball player on and off the court,” Curry said at NBA All-Star weekend, per Natalie Esquire. We see a lot of potential in her. She believes in what we're doing. She's been to my camps, obviously in South Carolina doing amazing things, winning a championship in her freshman year... as you build out your roster you want to have good people.”

Earlier this week, the NBA star also announced he'd be returning to his alma mater, Davidson, to serve as the assistant general manager of both the men's and women's basketball programs. 

The new league boasted more than 40 WNBA standouts, a list of stars that includes Ionescu, Collier, Stewart, Angel Reese, Brittney Griner, Kahleah Copper, Chelsea Gray, and dozens of others. The league put up its biggest viewership numbers for its 1-on-1 tournament, bringing in 377,000 viewers, and has since eclipsed 200,000 viewers six times, per Sportico. 

The total salary pool for players is $8 million, with the average salary coming in at $222,222. 

Postseason action will begin on Sunday, March 16th, and conclude the following night.

A hero was born in the Sacramento Kings' tremendous new ‘Perfect Pump' halftime game.

Who among us doesn't love the thrill of the perfect pump? I remember hearing about the perfect pump after getting my driver's license back in the mid ‘00s. There was nothing better than having $20 in your pocket and stopping the gas pump exactly on the number. If you missed, you had to scrounge up some change from the cup holder, or see if you had an extra single in your wallet.

Credit the Sacramento Kings for recognizing the delight of the perfect pump, and using it to come up with the NBA's best new halftime game. The worst kept secret in basketball is that March games don't really matter outside of some rare exceptions like the Nuggets-Thunder games the last two nights. In reality, the season is about 20 games too long, and most of the NBA's problems stem from it. I'll admit this is when I check out a little bit to cover March Madness before coming back just ahead of the playoffs.

During the dire part of the season, the Kings found a winner with their perfect pump halftime game. They also gave us a new hero. Watch the viral video of a local man crushing it at the pump. 

Tommy understands it.    pic.twitter.com/5zbrGFT3nq

The double thumbs up. The vintage Peja Stojaković jersey. It's all so good.

Hey, you can't book Red Panda every night. Props the Kings for coming up with a fantastic bit of halftime entertainment. And props to this gentleman for crushing it.

The Knicks beat the Kings, 133-104. At least Sacramento found one win on the night.

Milton Williams' huge NFL free agency bag from Patriots can reshape their defense

“I like to shop like everybody else,” New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel said about his team's approach to free agency at the NFL scouting combine in late February. 

“And so when you go and there's only one of a certain car, maybe you have to pay a little bit more for that one car, because there's only one of them. When you start to get into a range where you feel like there's an area where players are comparable, and you like three or four players in a certain area for a certain role, you may not have to overspend, but it's free agency. I think that everybody overspends in free agency sometimes.”

Vrabel also said that the Patriots would be aggressive, and that's played out so far – certainly on the defensive side of the ball. It didn't take long for the deals to come down. The Pats signed former Detroit Lions cornerback Carlton Davis to a three-year, $60 million deal with $34.5 million guaranteed, they signed former Tennessee Titans edge-rusher Harold Landry to a three-year, $43.5 million deal with $26 million guaranteed, and they signed former Las Vegas Raiders linebacker Robert Spillane to a three-year, $33 million deal with $20.6 million guaranteed.

And then, New England took the biggest and best defensive free agent off the market in the person of ex-Philadelphia Eagles defensive lineman Milton Willams in a deal that will reportedly average $26 million per year. Purely on an annual basis, that would make Williams the NFL's third-richest interior defensive lineman behind Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs, and Christian Wilkins of the Raiders. 

If you're not familiar with Williams' work, this may seem like an overpay, as Vrabel intimated his team may have to do. But Williams' tape screams otherwise. 

Back in 2022, Vic Fangio worked as a consultant for the Philadelphia Eagles between his stints as the head coach of the Denver Broncos (2019-2021) and as the defensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins (2023). Of course, Fangio became the Eagles' defensive coordinator in 2024, and it was his amazing game plans that gave Philly the NFL's best defense, and blew the Kansas City Chiefs apart in Super Bowl LIX. 

But back in 2022, there was one defensive player who left a major impression on Fangio: Milton Williams. That happened to the point where when Fangio moved to Miami, he tried to trade for Williams, and he was rebuffed. 

“Yeah, I like Milt. Milt is a good player,” Fangio said last August, just before that runaway Super Bowl season took place. “He's solid, both versus the run and in pass rush. He's a guy that from afar I've liked that the Eagles have had. In fact, I tried to get us to trade for him last year in Miami, but [executive vice president/general manager] Howie [Roseman] wouldn't do it. But I like Milt. Milt is a pro.”

It all turned out for the best in the end. Because Williams, who the Eagles selected in the third round of the 2021 draft out of Louisiana Tech, became a star in 2024 under Fangio's auspices. He was one of several defensive players who had career years with Uncle Vic, through various half-smart tape nerds had been all over Williams' potential from the beginning. 

I find Louisiana Tech DL Milton Williams to be a fascinating prospect. Someone gonna get a steal there. https://t.co/9U6lIkItBI pic.twitter.com/vVY65ZPI2i

While Williams was a solid player for the Eagles in his first three seasons, 2024 was indeed the breakout campaign. In 653 overall snaps and 418 pass-rush snaps, he totaled eight sacks, seven quarterback hits, 39 quarterback hurries, 16 solo tackles, 17 stops, nine tackles for loss, and two forced fumbles. Williams did this playing defensive tackle 90% of the time, nose tackle 2%, and on the edge the rest of the time. In that regard, he does fit the NFL's current requirements for gap versatility. Williams rotated a lot in Fangio's system because that's how Vic does it, and the Eagles had more than enough answers on the edge, but in another system where he might be a 70/30 tackle/edge hybrid guy, I think he'd be just fine. 

Milton Williams didn't line up outside the tackles a lot last season because he was so good inside, and because the Eagles had so many answers there, but you can see the potential for more with another team. pic.twitter.com/RF47pdCck5

As a three-tech tackle, Williams can get to the quarterback or running back in all kinds of evil ways. But let's start with how he was deployed as a supposed 4i linemen to the offensive tackle's inside shoulder. One might expect Williams to take on the offensive tackle there, but the Eagles would then have him laterally push to the offensive guard.

This did not work well for the offensive guard.

As a pure 3-tech tackle, where most tackles get most of their sack and pressure numbers, Williams is a major problem for opponents. He can shock guards with straight bull-rushes as well as he can jump a gap or to in order to send protection schemes into total confusion.

The Eagles famously didn't blitz the Chiefs once in Super Bowl LIX, which allowed them to send seven defenders into coverage over and over. That was as much a problem for Patrick Mahomes as the pressure was. But Philly did stunt their linemen 11 times, and that was a serious component of the pressure they were able to generate. Given Williams' athletic attributes, it should come as no surprise that he's outstanding when it comes to stunts and games. Anyone in Kansas City would certainly attest to that. 

The final piece of Milton Williams' pass-rush oeuvre is how well he works in stunts and games. It's a big reason the Eagles didn't have to blitz the Chiefs once, and they still got all that pressure in Super Bowl LIX. pic.twitter.com/LsdZhyYjwJ

Regarding Williams' run defense? It's not an alpha strength to this point in his career, but that's primarily because the Eagles had him going hell-bent after the quarterback most of the time. It's not always easy to reset in a split second when the run is going away from you. But there are more than enough plays to indicate the potential for improvement. 

And if we're worried about Milton Williams' run defense, let's remember the time he blocked Nick Allegretti with one hand, and tackled Austin Ekeler with the other. pic.twitter.com/kZMlJpQtyl

There's also the matter of the quick pressures the NFL's best interior defensive linemen are able to generate. With the league's increasing emphasis on RPOs and first-read passes out of zero- to three-step drops, your inside guys need to get to the quarterback quickly – it's one reason the inside guys are getting paid more and more. 

No matter where Williams was lined up (everywhere from 1-tech to the center's outside shoulder to 4-tech straight over the offensive tackle), he was outstanding in this regard. Per Sports Info Solutions, Williams generated two sacks and 21 total pressures against zero- to three-step drops on just 190 true pass rushes. That was the seventh-most pressures in the NFL among interior defensive linemen against quick passes, and the guys ahead of Williams on the list all had more pass-rushing reps – including teammate Jalen Carter, who had two sacks and 28 pressures on 319 rushes against quick passes. 

Since we brought up Carter, there's the alleged elephant in the room: Milton Williams could only do what he did because Carter was an absolute alien next to him, and without Carter, he's going to be ordinary. And the Patriots should have been cautious of the Carter Effect on Williams' play when deciding whether to make him one of the league's highest-paid players at his position(s).

It's a neat little theory. Too bad the tape doesn't back it up at all. With Carter off the field, Williams was the primary focus of opposing offensive lines, and that didn't go so well for them, either. 

What do these Milton Williams QB disruptions (and one REALLY obvious hold) have in common? They all happened without Jalen Carter next to him. So, let's bust that myth right now. pic.twitter.com/t4xjwnmXos

For all the reasons above, Milton Williams is now one of the NFL's highest-paid interior disruptors, and he's earned every bit of it. Now, the Patriots will benefit from his skill set. And when you imagine a New England front four consisting of Williams, Landry, Christian Barmore, and Keion White as the primary instigators, it's fair to say that opposing quarterbacks and ballcarriers won't appreciate it one little bit.

The Bears' NFL free agency haul fixed their biggest weakness and forged a new identity

The Chicago Bears as a franchise have always been known far more for stout and amazing defenses than they have been for revolutionary offenses. The “Monsters of the Midway” moniker always referred to the Bears' defenses from the eras of Bill George and Dick Butkus all the way up to the more modern times of Charles “Peanut” Tillman and Brian Urlacher. 

But now, with new head coach Ben Johnson in charge of things, the Bears' new “Monsters of the Midway” live comfortably along the team's interior offensive line. This was very much a part of a plan that began with the hire of Johnson, formerly the Detroit Lions' offensive coordinator, and it extended to not only improving, but outright flipping major parts of the front five as the analyzed needs arose. 

“We want a physical group,” Johnson said from the scouting combine in late February. “Alright? It starts with that. And that's not just the offensive line – that's the entire team. DA [defensive coordinator Dennis Allen] and I have been talking about what that looks like on defense. It's going to look that way on offense. It starts in the trenches up front. We talk about finishing in a dominant position. We want to be around the football. The best football players, they finish around the ball. So, that's what you're going to see from the five guys that we roll into. And it's not just going to be five. The last few years, it ends up being six, seven, eight, nine guys end up playing a significant number of snaps. So, we got to find those five best guys, but we also have to get a good bullpen, if you will, ready to go in at a moment's notice.”

As far as flipping the line with major changes, Johnson had no issue with that at all.

Yeah, I think it's been done before,” he said. “Right? I mean, there are a number of teams that did that last year. The Panthers come to mind when they went out in free agency and got a couple top guards, really changed the dynamic of their offense. You saw them clicking there in the second half of the season once they started to really gel. There's no question that you can change the dynamic of a room just like that. That particular room, it does take time for five guys to come together. Especially if you have to deal with attrition and injuries for five guys to be working on the same page. 

“When you watch the tape and you come away with… I think I made the statement in my opening press conference, that's an area we have to get better. That doesn't necessarily mean we need five new starters, because all it takes is one individual to blow up a play. And so we're just identifying where we can get a little bit better, and we're going to continue to raise that floor, and we'll find the right mix of five to eight, nine, 10 guys.”

Well, let's start with three. The Bears have officially flipped the entire interior of their offensive line with three major moves. The first move that took place happened on March 4, when Chicago traded a 2025 sixth-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Rams for guard Jonah Jackson. The Bears also took on the remainder of the three year, $51 million contract with $34 million guaranteed that Jackson signed before the 2024 season. 

That 2024 season didn't work out for Jackson or for the Rams in that regard. Jackson suffered a fractured scapula in September and was only able to play four regular-season games, and one snap in Los Angeles' divisional-round loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. 

What Johnson was likely looking at with this trade was how well Jackson had played for the Lions under Johnson's purview. Because in 2023, Jackson was a great guard in about every way you want a guard to be. 

Go back to Jonah Jackson's non-injury 2023 season, because that's what Ben Johnson and the Bears traded for/are paying for. Outstanding to the second level, on pulls, and at the LOS when battering tackles in the run game or pass-blocking. Not as agile as Thuney, but really good. pic.twitter.com/IGw3ZsjmQi

It took the Bears exactly one day to drop the next hammer; that happened when they sent a 2026 fourth-round pick to the Kansas City Chiefs for Joe Thuney, one of the best guards of his era, and a guy who had to fill in at left tackle down the stretch for the AFC champions when their left tackle situation fell apart. The Bears took on $16 million in salary cap with Thuney, as he's on the last year of the five year, $80 million contract he signed with Kansas City in 2021. Thuney is nobody's idea of an ideal left tackle, but as a pure guard, the 32-year-old has quite a bit left in the tank. 

Joe Thuney has been one of the NFL's best and smartest guards for quite a few years. Not a mauler per se; just a pitch-perfect technician. Can't say enough about what the Bears have done for their interior offensive line. pic.twitter.com/1jdw9bqO0l

Then, on Monday, the Bears took the best center on the open market off the open market in Drew Dalman, formerly of the Falcons. Dalman has a new three-year, $42 million deal with $28 million guaranteed. Like Thuney, Dalman is more technician than mauler, though he can get grimy when the need arises. 

Dalman can block anything, but he's really great on the move. The Bears have done massive work on their O-line in the last week. https://t.co/YOd7KMZ4TE

More importantly, both Dalman and Thuney have the intellectual chops to block up Johnson's run concepts, which were among the NFL's most varied and effective when he ran the Lions' offense. And Jackson will have no trouble remembering the entire playbook. 

Do the Bears still have some questions to answer at their tackle spots? Absolutely. Left tackle Braxton Jones allowed five sacks and 26 total pressures on 471 pass-blocking reps last season, right tackle Darnell Wright gave up six sacks and 30 total pressures on 662 pass-blocking snaps, and swing tackle Larry Borom got absolutely viced on both sides of the line in 2024, allowing seven sacks and 22 total pressures on just 237 pass-blocking chances. 

But Chicago also has the 10th, 39th, and 41st picks in the 2025 draft if they want to reinforce those positions early on in late April, and the free-agency additions of defensive linemen Grady Jarrett and Dayo Odeyingbo give Johnson and general manager Ryan Poles the flexibility to focus on other spots with the other side of the interior also bolstered in a very positive sense. 

So, the Bears' new Monsters of the Midway are indeed on the offensive side of the ball. We'll see how Ben Johnson, quarterback Caleb Wiliams, and the rest of that offense benefits, but based on the talent and the plan, the effects could be game-changing.

All athletes are a little off, but NHL players are certifiable. Only someone who smacks people around on ice while wearing knives strapped to their feet would think that the best move when entering a hockey fight would be to throw a damn Superman punch.

Simon Benoit WITH THE SUPERMAN PUNCH as he drops the gloves with Michael Kesselring    pic.twitter.com/N1UbrpXDqO

Simon Benoit of the Maple Leafs got into with Michael Kesselring of Utah on Monday night and things went wild immediately. Rather than simply putting up his dukes, Benoit took to the sky to punch Kesselring in the head — which is a bold move in a sport where players are wearing helmets.

It's tough to say if anyone really won this fight. Kesselring got in the best clean hits, but Benoit ended up on top of him on the ground in the end. 

Naturally punching someone in a hockey helmet is not a good idea, and Benoit learned this the hard way by dislocating his own thumb in the exchange. Then it was off to the penalty box to be his own doctor.

Reese, who broke her wrist in September, missed the second half of Monday's Unrivaled game.  





Angel Reese has had a phenomenal Unrivaled season; she's averaged 13.1 points per game and a league-best 12.1 rebounds, and her Rose Club has surged through the standings after a tough start to finish with the league's second-best record. 

But, her availability for the weekend's postseason action is in question after she appeared to suffer a wrist injury on Monday night. Reese had surgery for a wrist injury in September; she suffered a small crack in a bone in her left wrist and missed the final weeks of her rookie season, turning to social media to initially break the news. 

Reese appeared to clutch at that same wrist on Monday night and didn't play in the second half of Monday's game, a 92-58 Rose win over the Mist.  

Rose head coach Nola Henry didn't offer additional information in her postgame media availability. 

“No update on Angel, but hopefully, we'll have one soon,” Henry said. “Sending her our best wishes.” 

Unrivaled's postseason begins on Friday, with the Laces and Rose slated to face off at 7:30pm. The winner of that game will advance to the championship game, set for Monday night. 

Reese has been a massive part of the Rose Club's success this season, and her absence would require other players to step up. Chelsea Gray has been the team's most valuable player; she's averaged 21.3 points, 5.4 assists, and 5.1 rebounds, and has been pivotal in the Rose's second-half push. Gray's load will be particularly substantial with Reese out because Kahleah Copper, the club's second-leading scorer, has been out with an injury since Feb. 7. 

The Rose will need to rely on other players in the event they lost another player to injury. Azura Stevens will likely see additional minutes in Reese's absence; she's averaged 11.7 points and 7.2 rebounds in 9.6 minutes per night. Brittney Sykes has also been key off the bench; she's averaged 11.4 points in 13.2 minutes per game. Lexie Hull rounds out the roster with 6.2 points in 11.5 minutes per night. 

Beyond that, with the Chicago Sky's season just a few months away, a wrist re-injury could threaten Reese's early availability. The Sky's preseason will tip-off on May 2, with their first exhibition game taking at Reese's alma mater, LSU. 

It's very possible Reese was just experiencing some soreness and could be back in the lineup in time for Friday's action. But, Unrivaled fans and WNBA fans will hold their breath until the league offers more information on her injury status.

Madison Keys' parents initially thought she would become a dancer, but the moment she saw “Venus Williams on TV in a pretty dress” things changed and her parents Rick and Christine Keys did everything they could to help her achieve her dreams.

Keys – who has one older sister named Sydney and two younger sisters named Montana and Hunter – was only four years old when she saw the great Williams donning a white dress at Wimbledon and she immediately fell in love with the game of tennis.

The American eventually turned professional on her 14th birthday in 2009 and not long after she won her maiden WTA Tour match, aged just 14 years and 48 days.

In 2014 she went on to win her first-ever WTA Tour title when she lifted the Eastbourne International trophy and three years later she reached her maiden Grand Slam final, but lost against good friend Sloane Stephens in the final of the US Open.

Several up and down years followed and Keys must've thought that big Grand Slam title moment had come and gone with her defeat at Flushing Meadows.

But with age comes maturity and Keys finally “got to the point where I was okay” with not winning a major trophy.

With that pressure off, she flourished and that Grand Slam winning moment did eventually arrive at the 2025 Australian Open when she produced an astonishing run as she beat world No 2 Iga Swiatek in the semi-final and reigning champion and world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka in the final to lift the title.

It was a richly deserved Grand Slam moment, not just for Madison, but for her parents Rick and Christine, who sacrificed a lot over the years to help her to get to the top.

Rick and Christine hail from Rock Island in northwestern Illinois in the United States and they welcomed a girl, whom they named Madison, into the world on 17 February 1995.

Rick is an attorney and former college basketball player and Christine was also into the law as she was an attorney specialising in personal injury and workers' compensation.

Madison was only four when she found her passion for tennis and Rick told Vavel back in 2015: “It all started when Madison came to us out of nowhere and said she wanted to play tennis. She had seen Venus Williams on TV in a pretty dress and decided that's what she wanted to do.

“Madison was a dancer but we wanted to support her so we got her a racquetball racket and she started to hit on the wall. She would hit all day long. Her passion was evident so we got her into local clinics. Soon she was beating everyone in sight so we needed to look for a more challenging environment.”

The family moved to Florida as the young Madison was signed up at the Evert academy and she told her father: “‘Dad, I feel so normal and happy here'” with Rick adding “this obviously was a big moment because she knew she belonged with these talented young stars”.

The family knew “if we stayed in Illinois the dream would die. There was no looking back”.

Rick added: “I called many other top pros and they all agreed if you were going pro these years are the most important. Well ! we were now all in. We had to get a place near Evert academy, made arrangements to move kids there and still maintain a place in Rock Island to take care of business. It was a whirlwind and a monumental investment that we knew nothing about.”

Christine quit the legal profession for a decade as she took on several roles to support her daughters with Rick saying she was “mother, chauffeur, cook, support team, school etc. Mostly on her own”. He continued: “We both had to make sacrifices and take on significant roles to make it work.”

And work it did as Madison performed on and off court with Christine revealing in 2018 on a United States Tennis Association video: “The best part about being a mom is watching your child figure out a problem.

“When they can figure something out based on the skills that you've helped them develop and they actually are successful at making a good decision, that's the best part.”

Christine eventually returned to law in 2015, but in 2022 she took on a new rewarding role as she became the president of her daughter's charity, Kindness Wins.

“No one knows me better than my mom. So when I had to hire someone to run my charity @kindnesswinsfoundation, I couldn't think of a better person,” Keys wrote.

“My mom is the President of Kindness Wins, handling all of the fundraising and charitable outreach we do, and she knows exactly what I'm passionate about when it comes to helping others!”

And Kindness Wins has gone from strength to strength, just like Madison Keys on and off the court thanks to the help of Rick and Christine.

You could make a case that the Washington Commanders made the best move on the first day of the NFL's legal tampering period by trading for Pro Bowl left tackle Laremy Tunsil. You could also make the case that Washington had Monday's most head-scratching move: signing former 49ers and Jets defensive tackle Javon Kinlaw to a three-year, $45 million deal with $30 million guaranteed.

Washington just released longtime standout defensive tackle Jonathan Allen in a salary cap move to save $16 million. It's not totally fair to say the Commanders released Allen to sign Kinlaw until you know what Kinlaw's role will be in Joe Whitt's defense. Kinlaw doesn't have a reputation as a big-time run stopper playing defensive tackle. Perhaps Washington plans on playing the 6-foot-5, 319-pound Kinlaw on the edge, giving it a better chance of being more stout against the run next season.

Regardless, the deal wasn't well received on the surface by many across the NFL, including some Washington fans.

Let's check out some of these reactions.

Cutting Jonathan Allen to save $15.5M and then paying Javon Kinlaw a guaranteed $30M ... is interesting. Adam Peters is a very smart exec. But that's interesting.

As you can see, the reactions are all over the place. Eagles' fans weighing in is funny. Most Washington fans haven't seen Kinlaw play and have tried to keep an open mind instead of outright praising the move. Meanwhile, Philadelphia fans would somehow find a way to say the Laremy Tunsil trade was bad.

Kinlaw has a chance to prove Adam Peters right. If not, that honeymoon period will wear off fast for Peters. For now, fans think Peters can do no wrong, but that will chance if Kinlaw flops in 2025.

Gilgeous-Alexander, who's currently favored to win MVP, is having quite the season. He's leading the league in scoring (32.7 points per game) while dominating teams on defense by accumulating the second highest average in steals (1.8 steals per game). The OKC Thunder are sitting atop the Western Conference with a comfortable 11 game lead over the second place Denver Nuggets, and are favored to make their first appearance in the NBA Finals since 2012. Shai and the Thunder look to ride this momentum into TD Garden to face their biggest Eastern Conference threat.

On the other hand, the Celtics haven't shown any signs of slowing down since winning the NBA Finals last season. Tatum and Brown continue to prove that they're one of the best duo's in league history, alongside an extensive roster of weapons including Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porziņģis, and veteran Al Horford. Behind the three-point line, there's no team better than the Celtics right now. They have the most team threes in the season with 1,157 so far, and hold the record for most threes made in a game with 29.

Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has refused to be drawn on which competition he would prefer to win this season.

The Gunners already have one foot in the Champions League quarter-finals, leading PSV Eindhoven 7-1 from their first leg last week.

But they have fallen well behind leaders Liverpool in the Premier League, currently sitting 15 points adrift of the Reds following their 1-1 draw with Manchester United at the weekend.

And now ahead of their return game at the Emirates on Wednesday, Arteta has claimed he won't be drawn on whether he would rather lift the Champions League or Premier League trophies come May.

Health insurance premiums are rising even faster","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250311/Thought-inflation-was-bad-Health-insurance-premiums-are-rising-even-faster.aspx","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 10:43:00 GMT","

Kirk Vartan pays more than $2,000 a month for a high-deductible health insurance plan from Blue Shield on Covered California, the state's Affordable Care Act marketplace. He could have selected a cheaper plan from a different provider, but he wanted one that includes his wife's doctor.

""It's for the two of us, and we're not sick,"" said Vartan, general manager at A Slice of New York pizza shops in the Bay Area cities of San Jose and Sunnyvale. ""It's ridiculous.""

Vartan, who is in his late 50s, is one of millions of Californians struggling to keep up with health insurance premiums ballooning faster than inflation.

Average monthly premiums for families with employer-provided health coverage in California's private sector nearly doubled over the last 15 years, from just over $1,000 in 2008 to almost $2,000 in 2023, a KFF Health News analysis of federal data shows. That's more than twice the rate of inflation. Also, employees have had to absorb a growing share of the cost.

The spike is not confined to California. Average premiums for families with employer-provided health coverage grew as fast nationwide as they did in California from 2008 through 2023, federal data shows. Premiums continued to grow rapidly in 2024, according to KFF.

Small-business groups warn that, for workers whose employers don't provide coverage, the problem could get worse if Congress does not extend enhanced federal subsidies that make health insurance more affordable on individual markets such as Covered California, the public marketplace that insures more than 1.9 million Californians.

Premiums on Covered California have grown about 25% since 2022, roughly double the pace of inflation. But the exchange helps nearly 90% of enrollees mitigate high costs by offering state and federal subsidies based on income, with many families paying little or nothing.



Rising premiums also have hit government workers — and taxpayers. Premiums at CalPERS, which provides insurance to more than 1.5 million of California's active and retired public employees and family members, have risen about 31% since 2022. Public employers pay part of the cost of premiums as negotiated with labor unions; workers pay the rest.

""Insurance premiums have been going up faster than wages over the last 20 years,"" said Miranda Dietz, a researcher at the University of California-Berkeley Labor Center who focuses on health insurance. ""Especially in the last couple of years, those premium increases have been pretty dramatic.""

Dietz said rising hospital prices are largely to blame. Consumer costs for hospitals and nursing homes rose about 88% from 2009 through 2024, roughly double the overall inflation rate, according to data from the Department of Labor. The rising cost of administering America's massive health care system has also pushed premiums higher, she said.

Insurance companies remain highly profitable, but their gross margins — the amount by which premium income exceeds claims costs — were fairly steady during the last few years, KFF research shows. Under federal rules, insurers must spend a minimum percentage of premiums on medical care.



Rising insurance costs are cutting deeper into family incomes and squeezing small businesses.

The average annual cost of family health insurance offered by private sector companies was about $24,000, or roughly $2,000 a month, in California during 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Employers paid, on average, about two-thirds of the bill, with workers paying the remaining third, about $650 a month. Workers' share of premiums has grown faster in California than in the rest of the nation.

Many small-business workers whose employers don't offer health care turn to Covered California. During the last three decades, the percentage of businesses nationwide with 10 to 24 workers offering health insurance fell from 65% to 52%, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Coverage fell from 34% to 23% among businesses with fewer than 10 employees.

""When an employee of a small business isn't able to access health insurance with their employer, they're more likely to leave that employer,"" said Bianca Blomquist, California director for Small Business Majority, an advocacy group representing more than 85,000 small businesses across America.

Kirk Vartan said his pizza shop employs about 25 people and operates as a worker cooperative — a business owned by its workers. The small business lacks negotiating power to demand discounts from insurance companies to cover its workers. The best the shop could do, he said, were expensive plans that would make it hard for the cooperative to operate. And those plans would not offer as much coverage as workers could find for themselves through Covered California.

""It was a lose-lose all the way around,"" he said.

Mark Seelig, a spokesperson for Blue Shield of California, said rising costs for hospital stays, doctor visits, and prescription drugs put upward pressure on premiums. Blue Shield has created a new initiative that he said is designed to lower drug prices and pass on savings to consumers.

Even at California companies offering insurance, the percentage of employees enrolled in plans with a deductible has roughly doubled in 20 years, rising to 77%, federal data shows. Deductibles are the amount a worker must pay for most types of care before their insurance company starts paying part of the bill. The average annual deductible for an employer-provided family health insurance plan was about $3,200 in 2023.

During the last two decades, the cost of health insurance premiums and deductibles in California rose from about 4% of median household income to about 12%, according to the UC Berkeley Labor Center, which conducts research on labor and employment issues.

As a result, the center found, many Californians are choosing to delay or forgo health care, including some preventive care.



California is trying to lower health care costs by setting statewide spending growth caps, which state officials hope will curb premium increases. The state recently established the Office of Health Care Affordability, which set a five-year target for annual spending growth at 3.5%, dropping to 3% by 2029. Failure to hit targets could result in hefty fines for health care organizations, though that likely wouldn't happen until 2030 or later.

Other states that imposed similar caps saw health care costs rise more slowly than states that did not, Dietz said.

""Does that mean that health care becomes affordable for people?"" she asked. ""No. It means it doesn't get worse as quickly.""

The Trump administration issued its first major set of proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act on Monday that federal officials said are intended to crack down on fraud in the program. Policy experts said they will make it harder for consumers to sign up for coverage, potentially reducing enrollment.

Details were released Monday after a draft press release was inadvertently posted earlier.

About 24 million Americans signed up for insurance plans sold under the ACA, known popularly as Obamacare, for 2025. The Biden administration achieved record enrollment levels after increasing premium subsidies for many lower-income people, which resulted in reducing the monthly cost of some plans to $0. It also made it easier for some very low-income people to sign up at any time of year, instead of waiting for an enrollment period each fall. But the program became plagued by fraudulent enrollment last year, generating about 274,000 consumer complaints through August, most focused on rogue insurance agents and other bad actors, to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

The Trump administration said in a statement Monday that the new regulations include ""critical and necessary steps to protect people from being enrolled in Marketplace coverage without their knowledge or consent, promote stable and affordable health insurance markets, and ensure taxpayer dollars fund financial assistance only for the people the ACA set out to support.""

Policy experts said the changes, though, will impose new paperwork burdens likely to hamper enrollment.

""Under this banner of trying to crack down on the bad actions of some insurance brokers, they are penalizing consumers, particularly low-income consumers, with more burdensome requirements and more limits on their access to coverage,"" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and the co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.

Among other new requirements, consumers would have to provide more information proving their eligibility for special enrollment periods and for premium subsidies when they enroll. The regulation would also shorten the annual enrollment period by a month. And it touches on social issues, limiting eligibility for ""Dreamers"" — a nickname for immigrants in the country illegally who were brought here as children, based on never-passed proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act.

The proposal would eliminate the year-round opportunity for a special enrollment period for people with very low incomes. But it would also set new requirements for the remaining special enrollment periods, which allow people to sign up after major life events, such as when their income changes, they lose their job-based coverage, or they get divorced, marry, or move. They would now have to provide evidence of their eligibility when applying under those special situations.

People auto-reenrolled into zero-premium plans during the regular enrollment period would be charged a small monthly payment until they confirm or update their information.

The ACA marketplaces, according to the proposal, would have to seek additional data from consumers, including the self-employed or gig workers, who estimate their income for the coming year but don't have tax return data filed with the IRS for previous years.

The Biden administration made changes to reduce fraudulent enrollment last year including requiring three-way calls among insurance brokers, their clients, and the federal insurance marketplace, healthcare.gov, when certain sign-ups or coverage changes were made.

Some of the Trump administration's proposed changes could help warn certain consumers that they've been unknowingly enrolled in an ACA plan, such as a requirement that some customers on even the least expensive plans receive a small, monthly premium bill.

However, the additional paperwork and other eligibility requirements ""will probably have a downward effect on enrollment,"" said Cynthia Cox, a vice president and the director of the Program on the ACA at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. ""Some of that could be protecting enrollees who were fraudulently signed up or don't realize they're still signed up.""

Still, it could prove difficult for some people if they're not able to document an expected change in income. ""They might have a legitimate claim but have a hard time demonstrating it,"" Cox said.

The annual open enrollment period would end Dec. 15, a month earlier than this year. The designated period is when most people sign up and is intended to prevent people from waiting until they get sick to enroll, a move that helps slow premium growth.

The Trump proposal also touches on social issues.

It would reverse the Biden administration policy that allows Dreamers to qualify for subsidized ACA coverage. That decision is already the subject of a court challenge brought by 19 states seeking to overturn it.

Also under the Trump proposal, gender-affirming care would not be considered part of the ""essential health benefits"" that all plans must cover.

According to an FAQ that accompanied the initial press release of the proposed regulations, the provision could ""lead to increased out-of-pocket costs for individuals requiring sex-trait modification services, as they may need to seek plans that offer this coverage as a non-EHB or pay for services out-of-pocket.""

As a proposed rule, the measures now face a public comment period and potential revision before being finalized.

""None of it will go into effect right away,"" said Katie Keith, director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University. ""The question is how much will apply in 2025 versus 2026.""

The FAQ acknowledged that some of the proposed changes, including ending year-round enrollment for very low-income people, ""may increase the administrative burden for consumers associated with enrollment and verification processes or could deter some eligible low-income individuals from enrolling.""

But, it continued, ""we believe that enhancing program integrity and reducing improper enrollments outweighs these potential impacts on access to coverage.""

Some lawmakers and conservative groups have pointed to the concerns about unauthorized enrollment and the role, if any, that ACA subsidies or enrollment periods have in fueling the problem.

The right-leaning Paragon Health Institute, for example, released a report in June that, among other things, called for the Biden administration's expansion of the special enrollment period for low-income people to be reversed.

""There is substantial amounts of fraud and waste in the ACA exchanges and the Biden administration pursued the enrollment-at-all costs strategy, and was tolerant of the waste, fraud and abuse,"" said Brian Blase, a former health aide during Trump's first presidency who is president of the Paragon Health Institute and influential within the current Trump administration. ""Clearly a different approach to protect legitimate enrollees and taxpayers is needed.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22health%20news%22%20site%3Anews-medical.net","Under Trump, Social Security resumes what it once called ‘clawback cruelty","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250311/Under-Trump-Social-Security-resumes-what-it-once-called-e28098clawback-cruelty.aspx","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 10:48:00 GMT","

A year ago, a new head of Social Security set out to stop the agency from financially devastating many of the people it was meant to help.

The agency had long made it a practice to reduce or halt benefit checks to recoup billions of dollars in payments it sent recipients but later said they never should have received.

Martin O'Malley, then the Social Security Administration commissioner, announced in March 2024 the agency would no longer cut off people's monthly old-age, survivors, and disability checks to recoup money they had allegedly been overpaid — a pattern he called ""clawback cruelty."" Instead, it would default to withholding 10% of monthly benefits. The new policy allowed people who already live on little to pay their rent and keep food on the table.

Last Friday, the Trump administration reversed that policy.

Beginning March 27, to recover new overpayments, the Social Security Administration will automatically withhold 100% of recipients' monthly benefits, the agency announced.

The agency said it was acting in the interest of fiscal responsibility and that the reversal would save the government about $7 billion over a decade.

""It is our duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding, as it was during the Obama administration and first Trump administration, to properly safeguard taxpayer funds,"" acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said in a news release.

Advocates for Social Security beneficiaries described the action as cruel and harmful.

""The results are predictable: more unnecessary suffering,"" said Kathleen Romig, who worked at the Social Security Administration under O'Malley and is now director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Kate Lang of the advocacy group Justice in Aging said she was heartbroken.

""Those who are most vulnerable, with the fewest resources, are the ones who will feel the harsh impacts of this change,"" she said. Many ""are going to be unable to buy food or keep the roof over their head,"" she said.

In 2023, after an investigation by KFF Health News and Cox Media Group cast a spotlight on overpayments and clawbacks, lawmakers from both parties called on the Social Security Administration to change its approach.

The policy change a year ago was inspired in part by the plight of people such as Denise Woods, who was sleeping in her Chevy in Savannah, Georgia, in December 2023 while contending with lupus and congestive heart failure after the government cut off her disability benefits. The government was demanding she repay almost $58,000.

Many overpayments are the result of government error. It can take the government years to figure out it has been paying someone too much, and by then, the amount the government says it is owed can grow far beyond a beneficiary's ability to repay. And it has often demanded that recipients repay the full amount within 30 days.

As of October, the SSA was withholding at least a portion of monthly benefit payments from hundreds of thousands of people, according to data the SSA provided last fall to KFF Health News and Cox Media Group. The agency said it was withholding up to 10% from 669,903 people to recoup an overpayment. Asked whether those numbers covered all types of benefits administered by the SSA, the agency's press office didn't say.

“Under Trump's leadership, Social Security has reinstated a cruel policy of clawing back Social Security overpayments with no regard for an American's ability to pay or whether the overpayment was an error by the agency,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.

The new plan to completely withhold monthly benefits from recipients who were allegedly overpaid does not extend to the Supplemental Security Income program, one of two Social Security programs for people with disabilities. SSI, as the agency explains, covers ""people with disabilities and older adults who have little or no income or resources.""

The government's estimate that cutting people off completely will save $7 billion over a decade implies it expects many more overpayments in the years ahead.

The SSA's March 7 announcement was part of a broader dismantling of Biden-era policies under President Donald Trump. It was also part of a broader upheaval at the Social Security Administration, which announced In February that it would cut its staff from about 57,000 to 50,000.

In an interview Monday, O'Malley predicted that the public will experience much longer wait times trying to get through to the agency by phone and longer waits for disability determinations.

Social Security runs on a very old computer system, he said, and driving people out of the agency who understand it ""can only result in system collapse.""

""The risk of totally shutting down the agency is greatly increased by people mucking around that don't know what they're doing,"" O'Malley said.

On the PBS NewsHour last week, he advised recipients to save money to prepare for an interruption of benefits.

Trump deputy Elon Musk has boasted of taking a chainsaw to the federal government and has called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. In a signed declaration filed in federal court last week, a recently retired SSA official, Tiffany Flick, said she ""witnessed a disregard for critical processes"" as members of DOGE — the Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump established by executive order — demanded access to sensitive Social Security systems, including files that contain beneficiaries' banking information.

New management at the SSA called its workforce ""bloated."" But, under the previous administration, the agency was telling a starkly different story.

A year ago, O'Malley told lawmakers that, as the number of people receiving benefits increased, ""historic underfunding and understaffing"" at the agency had created a ""service delivery crisis.""

Late last year, the agency provided data to KFF Health News showing that in September its workforce was near a 50-year low. As of last month, applicants for disability benefits were waiting an average of more than seven months for a decision, according to the SSA website.

The staffing cuts will lead to more overpayments than ever and will make it harder for the people affected to clear up mistakes, said Jen Burdick, an attorney at Community Legal Services of Philadelphia.

As KFF Health News and Cox Media Group revealed in 2023, about 2 million people a year were receiving notices from the SSA that they were overpaid and owed money back.

People can appeal overpayment notices, request a lower withholding rate, or ask the SSA to waive collection altogether, the agency said. The SSA does not pursue recoveries while an initial appeal or waiver request is pending, it said.

Shortly before O'Malley left the SSA in November, the agency implemented changes that made it easier for beneficiaries to get overpayments waived. The agency spelled out grounds for determining the beneficiary was not at fault — for instance, if the agency continued to issue overpayments after the beneficiary reported a change in their financial circumstances that should have led to a reduction in benefits. Those policy changes remain intact.

Several Republicans who expressed concern about clawbacks in the aftermath of 2023 news coverage did not respond to inquiries for this article or declined to comment. One of them was Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who is now chair of the Senate's Special Committee on Aging.

""Hardworking American taxpayers pay into Social Security all of their lives so that they can depend on it in the time they need it most,"" Scott said in a 2023 letter to the agency. ""The fact that the SSA's actions are leaving some of them worse off, through no fault of their own, is absolutely unacceptable.""

When congressional Republicans in 2017 pushed to repeal the Affordable Care Act and slash Medicaid, dozens of physician groups, patient advocates, hospitals, and others rallied to defend the law and the safety-net program.

Eight years later, two industry groups have been notably restrained as GOP lawmakers consider sweeping new Medicaid cuts: the American Medical Association and the American Health Care Association, which represents nursing homes.

At the same time, the two groups are lobbying Republicans, seeking support on other priorities.

The AMA is lobbying lawmakers to reverse a nearly 3% cut in Medicare's fees for physicians. And the AHCA has pushed Congress to roll back regulations enacted under President Joe Biden that mandate better staffing ratios at nursing homes.

Representatives of the two groups declined to comment on the record about any connections between the Medicaid fight and their other legislative priorities.

But AHCA spokesperson Rachel Reeves said the nursing home group, which has issued a statement defending Medicaid, is communicating with lawmakers about the importance of the program for people with low incomes and disabilities. ""We will make sure that the voices of our community are heard and that the message is loud and clear: Congress must protect our seniors who rely on Medicaid,"" she said. Medicaid is the primary payer for nursing home care, covering more than 6 in 10 nursing home residents.

Nevertheless, other advocates and congressional Democrats said they're frustrated by the two groups. ""The time to speak out is now,"" Sen. Ron Wyden, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, told KFF Health News. ""Americans will know which organizations stood up against harmful cuts to Medicaid when this fight is over.""

Medicaid, a state-federal insurance plan that together with the related Children's Health Insurance Program covers about 80 million Americans, is in the crosshairs as congressional Republicans seek to trim several trillion dollars in federal spending to offset the $4.5 trillion cost of extending tax cuts enacted in President Donald Trump's first term.

Medicaid cuts on the scale being contemplated would put coverage for millions of Americans at risk. That has alarmed advocates who work with people covered by the program, including children, Americans with disabilities, and low-income older adults. Other advocacy organizations who work with these patients have been much more active.

Last week, more than 400 pediatricians traveled to Washington, D.C., to speak to members of Congress about the importance of Medicaid. More than 100 leaders of safety-net hospitals that serve low-income patients around the country did the same.

Patients' advocates such as the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network have defended Medicaid. Last month, state medical societies sent a letter to congressional leaders warning of dire consequences if Medicaid cuts are enacted. And this week, more than 750 members of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are expected in Washington, where the group says they'll be lobbying to preserve Medicaid funding.

""Slicing hundreds of billions of dollars from federal funding will force states to cut the care children and families depend on or raise taxes on hard-working Americans,"" said Chip Kahn, chief executive of the Federation of American Hospitals, another trade group fighting to defend Medicaid.

Building coalitions was critical in previous health care debates, said Ron Pollack, the former head of patient advocacy group Families USA. Pollack helped lead the push for the 2010 Affordable Care Act. ""We succeeded in the past because we stuck together,"" he said.

Eight years ago, the AMA and AHCA were key members of the coalition that turned back Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare.

The AMA, the nation's largest physician group, sent multiple letters to Congress throughout 2017, warning lawmakers in a March 17, 2017, letter that they should ""keep upmost in your mind the potentially life altering impact your decisions will have on millions of Americans.""

And the AHCA's president was a leading voice opposing repeal, which at one point he called ""the biggest threat that the sector has faced in at least 20 to 25 years.""

This year, the AMA hasn't sent a single letter or issued any news releases opposing Medicaid cuts. By contrast, the group has issued seven news releases since January on the lack of congressional action on physician fees.

The AHCA issued its first public defense of Medicaid in this year's debate — a document it called a fact sheet — only the day after House Republicans adopted a budget resolution that threatens the program's funding. When the group issued its 2025 policy priorities last week, ""Priority #1"" focused on staffing, including repealing the Biden-era staffing mandate. ""Protecting Medicaid"" was ""Priority #2.""

The Medicaid debate will likely drag on for months as GOP leaders in the House and Senate try to cobble together a bill to extend tax cuts.

Medicaid's defenders say they're still looking for more voices to speak up.

""Republicans have said outright that silence is consent,"" Wyden said. ""If health care organizations don't speak out against the GOP's plans to cut health care, Republican lawmakers are going to assume those organizations are on board with their agenda.""

This review highlights the critical role of ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) in regulating programmed cell death (PCD) in breast cancer (BC). As the most prevalent malignant tumor among women, BC remains a significant global health challenge. Despite advances in therapy, resistance to treatment and metastasis continue to pose major obstacles. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of how ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes, governed by USPs, influence various cell death pathways crucial to cancer progression and treatment response.

The intricate ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, determining the fate of apoptotic, autophagic, necroptotic, ferroptotic, and pyroptotic pathways. By selectively modulating proteins involved in these pathways, USPs contribute to either promoting or inhibiting cancer cell survival. The review explores the dual role of PCD in BC, where certain forms of cell death act as a defense mechanism, while others enhance tumor growth and resistance to therapy.

Apoptosis, the most studied form of PCD, is closely linked to tumor suppression. However, BC cells often develop resistance to apoptotic signals, enabling uncontrolled proliferation. USPs such as USP22 and USP7 regulate key proteins like c-Myc and p53, influencing apoptosis in BC. Similarly, autophagy, a mechanism for cellular self-digestion, has a paradoxical role in BC, either inhibiting or promoting tumor survival. The review discusses how USP8 and USP13 influence autophagy by regulating Beclin1 and p62/SQSTM1, potentially affecting therapeutic outcomes.

Emerging non-apoptotic PCD pathways such as ferroptosis and pyroptosis have garnered attention for their potential in cancer therapy. Ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent cell death, has been identified as a promising target in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The review highlights the role of USP7 and USP35 in ferroptosis regulation, underscoring the therapeutic possibilities of manipulating iron metabolism and oxidative stress. Pyroptosis, an inflammatory cell death pathway, is also examined, with a focus on USP48 and gasdermin E (GSDME), which contribute to immune responses and tumor suppression.

Beyond their influence on PCD, USPs play a role in tumor metastasis and drug resistance, presenting new challenges and opportunities for targeted therapy. The review emphasizes the need for further investigation into the crosstalk between USPs and PCD mechanisms, particularly in necroptosis and anoikis, which are less understood but critical in BC progression.

By unveiling the complex interactions between ubiquitination, cell death pathways, and cancer biology, this review lays the foundation for novel therapeutic strategies.

A new study published this week in Child Maltreatment found that in comparison to those who had not been abused in childhood, adults who had experienced both childhood physical and sexual abuse had approximately double the odds of physical and mental health conditions, including angina, arthritis, asthma, COPD, heart attack, depression, and disability -- even after considering respondents' age, race, income, and health behaviors, as well as obesity.

Those who had been sexually abused, but not physically abused, were 55% to 90% more likely to experience these health outcomes compared to their peers who had not experienced any abuse. Adults who were physically abused, but not sexually abused, also had significantly elevated odds of these health outcomes compared to the non-abused, but the associations were more modest (between 20% to 50%).

""People don't typically think about the impact early adversities can have on health outcomes later in life,"" says first author Shannon Halls, a Research Coordinator at University of Toronto's Institute for Life Course and Aging.

Our research underscores the harmful associations between early adversities, such as sexual and/or physical abuse, and a wide range of health issues in adulthood.""

Shannon Halls, Research Coordinator, Institute for Life Course and Aging, University of Toronto

In exploring this association, the study also examined whether the presence of an adult in the home who made the child feel safe and protected was associated with better long-term health outcomes among children who experienced abuse.

""We found that when children experiencing abuse had a protective adult in their home, the negative impact of abuse on their health as adults was less severe,"" says co-author Andie MacNeil, a doctoral student at the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work (FIFSW).

""Though more research is needed to pinpoint the precise mechanisms, it is evident that these relationships can play a key role in supporting children and mitigating the adverse health effects of abuse.""

The presence of a protective adult was not only important for children who had experienced abuse, but important for children who had not been abused as well. Children without a protective adult in their home, irrespective of childhood abuse status, were 20% to 40% more likely to experience adverse physical health outcomes and twice as likely to suffer from depression in adulthood.

""The implication here is that lacking the safe and stable relationships with adults can be just as harmful to children's health as being physically abused,"" says senior author Esme Fuller-Thomson, a Professor at FIFSW and Director for the Institute of Life Course and Aging at the University of Toronto.

The study's authors point to the need for future research to unpack these findings in particular.

""It will be important in future research to investigate why some adults in the home are not adequately protective of children, and to discuss potential primary prevention interventions that can help parents provide a more protective environment for children,"" said co-author Philip Baiden, an Associate Professor in the School of Social Work at the University of Texas at Arlington

The study analyzed data from the 2021 and 2022 Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System, a large representative sample from which over 80,000 adult U.S. respondents were included.

""Our research shows the importance of positive relationships between children and the adults in their lives"" says Halls. ""We hope that these findings can contribute to a better understanding for creating effective programs targeted at children experiencing abuse.""

An extensive tumor genomic analysis of individuals with ovarian cancer, led by researchers from Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah (the U) and Emory University, revealed that Black women have nearly identical mutations to other previously studied populations. But researchers also found a few notable differences that may be clinically relevant.

Our analysis shows the importance of researching different types of populations. The molecular features that we discover in one patient group will allow us to find potential targets for drug therapies that will work for all patients and improve ovarian cancer health care for everyone.""

Jen Doherty, MS, PhD, co-principal investigator of the study and co-leader of the Cancer Control and Population Sciences Program at Huntsman Cancer Institute and professor of population health sciences at the U

Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed in its later stages due to a lack of clear symptoms or an effective screening approach, according to the National Cancer Institute. Over 12,000 women are estimated to have died from the disease in 2024. Extensive federal and private research has been devoted to understanding the causes and optimal treatment regimens for this deadly type of disease.

The study included individuals between 20 to 79 years of age who had been diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, the most common ovarian cancer. State-of-the-art tumor sequencing technology was used to discern tumor characteristics.

Molecular epidemiologist Kayleigh Lawson-Michod, MPH, PhD, a recent graduate from the U's Population Health Sciences doctoral program, is the first author of the study.

""Prior characterizations, or analyses, of mutations in ovarian cancers were done in predominantly white populations,"" says Lawson-Michod. ""This project was unique in that it was the first large study to characterize tumor mutations in Black individuals with high-grade serous ovarian cancer.""

The team compared the results of their research to those of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a National Cancer Institute-initiated landmark genomics database that characterized the genetic makeup of 33 cancer types. Most of the high-grade serous ovarian cancer samples analyzed in TCGA were from white individuals.

The researchers wanted to understand if there were distinctions in the tumors of certain populations given differences in survival.

""The characterizations between these groups showed similar mutations. But Black individuals have a 43% five-year overall survival rate for ovarian cancer, compared to 51% for all American women,"" says Doherty. ""Our research shows that this discrepancy is unlikely to be explained by the genetic makeup of the tumors themselves.""

Still, the research team did note a few key differences.

In the analysis of Black individuals, KRAS mutations were more prevalent than in white individuals. KRAS is a mutated gene that causes cancer.

""KRAS did not show up as a significant mutation in the high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients from TCGA,"" says Lawson-Michod. ""However, just because KRAS may be more prevalent in Black individuals does not mean it is not present in all populations with this cancer type. If validated, this could be a missed treatment opportunity.""

Researchers also noted that Black women in the study had a higher prevalence of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). HRD prevents damaged cells from repairing themselves. HRD tumors are sensitive to PARP inhibitors, a type of targeted therapy.

""HRD status is associated with better survival, but Black women have higher mortality rates from this disease than other women,"" says Joellen Schildkraut, PhD, MPH, co-principal investigator of the study, member of the Cancer Prevention and Control Research Program at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, and professor of epidemiology at Emory University. ""This characterization of ovarian cancer in an understudied population such as this can hopefully impact clinical decision-making for all women with ovarian cancer and inform targeted treatment for this disease.""

The results of this study have been published in Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.

The research described in this release is supported by the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute, including P30 CA042014, and Huntsman Cancer Foundation.

The disparities between men and women in prevalence, risk factors and symptoms of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) have a profound impact on prevention, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes for women, according to a new American Heart Association scientific statement published today in the Association's flagship, peer-reviewed journal Circulation.

""Peripheral vascular disease is often under-recognized and understudied in women,"" said Esther S.H. Kim, M.D., M.P.H., FAHA, chair of the writing group for the new scientific statement. Dr. Kim is the Izard Family Distinguished Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine, a professor of medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and director of the Center for Women's Cardiovascular Health at Atrium Health in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""While differences in heart disease between men and women are increasingly recognized, equivalent focus on vascular diseases affecting blood vessels outside the heart remains lacking. In order to improve the quality of life and prolong the lives of women with PVD, more research is needed to identify and address these disparities.""

The scientific statement, ""Sex Differences in Peripheral Vascular Disease,"" summarizes current knowledge of the differences between men and women with PVD; highlights disparities in risk factors, screening, treatment and outcomes; and outlines key research priorities to mitigate these disparities and promote health equity.

The statement highlights numerous disparities in risk factors, symptoms, screening, treatment and outcomes for various types of PVD.

PVD leads to significant illness and health complications. However, the disparities between women and men hinder equitable outcomes. Identified disparities in effective prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care underscore the importance of tailored prevention and treatment strategies.""

Esther S.H. Kim, M.D., M.P.H., FAHA, chair of the writing group for the new scientific statement

According to the statement, there is a need to prioritize research to help define differences in PVD between men and women. Future research, from research at the cellular level to clinical trials, should include sex in their design and reporting. Suggestions include:

In addition, the statement also includes suggestions that may help improve diagnosis and long-term prognosis for women with PVD:

This scientific statement was prepared by the volunteer writing group on behalf of the American Heart Association's Council on Peripheral Vascular Disease; the Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing; the Council on Clinical Cardiology; the Council on Genomic and Precision Medicine; the Council on Quality of Care and Outcomes Research; and the Stroke Council. American Heart Association scientific statements promote greater awareness about cardiovascular diseases and stroke issues and help facilitate informed health care decisions. Scientific statements outline what is currently known about a topic and what areas need additional research. While scientific statements inform the development of guidelines, they do not make treatment recommendations. American Heart Association guidelines provide the Association's official clinical practice recommendations.

Australian mother Clementine Joyce is celebrating an important milestone in her latest pregnancy journey — reaching 25 weeks. The 31-year-old, from Sydney's Northern Beaches, has been pregnant a total of four times, each through in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

She's part of a rapidly growing group of Australian women turning to IVF to conceive, with some projections suggesting that within the next century, a third of all babies in the country could be born in this way.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reports that women are having children much later in life, with the highest fertility rates now seen in those aged 30 to 34. While overall fertility is steadily declining, the data also showed that pregnancy rates among women in their 40s are doubling, while those in their 20s are seeing a huge drop.

For Clementine, these figures come as no surprise. For her, IVF has resulted in her daughter, Val, and her current pregnancy. Speaking to Yahoo, the Sydneysider, a nurse, said the majority of her female friends have also struggled with conception. ""I would say more of my friends who have tried for babies have struggled compared to those who haven't,"" she told Yahoo News Australia.

Clementine said that, eventually, many ""ended up pregnant"", either after trying ""for over a year naturally"" or from receiving some form of fertility help. She said ""in comparison to most"" her ""IVF journey has actually gone smoothly"". But it's not been without its difficulties.

""With IVF and infertility, you're always pending results or significant health news that puts you in a state of distress,"" she said. ""Fertility and making babies feels like a competition. You feel like everyone around you is announcing a pregnancy while you're being left behind with an empty bank account, a barren uterus, guilt for not being able to provide, and no baby.

""There is this loud ticking clock where you know every second you're not pregnant, your chances are getting worse and worse. And even when, or if you get that phone call telling you you're pregnant, the hurdles you go through to maintain that pregnancy are so complicated and debilitating.""

As young Australians delay starting a family, it's an increasingly common plight. ""Women are starting to try to have babies basically at the end of their fertility window,"" she said.

Australia's fertility rate has reached a record low

Associate Professor Alex Polyakov, medical director at Genea Melbourne, is all too familiar with the struggles facing women like Clementine. He explained that Australia's declining fertility is driven solely by the fact that couples are delaying having kids.

More women are choosing to have children later in life, due to various factors including career advancement, financial stability and personal aspirations. The trend has been particularly noticeable in developed countries like Australia, where the average age of first-time mothers has steadily increased.

""Women are as healthy as they used to be. It's just that in the past – 30 to 40 years ago – the average age of the first motherhood was early 20s,"" he told Yahoo News.

""At the moment in Australia, the average age of first motherhood is 32 and the average age of IVF patients who come to see us for fertility treatment is 38 — but the best eggs are available in their mid-20s. By the time the woman is 38, the quality of eggs, and the number, drastically decreases.

""So that's the problem. It's a social problem, not a medical problem. And if it wasn't for migration, our population would actually be shrinking right now.""

This week, NaturoBest, a prenatal vitamin brand, released data that suggested that within the next century, as many as one in three babies in Australia could be conceived via IVF.

Polyakov suggested that while it's within the realm of possibility, many variable factors will influence how women conceive in the future. He pointed out that just as scientific advancements in recent decades have significantly improved older women's chances of conceiving, similar breakthroughs are likely to continue, making it challenging to forecast future fertility and IVF rates.

He did predict however that within the next 100 years, there ""will be technologies available"" that will ""allow all women to have babies"" and ""preserve their fertility much better"" than what is available today.

""If you think about the progress in the last 50 years, it's been spectacular, but it's only accelerating, and so in the next 100 years, there will be technologies available where a woman at any age would be able to have a baby. And in the NaturoBest paper, they actually talk about this, creating eggs from peripheral or skin cells, or pluripotent cells — various stem cells.""

But despite these potential future advancements, there are still significant emotional and personal challenges many continue to face in the journey to parenthood.

Clementine is determined to break the stigma surrounding IVF. She wants to empower women to openly discuss their struggles and share their experiences, in a bid to normalise the conversation and reduce the shame often associated with fertility challenges.

""I have a good friend who was doing IVF treatments at the same time, and she had eight failed transfers in a row. It's heartbreaking,"" she said. ""To those going through the heartache of not falling pregnant or losing pregnancies. I feel it so hard. Try to be kind to yourself. It's cruel and unfair.

""With all the fertility treatments I've done, I have a higher chance of getting both ovarian and breast cancer. Children born via IVF are slightly more likely to have hepatic tumours. Women are more likely to develop postnatal depression (PND) after giving birth, and women with IVF pregnancies have a slightly increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage compared to those who conceive naturally.

""But, I've successfully gotten pregnant and been able to carry one pregnancy to full term, and hopefully this pregnancy as well. Getting pregnant naturally and easily would be ideal, but the reality is that it is going to be less and less common, and we need to accept that.""

The pope rested peacefully overnight after his prognosis was ""lifted"" on Monday as he begins his 26th straight day in the hospital, the Vatican said.

Vatican sources told ABC News that Francis' prognosis being lifted means he's no longer in imminent danger, but the clinical picture still remains complex.

The 88-year-old pontiff will continue ""for additional days, the pharmacological medical therapy in a hospital environment"" due to the ""complexity of the clinical picture and the significant infectious picture presented at hospitalization,"" the Vatican said.

""The improvements recorded in previous days have further consolidated, as confirmed by both blood tests and clinical objectivity and the good response to pharmacological therapy. For these reasons, the doctors decided to lift the prognosis,"" the Holy See, the Vatican's press office, said in a statement Monday.

The pope will move back to noninvasive mechanical ventilation and will continue an antibiotic treatment, the Vatican sources said.

Francis' doctors said there are positive signs of the pontiff's recovery, but caution remains, according to the Vatican sources.

Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital on Feb. 14 and was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia.

Thursday will mark the 12th anniversary of when Pope Francis was voted to succeed Pope Benedict XVI, who previously resigned.

Unilever's new Chief Executive Officer Fernando Fernandez expects to accelerate the company's turnaround plans by selling a number of underperforming brands in the food segment.

In a fireside chat with Barclays Head of Consumer Staples Warren Ackerman, published on Unilever's website late Monday, the CEO said there are about 1 billion euros ($1.08 billion) of local brands in its foods Europe division that “don't fit well” with the company's portfolio.

The consumer-goods company also has a further 500 million euros in smaller markets that it doesn't see the possibility to scale, he added.

“My intention is to act on all of these, probably at a faster pace,” Fernandez said.

The comments regarding the potential disposal of these brands comes as the company seeks to grow the business by focusing on the most profitable brands.

The food business delivered a combined turnover of 13.4 billion euros in 2024, with 60% consisting of the brands Knorr and Hellmann's, which both represent significant profit margin and cash generation. “We are committed to growing that business,” he said.

Unilever plans to save 800 million euros over the next three years with cost-cutting measures that will shed 7,500 jobs globally. It is also spinning off its ice cream business as a stand-alone company.

Thirty years after her name was linked to the orchestrated assault of Nancy Kerrigan, Tonya Harding trended all over social media after a wild high school track attack. 

The bizarre incident happened at the Virginia High School League Class 3 State Indoor Championships at Liberty University last week, when a runner named Alaia Everett appeared to hit another runner over the head with a baton during the 4x200m relay.

Kaelen Tucker, the athlete who was hit, reportedly suffered a concussion and a potential skull fracture. 

Video of the alleged attack went viral, which caused Harding's name to be invoked by some individuals drawing a line between the incident in Virginia and the 1994 attack of Kerrigan, during which Kerrigan was struck in the knee with a baton by a hitman hired by Harding's then-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and Harding's then-bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt.



“This is Tonya Harding 2.0, imo,” one person wrote via X. “She should, at a minimum, be charged with assault and the intent to injure!”

Another person called Everett the “Tonya Harding of track and field!”

“I hope they ban her for life,” the individual added.

In an interview with WAVY TV 10 (an ABC affiliate in Norfolk, Virginia) on Sunday, March 9, alleged assailant Everett attempted to explain that the entire ordeal was one big misunderstanding. 

“After a couple times of hitting her with my baton, I got stuck behind her back and (the baton) rolled up her back,” Everett said. “I lost my balance, and when I pumped my arms again, she got hit.”

Everett added, “I know my intentions and I would never hit somebody on purpose.”

The aftermath and social media backlash has taken a toll on Everett, a senior at I.C. Norcom High School in Portsmouth, Virginia.

“They're assaulting my character, calling me ghetto, racist slurs, death threats, all of this, just because of a nine second video,” she said. 

The Everett family has been served court papers saying Tucker and her family are seeking a protective order against them.

“It doesn't seem right that this would happen and now we have to go to a city three hours away that everyone hates our guts already,” Everett's father, Genoa, told WAVY TV 10. 

As for Harding, now 54, she pleaded guilty in March 1994 to a charge of “conspiracy to hinder prosecution” in relation to the assault on Kerrigan. She received three years probation and was issued a $160,000 fine. 

Three months later, Harding was banned from U.S. Figure Skating for life. She has yet to comment on the recent incident.

Nadya Suleman is reflecting on the controversial actions she made days after welcoming eight babies.

In the Monday, March 10, episode of Lifetime's Confessions of Octomom, Suleman, 49, looked back on her decision to sit down with NBC News journalist Ann Curry for her first sit-down interview.

“[The hospital] let me pick what interviewer so I opted [for] a news anchor and I didn't know who she was. I never watched anything she did,” Suleman said. “So I picked Ann Curry. She was one of the only women. I thought I'd feel comfortable talking to a woman.”

When sitting down with Curry, 68, for an interview that would air on Today and Dateline in 2009, Suleman said she was stressed for a variety of reasons including the way she looked.



“I felt horrible about myself,” she said. “I gained 150 pounds during the whole pregnancy so at that point, I was still about 100 pounds heavier than normal. … I had no idea what she was going to ask me. I had never done an interview before.”

As recapped in Confessions of Octomom, Curry asked questions many Americans wanted answered at the time. At one point, the journalist asked Suleman to respond to people who thought she was being “irresponsible and selfish” for having so many children. (Before welcoming octuplets, Suleman was already a mom to six kids.)

“I was foggy in my head. I really wasn't lucid. I was also ripped open and I was on Vicodin for pain,” Suleman explained to Lifetime cameras. “Can you imagine being interrogated and interrogated while you have just given birth, all those hormones? You're very, very depressed. You're in a state of shock. I was not there.”

Suleman went on to claim she was in “survival mode” and not ready to take accountability for her actions.

“I felt under attack. I was under attack,” she said. “When a human is under attack psychologically, they're not in the frame of mind to be transparent or honest. They are going to protect themselves and I utilized every coping mechanism.”

According to Sulman, who went on to appear on the Today show again for another chat with Curry in 2011, the hospital where she gave birth wanted to set up an interview to “set the record straight” about her journey. But for the Orange County, California, resident, she simply wanted to go home and see her kids.

“It's a blur to me,” she said about the interview. “I just don't even remember. I just know I was in constant defense.”

Confessions of Octomom is a six-part documentary series that follows Suleman as she provides an intimate look at her history and her life today as a mom of 14.

With her octuplets turning 16 this January and her other six children ranging from 17 to 23 years old, Suleman has been out of the public eye for years. Now, she's hoping to provide a side of her family many haven't seen.

Confessions of Octomom airs on Lifetime Mondays at 10 p.m. ET.

As a member of Rent‘s original Broadway cast, Anthony Rapp got to witness Jonathan Larson‘s genius firsthand.

“He was so prolific,” Rapp, 53, told Us Weekly exclusively on Monday, March 10, while celebrating opening night of the new Off-Broadway musical, The Jonathan Larson Project, in New York City. “And he was so young, but so prolific.”

Now a legend in the musical theater world, Larson died unexpectedly at age 35 shortly before the first preview performance of Rent in January 1996. Rapp starred as Mark Cohen in the original cast alongside Adam Pascal, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Idina Menzel, Taye Diggs and more.

Rent became a career-defining success, earning Larson multiple posthumous awards, including the Tony Award for Best Musical and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. While it may be his most beloved work, Larson's archive of music is expansive — and The Jonathan Larson Project finally gives fans access to the songwriter's previously unheard work.



“I really went into this not knowing,” Rapp told Us. “I didn't want to know how they structured it. I didn't want to know what songs were in it. I wanted to come to it totally open to whatever it was going to be, and I was very moved.”

Rapp recognized “four or five” of the numbers chosen for the sung-through showcase, which stars Adam Chanler-Berat, Taylor Iman Jones, Andy Mientus, Jason Tam and Lauren Marcus.

“[‘Valentine's Day'] was a song that was in an early version of Rent that got cut and changed and, you know, became something else. … We from the company did a version of ‘Love Heals,' so that was a song I was very familiar with,” Rapp told Us, also citing “Pura Vida” and “Hosing the Furniture” as deep cuts he had a knowledge of.

Along with being introduced to songs he hadn't heard before, Rapp pointed out how special it was to see Larson's inner circle get bigger.

“The family extends,” he gushed, detailing his own personal history with Chanler-Berat and Tam. “It's not Rent-direct, but it's all [connected]. So it feels like being home.”

Despite his familiarity with the new show's cast, Rapp was hands-off during the rehearsal process. “This is theirs. I just feel grateful as a member of the family that they're doing this beautiful work to keep him alive,” he explained. “You know, both things are true — he lives on in his work and he's also gone forever. His legacy lives on, and his legacy is so pure. That's remarkable.”

Speaking to Larson's passion, Rapp told Us, “I know he had moments of doubt and he had moments where he almost gave up, but … he really did always believe in himself. And he always believed in the possibility and the power of what art and theater could be, of what song and music could do, and he was profoundly driven by that. So that's also up and through all of this [show].”

Larson's family was also on hand to celebrate the emotional opening night. “It's very hard to process it and to articulate it right away,” his sister, Julie Larson, told Us after the performance. “But this has been a long time coming and [conceiver] Jen Teffer has had this in her heart and in her sights for years. To see it come to fruition with such a talented, passionate group of people and to hear some of these songs that very few people have ever heard except our family, you know, on cassette tapes, is lovely.”

Julie continued, “It's wonderful. And it's always complicated emotionally, but I'm very happy at the moment.”

The project “shows a lot more colors of where he came from [and] where he started,” Julie said, praising the “wide range of styles” seen on stage. Mientus agreed, telling Us that he was struck by the “curiosity and playfulness” in Jonathan's writing.

“Jonathan Larson is the whole reason that I do this … and I thought we'd seen all the work we had of his,” the actor continued. “So to not only have new work playing in New York City right now, but to be a part of it — to be in Jonathan Larson's third-ever original cast in New York City — is a dream I didn't even know I could have, and it's somehow come true.”

The Jonathan Larson Project is now in performances for a 16-week limited engagement, ending June 1, at the Orpheum Theatre in New York City.

Hulu's new Rust documentary interviewed several actors who worked on the movie the day of the shooting — but not every cast member spoke out about Halyna Hutchins‘ death.

Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna, which premiered on Tuesday, March 11, featured first-hand accounts from several stars of the movie, including Josh Hopkins and Devon Werkheiser. Director Joel Souza appeared in the doc as well after getting injured on set.

The Western film is set in Kansas during the 1880s, where an aging outlaw comes out of hiding to rescue his nephew, who is sentenced to hang for an accidental killing. The duo become fugitives who are determined to outrun a vicious bounty hunter.

Filming on Rust began in October 2021, at Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Production was suspended that same month when Hutchins was fatally shot from a prop gun fired by Rust star — and producer — Alec Baldwin while they were in preparation for a scene. Souza was injured by the same round.



Baldwin was charged with involuntary manslaughter in January 2023 and he has continued to deny pulling the trigger on the gun. Baldwin pleaded not guilty, and the charges were dropped in April 2023, but he was indicted again in connection with the death of Hutchins. The second case was ultimately dismissed by the judge and Baldwin has since filed a lawsuit accusing the prosecution team of malicious prosecution and civil rights violations.

Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was also charged and found guilty of involuntary manslaughter but not guilty of the additional charge of tampering with evidence. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison while Rust first assistant director David Halls pled guilty to negligent use of a deadly weapon, and received a suspended sentence and six months of probation. (Halls pleaded no contest in March 2023 to an additional misdemeanor charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon, for which he received a sentence of six months of unsupervised probation, a $500 fine and 24 hours of community service.)

Halls participated in Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna along with other crew members who shed light on the challenges that plagued the Rust set. The A-camera first assistant Lane Luper, who quit before the Rust shooting took place, recalled three “negligent discharges” taking place in the weeks before Hutchins' death.

In February 2022, the Hutchins family filed a lawsuit against Rust productions and other responsible parties including Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed. After extended negotiations, the parties reached a confidential settlement that provided for Rust to be completed. Production resumed in April 2023 and concluded the next month.

“I can never be around a weapon that will fire again — in any circumstance. I don't want to be around it and I want nothing to do with it. I can't be near it,” Souza mentioned in Hulu's doc. “There will be nothing that is capable of any discharge — you may as well be holding a paperweight.”

Andy Wert, who was brought in to replace Gutierrez-Reed, addressed his decision to join the production, saying, “I got the call and I thought someone has to do it and it might as well be me. Whenever you are on a film set, they are all treated like real weapons. That way everyone has a heightened sense of safety. I wanted to do it because of Halyna and so this gets done safely so everyone is comfortable. That is what the goal is and everyone goes home.”

Keep scrolling for a breakdown of which actors took part — and which didn't — in Hulu's doc about the Rust shooting and aftermath:


Baldwin's perspective was featured in the documentary through footage from his trial, body cam videos from the day of Hutchins' death and audio provided during an OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) investigation.

While Baldwin didn't speak out in the doc, he did return to finish filming Rust. He also elaborated on the incident in his TLC reality series with wife Hilaria Baldwin.

“This has been just surreal,” Alec told Hilaria during the season 1 premiere, which aired in February. “I can't even believe that we're going through this, and I always feel more in pain about you than I do. I think to myself that I'm going to try to my best to just get through it, and I think about what it's done to you and how much it's hurt you and everything.”

Alec elaborated in a confessional, saying, “This past year was just terrible. There were times I'd lay in bed. I'd go, ‘Wow, my kids. I can't get up.' That's not like me. I'm not like that at all, not in any way am I like that. Never.”

“My first day [on set], this girl [Hannah] comes over and interrupts our conversation. She has an arm full of guns — she just barreled her way in — and I thought that was so unsafe to be walking around with a bunch of guns in your hand,” Fisher recalled in the Hulu doc. “Alec seemed a little [confused] as well and then I found out she was the armorer.”

Later in the special, Fisher said it felt “a little emotional” to return. “I wish I said something to [Halyna] and Alec [at the time],” she noted about the interaction. Fisher admitted she “didn't want to make waves” but also wasn't sure her speaking out would have “changed anything.”

Fimmel was cast as bounty hunter Fenton “Preacher” Lang when Rust originally went into production. He wasn't featured in Hulu's doc and hasn't previously spoken out about the shooting. Multiple publications name Fimmel as one of the cast members who returned to finish filming the movie.

The role of Sheriff Wood Helm was originally played by Ackles but he was ultimately replaced by Josh Hopkins after the delayed production caused scheduling conflicts. Ackles didn't appear in the doc but he issued a statement after Hutchins' death.

“This has been a tragedy of epic proportions that we are all still processing,” he wrote via Instagram at the time. “Earlier last week I felt compelled to tell Halyna just how awesome I thought she was. I told her how incredible I thought her camera shots were and just how exciting it was to watch her and her team work. Truly. She laughed and said thank you and gave me a hug. I'll forever be thankful we had that moment. She had a spunk and passion that infected the entire crew from the top down.”

He continued: “She was an inspiration. My heart and prayers go out to Halyna's husband, son and the rest of her family. There just aren't enough words to express what an immense loss this is. She will be incredibly missed by all of us who knew and admired her.”

Hopkins was seemingly cast in a different role on Rust before taking over as Wood Helm after Ackles' exit.

“They said, ‘[Halyna's husband] Matt [Hutchins] wants it done.' I am not coming back for anything until I hear it from his mouth. And they put me on a Zoom with him and he said he wanted it finished and she would want it finished and for people to see her work,” Hopkins explained in the doc. “I am glad there is a different ending for the experience but this experience will never be over for anyone associated with it.”

Earlier in the doc, Hopkins slammed those who criticized their decision to finish Rust. “But the internet is going to [the] internet because it is the land of cowards and that can be enraging,” he noted. “They don't know anything about a movie set or the hearts of the people involved.”

The Nickelodeon star played Boone LaFontaine before — and after — the shooting halted production.

“On a set where we are shooting guns every day, the danger of that is horrifying. I could have been the person who shot someone or I could have been the person that was shot,” Werkheiser shared, while admitting it was “painful” watching Gutierrez-Reed go through the trial.

“Coming back and picking up where we left off, it felt like being alone in a sea of people. I guess that is how trauma and grief goes,” Werkheiser said in the doc. “Finishing this movie feels like some step toward healing.”

Busey portrayed Drum Parker but didn't appear in the doc.

“We finished Rust at the end of May, in Montana. The experience was amazing and I can't wait to see the film, as a lot of emotions went into this one. I didn't know Halyna but I know a lot of her friends, and this film was finished with the utmost effort to pay homage and respect to her while exhibiting and sharing her last work with the world,” he wrote via Instagram in 2024. “She was an amazing woman from those I've spoken to. I'm so sorry to have not met her and though it is tragic, her memory is forever preserved in this film. We finished it in her honor. In somber mind, with loving hearts. It was a close and dedicated crew.”

Noon was originally cast as Lucas but his other commitments made him unavailable when production picked back up. He was replaced in the role by McDermott and neither appeared in Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna.

Adam Levine and Kate Hudson's friendship goes all the way back to the classroom.

“We've known each other since high school,” Levine, 45, shared on the Monday, March 10, episode of The Voice.

Hudson, 45, replied, “I actually might have been at one of your first gigs.”

Although the actress attended Crossroads School for Arts & Sciences in Santa Monica, California, and Levine went to Brentwood School nearby in West Los Angeles, the pair have remained in touch through the years.



When Levine needed a mentor to help guide his team for season 27 of The Voice, he knew just who to call.

“Kate Hudson is a household name and has been for years, and now she's venturing into this new career, which is awesome,” he said in a confessional interview. “It's actually kind of annoying because she's good at everything.”

Perhaps the cherry on top of Hudson's involvement is that she's been a viewer of NBC's long-running singing competition show for many years.

“I've been a fan of the show, watched the show,” she explained. “So much of my life has been in acting and performing, but music was always my love. To be here connecting through music is really special.”

While Hudson first found success on the big screen with hits like How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and the Oscar-winning film Almost Famous, she dipped her toes into music when she released her debut album Glorious in May 2024. The body of work ended up on the Billboard charts.

When asked about Levine's success in Maroon 5, Hudson said she wasn't surprised he turned into a rockstar.

“His first band, they were always playing somewhere,” she told Entertainment Tonight in an interview published on Tuesday, March 4. “It's amazing to see his success and then to be here doing this with him, it feels very familiar, yet surreal at the same time.”

Hudson got to work quickly on Monday's episode of The Voice when she mentored Levine's contestants for the Battle Rounds, including Darius J and Britton Moore.

After acknowledging how “competitive” Levine is, Hudson joked that she wasn't sure if she had what it takes to be a full-on coach.

“I can't wait to hear this,” she shared before realizing Levine has to pick only one contestant from each Battle Round to advance. “I'm so glad I don't have to make that decision.”

The Voice airs on NBC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET. Stream old episodes anytime on Peacock.

Some of Bachelor Nation's newest members may be headed to the beach for season 10 of Bachelor in Paradise.

The women of The Bachelor season 29 exclusively told Us Weekly whether they're interested in continuing their journey for love on Bachelor in Paradise. “I am still looking for love. I am single, if anyone is out there,” Sarafiena Watkins told Us after the Women Tell All taping. “I feel like there has to be people that would entice me to go, I am really serious about finding someone.”

Sarafiena, 29, was sent home ahead of this season's hometown dates. Even though Grant Ellis wasn't The One for her, Sarafiena told Us she'd be down to date another member of Bachelor Nation.

“I am just so open,” she shared. “I feel like if there is a good match for me, let me know.”



Alexe Godin, who was also eliminated ahead of Grant's hometown dates, told Us that “it would be fun” to join Paradise, even though she's never watched a “full season” of the Bachelor spinoff. “I have watched a couple of episodes, and it is more my speed,” she stated. “It is a little more lighthearted, more fun, more goofy, and I think that is me. I would have a good time and have [the] potential to meet my future husband there.”

Calling herself a “broken record,” Alexe, 27 admitted that she's not familiar enough with the men of Bachelor Nation to have her sights set on someone specific in Paradise. Luckily, the fans have a pick in mind for her.

“I keep hearing from people that Jonathon [Johnson] and I would make a cute couple,” she told Us of Jenn Tran's third place contestant from The Bachelorette season 21. “I went to hug him tonight and he said, ‘Don't hug too tight, people are going to scream.' I have heard really good feedback from people that he is a really good guy, so who knows? I keep saying, him and Tanner [Courtad] [are] cute, I think we can all agree.”

Another member of Grant's Bachelor cast interested in joining the season 10 cast of Paradise is Alli Jo Hinkes, who went home during the third rose ceremony of the season. “If I got asked to do Paradise and I was single at that point of my life … possibly,” she told Us. “We will see.”

Dina Lupancu, however, is “not sure” whether Paradise is in the cards for her after a drama-filled season. “Being in the experience again and seeing the girls, it made me miss it,” she said of the Women Tell All taping. “But I don't know. I also haven't stalked any of the guys, so I have to do that.”

Dina, 31, was sent home following her hometown date during the show's March 3 episode, while Juliana Pasquarosa, Litia Garr and Zoe McGrady all advanced to the fantasy suite dates. At the Women Tell All taping, Dina told Us she knew she wasn't going to make it to Grant's final three during her hometown date, which her family declined to participate in.

“Something that was hard for me, and I didn't realize until I lived it, was that when you are waiting for your hometown — and mine was last, there is, like, 7 days [of waiting],” she explained. “Before that was a travel day and then the date in Scotland, we barely got to talk. So you are talking [about] nine days when we didn't see each other, we didn't talk, we don't have our phones, so you don't have anything to continue to foster that connection.”

She went on to note that it took her “a few weeks” to get over her breakup with Grant.

Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright certainly aren't the only couple struggling in The Valley.

In the first trailer for season 2 of Bravo's hit reality show released Tuesday, March 11, the cast continues to deal with the fallout of both long-term relationships dissolving and the rumor mill continuing to run wild.

“Jax has been seeing people,” Brittany shares in one scene. “He had a girl staying here in the house again last night. There is a thong on my bathroom sink. Why was there a baby wipe on top of it?”

Later, Jax is seemingly served with divorce papers as Brittany shares what she wants from him and their relationship going forward.



“I already told him — filing, restraining order and custody,” she explains before accusing her estranged husband of having “people watching me.”

In August 2024, Brittany filed for divorce from Jax after five years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple share 3-year-old son Cruz. One month earlier, Us Weekly confirmed that Jax entered a 30-day treatment program to address his ongoing mental health struggles.

Most recently, the former Vanderpump Rules star admitted in the March 4 episode of Alex Baskin's “Hot Mic” podcast that he was an addict and had been sober for 83 days.

“I'm at the point where I'm so in love with the man I want to become,” Jax tearfully shares in one scene, “that I'm just not satisfied with who I am anymore.”

While Jax and Brittany try to coparent, Jesse Lally and Michelle Saniei are struggling to keep the peace as they move forward with their divorce while raising daughter Isabella, 4.

“You're a f—ing drunk,” Michelle claims in an explosive argument with her ex. Jesse responds, “Well she's a hooker so it's fine.”



Michelle, however, has the last word when she reminds Jesse, “I'm the mother of your f—ing child.”

Even couples who appeared stronger than ever in season 1 now find themselves facing rumors and wild accusations.

Kristen Doute accuses Janet Caperna's husband Jason of taking his wedding ring off when he goes out. As for Nia Sanchez's husband Danny Booko, rumors spread that he gets “wasted and handsy and inappropriate.”

In a surprise turn of events, Kristen's relationship appears to be in a strong spot as she accepts a romantic proposal from Luke Broderick.

“Who would have thought Kristen and Luke had the best relationship out of all of us?” Jax asks at one point in the season.

Season 2 of The Valley — which will feature appearances from Lala Kent, Tom Schwartz, Scheana Shay and Brock Davies — premieres on Bravo Tuesday, April 15, at 9 p.m. ET. Stream old episodes anytime on Peacock.

Molly Ringwald reflected on being a muse for late writer-director John Hughes in his 1980s comedies while she was a teenager.

“It's peculiar,” Ringwald, 57, admitted to long-time friend Monica Lewinsky during the Tuesday, March 11 episode of the “Reclaiming with Monica Lewinsky” podcast.

Ringwald became an icon of the 1980s thanks in large part to her work with Hughes, who cast her as romantic leads in 1984's Sixteen Candles, 195's The Breakfast Club and 1986's Pretty in Pink.

In her latest interview, Ringwald delved into the complexities of Hughes — who died in 2009 at age 59 — writing Sixteen Candles for her based solely off seeing her headshot when she was only 15 years old.



“In terms of, did I know that I was a ‘muse,' he told me that but when you're that age, I had nothing really to compare it to,” she recalled.

Ringwald added that despite her age disparity with Hughes, who was in his 30s at the time, she actually had “done more movies” than the filmmaker before Sixteen Candles because she worked as a child actress.

“Sixteen Candles was his directorial debut,” she noted. “I had done a few movies … I had actually had more experience but I was still only 15 years old so I didn't have a lot of life experience. It didn't seem that strange to me [that I was Hughes's muse]. Now, it does.”

Ringwald hedged slightly when Lewinsky, 51, asked if she felt her working relationship with Hughes was “weird [or] creepy,” before answering with a laugh: “It's peculiar. It's complimentary. I always felt it was incredibly complimentary.”

“Looking back on it, there is something a little peculiar,” she continued.

Lewinsky asked what it was like for Ringwald to reexamine her relationship with Hughes as an adult, since it all started with the filmmaker “staring” at her teenage head shot.

“It's complex. It's definitely complex,” Ringwald acknowledged. “It's something that I turn over in my head a lot and try to figure out, how that all affected me. I feel like I'm still processing all of that and I probably will until the day I die.”

Ringwald previously examined the complexities of working with Hughes in a 2018 essay for The New Yorker, where she discussed the power-imbalance in their relationship.

“John believed in me, and in my gifts as an actress, more than anyone else I've known, and he was the first person to tell me that I had to write and direct one day,” she wrote at the time. “He was also a phenomenal grudge-keeper, and he could respond to perceived rejection in much the same way the character of Bender did in The Breakfast Club. But I'm not thinking about the man right now but of the films that he left behind. Films that I am proud of in so many ways.”

In her new podcast interview, Ringwald looked back on what it meant to be internationally famous as a teenager, telling Lewinsky that it may have been easier for her than most since she'd had “varying degrees of fame” as a child.

“I've been a performer since I was 3. Literally, since I was 3 years old on stage,” she pointed out.

Since Ringwald acted in community theater from such a young age, she often felt like a “celebrity” to the people who came to watch her perform.

“I was written about. It was a sort of fame, a degree of fame,” she remembered. “Then, everything I did, I sort of became a little bit more well-known. You move to Los Angeles and, of course, nobody knew who I was until I started to do [movies].”

She went on: “I feel like I've never known a world where I haven't been a little famous … At a certain point, then I became really, really famous. I feel like, when you're on the cover of Time magazine … when it gets to that point, it becomes a level of fame that I don't personally feel that comfortable with.”

Ringwald was initially “happy” with the projects she was making as a teen superstar, but slowly began to feel “all the fame and notoriety” was “really overwhelming and scary.”

“[The fame] changed me a bit,” she said. “Maybe this is just who I am but there's a part of it where I felt like I became very closed and very self-protective.”

In recent years, Ringwald has publicly grappled with the legacy of her films with Hughes, which have been criticized for outdated depictions of sexism and racism.

The '80s icon told Andy Cohen in a 2021 interview that, while rewatching her classic films with daughter Mathilda, it was important to put them in the context of the time in which they were made.

“I feel like that's what makes the movies really wonderful, and it's also something I wanted to go on record talking about — the elements that I find troubling and that I want to change for the future,” she argued. “But that doesn't mean at all that I want them to be erased. I'm proud of those movies, and I have a lot of affection for them. They're so much a part of me.”

“Reclaiming with Monica Lewinsky” releases new episodes Tuesdays on Wondery.

Despite being one of the leads on NBC's Parenthood, Dax Shepard made a surprising revelation about his six-season run on the NBC drama.

“I know I was making among the lowest of all the actors,” Shepard, 50, revealed on the Monday, March 10 episode of his “Armchair Expert” podcast. He made the salary revelation while recalling working with costars to buy presents for the show's crew. “The amount of emails that would go back and forth to decide whether we were getting this mug or this f—ing … it was impossible,” he quipped.

Parenthood, which ran from 2010 to 2015, followed the lives of the Braverman family as they dealt with familiar drama and everyday ups and downs. Shepard played Crosby, one of the four Braverman siblings, alongside Peter Krause, Lauren Graham and Erika Christensen. The series also starred Craig T. Nelson and Bonnie Bedelia as the family's patriarch and matriarch, Zeek and Camille Braverman, respectively.

On the podcast, Shepard noted that prior to working on Parenthood, he “made it a point to find out what everyone was making” on the set of his other projects. “I'd always figure it out. I'd either get in a conversation where I'd get it out of them or I'd back channel through an agent,” he shared. “I would figure it out.”



However, Shepard decided to abandon the idea while filming Parenthood. “I went into Parenthood going, ‘I'm purposely gonna not find out,' and I was so happy on the show,” he said before poking fun at his costar Tyree Brown, who played Crosby's son, Jabbar. “I was like, ‘If I find out Jabbar's making twice as much as me, how can I enjoy going to work?'”

He added, “That was the first time I ever broke that habit. Boy, was it a blessing.”

While Shepard has fond memories of his time on the series, he's not interested in bringing the show back to the small screen. “I don't desire to act at all, but I deeply miss being on Parenthood,” he shared. “And there is a version of that show I would probably do if it were eight episodes or 10 episodes, I could manage my now real job.”

Monday's podcast served as a mini Parenthood reunion, as Graham, 57, was Shepard's guest. During the episode, Graham accidentally revealed that actor Carlos Valdes is the father of Mae Whitman's son, whom she welcomed in August 2024. Whitman, who played Graham's daughter on Parenthood, had not previously disclosed the identity of her baby's dad.

“I'm trying to think of the last time [I saw her]. They're in New York now,” the Gilmore Girls alum said on the podcast. “Carlos, her baby daddy, is on Broadway in Hadestown, which I feel happy to plug because he's fantastic in it, Carlos Valdes. … He's really great. And so, they're in New York for the next while and then she got this job in Ireland. So she's in Ireland with the baby.”

While announcing the birth of her son last year, Whitman, 36, revealed she named her child after her former Parenthood onscreen sibling, Miles Heizer. “He is the kindest, gentlest, smartest, funniest little beebee and he's our best friend (pretty much exactly like his namesake Uncle Miles,” she wrote via Instagram at the time. “We are infinitely grateful he chose us as his parents.”

Gabi Elnicki knew on The Bachelor that Zach Shallcross was not The One for her — and now she can see why he and Kaity Biggar made the perfect match.

“I actually realized when I was there that he was not my person,” Gabi, 27, admitted on the Monday, March 10, episode of the “Almost Famous” podcast. “But when I got back, I was like, ‘Thank god.' No offense to him. Him and Kaity are perfect together.”

Gabi said that she “totally” understands Zach, 28, and Kaity, 30 — who ultimately got engaged in the 2023 season 27 finale — as a couple.

“Being so close with Kaity, I get it much more now,” Gabi said. “Just me, to be honest with you, I'm, like, not probably nice enough. I don't think he could have handled me because I'm sassy. Kaity is very sweet and she's just a nurse. I know myself, I'm a little feisty. I don't think that we would have been compatible in the long run. Like, I'm really kind and really sweet but I pick at people as a joke. Like, I'm very sarcastic and I just don't know if that would have landed well.”



Gabi gushed that she's “so happy” for Kaity and her relationship with Zach — who she thinks has “changed” since his stint as the lead of the ABC reality show.

“We honestly see Zach the Bachelor as a totally different person than her Zac that she has now. I see Kaity a lot, and just hearing about their relationship, it's totally different and I really think it's for the best. They're very happy,” Gabi said. “I think he's changed as a person since the show, or at least from what Kaity and I's conversation have been. I think everyone has. I mean, you're in this bubble and he was having to be the Bachelor so I'm sure that comes with so much pressure. Everything has worked out the way that it was supposed to.”

Since her split from Zach, Gabi has moved on with Zach Espinosa — her friend from Houston that encouraged her to find love on The Bachelor.

“He was like, ‘This is going to be really good for you. You really can't lose anything. If you come back, you could possibly find someone. And if not, think about all of the people that will see you, and then you will find someone,'” she recalled, adding that he was “really just such a supportive friend through it.”

After The Bachelor, the pair went out for dinner and Gabi realized she had feelings for Espinosa and “one thing led to another.” The couple have now been together for nearly two years.

As for whether she thinks she's now found The One in Espinosa, Gabi gushed, “Definitely. I don't really see myself with anyone else. I feel like this is just a really good, healthy relationship.”

The countdown is on for Grant Ellis' finale of The Bachelor, which will see the lead torn between his final two women.

“In the position I am in, I'm going to get backlash regardless,” the 31-year-old lead told Us Weekly about the upcoming finale during an exclusive interview at the Women Tell All taping. “I think a lot of people don't know how hard it is to be in a relationship with different people — for the best, I wouldn't recommend it.”

Grant noted that he did “the best that I could” as he developed feelings for multiple women.

“But what I want people to know about me is that I love hard,” he said. “I lead with my heart, and when you are in a situation and you are very open, you are bound to develop feelings.”



Grant is currently down to his final three: Juliana Pasquarosa, Litia Garr and Zoe McGrady. Fans will have to watch the finale to see who gets the final rose — and whether watching back his feelings for his runner-up will affect his relationship with his fiancée.

Contestant Alli Jo Hinkes told Us at the Women Tell All that “it would definitely be hard to hear” how torn Grant was if you were his winner.

“At the end of the day, this is what we signed up for and it is going to be a difficult decision,” she explained. “And these are the biggest decisions that you could make in your life. I would have concerns if he wasn't concerned — it's your future.”

Alexe Godin, who got the first impression rose, also had empathy for Grant.

“You have two different girls. So if he fell in love with two different parts of these women for two opposite different reasons, I can see how hard it could be,” she said. “Putting myself in his shoes, they are so different, but in such great ways. I don't know what I would have done either. It would sting because you want that person to be so sure, but you are also on The Bachelor, so yes, he's going to have feelings for more than one person. I would focus on developing that relationship post-show.”

Sarafiena Watkins also understands, calling Grant an “empathetic and a caring person.”

“Understanding the process and knowing that Grant is a person that gives 100 percent of his heart, I could understand why he would have such a tough decision between two beautiful amazing women,” she said. “I feel like it would be something to talk through, but I can see why it is so hard. … I think he genuinely can fall in love with two women.”

While the promo for the finale hints that Grant was down to the wire when it came to making his final choice, he denied it was that close in a separate interview with Us for his cover story.

“It definitely wasn't [down to] one hour. There were external factors that played into me being hesitant,” he said. “You don't wanna hurt people. You have a lot of weight in terms of being a lead of a different ethnic group. There's a different level of pressure that comes with being a man of color in this role — and a different expectation. It leads to some added thinking that deserves a little extra time. There were some things that really weighed and were hard for me. But ultimately, you go with what makes you happy and you go with what you feel is gonna be the best decision for your future.”

The Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.

CBS is shaking up the FBI franchise in a big way. 

The network just announced that FBI: International and FBI: Most Wanted will both be canceled after their current seasons, leaving fans wondering what happened.

Keep reading to find out more…

While CBS hasn't officially stated a reason, all signs point to a major franchise overhaul. 

The network is currently making room in the programming schedule for a brand-new spin-off, FBI: CIA, currently in development with creator Dick Wolf. 

The move suggests CBS is shifting their focus to fresh projects, rather than maintaining long-running spin-offs.

The cancellations still come as a surprise, especially given the success of both series. FBI: Most Wanted premiered in 2020 and will end after its sixth season, while FBI: International, which debuted in 2021, will end with Season 4.

However, there may have been signs of this series shake-up happening as early as last year: Back in May 2024, CBS announced cost-cutting measures, reducing minimum episode guarantees for the cast of FBI and FBI: Most Wanted. The budget trims potentially hinted at a shift in priorities for the network.

CBS has also used this strategy before: NCIS: Hawai'i was canceled just months before the debut of NCIS: Origins, a prequel to the long-running crime drama. 

As a result, it would not come as a surprise if the network was once again replacing established spin-offs with newer ones to keep audiences engaged.

As for FBI: CIA, details are still under wraps, but the show will reportedly follow a dedicated FBI agent and a street-smart CIA agent as they join forces to combat domestic terrorism in New York City. 

The series is now casting for three series regular roles. The pilot will air as a springtime episode of FBI. If ordered to series, FBI: CIA would premiere during the 2025-26 TV season. Get more details.

Alysha Burney, who was known for her viral TikTok parody videos, has sadly passed away.  

Charles Burney, Alysha's brother, said that she died of an asthma attack in her sleep on March 2, the day before her 25th birthday. He says he was with her at the time of her passing while they were vacationing in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. 

“She was not selfish with her knowledge and was a very open book about her journey. She will always be dearly loved, and her legacy will live on forever. [She was] very goal-oriented, creative, and passionate about giving back,"" Charles told Fox4News on Monday (March 10). 

Keep reading to find out more...

Charles also wants to shut down rumors regarding her cause of death.

“She does not do drugs. She was a self-loving and happy individual who cherished her life and was looking forward to the upcoming year's plans. There's a spread of misinformation online, stating different things based on speculation. These sources lack credibility and should not be believed,” he added.

Charles took to Instagram to confirm the news on Sunday (March 9), asking for fans to ""allow our family time to grieve during this time.""

Alysha amassed over 5 million followers across her TikTok, Youtube, and Instagram platforms, and owned her own production company. A Kansas City native, she graduated from University of Central Missouri with a Bachelor's of Science in Digital Media Production. 

Our thoughts are with Alysha's loved ones at this incredibly difficult time.

Aimee Lou Wood portrays the role of Chelsea on season three of HBO's The White Lotus and fans are absolutely loving her performance.

About filming with a largely American cast, she told THR, “These people live in Holly­wood. I live in my little flat in South East London, and I'm so British in my sensibility that I wasn't sure how to handle being around so many people who are so front-footed and confident. All I ever do is take the piss out of myself."" 

About her teeth, she added, ""Even the way [White Lotus fans] are talking about me and my teeth — that I don't have veneers or Botox — it feels a bit rebellious,"" she shared.

She said some of the American culture she experienced while hanging out with The White Lotus cast did have an impact.

“I would be more confident now to talk to a director about an idea I have, or just to make shit happen. The first thing I did out of drama school was a play, and I remember thinking it was so cool that I was getting paid for it. Then I got Sex Education and thought it was just a fluke; even when it erupted, I figured my success would pass. It was basically just last week that I woke up and went, ‘What the hell is my life?'” she shared.

Lily James is spending time with Christopher Jones.

Lily was seen leaving Siena restaurant with Christopher on Sunday night (March 9) in Paris, France.

Lily and Christopher were seen getting into the backseat of a car together following their night on the town during Paris Fashion Week. 

It's unclear if Lily and Christopher are just friends, or more than that, though it's important to note that he is the brother of Lily's longtime friend Emma Holly Jones. So it's possible that this was just a friendly outing!

Christopher has been linked to model Lorena Rae for years and it's unclear if they are still together or not. 

Lily was most recently linked to rocker Michael Shuman, though we haven't had an update on their relationship in over a year.

The father of Mae Whitman‘s baby boy has been revealed!

Back in August 2024, the 36-year-old Good Girls actress announced the birth of her first child, a baby boy named Miles. However, she never publicly revealed who the father of her son is.

While making an appearance on Dax Shepard‘s Armchair Expert podcast on Monday (March 10), Lauren Graham shared the actor who is the father of Mae‘s baby.

Keep reading to find out more…If you forgot, Mae, Lauren, and Dax all starred together on Parenthood, which ran for six seasons from 2010 to 2015.

“I'm envious of your relationship with Mae,” Dax told Lauren. “First of all, it's the sweetest relationship. It really is special.”

Lauren, who has remained super close with Mae, responded, “It really is. I still get a little thrill when she'll text me back because it's not a given. And she's a mom now, and she's working and she's in Ireland.” 

The two then went on to gush over Mae before Dax said that he wants to meet her son Miles “so bad.”

That's when Lauren revealed that the father of Mae‘s son is Carlos Valdes.



“I'm trying to think the last time [I saw her],” Lauren said. “They're in New York now. Carlos, her baby daddy, is on Broadway in Hadestown, which I feel happy to plug because he's fantastic in it, Carlos Valdes.”

“He's really great,” she continued. “And so they're in New York for the next while and then she got this job in Ireland. So she's in Ireland with the baby.” 

As of right now, the nature of Mae‘s relationship with Carlos, 35, is unclear. The two previously played love interests in the 2022 Hulu series Up Here and Mae shared several photos with Carlos on her Instagram, but hasn't posted any photos of him since July 2023.

Natalie Portman is enjoying public nights out with her new boyfriend, French musician Tanguy Destable!

The 43-year-old Oscar-winning actress was seen supporting Tanguy, 44, while joining him at the Louis Vuitton after party during Paris Fashion Week on Monday (March 10) in Paris, France.

Tanguy produces music for Louis Vuitton shows and while Natalie was not at the show, she did help him celebrate at the after party.

It was reported last week that Natalie and Tanguy are in a new relationship and while they were first linked this month, it's unclear how long they've actually been together.

Natalie and ex-husband Benjamin Millepied finalized their divorce in early 2024. At the time, we learned that they had quietly separated the previous year. The pair got married in August 2012 and share two children - son Aleph, 13, and daughter Amalia, eight.

After the split, some romance rumors briefly linked her to Paul Mescal. However, sources were quick to clarify that they were just friends. 

Benjamin debuted a new relationship in November 2024.

Ben Affleck will make sure his children know the value of a dollar.

When speaking with Access Hollywood at the premiere of ""The Accountant 2"" at the SXSW film festival, the 52-year-old actor humorously addressed a video that went viral recently, featuring his teenage son admiring a $6,000 pair of Dior Air Force 1s.

""That's what happens when you tell a motherf---er they have to mow a lawn,"" he told the outlet. ""All of a sudden they don't want those shoes, and he was like, ‘But I always said they were tough.'""

He asked the reporter if she had any children, then explained, ""It's always some grift why I need to be … I'm like, 'Man, you do not need thousand-dollar shoes!' He's like, 'We have the money.' I'm like, 'I have the money, you're broke!'""

Ben Affleck Relishes Jennifer Garner Family Time, Stark Turnaround From Red Carpet Life

In the original video, Affleck and his son Samuel, 13, could be seen browsing various pairs of shoes at a sneaker convention, where Samuel spotted the Dior shoes. Upon seeing the hefty price tag, Affleck told his son, ""That's a lot of lawns you gotta mow there.""

Read On The Fox News App

The ""Gone Girl"" actor shares Samuel with his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner, along with two older daughters; Violet, 19, and Seraphina, 16.

Their eldest daughter, Violet, graduated from high school in May 2024 and has spent the past school year studying at Yale. Garner shared her reaction to her daughter's graduation on Instagram at the time, posting a series of photos, including a teary-eyed photo of her cheering on Violet during a graduation event.

""Tell me you have a graduate without telling me you have a graduate,"" she wrote in the caption. ""(Bless our hearts)."" The remaining photos featured her crying while on a plane and another one of her wearing ""2024"" glasses.

Affleck and Garner first announced their split to the public in 2015, after 10 years of marriage, and later finalized their divorce in 2018. Although they have both moved on and have dated, and in his case, married other people, they remain close as co-parents.

""When you have children with somebody you're connected to them forever,"" he told ""Good Morning America"" in February 2020. ""And I'm very lucky she is the mother of my children. I'm very grateful and respectful of her. Our marriage didn't work, and that's difficult. Both of us really believe that it's important for kids to see their parents respect one another and get along, whether they're together or not.""

The couple have been spotted together many times over the years, most recently on a paintball outing with one of their children. While the internet is swirling with reconciliation rumors, a source told Fox News Digital they had ""a bunch of good energy around them,"" and that ""you can just tell they were mainly there for their kid.""

Video footage from the paintball event shows Affleck hugging Garner from the side as she points her paintball gun at a target off-screen. He later picks up his own paintball gun, after Garner does not return the hug.

""Many couples who are divorced and co-parenting stand with distance between their bodies as a way to maintain emotional distance,"" body language expert, Nicole Moore, told Fox News Digital. ""However, Ben and Jen's bodies appear to be actively leaning in toward one another, indicating that they still share emotional intimacy.""

Following their divorce, Affleck rekindled his romance with Jennifer Lopez. The two were married for roughly two years, before finalizing their divorce in February 2025. Garner has been linked to John Miller, chairman of CaliGroup, since 2018, and although they took a break at one point, People reports they have been together since 2023.

Stephen Colbert began his monologue Monday by addressing President Donald Trump's economy. Not only has the Dow Jones dropped significantly, Colbert pointed out, but so has the nation's projected GDP growth.

“According to the Atlanta Fed, so far growth in the current quarter was a stunning negative 2.8 percent,"" Colbert said.

He noted that this means that “the GDP is shrinking at the fastest pace since the pandemic lockdown.”

Colbert joked, “In the first Trump term, it took a disease to destroy the economy. This time, he is the disease.”

But although Colbert has taken plenty of shots at Trump over the past few weeks for his handling of the economy, tonight he took aim at Fox Business Network's Charlie Gasparino for his spin on the crisis.

“Who cares if we take the Dow down to 35,000, if that's what happens? Nobody will care,” Gasparino said in the clip Colbert showed. “We avoided a recession. We reoriented the economy to the private sector. It's going to go up, because [Trump's] plan is to unleash this sort of animal spirit.”

“He's what? He's going to unleash the animal spirit?” Colbert joked. “That's not the advice you get from your financial guy. That's what the shaman says as he's pouring the ayahuasca down your throat.”

The term “animal spirit” is a fairly common one among Wall Street experts. It was first coined in 1936, and is often used to describe how herd mentality can affect market trends. For Colbert, however, it didn't seem to be a convincing argument in Trump's favor.

“Trump's twitchy tariff hand is bumming out everybody on Wall Street,” Colbert noted. He quoted a TIME magazine article reporting that Wall Street investors are “exhausted” by Trump's behavior.

“Do you know how hard it is to exhaust Wall Street?” said Colbert. “They wake up every morning to a hot cup of cocaine, and then, just to take the edge off, more cocaine.”","{'href': 'https://news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News'}"

Wendy Williams says she passed her competency tests with ""flying colors.""

One day after being rushed to a New York hospital, the former daytime television host spoke with Rosanna Scotto on a live segment of ""Good Day New York"" on Tuesday to discuss the outcome of her competency tests.

Williams said she is currently in the hospital and passed her tests with ""flying colors.""

""Everybody knows factually that Wendy is not incapacitated,"" Ginalisa Monterrosa, a caretaker for Williams, told Scotto.

Wendy Williams Hospitalized For 'Evaluation' After Receiving Welfare Check

During an appearance on ""The Breakfast Club"" that same morning, Williams further explained why she pleaded to go to a medical facility and get evaluated by an independent doctor.

""The police showed up. I'm exhausted. I wanted to go to the hospital to talk to the doctor,"" Williams, who has been under a court-appointed guardianship since May 2022, told the hosts.

Monterroso said that they have been laser-focused on trying to get ""some kind of motion"" into the TV personality's guardianship case.

""We were pretty stuck at one point waiting for the lawyers to break through and get some type of trial,"" Monterroso said while on ""The Breakfast Club."" ""I did two things. I wrote a letter to the Adult Protective Services and explained to them Wendy's situation. She was isolated and needed an investigation.""

""Yesterday morning, during our morning calls, I told Wendy, 'We will be calling the police and telling them that you're isolated.' I pleaded with the police as if Wendy was my child. ‘Please you need to get her off this floor. She is confined.'""

Williams said during her chat with law enforcement, she told them ""I am not incapacitated as I've been accused [of].""

""This floor that I live on is the memory unit,"" Williams explained. ""The people who live there don't remember anything, unlike me. Why am I here? What is going on? It's a cry for help.""

When officers visited Williams at the current facility she is residing in, Monterrosa said the TV host began to feel ""a little bit of anxiety.""

Monterrosa explained that she advised Williams to ask police officers to take her to a hospital and ask for an independent doctor to conduct a medical evaluation. Monterrosa said the facility was giving them a ""hard time,"" but they were eventually able to get Williams to a local hospital.

""When I got to the hospital, I got checked in,"" Williams said. ""They checked me for the heart palpitations, they did all kinds of scans.""

Moterrosa explained that both Williams' guardian and attorney were both present at the hospital, but shared a ""difference in opinion"" about how to proceed with the evaluations.

After the doctor cleared her evaluations through the hospital's legal department, Williams took two competency evaluations, said Monterrosa.

""She passed both tests,"" she said.

""On Monday, the NYPD responded to a welfare check at 505 West 35 Street,"" the New York Police Department said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

""EMS responded and transported a 60-year-old female to an area hospital for evaluation.""

According to the New York Post, Williams had thrown a handwritten note that read ""Help! Wendy!!"" out the window.

Fox News Digital has reached out to Williams and Monterrosa for further comment.

Earlier this year, Williams denied she was cognitively impaired and admitted during an interview with ""The Breakfast Club"" that her guardianship felt like a ""prison.""

""I am not cognitively impaired but I feel like I am in prison,"" Williams said in January. ""I'm in this place with people who are in their 90s and their 80s and their 70s. .... These people, there's something wrong with these people here on this floor. I am clearly not.""

""Where I am… you have to get keys to unlock the door to press the elevator to go downstairs, first of all. Second of all, these people here, everybody here is like nursemaids, so to speak,"" she said. Williams admitted she isn't privy to what medication she's given. ""Excuse me, doctor, can you tell me what this pill is for?""

In February 2024, Williams' team announced she had been diagnosed with both progressive aphasia and frontotemporal dementia.

""Boob jobs, blame and OnlyFans.""

That is how one ""Harry Potter"" actress introduced her podcast, as she opened up about her new venture on the social media platform primarily known for adult content.

Jessie Cave, who played Rupert Grint's character Ron Weasley's girlfriend in the popular franchise, confessed she joined OnlyFans to pay off her debt.

""I'll try for one year,"" Cave wrote on her personal Substack. ""My aim? To get the house safe, cover the arsenic/lead wallpaper, build a new roof etc. My aim? To get out of debt. My aim? To empower myself? To prove to those in the past who have misjudged me that I'm not so sweet? To put time into something I never invested in before: self-love.""

Cave, 37, shared that her adult content is very ""niche"" and explained her OnlyFans will focus on a ""slutty Mormon"" demeanor.

""It's very much geared toward people who have an interest or fetish with hair,"" Cave said on her ""Before We Break Up Again"" podcast. ""I do a lot of videos with my hair on Instagram and I have now for a while. I just noticed that I always get comments.""

""They're never sexually depraved or lascivious. It's never dirty comments, but I do get lots of interest in the hair thing and I just thought, 'F--- it, I'm going to do something that is very niche,'"" she added.

While the mom-of-four understands she may get criticized for her content on the site, Cave found joining OnlyFans to be ""quite liberating.""

""I really am choosing to think of this as an empowering moment for me because I have been this very straight, prim actress for a lot of my career and this is very much a way of me saying, 'Okay, I'm doing something that is not normal. This is weird and me and a bit kinky. And why not?'""

Despite OnlyFans being known for sexually explicit content, the ""Harry Potter"" alum plans to keep her content less R-rated.

""I do NICHE HAIR CONTENT which you may well quite like. How magical!"" she noted. ""If you have a hair thing, this is the place for you. If you want something specific, you can message me and I will be happy to see what we can do.""

SANTA FE, N.M. — Gene Hackman didn't want to slow down, according to friends in the Santa Fe community he spent almost 40 years in with his wife, Betsy Arakawa Hackman, by his side.

Stephen Marshall, a retired FBI agent who trained them through a community outreach program, recalled the Oscar-winner was ""bothered"" by aging.

""Gene was concerned about the fact that he was getting older. He didn't like being old, and seeing himself on film bothered him because he knew he didn't look like that anymore,"" Marshall, who later became a friend of the Hackmans, told Fox News Digital.

He recalled inviting Gene and Betsy to a screening of one of Gene's films, ""Night Moves,"" but the invitation was declined.

Gene Hackman Death: Complete Coverage

""She said Gene broke into a cold sweat when she brought it up, but he just ... didn't want to be any part of it. And so I tried to respect that.""

Read On The Fox News App

He continued, ""When we went out, he didn't want to advertise who he was. I remember the first time we went out, we're walking down the street in Santa Fe, and I noticed people noticing him. And I said, ‘Do you get used to the idea of people going, ""Hey, that's Gene Hackman""'? And he said, ""Yeah, but now they add, ‘And he got so old.'"" So I thought he looked much younger. I thought he looked great, but he was concerned that he had aged and that bothered him.""

Marshall first met Gene and Betsy at a picnic event celebrating the 100th anniversary of the FBI, and he later trained them through a citizens' academy, a program to help people learn about the bureau.

""I got to talk to them a little bit more as we took him to the range one day. We shot all the bureau guns, and I had a business card with my cellphone number I was going to give Betsy at the end of the academy and tell her, ‘If you guys ever need anything, just give me a call.' And as I was walking up to give it to her, she turned around and handed me a Post-it note that she had already filled out with her phone number and email and said, ‘Gene and I would like [to] take you to dinner if you have time.' And I'm thinking, ‘I think I can squeeze it in!' And so we went to dinner a couple of weeks later, and after that we just became friends.""

Gene Hackman Told Friend He Would Have Died 'Long Ago' Without Wife Betsy

Marshall hadn't seen them for a while before their deaths, recalling Gene was ""starting to have some issues with age. And so I was seeing them less and less often. They were going out less.""

Gene died around Feb. 18 due to hypertensive and atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributing factor, New Mexico officials confirmed last week. He was likely alone in their home for about a week after Betsy died due to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is transmitted from animals to humans and is commonly found in rodents.

While many friends remarked upon the couple's private behavior, all were impressed by how active and engaged they were, particularly Gene.

Mike Anaya, a sports medicine specialist with Santa Fe Spa, told Fox News Digital, ""Gene, at 84, he had a background in the Marines. He used to box in the Marines. So he was a tough guy. And he knew what he was doing.""

Anaya first worked with Gene after Betsy reached out along with a referral from a doctor to address a shoulder injury.

After rehabbing the shoulder injury, Anaya said Gene's training regimen was ""scapular stability, of course, to build hip stability and proprioception, that's balance. He was getting a little bit older, so we had to address that.""

Anaya said Gene ""had a boxing background in the military. So he knew how to stand. He knew how to throw punches, he knew how to move. So I was very impressed,"" adding that they never exchanged punches, just worked with practice mitts.

He also recalled getting to know them well, saying, ""After a while working with Gene, he insisted that I call him Gene instead of Mr. Hackman. So, you know, they're really nice people. He wasn't stuck up. He was a good man … and she was a good lady.""

Gene also gifted the trainer a few of his paintings, a beloved hobby of the late actor.

Mike Putnam, a golf instructor who worked with them, also noted that the Oscar-winner insisted that he be called Gene instead of ""Mr. Hackman.""

The ""French Connection"" star left a note on Putnam's desk requesting lessons.

""[He was a] terrific person. And it just developed from there and several golf lessons. We enjoyed time together, and eventually Betsy, his wife, joined us, and she started taking lessons as well. ""So it just became a nice, fun relationship to have,"" Putnam told Fox News Digital.

Gene Hackman's Final Years In Santa Fe With Wife Were Increasingly Secluded

He shared that Gene was ""determined"" to learn the game, noting that golf is more difficult than might be expected.

""I think he kind of knew that. But I think he always probably expected to do a little better than he was doing, you know?"" Putnam said with a laugh. ""But I was able to talk him through that and set the right expectations to help him enjoy it and not have such high expectations.""

He continued, ""And Betsy, when she started playing, it frustrated him a little more, because she was a little more athletic, actually, and she kind of took to the game quicker and maybe probably just didn't get in her own way. You could just see Gene grinding in his head. But gosh, what a delight both of them were.""

Putnam was one of several people in Gene's orbit to receive a painting from the actor. Putnam's came with a simple note that read, ""Thanks for our time"" after working on lessons together.

Stuart Ashman, a friend of Gene and Betsy's, also received a painting from the actor after routinely delivering him a dozen eggs from his small farm.

""One day he brought me a painting, and I said, ‘You can't give me this painting.' He says, ‘Yeah, you've been giving me eggs for months.' So I traded a painting for eggs, which is pretty nice. So now I have this wonderful treasure,"" he told Fox News Digital.

Ashman and Gene met when they served on a committee together at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, and they bonded further through a shared Pilates teacher.

""He was the class after me, and it was a one-on-one class, and we would sit and talk for long enough that the teacher said, ‘Gene, are you going to take a class today or are you just going to talk to Stuart?' And that's really kind of how it was. It was a strong connection. Although, you know, now that he's passed, I lament the fact that we didn't spend more time together.""

Gene Hackman's Friends Say He Was ‘Slowing Down' And ‘Reclusive' Ahead Of Mysterious Death

Ashman also recalled, ""He was very fit, you know, and he was 6-foot-2 plus an ex-Marine. He did Pilates like three times a week. And then on the days that he didn't do Pilates, he would load his bicycle up to his SUV and drive to Albuquerque, which is 70 miles, and ride this trail down there, which is along the river and it's paved and level. So he didn't want to do mountain biking, but he did that. So he was in great shape.""

Daniel and Barbara Lenihan and their son, Aaron, recently spoke with People magazine about Gene and Betsy, saying Gene had been ""essentially kind of home-bound"" in ""recent times"" and ""quit riding his bike through the neighborhood.""

Aaron told the outlet, ""Betsy tried to keep him kind of active and engaged,"" adding that the ""Mississippi Burning"" star did puzzles and yoga via Zoom daily.

""She was still trying to keep him as active and engaged and healthy as possible,"" Aaron said.

Gene and Betsy also shared some active hobbies, like fly-fishing and learning to fly planes.

Ivan Valdez, the owner of The Reel Life, told Fox News Digital that Betsy called his shop eight years ago and got everything set up for Gene and former NFL star and coach Jack Del Rio to go up to the Pecos Wilderness for a relaxing day.

""A few years ago, Gene's wife, Betsy, gave us a call at the fly shop wanting to get a trip set up for her husband and Jack Del Rio, who is a former NFL coach. So I ended up taking them to Cal Creek Ranch in the Pecos Wilderness, and it was just a spectacular day out there with them,"" Valdez said.

Valdez said he was ""pretty nervous"" to go fly-fishing with someone of Gene's caliber, but the movie star made ""the day so comfortable and easy to be around him.""

""We got into a lot of deep conversations about family,"" Valdez said.

Andy Wells, a retired military pilot and flight instructor, first met the couple in 1987 and worked with Gene to get his pilot's license up to date and train Betsy in flying, partially as a backup in case of emergencies.

Wells said both Gene and Betsy were good pilots, and Gene, who had years of experience, ""had the moves.""

After the couple's successful lessons with Wells, they would occasionally meet for other activities in the Santa Fe area.

""I would bump into him around town, and eventually I think he joined the El Gancho swim and tennis club. And then he and I became tennis buddies. And that was an experience.""

As many friends noted, Gene became ""reclusive,"" and Wells didn't see him or Betsy for years.

""The two of them were joined at the hip, practically. So, if he became reclusive, I think she did, too. And she was very quiet. Anyway, if she went out on her own and was in the same grocery store [as] me, it would be easy to not see her. She was small and quiet and very, very focused. I thought she was great.""

Gene was also generally active in the Santa Fe community.

Jennifer LaBar-Tapia, the Santa Fe Film Commissioner, shared that the ""Superman"" star didn't lead a Hollywood life in town.

""Gene Hackman is an icon, as all film fans know. But having Gene Hackman the neighbor here, he was just a man about town. He was very approachable. He and his wife were woven deep into our community. She was a business owner. He sat on the board of directors for our Georgia O'Keeffe Museum. He invested in a handful of restaurants here in Santa Fe, so he was very much a foodie. He was an artist. He was an author. So really, his time in Santa Fe was really toward the end of his career as Gene Hackman, the actor that we already knew him as. But we got the privilege of getting to know him as the author, the artist and the foodie,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Fox News Digital's Tracy Wright, Lauryn Overhultz, Janelle Ash, and Stephanie Giang-Paunon contributed to this report.

HONG KONG — Six of the world's 10 most polluted cities are in India, while California has the worst air pollution in North America, a new report shows.

New Delhi was the most polluted capital city globally, followed by N'Djamena, the capital of Chad, a country in central Africa with the world's worst air pollution, according to the 2024 World Air Quality Report published Tuesday by IQAir, a Swiss air monitoring company.

Ten of the 15 most polluted cities in North America, including Ontario and Bloomington, are in California as the United States reclaimed the top spot as the most polluted country in the region in 2024, the report said.

India, the world's most populous country, with more than 1.4 billion people, had a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentration last year, but air pollution remains a “significant health burden” that reduces life expectancy there by an estimated 5.2 years, the report said. The country's major pollution sources include industrial discharge, construction dust and the burning of crop residues.

PM2.5 refers to tiny particles with diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less that can go deep into lungs and even enter the bloodstream. Deriving from emission sources such as the combustion of gasoline and oil, it is linked to premature death, heart attacks and breathing difficulties.

Though the World Health Organization recommends that average annual concentrations of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 micrograms per cubic meter, only 17% of cities worldwide meet its air quality standard, the report said.

Chad's PM2.5 levels were more than 18 times higher than the WHO guideline, with mineral dust in the Sahara Desert as the primary source of air pollutants. Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand and Pacific island nations, is the world's cleanest region, with 57% of cities meeting the WHO standard.

Bangladesh and Pakistan, both of which neighbor India, ranked as the second and third most polluted countries. In November, air quality in Pakistan reached “hazardous” levels because of a combination of festival celebrations, brick kiln emissions and adverse weather.

China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, recorded lower air pollution levels in more than 300 cities last year, the report said.

While noting Chinese authorities' “ambitious” goal to reduce the country's annual average PM2.5 concentration levels to below 25 micrograms per cubic meter, the report said that is still “significantly” above the WHO guideline of 5 micrograms.

A senior Chinese environmental official said last month that China aimed to effectively eliminate severe air pollution by the end of this year. China announced its “war against pollution” in 2014.

The report also noted the “considerable” gaps in air quality that still exist in many parts of the world. Only 21% of the world population has access to hyperlocal, real-time air quality information, according to IQAir estimates.

Cambodia had no official government monitoring, while many critical regions in Africa and West Asia lack sufficient monitoring. In comparison, North America has a “robust” air quality monitoring infrastructure that accounts for 56% of ground-based stations.

“Air pollution remains a critical threat to both human health and environmental stability, yet vast populations remain unaware of their exposure levels,” Frank Hammes, IQAir's global chief executive, said in a statement.

“Air quality data saves lives,” Hammes said. “It creates much needed awareness, informs policy decisions, guiding public health interventions, and empowers communities to take action to reduce air pollution and protect future generations.”

Last week, U.S. embassies and consulates said they had stopped monitoring air quality abroad, ending a program that had provided essential public health data for more than a decade.

Data the United States provided in dozens of countries had led to noticeable improvements in local air quality in China and elsewhere, reducing premature deaths and generating cost savings associated with lower mortality, studies found.

Air pollution accounted for 8.1 million deaths worldwide in 2021, according to the WHO. Children under age 5 are considered especially vulnerable, with health effects including premature birth, low birth weight, asthma and lung disease.

The US's top diplomat has said that he sees promise in Ukraine's proposal for a partial ceasefire to end the war with Russia, ahead of talks in Saudi Arabia between US and Ukrainian officials later on Tuesday.

""I'm not saying that alone is enough but it's the kind of concession you would need to see in order to end the conflict,"" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Monday.

Kyiv is expected to propose an aerial and naval truce with Russia during the negotiations in Jeddah.

Russia has previously rejected the idea of a temporary ceasefire, saying it was an attempt to buy time and prevent Ukraine's military collapse.

In a separate development, at least three people have been killed in a ""massive"" overnight drone attack on Moscow and the capital region, Governor Andrei Vorobyev said. Seven apartments in a residential building were damaged. 

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said 74 drones heading toward the city were shot down. The roof of one building was damaged by drone wreckage, he added.

The attack forced the suspension of one district train network, and flight restrictions at Moscow's airports.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky landed in Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, although he is not expected to play any formal role in the talks with the US.

In his video address late on Monday, Zelensky said he was hoping for a ""practical result"" at the talks, adding that the Ukrainian position would be ""absolutely constructive"". 

The Ukrainian team will be represented by Zelensky's head of office Andriy Yermak, the country's national security adviser and several foreign and defence ministers.

Rubio will represent the US delegation alongside National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.

Before arriving in Jeddah on Monday, Rubio said that it was important to ""establish clearly Ukraine's intentions"" for a peace deal and that the country would ""have to be prepared to do difficult things like the Russians are going to have to do difficult things to end this"".

""I'm not going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do,"" he added. ""We want to listen to see how far they're willing to go, and compare that to what the Russians want, and then see how far apart we truly are.""

He said that both sides needed to realise that ""there's no military solution"" to the conflict and it can only be resolved through ""diplomatic means"".

Meanwhile, Witkoff is planning to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow later this week, Bloomberg and Axios news websites report, citing unnamed sources. 

The Kremlin has not publicly commented on the reported visit.

The talks in Jeddah come as US President Donald Trump steps up pressure on Zelensky to agree to a ceasefire with Moscow, without any promises of US security guarantees.

The talks mark the first official meeting since Zelensky's visit to the White House descended into acrimony last month.

Following the heated Oval Office encounter, the US paused military aid and intelligence sharing for Kyiv in an apparent bid to get Zelensky to the negotiating table.

Rubio said that he hoped the pause in aid could be ""resolved"" but that the negotiations on Tuesday ""would be key to that"".

The suspension ""came about because we felt that they [Ukraine] were not committed to any sort of peace process"", he said, and ""if that changes, obviously our posture can change"".

""The president is going to use whatever tools he has at his disposal to try to get both sides to that table so this war will end,"" he added.

Earlier on Monday, Trump special envoy Steve Witkoff said he expected ""substantial progress"" during the negotiations.

Asked whether he thought Zelensky would return to the US to sign a minerals deal later in the week, he told Fox News: ""I am really hopeful. All the signs are very, very positive.""

Zelensky has previously said he is willing to sign a minerals deal with the US, which would establish a joint fund from the sale of Ukrainian minerals.

Witkoff said that among the issues to be discussed in Saudi Arabia were security protocols for the Ukrainians and territorial issues.

He said the US administration had never shut off intelligence sharing for anything defensive that Ukraine needed, while on Sunday, Trump told Fox News that he had ""just about"" lifted the intelligence sharing pause on Ukraine.

Sir Keir Starmer also spoke to Trump ahead of the talks, Downing Street said.

The UK prime minister told Trump that ""he hoped there would be a positive outcome to the talks that would enable US aid and intelligence-sharing to be restarted,"" a spokeswoman said.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and currently holds around a fifth of Ukraine's territory, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.

In a speech to allies and in that infamous Oval Office row, the vice-president came out punching - but what is he fighting for?

Three people were killed and another 18 were hurt in the strikes, including three children.

American and Ukrainian officials meet in Saudi Arabia for ceasefire talks and to revive a critical mineral deal

Ukraine is under US pressure to accept a quick truce to end the war with Russia, with US-Ukrainian talks set to begin in Saudi Arabia.

Donald Trump believes Kyiv is now ready to ""move forward"" with a ceasefire with Russia. BBC News correspondent James Waterhouse explains what it means for Ukraine.

BENGALURU, India (AP) — Most of the world has dirty air, with just 17% of cities globally meeting air pollution guidelines, a report Tuesday found. 

Switzerland-based air quality monitoring database IQAir analyzed data from 40,000 air quality monitoring stations in 138 countries and found that Chad, Congo, Bangladesh, Pakistan and India had the dirtiest air. India had six of the nine most polluted cities with the industrial town of Byrnihat in northeastern India the worst.

Experts said the real amount of air pollution might be far greater as many parts of the world lack the monitoring needed for more accurate data. In Africa, for example, there is only one monitoring station for every 3.7 million people.

More air quality monitors are being set up to counter the issue, the report said. This year, report authors were able to incorporate data from 8,954 new locations and around a thousand new monitors as a result of efforts to better monitor air pollution. 

But last week, data monitoring for air pollution was dealt a blow when the U.S. State Department announced it would no longer make public its data from its embassies and consulates around the world.

Breathing in polluted air over a long period of time can cause respiratory illness, Alzheimer's disease and cancer, said Fatimah Ahamad, chief scientist and air pollution expert at Malaysia-based Sunway Centre for Planetary Health. The World Health Organization estimates that air pollution kills around 7 million people each year. 




Ahamad said much more needs to be done to cut air pollution levels. The WHO had earlier found that 99% of the world's population lives in places that do not meet recommended air quality levels.

“If you have bad water, no water, you can tell people to wait for half an hour a day, the water will come. But if you have bad air, you cannot tell people to pause breathing,” she said.

Several cities like Beijing, Seoul, South Korea, and Rybnik in Poland have successfully improved their air quality through stricter regulations on pollution from vehicles, power plants and industry. They've also promoted cleaner energy and invested in public transportation.

Another notable effort to curb severe air pollution was the Association of Southeast Asian Nations agreement on transboundary haze pollution. Even though its had limited success so far, ten countries in the region pledged to work together to monitor and curb pollution from large forest fires, a common occurrence in the region during dry seasons.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports the majority of the world's population breathes dirty air; a new report finds.

Shweta Narayan, a campaign lead at the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said many of the regions witnessing the worst air pollution are also places where planet-heating gases are released extensively through the burning of coal, oil and gas. Slashing planet-warming emissions to slow the heating up of the planet can also improve air quality, she said.

Air pollution and climate crisis “are two sides of the same coin,” she said. ___

Ukraine has agreed to a 30-day ceasefire with Russian forces, contingent on Russia's acceptance, according to a statement released Tuesday.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials met in Saudi Arabia to discuss steps toward ending the war, which began with Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

""Our hope is that the Russians will say yes, that they will also agree so the shooting will stop, the killing will stop, the dying will stop and the talks can begin about how to end this war permanently in a way that's acceptable and enduring for both sides,"" said U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

As part of the talks, the U.S. agreed to ""immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine.""

""Both delegations agreed to name their negotiating teams and immediately begin negotiations toward an enduring peace that provides for Ukraine's long-term security,"" a joint statement from the U.S. and Ukraine said.

The pause in U.S. support was implemented after a contentious meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Ukraine carried out one of its largest attacks since Russia's invasion in 2022, firing around 300 drones, with at least 70 of them targeting the Moscow region, according to Ukrainian officials.

Officials in Moscow claimed that Ukraine was targeting civilian buildings, but the attacks were mostly averted. However, Ukraine said it managed to hit oil facilities not just in the Moscow region but across the country.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, while lamenting the tariffs imposed by various nations on the United States, referred to the tariffs imposed by India on American alcohol and agricultural products.

While addressing a press briefing on Tuesday (local time), she said that US President Donald Trump believes in reciprocity and wants to have fair and balanced trade practices.

The Press Secretary also accused Canada of ""ripping off"" the US and Americans ""for decades"" with its ""egregious"" rate of tariffs.

Being asked about the timeline for Trump speaking to Canada's Prime Minister-designate Mark Carney, Leavitt responded, ""The president is again responding to the fact that Canada has been ripping off the United States of America and hardworking Americans for decades. If you look at the rates of tariffs across the board that Canadians have been imposing on the American people and our workers here, it is egregious.""

Leavitt further mentioned the tariffs imposed by India and Japan on different US products. She added that today the US has a President who ""actually looks out"" for the interests of American businesses and workers.

""In fact, I have a handy dandy chart here that shows not just Canada but the rate of tariffs across the board. If you look at Canada since you brought it up American cheese and butter nearly 300 per cent tariff. You look at India, 150 per cent tariff on American alcohol. Do you think that's helping Kentucky bourbon be exported into India? I don't think so. 100 per cent tariff on agricultural products from India,"" Leavitt said.

""Look at Japan, tariffing rice, 700 per cent. President Trump believes in reciprocity and it is about...time that we have a president who actually looks out for the interests of American businesses and workers. And all he's asking for at the end of the day are fair and balanced trade practices and unfortunately, Canada has not been treating us very fairly at all over the past several decades,"" she added.

On Sunday, US President Donald Trump said that tariffs against neighbouring countries Mexico and Canada could go higher in the future, Fox News reported. He added that the global community has been ripping off the US for ages.

""I think [the business community could see clarity on tariffs],"" he said, addressing CEOs' desire to see predictability for Capital Expenditure spending and shareholder purposes.

""But the tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up..."" he added, as per Fox News.""For years, globalists have been ripping off the United States. They've been taking money away from the United States, and all we're doing is getting some of it back, and we're going to treat our country fairly,"" Fox News quoted Trump as saying.

Trump said that the US would get back at the other countries for the same, as per Fox News. ""This country has been ripped off from every nation in the world, every company in the world. We've been ripped off at levels never seen before, and what we're going to do is get it back,"" he said.

Trump has imposed tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, citing the countries' alleged border control issues leading to fentanyl pouring into the US and killing American citizens, Fox News reported.

Earlier on March 7, Trump delayed tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a short-term period for certain products before the ""big one"" from April 2. He said he agreed after having ""fruitful conversations"" with Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum while he slammed Canada for being a ""high tariff nation"".

Last week, Trump attacked India's tariffs, saying it is ""next to impossible to sell anything to India"" because of the ""high tariffs.""

In a nationally televised address, Trump focused on the tariffs his administration will be putting in effect soon. However, he also revealed that India has agreed to slash its tariffs significantly, allegedly because ""somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done.""

In his remarks at the White House, Trump stated, ""India charges us massive tariffs. Massive. You can't even sell anything in India...They have agreed, by the way; they want to cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done.""

Southwest Airlines is ending its most recognizable perks: Free checked baggage. The airline will begin charging for the first and second checked bag beginning on May 28, Southwest announced March 11.

New York (CNN) — Months after ditching its open seating policy, Southwest Airlines is ending its most recognizable perks: Free checked baggage.

The airline will begin charging for the first and second checked bag beginning on May 28, Southwest announced Tuesday. However, members of its A-List loyalty program or those traveling on a business fare will be exempt from the fees.

“We have tremendous opportunity to meet current and future customer needs, attract new customer segments we don't compete for today, and return to the levels of profitability that both we and our shareholders expect,” said Bob Jordan, CEO of Southwest, in a press release.

It's a seismic shift for the Southwest, which has always offered free checked bags since the airline started about 60 years ago and kept the policy in place when its competitors starting adding and increasing fees. In fact, the carrier has trademarked “bags fly free” slogan and it's been a key part of its advertising.

Jordan told investors on an analyst call last year that it had no plans to start charging for the first two bags being checked. He said the no fees for the first two bags is “a big part of what attracts people to Southwest.”

“After fare and schedule, bags fly free is cited as the number one issue in terms of why customers choose Southwest. So, it's not something under consideration right now,” Jordan said at the time.

He also said that there are costs, and not just revenue, that come from charging for bags. It slows the time it takes to load a plane as passengers take more time to look for space in overhead bins for carry-on bags. Also, some bags have to be moved from the cabin to the cargo hold once there is no longer any room available in the overhead bins.

Southwest didn't immediately reveal how much the checked bags will cost. Regardless of the price, it will likely instantly boost its bottom line because Southwest has two to three times as many checked bags as other airlines.

Despite not charging for the first two checked bags, Southwest collected $73 million in baggage fees in 2023, and $62 million in the first 9 months of 2024, according to Department of Transportation statistics. However, that is a fraction of the baggage fees collected by other airlines, with American Airlines collecting $1.4 billion in 2023, while United Airlines pulled in $1.2 billion and Delta Air Lines garnering $985 million.

Competitors trounced on the news, including Delta CEO Ed Bastian said at an investors conference Tuesday that Southwest's decision to charge for bags could be a help to its competitors.

“Clearly there are some customers who chose them because of that [bags fly free policy],” Bastian said. “Now clearly those customers are up for grabs.”

Shares of Southwest (LUV) soared more than 9% in premarket trading.

Southwest has introduced a number of changes since Elliott Investment Management took a $1.9 billion stake in the carrier last year. The activist investor called for leadership changes and an operations overhaul to boost profitability.

Other hallmarks that Southwest has changed include its cabin. Assigned seating will soon be introduced, as well as premium seats, bringing it in line with traditional carriers. The airline also rolled out red-eye flights.

Southwest said customers were clamoring for those changes. When people switch to a competitor from Southwest, the company said the No. 1 reason passengers cite is open seating. But the change will also help the company charge some passengers more for their tickets.

The airline has also changed the way it sells tickets. Traditionally it only sold them on Southwest.com, but recently said they would sell them on Expedia in an attempt to attract more customers.

Southwest also announced Tuesday it will also start selling “basic economy” fares in May, which are low-priced tickets but with tons of restrictions.

Last month, Southwest cut 15% of its corporate workforce, or 1,750 people — the first mass layoffs in the company's history. The layoffs will save the company $210 million this year and $300 million in 2026.

The company started the year with a new chief financial officer, Tom Doxey, who most recently was president of Breeze Airways. Southwest's previous chief financial officer Tammy Romo and chief administration officer Linda Rutherford will retire from their positions in April.

Ukraine has agreed to a 30-day ceasefire proposal and the US says it will restart military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv after a day of peace talks in Saudi Arabia. Follow the latest here - and ask Michael Clarke a question for our Q&A tomorrow below.

Tuesday 11 March 2025 22:44, UK

Thanks for joining us for a busy day of coverage as US and Ukrainian officials met in Saudi Arabia.

We're pausing our live updates for now, but here's a round-up of all the day's events:

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine has accepted a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia after the talks in Jeddah - something which has been welcomed by European leaders.

It comes as the US said it had immediately resumed intelligence-sharing and military aid with Ukraine.

In a statement, Zelenskyy said the US must now ""convince Russia to do this"" and that ""if the Russians agree - that's when the silence will work"".

US secretary of state Marco Rubio responded by saying ""the ball is now in Russia's court"" and said ""we're going to take this offer to Russia"".

Meanwhile, Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that he thinks he will talk to Vladimir Putin this week, but warned ""it takes two to tango"".

The US president said he hopes to have a total ceasefire in the coming days - with Russia not ruling out the prospect of contacts with the US.

You can watch the immediate reaction from the talks, including analysis from our US correspondent Mark Stone, in the video below...

After a busy evening of developments on the war in Ukraine, our security and defence analyst Michael Clarke will be back to answer all your questions live tomorrow.

You can submit them now in the box at the top of the page.

You'll be able to watch along tomorrow afternoon - but before then you can catch up on last week's edition here:

We're now receiving more reaction from the officials that were in the room for the US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia.

Ukraine's defence minister has taken to social media site X to highlight the key outcomes of the meeting- from the resumption of US assistance to Europe's role in peace negotiations.

Rustem Umerov said he was ""grateful to all participants of today's meeting for a very productive and results-oriented conversation"".

He went on to thank his ""American colleagues"" and ""Saudi friends and partners"" for their support.

Rubio: Today was a good day for peace

Leading the US delegation was secretary of state Marco Rubio, who described today as being a ""good day for peace"".

Rubio thanked Donald Trump for his leadership and said ""we are one step closer to restoring durable peace for Ukraine"".

""The ball is now in Russia's court,"" he added.

Earlier, we brought you comments from Donald Trump as he said he believes he will talk to Vladimir Putin this week (see 7.26pm post).

But the US president warned ""it takes two to tango"" after Ukraine said it is ready to accept the US proposal of a 30-day ceasefire.

You can watch his reaction to the US-Ukraine talks below...

The biggest win for Ukraine at the moment is the resumption of US military support, the chair of the Ukrainian parliament's foreign affairs committee has said.

Speaking on The World with Yalda Hakim, Oleksandr Merezhko said: ""For us, it's crucial for our defensive capabilities and survival.""

But as for the ceasefire proposal, he warned ""we should remember history"".

""We had dozens of such ceasefires before under the Minsk Accords, and each time these ceasefires had been violated in the most flagrant way by Putin,"" Merezhko said.

""But now we have one psychological and interesting difference, because this time, if Putin assumed that he agrees to such a ceasefire, the guarantor of such a ceasefire will be Trump himself.""

""I would like to see whether Putin respects or doesn't respect Trump.""

Merezhko adds that he is ""very sceptical"" over whether Russia would stick to any potential ceasefire if it was agreed.

""This is why we continue to need reliable security guarantees, and the best and cheapest security guarantee for us is NATO membership,"" he said.

By Alex Rossi, international correspondent, in Jeddah

It was a long day of negotiations but at the end it appeared that the Ukrainian and American delegations had found common ground. 

When they entered the talks they looked focused - there is a lot riding on the talks.

When they emerged after sundown it was clear that they had achieved something - small steps on what will be a long and difficult road to achieve any sort of peace.

The initial agreement saw progress on a readiness by the Ukrainians to accept an immediate interim 30-day ceasefire in theory.

Whilst there are still many outstanding issues there is now movement to end a war that has been grinding on for more than three years.

For the Ukrainians, they wanted and needed to mend the relationship with the US after that now infamous diplomatic spat in the Oval Office.

They were seeking a restoration of military aid and intelligence-sharing. The US has now announced it will immediately restart its assistance. 

What the Americans wanted to see was a Ukraine that was prepared to be flexible and make difficult decisions to reach a peace agreement. 

The Ukrainians were clearly persuasive on that count and the US delegation sounded convinced.

But the war cannot stop without Russian agreement and buy in to the negotiating process, and whether Moscow bites and also agrees to an interim ceasefire is far from clear. They have given mixed signals.

On the one hand, officials have said the Kremlin's war objectives remain the same and there will be no concessions but they've also said they are waiting to hear the details of the talks.

Clearly the ball is now in Moscow's court. US President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff is heading to Moscow later in the week. It's reported he will discuss the diplomatic proposals with  Russian President Vladimir Putin.

But getting a lasting and sustainable peace will not be easy - Russia's leader is unlikely to accept anything that does not allow him to present his ""special military operation"" as anything other than a total victory.

And until an agreement is reached, the violence and the killing will continue.

A Ukrainian presidential official has confirmed the US has resumed its military assistance to Ukraine after talks in Saudi Arabia.

It comes after the US said it would immediately lift the pause on intelligence-sharing and military aid to Ukraine (see 6.03pm post).

Pavlo Palisa, the deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office, said: ""I have confirmation that US military assistance has been resumed.

""The agreements are being implemented. The fight continues!""

By James Matthews, US correspondent

It looks like progress and it sounds like progress.  How much it is actual progress will be a matter for the Russians.

Moscow will decide if this step forward amounts to two steps back.

The Americans and Ukrainians did the easy bit in Saudi Arabia.

This was a diplomatic healing between both parties, a reset on relations that restores a military alliance.

Clearly, Ukraine will welcome the US lifting its pause on intelligence-sharing and weapons supply.

It will strengthen the ties between Washington and Kyiv, even if trust remains undermined.

There is deep suspicion in Kyiv surrounding the motivations of Donald Trump and his relationship with Vladimir Putin.  

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the ceasefire proposal a positive step – he's content as far as it goes, even if he'll have questions around the context.

Ukraine was second behind Russia on the guest list for talks with the Americans and, while Trump has courted Putin, he's cold-shouldered Zelenskyy.

Discussions between Trump and Putin will surely have given the US president a guide on how the Russians will respond to offers made.  

Would Trump have proposed a ceasefire without an assurance that Putin would accept? 

Unlikely, given everything Moscow has to gain.  

The future floated for Ukraine by the Trump administration doesn't include NATO membership, doesn't reflect a desire to roll back Russian territorial gains and doesn't rule out lifting sanctions against Moscow.  

For Ukraine, there are difficult questions about what comes after the guns go silent.  

A ceasefire in the current conditions isn't the starting point that Zelenskyy would have chosen but, realistically, it's the only starting point he's got. 

The meeting between US and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia today was a ""serious step forward"", Ukraine's foreign minister has said.

In a post on social media site X, Andrii Sybiha said the meeting was a step forward ""both on the path to peace and in developing the strategic Ukraine-US partnership"".

""I want to thank my counterpart Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, and our Saudi friends,"" he added.

We've been receiving reaction from Europe to the 30-day ceasefire proposal

European Council president Antonio Costa and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen have said they welcome the news from the US-Ukraine talks.

""This is a positive development that can be a step towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine. The ball is now in Russia's court,"" they said.

They also added the European Union is ready to play its full part, together with its partners, in upcoming peace negotiations.

Meanwhile, Sir Keir Starmer hailed a ""remarkable breakthrough"" between Kyiv and Washington.

""We now all need to redouble our efforts to get to a lasting and secure peace as soon as possible,"" he added.

We've also heard from Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who said: ""It seems like the Americans and Ukrainians have taken an important step towards peace.

""And Europe stands ready to help reach a just and lasting peace.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday backed the United States's proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but said Washington needed to persuade Russia to accept it.

His comments came after US and Ukrainian officials concluded lengthy talks in Saudi Arabia, in which Washington agreed to resume intelligence sharing with Kyiv and mooted a 30-day truce with Moscow.

""Ukraine welcomes this proposal, we consider it positive, we are ready to take such a step. The United States of America has to convince Russia to do this,"" Zelensky said of the proposed truce in his evening address.

""The American side understands our arguments, perceives our proposals, and I want to thank President Trump for the constructive conversation between our teams,"" he said.

A senior Ukrainian official told AFP that the talks in Saudi Arabia earlier had yielded ""initial steps"".

""We will see if the Russians are ready for anything at all,"" they said.

Ukraine also pressed the US about including Europe in any peace negotiations during the talks in Saudi Arabia, amid frustration among European leaders that they are being squeezed out.

""We stick to our position: no decisions on the long-term security of Europe without Europe,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said following the talks.

Israel said on Tuesday that it had agreed to release five Lebanese citizens detained during its war with Hezbollah as a goodwill gesture to the neighbouring country's new president.

""In coordination with the United States and as a gesture to Lebanon's new president, Israel has agreed to release five Lebanese detainees,"" a statement from the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.

Netanyahu's office said that the decision came following a meeting held earlier in the day in the Lebanese border town of Naqoura that included representatives of the Israeli army, the United States, France and Lebanon.

""During the meeting, it was agreed to establish three joint working groups aimed at stabilising the region,"" the prime minister's statement said.

""These groups will focus on the five points controlled by Israel in southern Lebanon, discussions on the Blue Line and remaining disputed areas, and the issue of Lebanese detainees held by Israel.""

The Blue Line is the UN-patrolled demarcation line that has marked the Israel-Lebanon border since 2000.

On November 27, Israel and Lebanon agreed to a US-French mediated truce that largely halted more than a year of hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, including two months of full-blown war in which Israel sent in ground troops.

While the ceasefire continues to hold, Israel has periodically carried out air strikes on Lebanese territory, it says to prevent Hezbollah from rearming or returning to the territory along its northern border.

On Saturday, the military targeted a Hezbollah operative with an air strike in southern Lebanon. Lebanese media reported one killed and another wounded in what it said was an Israeli drone strike on a car.

The ceasefire required Hezbollah to withdraw north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the border, and to dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south.

Israel had been due to withdraw completely from Lebanese territory by February 18 after missing a January deadline, but decided to keep troops at five locations it deemed strategic.

Ukraine agrees to 30-day ceasefire with Russia after talks with U.S.

The United States agreed on Tuesday to resume military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine immediately after talks in Saudi Arabia in which Kyiv voiced readiness to accept a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in its conflict with Russia, the countries said in a joint statement.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would now take the offer to the Russians and that the ball is now in Moscow's court.

""Our hope is that the Russians will answer 'yes' as quickly as possible, so we can get to the second phase of this, which is real negotiations,"" Rubio told reporters, after more than eight hours of talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

The Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago, and Russia, which has been making advances, now holds about a fifth of Ukraine's territory, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.

Rubio said Washington wanted a full agreement with both Russia and Ukraine ""as soon as possible.""

""Every day that goes by, this war continues, people die, people are bombed, people are hurt on both sides of this conflict,"" he said.

John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told PBS News Hour that provided the proposed ceasefire was  ""not undercut by the next step in Moscow, it's a good day which has historic significance.""

How Moscow would respond was far from certain.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he is open to discussing a peace deal, but he and his diplomats have repeatedly stated they are against a ceasefire and would seek a deal that safeguards Russia's ""long-term security.""

Putin has ruled out territorial concessions and said Ukraine must withdraw fully from four Ukrainian regions claimed and partly controlled by Russia.

On Tuesday, Russia's Foreign Affairs Ministry said only that it did not rule out contacts with U.S. representatives.

Herbst, the former U.S. diplomat, told PBS News Hour that he didn't think Putin would want a ceasefire as that would halt his ambitions to exert control over Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was in Saudi Arabia but did not participate in the talks, said the ceasefire was a ""positive proposal"" that covers the front line in the conflict, not just fighting by air and sea.

The Ukrainian leader said the ceasefire would take effect as soon as Russia agreed.

""When the agreements come into force, during these 30 days of 'silence,' we will have time to prepare with our partners at the level of working documents all the aspects for reliable peace and long-term security,"" Zelenskyy said.

Rubio said the plan would be delivered to the Russians through multiple channels. U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, was due to meet his Russian counterpart in the coming days, and Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, plans to visit Moscow this week to meet Putin.

On Tuesday, Trump said he hoped for a swift ceasefire and thought he would talk to Putin this week. ""I hope it'll be over the next few days,"" he told reporters at a White House event to promote his close adviser Elon Musk's Tesla car company.

The U.S.-Ukraine agreement was a sharp turnaround from an acrimonious White House meeting on Feb. 28 between the new Republican U.S. president, who has long been a Ukraine aid skeptic, and Zelenskyy.

In Tuesday's joint statement, the two countries said they agreed to conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources, which had been in the works and was thrown into limbo by that meeting.

What Zelenskyy wanted from Trump before the shouting started

Following that encounter, the U.S. cut off intelligence sharing and weapons shipments to Ukraine, underlining Trump's willingness to pressure a U.S. ally as he pivots to a more conciliatory approach to Moscow.

Trump said on Tuesday he would invite Zelenskyy back to the White House.

Ukrainian officials said late on Tuesday that both U.S. military assistance and intelligence sharing had resumed.

A top aide to Zelenskyy said options for security guarantees to Ukraine were discussed with U.S. officials. Security guarantees have been one of Kyiv's key aims, and some European countries have expressed willingness to explore sending peacekeepers.

In the joint statement, Ukraine reiterated that European partners should be involved in the peace process. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte will be at the White House on Thursday.

""It seems like the Americans and Ukrainians have taken an important step towards peace. And Europe stands ready to help reach a just and lasting peace,"" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk posted on X.

Waltz, the U.S. national security adviser, said the initial resumption of military assistance for Ukraine would involve equipment from U.S. stockpiles approved by former U.S. president Joe Biden and stopped by Trump.

In an era marked by rapid technological advancement and complex global challenges, City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK) has established itself as a key institution driving innovation across multiple fields.

Recent developments at the university show a focus on fostering an environment that turns research into real-world benefits, while preparing students for careers of the future.

This page was produced by Sky Media, the advertising department of Sky, in collaboration with CityUHK

Digital medicine: bridging traditional healthcare and technology

One field in which this is most apparent is medical technology.

The establishment of the Institute of Digital Medicine (IDM) marks an important step in CityUHK's cross-disciplinary approach.

Through partnerships with academic, clinical and industry organisations, the university is using its research strengths in engineering, data science and life sciences to develop healthcare technologies that doctors can use immediately.

Asia's rapidly aging population presents significant healthcare challenges throughout the region.

                  'Calling Moscow's bluff': Sky News correspondents' views as Ukraine accepts ceasefire deal
                

The integration of digital solutions with traditional medical approaches has become increasingly vital, with market analysts projecting the Asia-Pacific digital health market to exceed £55bn by 2026.

This convergence of medical expertise and technological innovation provides a good example of CityUHK's commitment to addressing societal challenges through academia-industry collaboration.

Entrepreneurial development framework

Elsewhere, the HK Tech 300 programme shows CityUHK's commitment to developing entrepreneurs beyond classroom learning.

This initiative supports aspiring business founders within the University community and beyond, encouraging them to put innovative ideas into practice.

Hong Kong's start-up ecosystem has grown substantially in recent years, with over 3,000 start-ups reported in 2023, representing a 60% increase from those in 2017.

This growth coincides with government initiatives providing approximately £500m in innovation and technology funding, creating a supportive environment for university-led entrepreneurship programmes.

The overlapping area between institutional support and governmental policy creates fertile ground for CityUHK's entrepreneurial initiatives to flourish within Hong Kong's evolving innovation landscape.

Comprehensive innovation education

To strengthen this space, the CityUHK Academy of Innovation was established to bolster the university's approach through specialised academic programmes at all levels.

From undergraduate to postdoctoral studies, these programmes are designed to nurture young entrepreneurs with a focus on deep-tech venture creation and to promote university-industry collaboration.

The programmes on offer include a PhD by Innovation, MSc in Venture Creation, Graduate Research and Innovation Trek Programme (GRIT), and the Overseas Start-up Technology Entrepreneur Programme (STEP).

In developing these courses, the academy collaborated closely with university colleges, departments, the School of Graduate Studies, and relevant administrative offices.

Teaching is delivered by a carefully selected blend of CityUHK faculty members alongside external experts bringing valuable industrial and investment experience.

The initiative aims to build a leading international ecosystem that nurtures young entrepreneurs, supports deep-tech start-up incubation, and enhances university-industry collaboration.

Artificial intelligence research with practical applications

In the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), CityUHK has recruited excellent AI talent to focus on developing practical applications.

One example of such work involves developing traffic-prediction systems for self-driving vehicles, demonstrating how AI research can address real challenges in transportation.

The global autonomous vehicle market is expected to reach £43bn by 2026, with Asia representing approximately 40% of this amount. CityUHK's research positions Hong Kong to participate meaningfully in this expanding sector.

This strategic focus on applied AI research illustrates how CityUHK is targeting high-growth technological domains in which academic innovation can directly contribute to emerging industries.

Sustainability integration across academic and research activities

CityUHK is committed to promoting sustainability through both education and research. A standout example is the development of next-generation printable solar cell technology, which addresses key industry challenges, including efficiency, stability, cost, scalability and environmental impact.

These initiatives align with Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050, which aims for carbon neutrality by mid-century.

Renewable energy development represents a critical component of this strategy, with solar energy identified as having significant growth potential despite Hong Kong's space limitations.

Strategic positioning in regional innovation

These initiatives together position CityUHK as a major contributor to regional innovation.

By creating pathways to turn research into commercial applications and equipping students with relevant skills, the university is strengthening Hong Kong's overall innovation ecosystem.

CityUHK's approach exists within a broader regional context, in which university-industry collaboration has become increasingly important.

Neighbouring jurisdictions, including Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, have demonstrated how effective academia-industry partnerships help drive economic development and international competitiveness.

As Asia's educational landscape evolves, universities that successfully balance theoretical research with practical applications are likely to emerge as regional leaders.

CityUHK's multi-faceted innovation strategy reflects an understanding of this shifting paradigm, positioning it to contribute meaningfully to Hong Kong's economic diversification and technological advancement in the coming decades.","{'href': 'https://news.sky.com', 'title': 'Sky News'}"

Donald Trump has undoubtedly raised Greenland's profile and energised its politics. Tuesday's election will show how far that might take the territory away from Denmark and how much its people are tempted by Trump.

Greenland is remote, much of it untouched and beautiful.  It has until recently managed to stay out of the limelight.

But it is now being interfered with by the world's most powerful man, right on the eve of an important national election.

That meddling is making this a highly charged vote and undoubtedly having an influence, but perhaps not in the way Donald Trump wants.

Social media influencer and parliamentary candidate Qupanuk Olsen told Sky News Donald Trump's intervention is forcing Greenlanders to decide where they stand.

""Everyone in Greenland now has to have an opinion on whether we should stay under Denmark or whether we should become a state under the US or whether we should become independent.

""It's making us aware, we are worth more than what the Danish people have been telling us for the last 300 years, maybe we can stand on our own two feet.""

Donald Trump isn't the first US president to want Greenland - here's whyPoll shows 85% of Greenlanders oppose joining US as Denmark shores up European support

Many here are outright angry that the American president has openly talked about taking their territory. They do not want to become American for a host of reasons.

CEO of Raw Arctic Tour Company, Casper Frank Moller, told us Greenlanders would never want to become Americans.

""I think our entire society, our culture is so embedded into nature, like this is what we run our businesses on, is going out into nature and this is not aligning with the capitalistic society of the United States.""

His partner, Aningo Brogerg, CEO of Sumut Greenland, was more blunt when it comes to America's president.

""I think that guy's a lunatic. He's mad. There's something wrong with his head.""

But both said he had been very good for business.

""You know, Donald Trump going out and talking about Greenland like it has never been mentioned before. It's just it's on everybody's lips,"" Mr Moller said.

Greenland is a semi-autonomous Danish territory. It has the right to vote for independence if it wants. But many are wary. They value the free health care and security Denmark offers.

It may be the world's biggest island - Australia's classed as a continent - but its population is only 56,000.

Every party running seeks independence but they differ in how quickly it should happen.

What message might this election send Donald Trump? We asked Jens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of the Demokraatit Party.

""I hope it sends a clear message to him that we are not for sale,"" he said. We don't want to be Americans. No, we don't want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders. And we want our own independence in the future. And we want to build our own country by ourselves, not with his hope.""

 BUENOS AIRES — An Argentine court started on Tuesday its trial of seven healthcare professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer great Diego Maradona, at age 60. 

 Maradona was under the care of those professionals when he had a cardiac arrest in a house outside Buenos Aires on Nov. 25, 2020. 

 Three judges will decide whether those charged, including a neurosurgeon, a psychiatrist and several medical staffers, are guilty of manslaughter. The maximum jail time for those sentenced is 25 years. 

 The tearful family of the 1986 World Cup winner were present at the courtroom. Maradona's oldest daughters, Dalma and Giannina, sat in the front row near Verónica Ojeda, former partner of the footballer, and Jana, another of his daughters. 

 Minutes before the start of the trial, Ojeda shared a video on social media of Maradona's son Diego Fernando wearing a T-shirt with the face of the football star, and the word “justice.” 

 The spotlight is on neurosurgeon Leonardo Luque, Maradona's personal physician for the last four years of his life. He performed surgery to remove a blood clot from the former footballer's brain just weeks before his death. 

 Six other professionals will be on trial. Psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov, who prescribed the medication that Maradona took until the time of his death, psychologist Carlos Díaz, Nancy Forlini, a coordinator of the medical company hired for Maradona's care during his hospitalization, Mariano Perroni, a representative of the company that rendered nursing service, doctor Pedro Di Spagna, who monitored his treatment, and nurse Ricardo Almirón. 

 Nurse Gisela Madrid, who was also indicted, will be tried by a jury later this year.

Iran's president Masoud Pezeshkian said that his country would not negotiate with America under any threat, telling US President Donald Trump to ""do whatever the hell you want"", state media reported on Tuesday.

""It is unacceptable for us that they (the US) give orders and make threats. I won't even negotiate with you. Do whatever the hell you want,"" Pezeshkian was cited as saying state media, a Reuters report said.

The Iranian president's remarks come just days after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Tehran will not be bullied into negotiations.

""Some bully governments -- I really don't know of any more appropriate term for some foreign figures and leaders than the word bullying -- insist on negotiations. Their negotiations are not aimed at solving problems, they aim at domination,"" Khamenei was quoted as saying.

His statement came just a day after Trump sent a letter to him, urging Iran to negotiate a new nuclear deal.

“I've written them a letter saying I hope you negotiate, because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing for them,” Trump told Fox News.

The US president had also said that while he is not ruling out a military intervention, he would ""rather negotiate a deal"".

Even though he showed openness to a deal with Iran, Trump also reinstated the ""maximum pressure"" campaign he applied in his first term as president to isolate Tehran from the global economy and drive down its oil exports towards zero.

On the other hand, Iran has consistently refused any plans of developing a nuclear weapon. However, it is ""dramatically"" accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60 per cent purity, which is close to the roughly 90 per cent weapons-grade level, the IAEA warned.

Iran has been accelerating its nuclear work since 2019, a year after the then President Donald Trump ditched Tehran's 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers, reimposing sanctions that obstructed the country's economy.

 RIO DE JANEIRO — Clowns complete with red noses and tutus delivered the joy of Carnival to sick children in a Rio de Janeiro hospital on Tuesday, bringing the ebullient festivities normally found on the streets straight to the young patients and their caregivers. 

 Street parties, known as blocos, are a fixture of Rio's Carnival celebrations. They're raucous, rambunctious romps with thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of partygoers. 

 The vibrant chaos of Carnival street parties was, of course, unsuitable for sick children, so members of the Clown Circle project brought a gentler celebration to the State Servants Hospital in downtown Rio. 

 Musicians, clowns and even a standard-bearer danced their way through the corridors decorated with streamers and masks, inviting children, parents, nurses and doctors into a merry dance and moment of celebration. 

 “It's a really good feeling, because staying in a hospital with a child is tiring,” said Moniky Fernanda de Nazaré Moreira, as she balanced her one-year-old son on her hip. “We need this to cheer the child up – and he loves a bit of a mess, so he had a lot of fun.” 

 While the trumpet, drum and banjo players played classic Carnival tunes, the clowns sought to create an individual interaction with each child, paying them a kind of attention that for once wasn't medical. 

 “It really helps children improve,” said Ioma Rodrigues Klemz, a doctor on the ward. “You see children who are sometimes very withdrawn in bed who start to communicate more, sing, dance,” she added. 

 The saying goes that laughter is the best medicine, and clown projects in hospitals even bring joy to hospitals in war-torn places such as Ukraine. 

 The Clown Circle project in Rio offers weekly activities, creating themed performances around calendar events like Carnival. 

 In Brazil, Carnival officially ended with Ash Wednesday last week, but such technicalities didn't stop the cheerful group. However, they adapt to the hospital environment, adjusting aspects like volume, explained Julia Schaeffer, a program coordinator. 

 “That's what it's all about; bringing the street party into the hospital for those who can't be out,"" Schaeffer said. “We bring it here with an extra dose of care.”

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Tuesday he had agreed to suspend a 25% surcharge on electricity imports into the United States after having conversed with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in the wake of President Donald Trump's threats to hike steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada to 50%. 

In a statement issued with Lutnick and posted on X, Ford said he and Lutnick would meet Thursday alongside the U.S. trade representative to discuss renewing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade act before Trump's self-imposed April 2 ""reciprocal tariff deadline.""

""In response, Ontario agreed to suspend its 25 per cent surcharge on exports of electricity to Michigan, New York and Minnesota,"" Ford said.

In subsequent remarks at the White House, Trump said Tuesday afternoon he was now looking at reducing tariffs on Canada. Asked whether he would lower them, he said, “Probably so.”

""I'll let you know"" whether 50% tariffs on Canada are going into effect, he said.

Major stock indexes, which had plunged on Trump's earlier tariffs threat, rallied into the green upon the suspension announcement.

Trump had posted on Truth Social Tuesday that steel and aluminum tariffs would go from 25% to 50% starting Wednesday in response to Ontario's placing a 25% tariff on electricity exported to the United States.

Trump added that he would declare a ""national emergency"" for the three states Ontario has targeted so the tariffs could go into effect.

Trump also called on Canada to drop its duties on U.S. dairy products and threatened to ""substantially increase"" tariffs on cars imported into the United States if Canada did not drop ""other egregious, long time tariffs.""The auto tariffs, Trump warned, without citing evidence, “essentially, permanently shut down the automobile manufacturing business in Canada.”

Trump then doubled down on some of his recent rhetoric about making Canada part of the United States, though he added it would get to keep its national anthem.

""The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State,"" Trump wrote. ""This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.""

Canada has quickly emerged as a target of Trump's ire in his second presidential term, putting the United States' closest ally on rockier footing. Earlier this month, Trump instituted, then pulled back, tariffs on a variety of Canadian goods as he goaded its leaders and blamed them for a lack of action on fentanyl trafficking. (Relatively little of the drug is seized at the northern border compared with the U.S. border with Mexico).

In another Truth Social post late Monday, Trump called Canada a longtime “tariff abuser.” 

“The United States is not going to be subsidizing Canada any longer,” he warned, adding: “We don't need your Cars, we don't need your Lumber, we don't your Energy, and very soon, you will find that out.”

While Mexico has faced similar tariff threats and rhetoric, its president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has succeeded in assuaging Trump.

The strategy has not worked for Canadian officials, who have more aggressively retaliated with tariffs and public comments.

“I'm not too sure why he continues to attack his closest friends and allies, but we need the American people to speak up,” Ford said Tuesday in an appearance on CNBC. “We need those CEOs to actually get a backbone and stand in front of them and tell them this is going to be a disaster. It's mass chaos right now.”

CNBC had reported that Trump had not yet signed formal paperwork to officially increase the tariffs to 50%, citing a senior administration official who added it was “in the works” and remained “a threat” rather than an action, until the paperwork was prepared and signed.

Newly appointed Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney subsequently called Trump's threats ""an attack on Canadian workers, families and businesses.""

""My government will ensure our response has maximum impact in the U.S. and minimal impact here in Canada, while supporting the workers impacted,"" Carney said.

He said Canadian tariffs on U.S. goods would remain ""until the Americans show us respect and make credible, reliable commitments to free and fair trade.""

Morgan Stanley analysts warned that because the United States is a net importer of steel and aluminum from Canada, the tariffs would lead to higher domestic prices. As an example, although steelmaker Alcoa's stateside facilities would benefit from higher tariffs, it has an even larger presence north of the border.

“We expect a net negative impact to the company as a whole,” the analysts wrote.

Some investors disagreed, sending shares of the Pennsylvania-based firm more 2% higher Tuesday.

The New York Independent System Operator, which manages the state's grid, had said there was enough generating capacity to transition away from Canadian sources. A spokesperson for Michigan's Public Service Commission told The Associated Press on Monday that the impact on the state's residents was likely to be “small.” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — Kamala Harris' 2024 running mate — likewise expected minimal impact for his state.

                On Feb. 6, salvage crews work on recovering wreckage in the Potomac River near where an American Airlines jet and a Black Hawk helicopter collided in midair as the jet was about to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Jan. 29.

The chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board says that ""there's a serious safety issue"" in the airspace surrounding Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. 

The NTSB's Jennifer Homendy called on the Federal Aviation Administration to implement several ""urgent safety recommendations"" during a Tuesday news conference. Her comments followed the release of a preliminary investigation report into the Jan. 29 midair collision between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet, which was attempting to land at DCA airport. Both aircraft plunged into the icy Potomac River, killing all 67 people aboard both aircraft.

Homendy described the flight patterns around DCA as ""an intolerable risk"" as helicopters and commercial planes operate in close proximity to each other in the busy airspace over the U.S. capital. She says an NTSB analysis found that in a 13-year period from 2011 to 2024, there was at least one ""close call"" each month between a commercial plane operating at DCA and a helicopter. 

In over half those encounters, Homendy said, the helicopter was operating higher than it should have been, and two-thirds of the instances were at night.

The January crash happened at night, and the collision occurred at 278 feet. The helicopter was supposed to be flying no higher than 200 feet. The NTSB said previously that it's unclear whether the altimeters in the helicopter were showing the pilots the proper altitude.

The new NTSB analysis further determined that between October 2021 and December 2024, there were a total of 944,179 commercial operations at DCA. During that time, there were 15,214 ""close-proximity events"" between commercial airplanes and helicopters. Of those, 85 had a horizontal separation of less than 1,500 feet and were less than 200 feet apart vertically.


                The chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, Jennifer Homendy, speaks during a news conference at the headquarters of NTSB on Tuesday in Washington, DC. The NTSB released a report urging the FAA to take immediate action on the safety recommendations concerning the potential for midair collisions near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

""This was not an isolated incident, but a symptom of broader failures in our aviation safety system,"" said 18 family members of those killed on the jet in a statement. ""While the NTSB's report sheds light on key factors of this event, it also reinforces what we, as the families of the victims, already suspected: serious, systemic failures in air travel safety cost our loved ones their lives and continues to threaten public safety.""

""It does make me angry. I feel incredibly devastated for families that are grieving because they lost loved ones,"" said Homendy. She told reporters the FAA could have used the same publicly accessible data that the NTSB did in its analysis. ""It shouldn't take a tragedy to require immediate action."" 

Congress has taken note. ""The NTSB report provides ample data that this helicopter route and the commercial aviation landing route never should have been allowed to coexist,"" said Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. ""The data also raises serious questions as to how such a route was allowed to continue when alarm bells were literally going off.""

Homendy called on the FAA to make several ""urgent safety recommendations."" She said the FAA needs to ""permanently prohibit helicopter operations"" near DCA when certain runways are in use for arrivals or departures. She applauded Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who put these restrictions in place temporarily after the collision until March 31. 

Homendy says the NTSB is also examining other factors, including what the pilots of each aircraft might have seen or heard in the minutes before the accident. The NTSB will also investigate the possible role of air traffic controllers.

The FAA has been under scrutiny for a yearslong shortage of air traffic controllers. In the last month, the Trump administration began laying off hundreds of FAA employees as part of a federal effort to cut back on workers. Duffy said none of the layoffs were of existing controllers or ""critical safety personnel."" Still, Elon Musk of the Department of Government Efficiency pleaded last month with air traffic controllers who have recently retired to return to work.

The midair collision was the deadliest aviation accident in the U.S. since 2001. The full NTSB investigation is expected to take about a year.

• “Urgent safety recommendations”: Helicopters should be barred from a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River when flights are landing on Reagan National Airport's Runway 33, National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said in a briefing as the NTSB unveiled “urgent safety recommendations” after the deadly mid-air collision in January.
    


• Thousands of near-miss events: The warning signs leading up to the disaster over the Potomac River were there, NTSB investigators said in their preliminary report, citing data that detailed thousands of near collisions at Reagan Washington National Airport over years.
    


• About the crash: All 67 people on the aircraft — 64 on the American Airlines plane and three in the Blackhawk helicopter — died in the January 29 collision. It was the deadliest aviation disaster in the US since 2001.



Our live coverage of today's briefing from the National Transportation Safety Board has concluded. Please scroll through the posts below or read the main takeaways here.



            The National Transportation Safety Board today recommended that helicopter traffic be banned from a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River when flights are landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport.
    


            Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, hours later, agreed to adopt the recommendation and continue with flight restrictions put in place after a deadly midair collision in January, saying the nation was “threading the needle” in allowing helicopters to fly down the same airspace as landing aircraft.
    


            The “urgent safety recommendation” is part of the NTSB's preliminary report on the midair collision between a passenger jet and a US Army helicopter in which 67 people were killed in the deadliest crash in the US in nearly two decades. The report did not identify the probable cause of the crash — which is expected to take more than a year.
    


Here are some key takeaways from the NTSB's preliminary report:



            The Federal Aviation Administration will adopt certain restrictions on helicopter routes at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, following a recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board Tuesday, according to Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.
    


            On Tuesday, the NTSB unveiled the preliminary report for the deadly midair collision that killed 67 people in January. In the report, the agency called for helicopters to be barred from a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River when flights are landing on Reagan National Airport's Runway 33.
    


            ”We're in a situation where we're threading the needle allowing helicopters to fly down the same airspace as landing aircraft,” Duffy told reporters. “And why this information wasn't studied and known before January 29 is an important question.”
    


            By tomorrow, he said there will be notice for pilots details on the route changes.
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that while reviewing 944,179 operations between October 2021 and December 2024, investigators uncovered 15,214 occurrences of “near-miss events” where aircraft were within one nautical mile of colliding and vertical separation of less than 400 feet.
    


            CNN's Pete Muntean asked the secretary how upsetting the data was for the close calls at the DC airport.
    


        “The data was there, it wasn't effectively analyzed to see that we had this kind of risk at DCA,” Duffy said. “It makes me angry. Maybe there was too much data coming in, and it's easy, maybe, to look back and say, ‘you should have seen it.' Looking forward, it can be more challenging, but it seems pretty clear someone should have seen because pilots were talking about it. We've heard news stories, social media posts of pilots talk about these near misses, it's not like it was hidden in the data somewhere, if someone was paying attention, someone was on the job, they would have seen this.”
    





            Duffy said he spoke with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Tuesday about giving the military and Department of Defense a route around the restricted airspace. Duffy said there still will be exclusions for presidential air travel, vice presidential air travel, life-saving missions or law enforcement.
    


            American Airlines and the largest pilot union in the world are expressing their support for the National Transportation Safety Board's new safety recommendation issued after the start of an investigation into the deadly collision earlier this year.
    


            The NTSB released a preliminary report on its investigation Tuesday, detailing much of its fact-finding efforts, but stopping short of offering analysis on the cause of the collision. The collision happened between an American Airlines plane and a military helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport near Washington, DC.
    


        “We continue to mourn the lives lost in the tragic accident involving Flight 5342. We're grateful for the National Transportation Safety Board's urgent safety recommendations to restrict helicopter traffic near DCA and for its thorough investigation,” American Airlines said in a statement.
    





            NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said the board recommends that helicopters should be barred from a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River when flights are landing on Reagan National Airport's Runway 33.
    


        “We are grateful to the NTSB for this preliminary report of their already extensive investigative work, which we were proud to support,” Capt. Jason Ambrosi, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, said in a statement. “Our efforts to advance aviation safety never stops, and as our industry processes recent events, it's more important than ever for all operators in our national airspace to remain vigilant and return to fundamentals.”
    





            All 64 people on the American Airlines plane and three people in the Blackhawk helicopter died in the crash, which is the deadliest aviation accident in the United States in almost two decades.
    


            National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy, in a message for people flying in and out of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, said “aviation is incredibly safe.”
    


        “I just flew with my daughter out of DCA,” she said in a press conference on Tuesday. “Aviation is incredibly safe. DCA is where I always fly out of. I say often that your biggest risk is in your personal vehicle when you're going to and from the aircraft at the airport. Aviation is safe.”
    





            “However, there are safety issues and areas where we need to improve to make sure that we are at zero. And so, that is the role of the NTSB in investigating. This is why we issue urgent safety recommendations,” she added.
    


            Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, dodged a question from reporters about if the deadly mid-air collision between a plane and an Army helicopter could have been prevented with more staffing.
    


            The crash that happened at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport outside Washington, DC, killed a total of 67 people.
    


        “I assume you mean on air traffic control,” Homendy said in response to the question. “That is part of our investigation and is part of the analysis phase of our investigation. Right now, we are collecting facts on air traffic control. In our preliminary report today, we will mention that there were five controllers on position.”
    





            She said there were nine controllers total in the tower, some were in the break room.
    


            At the time of the collision, one controller was working two positions in the tower, investigators previously said.
    


            “We are taking a look at that. We do not have any evidence that anybody left. In fact, the controller came back into rotation around 4:27 p.m.,” she said, adding that two other positions were also combined for the entire day, “which is not abnormal.”
    


            The preliminary report also outlines that the American Airlines flight was communicating with the control tower on one frequency, and the helicopter pilots were using another. Because of this, the crews of each flight “were not able to hear each other's transmissions to the controller, but the controller's transmissions to each aircraft would be audible to both flight crews,” the report said.
    


This post has been updated with additional details from the report.



            National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said she is devastated for the families who lost loved ones in the mid-air collision in January.
    


        “It's an intolerable risk to aviation safety, and we have called on DOT, FAA to take action” she said. “… It does make me angry, but it also makes me feel incredibly devastated for families that are grieving because they lost loved ones. It shouldn't take tragedy like this to occur. Unfortunately, one did.”
    





            “It shouldn't take a tragedy to require immediate action” when there were clear indicators where safety trending could have occurred, she added.
    


Some context: Homendy cited data that detailed thousands of near collisions at Reagan Washington National Airport over a few years. The NTSB said Tuesday investigators uncovered 15,214 “near-miss events” between October 2021 and December 2024, where aircraft were within one nautical mile of colliding and vertical separation of less than 400 feet.
    


            “That data from October 2021 through December 2024, (the FAA) could have used that information any time to determine that we have a trend here and a problem here, and looked at that route; that didn't occur, which is why we're taking action today. But unfortunately, people lost lives, and loved ones are grieving,” she later added.
    


            The warning signs leading up to the deadly disaster over the Potomac River were there, investigators said, citing data that detailed thousands of near collisions at Reagan Washington National Airport over years.
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that while reviewing 944,179 operations between October 2021 and December 2024, investigators uncovered 15,214 occurrences of “near-miss events” where aircraft were within one nautical mile of colliding and vertical separation of less than 400 feet.
    


            There were also 85 cases where two aircraft were laterally separated by less than 1,500 feet and a vertical separation of less than 200 feet.
    


        “We remain concerned about the significant potential for a future mid-air collision at DCA, which is why we are recommending a permanent solution today,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said.
    





            The National Transportation Safety Board is concerned about more collisions involving helicopters near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in the future, the board's chair, Jennifer Homendy, said Tuesday.
    


            It comes after the NTSB released an preliminary report on the collision between an Army helicopter and an American Airlines plane earlier this year. A total of 67 people were killed in the crash, which is the deadliest aviation accident in the United States in almost two decades.
    


            Homendy said that following the collision, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy moved to restrict helicopter traffic around the airport and over the Potomac River until the end of March.
    


        With that restriction soon lifting, “We remain concerned about the significant potential for future mid-air collision at DCA,” Homendy said.
    





            The National Transportation Safety Board found that a majority of encounters between commercial aircrafts and helicopters happened on the plane's approach to landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport.
    


        “RAs indicate a collision threat and require immediate action. In over half of the encounters we reviewed, again from 2011 thru 2024, the helicopter may have been above the route altitude restriction. Two-thirds of the events occurred at night,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said, referring to Resolution Advisories, which are messages from the Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) to a pilot to avoid a potential collision.
    





            In the preliminary report released by NTSB, the board reviewed information gathered from voluntary safety reporting programs along with Federal Aviation Administration data “regarding encounters between helicopters and commercial aircraft near DCA from 2011 through 2024 indicated that a vast majority of the reported events occurred on approach to landing.”
    


            According to the report, the “Initial analysis found that at least one TCAS resolution advisory (RA) was triggered per month due to proximity to a helicopter. In over half of these instances, the helicopter may have been above the route altitude restriction.”
    


            Helicopters should be barred from a four-mile stretch over the Potomac River when flights are landing on Reagan National Airport's Runway 33, National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy said in a briefing Tuesday.
    


            The helicopter route a US Army Black Hawk was following when it collided with an American Airlines regional jet on January 29 should be closed under certain conditions, according to a new recommendation from the NTSB.
    


        “Urgent recommendations require immediate action to prevent similar accidents or incidents when we issue them,” Homendy told reporters. “We believe a critical safety issue must be addressed without delay.”
    





            The recommendation reads, “Prohibit operations on helicopter Route 4 between Hains Point and the Wilson Bridge when runways 15 and 33 are being used for departures and arrivals, respectively, at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport,” and also calls for the designation of “an alternative helicopter route that can be used to facilitate travel between Hains Point and the Wilson Bridge when that segment of Route 4 is closed.”
    


            The investigative agency's “urgent safety recommendations” comes as part of its preliminary report on the mid-air collision that killed 67 people nearly six weeks ago.
    


            Right now, planes at the airport are stopped for necessary helicopter flights — like when President Donald Trump leaves the White House on Marine One — which has led to flight delays and diversions.
    


            National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy started Tuesday's news conference by previewing what is in the board's preliminary report releasing today.
    


            Here's a broad list of things in the report, according to Homendy:
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board is still in “the fact-finding phase” of its investigation into the collision between a helicopter and American Airlines plane near Washington, DC, in late January, the board's chair said Tuesday.
    


        “I often say that the easiest and quickest part of the investigation is determining what happened. The part that takes longer is the how and why,” NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said at a news conference.
    





            She reiterated that the information included in the preliminary report, which the board released today, contains “only the facts that we're able to validate and release at this time.”
    


            These facts, Homendy said, will serve “as the foundation” for the NTSB's analysis of what happened and subsequent safety recommendations.
    


            “If we still have questions on something, or there's an area that we need to do more investigative work on, we're going to do that work, and that takes time,” she said.
    


This post has been updated with more comments from Homendy.



            The National Transportation Safety Board issued a preliminary report Tuesday on a collision between a passenger plane and US Army helicopter, the deadliest accident in the US in nearly 20 years.
    


            American Eagle flight 5342 was moments away from landing on that runway when the military helicopter struck the jet's right side at an altitude of roughly 300 feet, investigators said.
    


            Tuesday's report did not identify the “probable cause” of the accident, which is expected to take more than a year. The incident killed 67 people involved.
    


            Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy will hold a news conference after the National Transportation Safety Board issues its preliminary report on January's mid-air collision near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
    


            Duffy's news conference is scheduled for 4 p.m. ET.
    


            Before American Eagle Flight 5342 took to the air from Wichita, Kansas, on the evening of January 29, on its way to the nation's capital, figure skater Spencer Lane snapped a photo of the plane's wing stretched out over the tarmac toward the horizon.
    


            A grayish-blue overcast sky formed a shimmery curtain over the setting sun in the image the teenager posted to his Instagram Stories. The up-and-coming skater wrote “ICT->DCA,” referencing the airport codes for the departure and destination cities.
    


            Lane, his mother, as well as other budding skating stars, their families and coaches from the US and Russia awaited their departure after attending the US Figure Skating Championships and a development camp for young athletes.
    


            At Reagan National Airport, Hamaad Raza received a text message from his wife: The flight was about 20 minutes from touching down. He later showed the message to a reporter for CNN affiliate WUSA.
    


            Tragically, all 67 people on board the American Airlines regional jet and US Army Black Hawk helicopter that collided midair in late January lost their lives in the deadliest aviation disaster in the US since 2001.
    


            Among the victims were three soldiers aboard the helicopter, four members of the jet's flight crew, 28 skaters and family members affiliated with US Figure Skating, seven friends on a hunting trip and other passengers who are mourned by their family and friends.
    


These are some of the victims of the tragedy and how loved ones remember them: 



A family of four from Virginia: Everly Livingston, 14, and her sister Alydia, 11, were promising young figure skaters, dad Peter Livingston played hockey and mom Donna was very active in the girls' lives, family friend Kim Urban previously told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The family was on their way home from Wichita, where they participated in events surrounding the US Figure Skating Championships. “The Livingstons were just — they were just a big personality family. They were loving, they were thoughtful. Donna and Peter were extraordinarily supportive parents. They were loving parents. They were doing anything for their children,” Urban said. “Alydia and Everly were … bright children, very talented skaters and super bubbly.”
    


A female Black Hawk pilot: The pilot who was co-piloting the aircraft when it collided with the passenger plane was a “driven and hardworking” officer who “was made for” Army aviation, those who knew her recalled to CNN. The Army officially identified the pilot as Capt. Rebecca Lobach, 28, one of the three-person crew inside the UH-60 Black Hawk. A statement released by the Lobach family called her a “bright star” who was “kind, generous, brilliant, funny, ambitious and strong.”
    


Asra Hussain Raza: A daughter of Indian immigrants, she graduated with honors in 2020 from Indiana University and married her college sweetheart in August 2023, her father-in-law, Dr. Hashim Raza, told CNN. “She went out of her way for everybody,” he said.

            The collision between an American Airlines regional jet and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter on January 29 over the Potomac River left no survivors.
    


            The passenger jet was carrying 64 people, while the Army helicopter was operated by three personnel. Among the dead were American Airlines pilots Jonathan Campos and Samuel Lilley, two flight attendants, and several members of the US figure skating community, according to friends, family and sports groups.
    


            Data shows that while some years in the 1990s saw hundreds of flight fatalities, total fatalities since 2002 have amounted to fewer than 200.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news","DC plane crash: NTSB calls for immediate changes at Reagan airport","https://abcnews.go.com/US/dc-plane-crash-ntsb-provide-updates-investigation/story?id=119664988","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 22:07:30 GMT","

The Transportation Department quickly agreed to the NTSB's recommendations.

The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday called for immediate changes at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, saying the current helicopter routes around the busy airport ""pose an intolerable risk to aviation safety"" in the wake of January's collision that killed 67 people.

The NTSB is recommending that the Federal Aviation Administration permanently ban helicopter operations near Reagan when runways 15 and 33 are in use and designate an alternative helicopter route for pilots, Chairman Jennifer Homendy said during a news conference.

After Homendy's announcement, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy quickly said the Department of Transportation will immediately follow the NTSB's recommendations and keep helicopter restrictions in place, noting that some modifications might be made to the current restrictions. (Duffy put a temporary ban in place after the crash; that ban was set to expire at the end of March.)

On Tuesday, families of the victims of the deadly collision said in a statement that the report highlights how ""serious, systemic failures in air travel safety cost our loved ones their lives and continues to threaten public safety.""

""This was not an isolated incident, but a symptom of broader failures in our aviation safety system,"" the statement read. ""If the necessary reforms had been implemented sooner, Flight 5342 likely would have landed safely and our family members would be home with us.""

During the new conference, Homendy outlined a history of close calls at Reagan and said the NTSB continues to investigate the devastating crash between an American Airlines plane and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter that killed everyone on board both aircraft.

The crash happened on the night of Jan. 29 when the PSA Airlines Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet, which had departed from Wichita, Kansas, with 64 people on board, was about to land at Reagan (DCA). The three soldiers in the helicopter were conducting an annual training flight and night vision goggle check at the time of the collision.

Between October 2021 and December 2024, there were 944,179 commercial operations at Reagan, Homendy said. During that time, there were 15,214 close proximity events between commercial airplanes and helicopters with a lateral separation of less than 1 nautical mile and a vertical separation of less than 400 feet, she said. There were 85 events where the lateral separation was less than 1,500 feet and the vertical separation was less than 200 feet, she said.

Helicopters on ""the Route 4 helicopter corridor at the maximum authorized altitude of 200 feet could have only about 75 feet of vertical separation from an airplane on landing approach to Runway 33,"" the NTSB said in a statement. ""Vertical separation could potentially be even less than 75 feet depending on the helicopter's lateral distance from the Potomac River shoreline or if an approaching airplane was below the designated visual glidepath to Runway 33.""

Homendy said 75 feet is an ""intolerable risk to aviation safety.""

""It does make me angry. But it also makes me feel incredibly devastated for families that are grieving because they lost loved ones,"" Homendy said. ""It shouldn't take tragedy like this to occur. Unfortunately, one did, and so we are calling on action, but there clearly were indicators where safety trending could have occurred.""

American Airlines said in a statement, ""We continue to mourn the lives lost in the tragic accident involving Flight 5342. We're grateful for the National Transportation Safety Board's urgent safety recommendations to restrict helicopter traffic near DCA and for its thorough investigation.""

Encounters between helicopters and commercial aircraft near Reagan show that, from 2011 through 2024, a vast majority of reported events occurred on approach to landing, Homendy said.

At least one Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) resolution advisory -- the most serious warning that tells the pilots to take immediate evasive action to avoid a collision -- was triggered per month at Reagan due to proximity to a helicopter from 2011 to 2024, Homendy said.

In more than half of the encounters the NTSB reviewed, the helicopter may have been flying above the altitude restriction, Homendy said. Two-thirds of the encounters occurred at night.

The NTSB's investigation is ongoing. Homendy said the NTSB will conduct a number of simulations, conduct additional interviews, and continue to examine radio altimeters, barometric altimeters and additional electronics.

After Homendy's news conference, Duffy also addressed the media on Tuesday, and he criticized the FAA and the previous administration for not identifying the hot spots earlier.

The FAA has deployed artificial intelligence tools to look through the data and identify potential hot spots in the airspace at other airports, Duffy said. The AI technology is currently in place at 12 airports, and he said the FAA plans to incorporate it across the country.

""If there's another DCA-esque situation out there, our AI tools will help us identify those and take corrective actions preemptively, as opposed to retroactively,"" he said.

Duffy also further discussed upgrades that he said will be made to runway safety and technology. To expedite the process, Duffy said he will ask Congress for money up front.

Homendy said last month there was no indication the helicopter crew was aware of the impending situation.

The soldiers may have had ""bad data"" on the altitude from their altimeter, as the pilots had differing altitudes in the seconds before the crash, Homendy said. One helicopter pilot thought they were at 400 feet and the other thought they were at 300 feet, she noted.

The transmission from the tower that instructed the helicopter to go behind the plane may not have been heard by the crew because the pilot may have keyed her radio at the same second and stepped on the transmission from air traffic control, or ATC, the NTSB added.

The Black Hawk crew was likely wearing night vision goggles throughout the flight, Homendy said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news","Trump reverses course, won't double tariffs on some Canada imports: Updates","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/03/11/trump-tariffs-canadian-steel-aluminum-imports/82265993007/","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 23:33:14 GMT","

WASHINGTON − President Donald Trump reversed course and will no longer double tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Peter Navarro, the White House's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, said Tuesday.

The abrupt shift was a response to Ontario Premier Doug Ford saying he would suspend a 25% electricity surcharge on about 1.5 million U.S. energy users in New York, Michigan and Minnesota.

Trump had hinted at the reversal Tuesday afternoon, and Navarro confirmed it, saying Ford and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick ""had a cordial discussion, and Mr. Ford, in his wisdom, decided to back away from his electricity surcharge of 25%.”

Navarro added that Ford “understood that this was not going to be a fight that he could win.”

Trump's turnabout came after he said Tuesday morning that he would be doubling tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports, set to go in effect Wednesday, from 25% to 50%. With Trump backtracking, the steel and aluminum tariff rate for Canadian imports will remain at 25%.

Trump downplayed the impact of his tariff threats on the plunging stock market. He has argued the tariffs are needed to help rebuild the U.S. manufacturing sector.

""Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down. But you know what? We have to rebuild our country,"" Trump told reporters gathered on the White House South Lawn as he promoted Tesla vehicles alongside Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and a senior White House adviser.

Trump defended his use of tariffs in remarks Tuesday to business leaders in Washington following another day of tariff threats and a sudden reversal – and suggested higher fees could be on the way.

Speaking before The Business Roundtable, Trump touted a “renewed spirit” in the U.S. manufacturing sector because of his tariffs on imports, even as the new duties have seen the stock market plunge.

“They don't want to pay 25% or whatever it may be,” Trump said of companies, referring to the rate he wants to set on imports from Canada and Mexico as well as all steel and aluminum imports. “It may go up higher. Look, the higher it goes, the more likely it is they're going to build (in the United States).”

Last week, Trump agreed to postpone until early April tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada that fall under the USCMA, a free trade deal he signed in 2019. They make up 50% of Mexican goods coming into the U.S. and 38% of those from Canada.

In a wild day of trading, U.S. stocks reversed course late Tuesday after Ford said he would suspend the electricity surcharge. Stocks closed lower but cut their steep early losses, which were initially prompted by Ford's threat of adding a 25% fee to U.S. electricity users in three border states, followed by Trump saying he would retaliate by doubling tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.

The S&P 500 index ended down 0.76%, or 42.49 points, to 5,572.07. The blue-chip Dow shed 1.14%, or 478.23 points, to 41,433.48. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.18%, or 32.23 points, to 17,436.10 after posting its worst day since September 2022 on Monday. The benchmark 10-year yield rose to 4.284%.

The stock market convulsions amid a series of escalating trade moves, including tariffs on Mexico and China, have some economists fearing a recession and the return of higher inflation, which has remained stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% goal.

Trump would not rule out an economic slowdown in an interview that aired over the weekend. “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big,"" Trump said in an interview that aired on ""Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo.""

Several companies − from retail giants Walmart, Kohl's and Dick's to airlines such as Delta and Southwest – said they're bracing for a possible slowdown in consumer spending. Consumers account for about 70% of the economy. Recent surveys show consumers growing less optimistic.

Small business sentiment has also been dented. The National Federation of Independent Business Small Business Optimism Index showed sentiment declining and uncertainty over the outlook rising. The Uncertainty Index rose to the second-highest reading in the survey's history, which dates to 1973.

Wednesday's closely watched report on inflation in February should bring modest relief, but the reprieve may be brief, with Trump's escalating trade war set to drive prices higher later this year.

The overall consumer price index likely increased 0.3% last month, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be a relatively large bump, but it's less than January's 0.5% rise and it would lower the annual inflation reading from 3% to 2.9% − still above the Federal Reserve's 2% goal.

A core inflation measure that excludes volatile food and energy items likely also rose 0.3%, economists predict, down from 0.4% the previous month. That would nudge the yearly increase from 3.3% to 3.2%. The price increases will likely be fueled by familiar culprits such as used cars, auto insurance and eggs, forecasters say.

Although most of Trump's tariffs have yet to take effect, they're already affecting businesses' pricing decisions and pushing some costs higher, Wells Fargo wrote in a note to clients.

Ford said Tuesday that Trump launched an “unprovoked attack” on Canada when he increased the steel and aluminum tariffs.

“We will not back down. We will be relentless. I apologize to the American people that President Trump decided to have an unprovoked attack on our country, on families, on jobs. And it's unacceptable,” Ford said on MSNBC.

Ford said CEOs should try to change Trump's mind. 

“You see the market tumbling. Consumer confidence is down,'' he said. ""And if he continues on with this, assembly plants in Michigan will shut down, and around the country, whoever makes autos, and as well as businesses, they're going to hurt.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt downplayed the plunging stock market as “a snapshot in a moment in time” and blamed former President Joe Biden for the ongoing economic turbulence – even though it is Trump's tariffs that have rattled Wall Street.

“We are in a period of economic transition,” Leavitt said at a Tuesday briefing with reporters.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 3.6% since Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have erased its post-election gains as well. Like Trump, Leavitt did not rule out a recession but pointed to Trump's first term in office as reason for economic optimism today.

“Look at President Trump's results in his first term. If people are looking for certainty, they should look at the record of this president,” Leavitt said.

Tariffs are likely to disrupt supply chains and increase the cost of transportation, which will lead to a rise in price for almost everything, Truist head of U.S. economics Mike Skordeles previously told USA TODAY. 

""Broadly speaking, higher tariffs will increase import costs, forcing companies to choose between absorbing the hit to their margins or passing it on to consumers,"" said Madhav Durbha, a supply chain expert and group vice president of consumer-packaged goods and manufacturing at RELEX. ""Either way, this creates inflationary pressure and dampens consumer spending, impacting not only individual companies but the broader market."" 

As previously reported, the U.S. auto industry and a broad array of common imports from Canada to the U.S. could be affected by the tariffs, according to the Bureau of Industry and Security and Trading Economics. For consumers, that could mean higher prices for appliances, cereal, milk products, alcoholic beverages and more.  

Not everybody's upset about Trump's tariffs. Those imposed on steel are “absolutely good” for American steel makers, said Philip K. Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association.

The U.S. produced 90 million tons of steel in 2023, ranking fourth in the world after China, India and Japan, according to worldsteel.org. But Bell said American manufacturers are tired of imported steel undercutting their profits because of previous tariffs and exemptions, and Trump wants to “level the playing field.” 

“The president understands the enormous power of tariffs and how they can fundamentally reshape our trade relations that have unfairly cost America in terms of value,” Bell said.

He said Mexican companies were importing cheap steel from China, making some alterations and exporting it to the U.S. like it was produced in Mexico. He added the Biden administration tried stopping that last year and applied a 25% tariff on Mexican steel that was melted or poured outside North America before it was a completed product. But it wasn't enough, Bell argues. 

“For far too long, those Mexican companies were allowed to use loopholes allowing other countries to dump their steel into our market,” Bell said. “It's time to stop that.”

Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, called the U.S. announcement of 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum ""incredibly destructive.""

""This series of escalations is quickly hitting a ceiling where Americans and Canadians are set to feel the hurt,"" Laing said in a statement. ""The stock market volatility is a glaring signal that this economic chaos must end.""

She said similar tariffs on steel and aluminum during Trump's first term led to a net loss of tens of thousands of American blue-collar jobs.

""Steel and aluminum are about strength; these tariffs do nothing but weaken us both,'' Laing said. ""President Trump may as well hand over North America's steel and aluminum leadership to China.""

For a nation facing a housing affordability crisis, a deepening trade war comes at the wrong time. As USA TODAY previously reported, an initial round of tariffs proposed for Canada, Mexico and China would have added about 5%, or $21,000, to the cost of the median-priced newly built home.

Nearly three-quarters of imported sawmill wood products come from Canada, according to an analysis from an industry consultant. Canada also supplies about 11% of the hardware used in residential construction.

With the stock market tumbling, consumer confidence skidding and U.S. companies ramping up layoffs, it may look like the nation is hurtling toward a recession amid Trump's widening global trade war and federal job cuts.

It isn't – yet. That's mostly because American consumers are still in good financial shape and the nation's businesses generally remain optimistic despite growing uncertainty about the trade conflicts and federal cuts, forecasters say.

A recession is informally considered at least two straight quarters of declining economic output. But the technical definition is “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” according to the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research.

The measure is based on employment, income, consumer spending and industrial production, among other criteria. An economic tailspin is typically accompanied by hundreds of thousands or millions of net job losses.

More U.S. airlines cut their earnings estimates on Tuesday, following Delta Air Lines and citing mounting economic uncertainty triggering a pullback in corporate and consumer spending. United Airlines said its first-quarter earnings are now expected to come in at the lower end of its forecast because of a 50% drop in government-related travel bookings.

""Economic uncertainty is a big deal,"" American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said at a J.P. Morgan industry conference.

Negative consumer sentiment among Canadians about U.S. products has erupted, and American liquor, wine and spirits are the first targets.

Many Canadian stores have been pulling American alcohol brands off shelves as part of retaliatory measures to Trump's tariffs on Canadian products, which is temporarily on hold until April 2. The maker of Jack Daniel's called the removal of his company's whiskey from Canadian shelves “worse than a tariff.”

Asked at a media briefing Tuesday if Canada is still a close ally, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the country as a neighbor and a partner. ""They have always been an ally,'' she said. ""Perhaps they are becoming a competitor now.""

She also reiterated Trump's far-fetched desire for Canada to join the U.S. as a state, which Canadian leaders oppose. “He believes that Canadians would benefit greatly from becoming the 51st state of the United States of America,” she said.

Leavitt said Trump has not yet spoken with Mark Carney, who is set to replace Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister after Carney won Sunday's Liberal Party election.

Trump on Tuesday once again expressed his desire to see the U.S. absorb its northern neighbor. In recent months, Trump has repeatedly suggested he wants to annex Canada and has referred to its outgoing prime minister as ""Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada"" − much to the aggravation of Trudeau and many Canadians.

“The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Trump's overtures were panned by Carney on Sunday in his first speech after winning the leadership of the governing Labor Party.

Canada “never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape, or form,” said Carney, adding that people “are worried about Canada's future, in the face of President Trump's threats and a more divided and dangerous world.”

Unfazed, Trump wrote Tuesday on his social media post that by Canada joining the U.S., the “greatest and most powerful nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever − And Canada will be a big part of that.”

“The artificial line of separation drawn many years ago will finally disappear, and we will have the safest and most beautiful Nation anywhere in the World,” he wrote.

Trump promised during the 2024 campaign to turbocharge the economy, declaring he'd work a ""miracle"" that would bring about ""extraordinary"" boom times. Rallying in Grand Rapids, Mich., the day before the election, Trump predicted his promised victory would swiftly improve the job market and fatten wallets.

""We're just one day... a half a day... away from the best jobs, the biggest paychecks and the brightest economic future the world has ever seen,"" the former and future Republican president declared as the crowd held up signs reading ""Dream big. Again!"" and ""Trump will fix it.""

Now − nearly two months into a second Trump term − his administration is bracing Americans for economic turbulence as last year'scampaign rhetoric collides with the reality of an increasingly uncertain economy. Read more here.

Groups that represent generic drug manufacturers and hospital pharmacists have warned tariffs on Chinese imports could impact both drug prices and supplies.

China is among the largest suppliers of ingredients used in generic drugs. Generic drugs are less expensive than brand name drugs and manufacturers buy drug ingredients from large factories in China and India that can make these ingredients more cheaply than in the United States. About 90% of U.S. prescriptions are generics.

The Association for Accessible Medicines, a trade group that represents generic drug manufacturers, has warned the tariffs could increase drug shortages. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists warned the extra costs from tariffs, combined with Biden-era inflation penalties levied on drug companies that raise prices more than the rate of inflation, could exacerbate drug shortages.

Against the backdrop of recession concerns, Americans are yet again bracing for a possible government shutdown. Congress has until 11:59 p.m. on Friday to pass legislation to keep the government funded. Otherwise, a majority of federal employees will go without pay or be forced to stop working while most government services pause.

House Republicans unveiled a spending bill, supported by Trump, that keeps the government running until Sept. 30. The vote on the bill, known as a continuing resolution, is expected later Tuesday. But it's unclear whether the bill has enough support to pass the House. Some Democrats have already spoken out against it.

The Trump administration is working toward its promise of eliminating the U.S. Department of Education: On Tuesday evening, the department released a statement saying it would cut nearly 50% of the department's workforce. Impacted staff will be placed on administrative leave beginning March 21, according to the announcement.

The statement confirms ""all divisions"" within the agency will be hit by cuts, but also says it will continue to deliver programs protected by law ""including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking.""

""Today's reduction in force reflects the Department of Education's commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers,"" U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in the statement. ""I appreciate the work of the dedicated public servants and their contributions to the Department. This is a significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States education system.""

According to the announcement, more than 1,300 positions will be cut as a result of this reduction in force. Roughly another 600 employees accepted voluntary resignations or retired over the last two months.

AFGE Local 252, a union that represents Education Department employees, released a statement in which its president, Sheria Smith, said, ""We will fight these draconian cuts and urge all Americans to stand up and contact their Members of Congress…to protect the Department of Education's vital work, working people, and our Nation by rejecting these political games.""

Minutes later, AFGE Local 252 told NPR that Smith was laid off, along with all five of the chapter's other union officers.

Earlier on Tuesday, department employees received an email advising them to vacate all department offices by 6:00 pm. Staff were instructed by the department's Office of Security, Facilities and Logistics to plan to work from home on Wednesday. Employees of the department shared the email with NPR. We are not naming them because they feared retribution.

Department employees have spent the past several weeks anticipating sweeping staff cuts by the Trump administration.

This Thursday, agency heads are expected to turn in their ""reorganization"" plans to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A guidance memo from OMB and OPM sent in late February instructed agency heads to achieve ""large-scale reductions in force (RIFs)"" through attrition and ""by eliminating positions that are not required.""

Already, at least 75 Education Department staff have been placed on paid administrative leave, according to a tally by AFGE Local 252. This count does not include managers and supervisors. Many of those workers on paid leave attended a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion workshop the department has offered for many years, including during the first Trump administration.

The union also says at least 75 probationary department staff, who were hired more recently and are legally easier to lay off, have also had their jobs terminated.

Konanki traveled to Punta Cana with friends for spring break.

Missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki's clothes were found on the Dominican Republic beach where authorities believe she was last seen going for a swim, two police sources with knowledge of the investigation told ABC News.

The 20-year-old Konanki, a legal permanent U.S. resident and an Indian citizen, vanished early Thursday while she and a group of students were on a spring break trip to a resort in Punta Cana, according to the Loudoun County, Virginia, Sheriff's office.

Konanki and one of her traveling companions were Loudoun County residents, the sheriff's office said.

The search for Konaki continued on Tuesday, authorities said.

Konanki's clothes were discovered on a portable beach bed close to the beach where she went missing, the sources told ABC News. Police have found no evidence of violence, according to the sources.

After going to a nightclub on Wednesday night, Konanki and a group of people went to the beach about 4 a.m. local time on Thursday, the sources said. The other women traveling with Konanki went back to their hotel about 5:55 a.m. and were captured on security camera returning to their rooms, the sources noted.

A man stayed behind with Konanki on the beach, according to a Dominican Republic investigative police report. The man, whose name was not released, told police that he and Konanki went for a swim and got caught by a big wave, the police report said.

The man, according to sources, told police that when he got back to the beach he threw up and went to sleep on a beach bed. When he woke up, Konanki was nowhere to be seen, the sources said.

Security video showed the man coming back to his hotel room at 8:55 a.m., according to the sources.

The man is cooperating with authorities, National Police spokesman Diego Pesqueira told ABC News.

Earlier, the chief of the Civil Defense in the Dominican Republic told ABC News on Monday the man was not considered a suspect in Konanki's death.

Right now, the investigation is being treated as an accident, the chief said.

Law enforcement authorities are increasing the perimeter of the search area of beaches and water in the ongoing operation to find Konanki, according to the chief.

Three Dominican officials involved in the investigation told ABC News over the weekend that Konanki is believed to have drowned in the ocean.

The last time Konanki was seen on the beach on security camera footage was around 4:15 a.m. Thursday, the Dominican Republic Public Ministry told ABC News.

The Public Ministry was first contacted by the U.S. embassy in the Dominican Republic on Friday, the Ministry said.

Officials said Konanki's friends who were with her around the time of her disappearance were questioned by police and have not been charged with crimes.

A joint investigation into Konanki's disappearance is being conducted by the FBI, the US Embassy in the Dominican Republic, the Dominican National Police and the Dominican Prosecutor's office, sources close to the investigation told ABC News.

The investigators will question everyone involved in the incident again, including hotel employees and the man Konanki's friends say she was with before she disappeared, the sources said.

All security camera footage since the day Konanki and her five friends arrived on the island is now being analyzed, sources said.

The United States will immediately lift a pause on intelligence sharing and resume providing security assistance to Ukraine after delegates from Kyiv agreed to accept the Trump administration's proposal for a 30-day interim ceasefire with Russia.

""Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the U.S. proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties,"" according to a joint statement issued Tuesday after meetings in Saudi Arabia. 

""The United States will communicate to Russia that Russian reciprocity is the key to achieving peace,"" the statement added.

The Kremlin did not immediately comment. 

The future of U.S. support for Kyiv has been in grave doubt since an extraordinary on-camera spat between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Feb. 28. In the wake of that confrontation, Trump's administration paused intelligence sharing with Kyiv.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has made a series of policy moves heralding a more cooperative stance toward Russia, traditionally considered a key geopolitical foe of the West. Trump, for his part, falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war and called Zelenskyy — not Vladimir Putin — a dictator.

Trump briefly addressed the 30-day ceasefire announcement outside the White House on Tuesday, telling reporters: ""Ukraine has agreed to it and hopefully Russia will agree to it."" Asked whether Zelenskyy would be invited back to the White House, Trump responded: ""Sure, absolutely.""

Zelenskyy welcomed the ceasefire proposal as a ""positive step,"" saying in his nightly address to the nation that Ukraine wants to ""do everything to achieve peace as quickly and reliably as possible — so that war never returns.""

In Tuesday's joint statement, the U.S. and Ukrainian delegations said Trump and Zelenskyy had ""agreed to conclude as soon as possible"" a deal to develop Ukraine's critical mineral resources, a pact designed to ""expand"" Ukraine's economy and ""guarantee Ukraine's long-term prosperity and security.""

The minerals deal was halted after the Trump-Zelenskyy clash.

""The delegations also discussed the importance of humanitarian relief efforts as part of the peace process, particularly during the above-mentioned ceasefire, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children,"" the joint statement said.

The announcement came hours after Russia said it had shot down more than 330 Ukrainian drones. Two people were killed and 18 were injured in the offensive, which Russian authorities said was the largest attack on Moscow and the surrounding area since Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022.

Kyiv said its targets included oil production and pipeline control facilities.

The talks in Saudi Arabia were anchored by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrii Sybiha, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and Andriy Yermak, the chief of Zelenskyy's presidential office.

""Representatives of both nations praised the bravery of the Ukrainian people in defense of their nation and agreed that now is the time to begin a process toward lasting peace,"" the joint statement said.

""The Ukrainian delegation reiterated the Ukrainian people's strong gratitude to President Trump, the U.S. Congress, and the people of the United States for making possible meaningful progress toward peace,"" the statement added.

At one point during Tuesday's talks in the coastal city of Jeddah, journalists were ushered in for a briefing with Rubio and Waltz, only to be ushered out when the conversation kept going. 

Kyiv's delegation had promised a news conference but scaled down to a briefing with only Ukrainian journalists, highlighting the fraught nature of the discussions.

WASHINGTON (AP) — In only two decades, China has grown to be the dominant player in shipbuilding, claiming more than half of the world's commercial shipbuilding market, while the U.S. share has fallen to just 0.1%, posing serious economic and national security challenges for the U.S. and its allies, according to a report released Tuesday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

In 2024 alone, one Chinese shipbuilder constructed more commercial vessels by tonnage than the entire U.S. shipbuilding industry has built since the end of World War II. China already has the world's largest naval fleet, the Washington-based bipartisan think tank said in its 75-page report.

“The erosion of U.S. and allied shipbuilding capabilities poses an urgent threat to military readiness, reduces economic opportunities, and contributes to China's global power-projection ambitions,” the report said.

Concerns about the poor state of U.S. shipbuilding have been growing in recent years, as the country faces rising challenges from China, which has the world's second largest economy and has ambitions to reshape the world order. At a congressional hearing in December, senior officials and lawmakers urged action. 

Last week, President Donald Trump told Congress that his Republican administration would “resurrect” the American shipbuilding industry, for commercial and military vessels, and he would create “a new office of shipbuilding in the White House.”




“We used to make so many ships,” Trump said. “We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.”

In February, the heads of four major labor unions called on Trump to boost American shipbuilding and enforce tariffs and other “strong penalties” against China for its increasing dominance in that sector.

“What we are seeing now is a recognition of the strategic significance of shipbuilding and port security, and the related challenges posed by China,” said Matthew Funaiole, a senior fellow in the China Power Project at CSIS and a co-author of the report. Funaiole said concerns over shipbuilding are “a fairly bipartisan issue.”

The report said that China's shipbuilding sector went through “a striking metamorphosis” in the past two decades, transforming from a “peripheral player” to the dominant player on the global market, with efforts centered on one state-owned enterprise: China State Shipbuilding Corporation, or CSSC.

At the same time, China has greatly expanded its navy. Last year, a CSIS assessment found that China was operating 234 warships, compared with the U.S. Navy's 219, although the U.S. continued to hold an advantage in guided missile cruisers and destroyers.

In developing recommendations for the U.S. to compete with China, the researchers zoomed in on the Chinese company's use of Beijing's “military-civil fusion” strategy, which blurs the lines between the country's defense and commercial sectors.

They found that CSSC, which builds both commercial and military ships, sells three-quarters of its commercial production to buyers outside China, including to the U.S.-allied Denmark, France, Greece, Japan and South Korea. These foreign firms are thus funneling billions of dollars to Chinese shipyards that also make warships, advancing China's modernization of its navy and providing Chinese defense contractors with key dual-use technology, the report said.

The CSIS researchers suggested that, as a long-term fix, the U.S. should invest in rebuilding its shipbuilding industry and work with allies to expand shipbuilding capacities outside China. For the near term, they recommended actions to level the playing field and “disrupt China's murky dual-use ecosystem,” such as by charging docking fees on Chinese-made vessels and cutting U.S. financial and business ties with CSSC and its subsidiaries.

The Trump administration has proposed new fees on China-linked vessels calling on U.S. ports. A BlackRock-led consortium last week agreed to acquire stakes in 43 ports across the globe, including the two ports on either side of the Panama Canal, from a Hong Kong-based conglomerate.

US President Donald Trump has announced plans to declare a 'National Emergency on Electricity' in response to Ontario's imposition of a 25 per cent surcharge on electricity exports to the United States, amid threats to halt exports entirely. This move is part of an escalating trade dispute between the two nations, with Trump vowing to impose retaliatory measures.

The emergency declaration will allow the US to alleviate the ""abusive threat"" from losing electricity imports from Canada, Donald Trump wrote in a post on social media.

US President Trump said in response to the surcharge imposed by Ontario, he would double existing tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, and warned Canada that it would pay a high cost if Ontario cuts off the flow of electricity to the US.

""Can you imagine Canada stooping so low as to use ELECTRICITY, that so affects the life of innocent people, as a bargaining chip and threat?"" Trump wrote. “They will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read about in History Books for many years to come!”

On Monday, Ontario put a 25 per cent fee on its electricity exports to New York, Michigan and Minnesota in response to Donald Trump's 25 per cent tariffs on Canada.

Ontario premier Doug Ford said he was applying ""maximum pressure"" on the US over its tariff war, and threatened to cut off exports entirely if Donald Trump increased tariffs further.

Ontario remains the largest exporter of electricity to the US in 2023, sending 15.2 TWh to the US.

Notably, Donald Trump already declared a national energy emergency on 20 January, unlocking emergency authorities to fast-track permitting and seek to retain production of baseload power plants.

President Trump has yet to offer more details on the electricity emergency, but the US Department of Energy (DOE) can issue emergency orders that would allow power plants to run at maximum capacity or waive some environmental regulations.

US President Donald Trump announced doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminium from Canada to 50%. Soon, Canada imposed a 25% surcharge on electricity it supplies to a region in US.

Soon, by Tuesday afternoon, Trump made a U-turn and called off the imposition of 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada, just hours after announcing the higher tariffs. 

The switch came after a Canadian official also backed off his own plans for a 25% surcharge on electricity, reported Reuters.

German Leftist BSW Party Challenges National Election Result

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's political newcomer, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), filed a complaint on Monday with the constitutional court seeking to legally challenge the results of the national election, a spokesperson said.

The leftist populist BSW, which was created last year, scored 4.97% in last month's election, lacking just 13,400 votes to enter parliament in a country where around 60 million people are eligible to cast a ballot.

""Several thousand BSW votes have apparently been incorrectly allocated to other parties or deemed invalid,"" the party's eponymous leader Sahra Wagenknecht was quoted as saying by paper the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).

Respect for the voters demanded that ""possible errors be scrutinised and corrected"", she was cited as saying.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration will immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and resume security assistance to Ukraine following Tuesday's talks between senior U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Meanwhile, U.S. officials are expected to speak with Russian officials in the coming days. Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is reportedly set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow this week.

After nearly eight hours of talks, Ukraine announced its readiness to accept the U.S. proposal for ""an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire"" in the war with Russia, pending Kremlin approval.

On March 5, Trump ordered a suspension of intelligence sharing with Ukraine, a move seen as an effort to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into talks with Russia to end the war.

The Kremlin had no immediate comment on a ceasefire proposal from the U.S. and Ukraine. Russia's Foreign Ministry said only that negotiations with U.S. officials could take place this week.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz led the U.S. delegation in Jeddah amid Trump's push to broker a swift end to the war that began in early 2022 with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Zelenskyy did not take part in Tuesday's meetings, with Ukraine represented by Zelenskyy chief of staff Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov and military commander Pavlo Palisa.

Rubio told reporters late Tuesday that Ukraine has taken a concrete step toward ending the war.

""Now hopefully we'll take this offer now to the Russians. And we hope that they'll say yes. That they'll say yes to peace. The ball's now in their court,"" he said.

Waltz said he will speak with his Russian counterpart ""in the coming days,"" while Rubio attends the G7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada. On Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte will visit the White House. All these discussions are part of the efforts to advance the peace process.

Waltz also told reporters that U.S. and Ukrainian officials delved into ""substantive details"" on how the war will ""permanently end"" and the types of guarantees needed for Ukraine's ""long-term security and prosperity.""

Before entering talks, Yermak told reporters that Ukraine is ready ""to do everything to achieve peace.""

When asked whether Ukraine is seeking security guarantees, Yermak responded ""yes,"" emphasizing that Ukraine wants to ensure Russia never repeats its aggression.

Mineral deal?

Trump has voiced interest in making continued military aid conditional on access to Ukraine's raw materials.

More than four dozen minerals, including several types of rare earths, nickel and lithium, are considered critical to the U.S. economy and national defense. Ukraine has large deposits of uranium, lithium and titanium.

Following Tuesday's talks, the joint statement said both sides agreed to “conclude as soon as possible a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources to expand Ukraine's economy and guarantee Ukraine's long-term prosperity and security.”

An agreement on the matter had been expected to be signed last month by Trump and Zelenskyy but was canceled after their tense Oval Office meeting Feb. 28.

For Rubio, this marks the second visit to Saudi Arabia since taking office. He and other senior U.S. officials held talks with Russian officials in Riyadh on Feb. 18. He is scheduled to travel to Canada on Wednesday for meetings with G7 foreign ministers.

The U.S. federal agency responsible for investigating transportation accidents is calling for immediate changes at Reagan National Airport near Washington, D.C. following a deadly mid-air collision involving an American Airlines flight and a U.S. Army helicopter earlier this year.

The National Transportation Safety Board issued an ""urgent recommendation report"" Tuesday, pressing for the Federal Aviation Administration to prohibit helicopters from flying on ""Route 4 between Hains Point and the Wilson Bridge when runways 15 and 33 are being used for departures and arrivals."" 

RELATED STORY | Why Reagan National Airport is one of the trickiest for pilots to land

The NTSB also urged the FAA to designate an alternative helicopter route that can be used when those runways are in use.

The recommended changes are in response to the crash that occurred on Jan. 29, when an American Airlines regional jet traveling from Wichita, Kansas, was preparing to land at Reagan National Airport. The jet collided with a Black Hawk helicopter conducting a training flight.

Both aircraft plunged into the Potomac River, killing all 67 people aboard.

RELATED STORY | Black boxes recovered from jet after fatal collision with helicopter

NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy has cautioned that the radio altitudes captured by flight recorders and the altitudes the flight crews saw from their main instruments may have conflicted. Officials said the collision likely occurred just under 300 feet — well above the helicopters 200-foot limit in that area.

The NTSB has not yet issued a final report about the crash, maintaining that all of its investigative findings are preliminary. Homendy reiterated to reporters Tuesday that it will take time to completely analyze all of the data and variables involved in the incident.","{'href': 'https://www.10news.com', 'title': 'ABC 10 News San Diego KGTV'}"

A crowd-sourced spreadsheet tracking the recent mass terminations of National Park Service (NPS) employees has revealed the impact on Michigan's national parks. The firings, which took place on February 14, 2025, were part of a broader reduction affecting more than 1,000 employees across over 430 NPS units and regional offices.

Breadth of U.S. National Parks

The National Park Service manages 433 units, which are commonly referred to as parks. These units span more than 85 million acres across the United States, the District of Columbia, and US territories. 

The National Park System includes many different types of units, including national parks, national monuments, national battlefields, national seashores, national historical sites, and national scenic trails. 

Spreadsheet Tracking of Staff Reductions

The spreadsheet was compiled by an anonymous seasonal park ranger. Axios shared a copy accounting for a total of 756 terminations thus far. The data has been widely shared through social media accounts such as “National Park Diaries” on Instagram and Threads.

While the National Park Service has yet to confirm the total number of employees affected, the spreadsheet continues to be updated by volunteers tracking developments across the country.

Michigan National Parks Impacted

Michigan is home to six national park units, which have not been spared from the nationwide reductions. According to the spreadsheet, the following Michigan parks experienced staff terminations:

Broader Impact on the National Park Service

Some of the hardest-hit national parks nationwide include Everglades National Park and Shenandoah National Park, each losing 15 employees, while Carlsbad Caverns lost 14 employees. Rocky Mountain National Park lost 12 employees and Grand Canyon National Park lost 10.

It's important to keep in mind the information is crowdsourced from a large group of people and is likely incomplete. The National Park Service firing data was compiled from reports shared by numerous park employees and workers in online groups rather than being an official government record.

Park officials have not provided an official statement regarding the full implications of the cuts, but visitors may experience reduced services, fewer ranger-led programs, and possible delays in maintenance and emergency response.

Visitors planning trips to Michigan's national parks are encouraged to check for potential changes in operating hours, services, and ranger availability as the parks adjust to reduced staffing levels.

The U.S. National Weather Service has issued a statement about an increased risk of fire spread Tuesday.

The announcement warns that there is an increased risk for fire spread Tuesday, for portions of eastern Pennsylvania.

South Whitehall Township also sent the U.S. National Weather Service's warning out Tuesday morning.

Minimum relative humidity values will be between 20 to 30% combined with southwest winds near 10 to 15 mph and gusts up to 25 mph, according to the National Weather Service.

High temperatures this afternoon will range from the mid 60s to low 70s. These conditions along with the continued drying of fine fuels could support the rapid spread of any fires that ignite, which could quickly become difficult to control, says the U.S. National Weather Service.

It states that outdoor burning is strongly discouraged.

Officials remind people to be sure to properly extinguish or dispose of any potential ignition sources, including smoking materials such as cigarette butts.

Be sure to check information on burn restrictions for your local area.

Some local Lehigh Valley Townships, including Bushkill and Weisenberg, have issued burn bans.

DELMAR—Bethlehem native and high school senior Jack Kroll became the U.S. Junior National Champion in ski jumping at the 2025 Nordic Combined Junior National Championships, held February 27-28 at Utah Olympic Park.

The 18-year-old, who competes in the under-20 division, also brought home a silver medal in the men's individual Nordic combined event and contributed to gold and silver medals in the men's Nordic combined and men's ski jumping team events, respectively.

For the junior national champion title, Kroll edged out 17-year-old Arthur Tirone from Steamboat Springs, Colorado, who finished second. Kroll was particularly surprised by his victory, as he and Tirone had identical combined jump scores for distance—132.5 meters. While Tirone recorded the higher single-jump score, 68.5 meters to Kroll's 66.5, Kroll's total of 250.7 points secured the win based on style scores.

Being named champion is “pretty cool, I guess,” Kroll said in a hometown interview. However, he remained humble about the victory, noting that many of his skiing friends who are “better than me were not there, but it still feels pretty good.”

Kroll said he never felt certain of his win—and, for a time, he wasn't. Due to a scoring error, Tirone was initially announced as the champion before officials corrected the mistake.

Kroll admitted that seeing Tirone's disappointment dampened his own excitement. “I actually felt bad for him because he was celebrating, and then he found out he didn't win,” Kroll said. “I know how bad I felt when I thought I hadn't won. For 5-10 minutes, it really sucked, so knowing that Arthur was going through the same thing indefinitely made it not as great.”

Kroll's championship builds on his 2024 performance at the same event, held last year in Anchorage, Alaska. In that competition, Kroll won four medals, including one gold.

“2025 was a long season with lots of ups and downs, but I stuck with it, and it paid off,” Kroll said.

Kroll's next challenge may be balancing ski jumping with college or taking a gap year if he cannot incorporate the sport into his education. He hopes to qualify for the Junior World Championships or another international competition.

“I have to prove myself at the next level,” Kroll said.

Nearly two months after American Airlines flight 5342 collided with a helicopter, leading to 67 fatalities, the National Transportation Safety Board has provided an update on the investigation.  

The National Transportation Safety Board is still looking for answers. 

Nearly two months after American Airlines flight 5342 collided with a Black Hawk Army Helicopter amid its descent into Washington D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, the NTSB is continuing its investigation. 

In a March 11 press conference, the safety board chair Jennifer Homendy said that army helicopters' flight patterns around the airport currently pose an ""intolerable risk"" for commercial flights, as there is only a definitive 75 feet of space between the flight pattern of helicopters and some descending airplanes. Therefore, the NTSB is recommending the FAA permanently suspend helicopter flights within that area of the airport. 

Indeed, Homendy detailed that out of 944,179 flights at the D.C. airport, there were 15,214 ""close proximity events,"" or situations where there was less than one nautical mile and a vertical distance of less than 400 feet. What's more, 85 instances had a distance of less than 1500 feet horizontally and 200 feet vertically. 

""There clearly were indicators,"" Homendy said of a potential crash. ""It shouldn't take a tragedy to require immediate action.""

She added of the American Airlines crash, ""It's stronger than an oversight.""

As the NTSB previously told NBC News Jan. 30, the full investigation of some evidence from the flight—which includes voice and flight data recorders from the American Airlines plane's cockpit—could take up to a year to complete. 

Updates on the Jan. 29 collision come amid a time of grieving the passengers aboard the American Airlines flight—which was traveling into D.C. from Wichita, Kansas—and the helicopter. The crash killed all 67 people aboard both aircrafts, 28 of whom were elite figure skaters on the American Airlines flight who were traveling back home after a development camp in Kansas. 

“This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's history and a tragedy of terrible proportions as one nation,” President Donald Trump said in a press briefing Jan. 30, shortly after confirming there were no survivors. “We grieve for every precious soul that has been taken from us so suddenly.”

Meanwhile, the U.S. Figure Skating organization, who shared a tribute video Feb. 5 honoring the victims of the crash, also shared, “We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts.”

In the months since the crash, loved ones to others on board have also opened up about their loss. NPR Host Adrian Ma recently detailed the loss of his girlfriend Kiah Duggins, who was set to begin teaching at Howard University School of Law shortly after the crash occurred. 

“There are reminders of Kiah everywhere,” Adrian told NPR. “Her glasses are on the nightstand. Her clothes are in the closet. Little curls of her hair are scattered around. I hear echoes of her voice sometimes, especially when I see something and I want to turn to her and say, like 'Hey, check this out' then I realize I can't do that anymore.”

As he put it, “It's just been a new level of pain that I didn't know I could experience.”

What Happened to the Passengers on American Airlines Flight 5342?

On the evening of Jan. 29, American Airlines flight 5342 traveling from Witchita, Kan., to Washington, D.C. collided with a United States Army Black Hawk helicopter near the Reagan Washington National Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration confirmed on X, formerly known as Twitter. The plane carrying 60 passengers and four crew members and the helicopter, which had three people aboard, crashed into the Potomac River. 

The passenger jet, a Canadian-made Bombardier CRJ-700 series twin-engine jet, was operated by American Airlines' subsidiary airline, PSA Airlines.

What was first a rescue mission became a recovery operation, with all 67 passengers in both aircraft being confirmed dead.

""Our hearts are with the victims' families as they navigate this tragic loss,"" Washington, D.C., officials shared in a statement Feb. 4. “We extend our deepest condolences and remain committed to supporting them through this difficult time.""

The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation, is still putting the pieces together but said in an update that data from air traffic control showed the helicopter appeared to be higher than the 200-foot ceiling allowed for its route.

""This data showed the Black Hawk was at 300 feet on the air traffic control display at the time of the collision. the NTSB said in a Feb. 4 investigation update. ""This data is rounded to the nearest 100 feet.”

Who Was Onboard American Airlines Flight 5342?

Among the 60 passengers were 28 American figure skaters, coaches and family members who were at a camp in Wichita, Kan., according to U.S. Figure Skating.

""These athletes, coaches, and family members were returning home from the National Development Camp held in conjunction with the U.S. Figure Skating Championships,"" the governing body shared in a statement obtained by NBC News. ""We are devastated by this unspeakable tragedy and hold the victims' families closely in our hearts.""

World champion Russian figure skating duo Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, who wed in 1995, were also onboard, the sport's governing body confirmed.

Hamaad Raza, whose wife was also on the American Airlines flight, was waiting for her at the international airport.

""I'm just praying that somebody's pulling her out of the river right now as we speak,"" he told CBS affiliate WUSA9. ""That's all I can pray for. I'm just praying to God.""

Soon-to-be Howard University School of Law professor Kiah Duggins was also a passenger on the flight. The university shared that the civil rights attorney, who earned her J.D. from Havard Law School, was set to join Howard's faculty this fall.

Who Was Onboard the U.S. Army Helicopter Involved in the Collision?

The helicopter was from Bravo Company, 12th Aviation Battalion out of Davison Army Airfield in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, Public Affairs Deputy Director for Joint Task Force-National Capital Region/Military District of Washington Ron McLendon II confirmed to NBC News.

The official shared that the aircraft was in the middle of a training mission at the time of the collision. 

The passengers onboard were identified as Capt. Rebecca Lobach, 28, Chief Warrant Officer Andrew Eaves, 39, and Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O'Hara, 28.

What Happens Next After Recover Efforts for American Airlines Flight 5342?

The FAA, U.S. Army and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the collision, with the latter taking the lead. The Pentagon has also initiated its own investigation.

While there are still more questions than answers, former NTSB and FAA investigator Jeff Guzzetti told Today that the air traffic control communications that night are ""going to be scrutinized by the NTSB, that controller will be interviewed and the radar data will be looked at by the NTSB.""

As of Feb. 4, NTSB investigators are continuing to transcribe the cockpit voice recorders for both aircraft, they confirmed in an update. The NTSB, in collaboration with the Naval Sea Systems Command Supervisor of Salvage and Diving , are continuing to recover the wreckage from the Potomac River. 

Who Has Spoken Out After American Airlines Flight 5342 Crashed Into the Potomac River?

President Donald J. Trump shared his condolences about the tragedy.

""I have been fully briefed on the terrible accident which just took place at Reagan National Airport,"" the White House statement said. ""May God Bless their souls. Thank you for the incredible work being done by our first responders. I am monitoring the situation and will provide more details as they arise.""

Ilia Malinin, the men's figure skater who won his third consecutive U.S. figure skating title in Witchita Jan. 26, confirmed he was not onboard the flight. He wrote on his Instagram Stories, ""I hope and pray for everyone who was on that flight is OK."" 

Wichita Mayor Lily Wu also expressed her grief, saying at a press conference that their ""hearts are heavy as a city.""

""We mourn with all those who have been impacted,"" she said. ""This is a terrible tragedy that will unite those in Washington, D.C., and Wichita, Kansas, forever.""

Two-time Olympic medalist Nancy Kerrigan shared an emotional message to reporters about the crash that claimed the lives of six skaters from Skating Club of Boston, where the athlete also formerly trained.

""I just wanted to be here and be part of our community,"" Kerrigan said through tears. ""When you find out you know some of the people on the plane, it's an even bigger blow.”

Donald Trump has halted a plan to double US tariffs on Canadian steel and metal imports to 50%, just hours after first threatening them.

Tariffs of 25% are still going ahead and will take effect from the 12 March.

The move by the president comes after the Canadian province of Ontario suspended new charges of 25% on electricity that it sends to some northern states in the US, hours after Trump threatened to sharply increase his tariffs on the country. 

It marked the latest skirmish in a trade war that risks economic damage to the two North American neighbours. 

""Cooler heads prevailed,"" said Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro told broadcaster CNBC, confirming that Trump would not move forward with his latest tariff threats.

Canada, one of America's closest trade partners, has borne the brunt of Trump's ire as he has launched trade battles in his first months in office. 

Trump has hit goods from the country, along with Mexico, with a blanket 25% tariff, though he signed orders temporarily exempting a significant number of items from the new duties, which he said were a response to drug and migrants crossing into the US. 

Canada is also facing 25% tariffs on its steel and aluminium, which are set to go into effect on Wednesday, after Trump said he was ending exemptions to the duties previously granted to some countries. 

Canada has called Trump's attacks unjustified and announced retaliation, including new tariffs on C$30bn ($22bn; £16bn) US products. 

Ford had announced he would tax electricity exports to the US in an effort to get those tariffs removed. 

He had also previously said he would ""not hesitate to shut off electricity completely"" if the US ""escalates"".

Announcing the decision to suspend the electricity duties, Ford said he thought it was the ""right decision"" to try to start focus the discussions on the wider North American free trade deal.

""With any negotiation that we have, there's a point that both parties are heated and the temperature needs to come down,"" he said,  thanking Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for reaching out about a meeting.

""They understand how serious we are,"" he added. ""We have both agreed, let cooler heads prevail. We need to sit down and move this forward.""

In his social media post early on Tuesday, which threatened to double levies on Canadian steel and aluminium, Trump said he was responding to Ford's moves. 

He also criticised Canada for relying on the US for ""military protection"", and reiterated that he wanted the country to become the 51st US state.

He add that it ""would make all tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear"" if Canada were to join the US as a state.

The White House declared the episode a win, saying in a statement that Trump had ""once again used the leverage of the American economy, which is the best and biggest in the world, to deliver a win for the American people"".

Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.

The companies that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. 

The back-and-forth came during a turbulent time for markets.

The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US fell a further 0.7% on Tuesday after dropping 2.7% on Monday, which was its biggest one-day drop since December.

The UK's FTSE 100 share index, which had edged lower earlier on Tuesday, fell further following Trump's latest comments and closed down more than 1%. The French Cac 40 index and German Dax followed a similar pattern.

Monday's stock market sell-off had begun after Trump said the economy was in a ""transition"" when asked about whether the US was heading for a recession.

Investors have been concerned about the economic effects of Trump's trade policies, which it is feared could push up inflation in the US and beyond, while uncertainty leads to economic paralyisis.

Even before Tuesday's comments, Trump's tariffs had already been causing concern for US businesses.

On Monday, Jason Goldstein, founder of Icarus Brewing, a small beer-maker in New Jersey that employs 50 people, told the BBC that previous tariff announcements had prompted a slew of emails from his suppliers. 

They have been warning that price increases for everything from grain and aluminium cans are likely to be coming.

Mr Goldstein has stockpiled an extra month's supply of cans and held off on new purchases as a result of the uncertainty and rapidly changing situation.

""It's definitely a worrying time for us,"" he said.

""Never before in my life have I had to read so much news, watch so much news to know, here's what my industry's going to look like tomorrow.""



Flat duty on steel and aluminium imports is a major hit for some of of the US's top trading partners. 

That both countries were able to make progress after a bitter White House meeting suggests Trump is always open to further negotiations.

Stock market falls, tariffs and other changes are reigniting fear of economic downturn in the US. 

The assumption that the US president would row back on policies if shares fell no longer holds true.

Tariffs are a central part of Trump's political vision, but economists fear they could spark a trade war.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his new administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump shopped for a new Tesla on the White House driveway on Tuesday, selecting a shiny red sedan to show his support for Elon Musk ‘s electric vehicle company as it faces blowback because of his work to advance the president's political agenda and downsize the federal government. 

“Wow,” Trump said as he eased his way into the driver's seat of a Model S. “That's beautiful.”

Musk got in on the passenger side and joked about “giving the Secret Service a heart attack” as they talked about how to start a vehicle that can reach 60 miles (95 kilometers) per hour in a few seconds. 

Trump told reporters that he would write a check for the car, which retails for roughly $80,000, and leave it at the White House so his staff can drive it. The president also said he hopes his purchase will boost Tesla, which is struggling with sagging sales and declining stock prices. 

When asked by FOX Business Network's Larry Kudlow, Elon Musk has this response on how he was able to run his other businesses while overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency.

“It's a great product,” he said. Referring to Musk, Trump said “we have to celebrate him.”

It was the latest — and most unusual — example of how Trump has demonstrated loyalty to Musk, who spent heavily on his comeback campaign last year and has been a key figure in his second administration. Tesla's stock price increased nearly 4% on Tuesday after dropping almost 48% since Trump took office in January.

The Republican president announced on social media overnight that he was going to buy a new Tesla as “a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.”




Musk continues to run Tesla — as well as the social media platform X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX — while also serving as Trump's adviser.

“Elon Musk is ‘putting it on the line' in order to help our Nation, and he is doing a FANTASTIC JOB!” Trump wrote. “But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's ‘baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for.”

Speaking later Tuesday at a business roundtable event, Trump said that Musk, the world's richest man, “shouldn't be scarified or have to suffer because he wants to help the government.”

Others have also rallied to Musk's defense. Alex Jones, a prominent conspiracy theorist, said that he bought a customized version of a Cybertruck that he'll give away to a customer of his online store next month. 

In addition to Tesla's struggles, Musk has faced other challenges too. He said X was targeted by a “massive cyberattack” that disrupted the social media platform on Monday, and the last two test launches of his Starship rocket ended in explosions.

Presidents almost never drive for security reasons. Joe Biden got behind the wheel of an electric truck while promoting domestic manufacturing, and Barack Obama took a spin with Jerry Seinfeld in the White House driveway for a comedy show. 

But regardless of the practicality of Trump's purchase, his overnight announcement about buying a Tesla represented another step in how the president has blurred lines between private and public interests.

During his first term, top adviser Kellyanne Conway urged people to show their support for Trump's daughter Ivanka by purchasing her retail products. 

“Go buy Ivanka's stuff,” she said. “I'm going to give it a free commercial here.”

Trump's wealth and business savvy is core to his political appeal. The president promoted his products while running for office last year, and he attached his name to a cryptocurrency meme coin that launched shortly before he took office. 

However, it's rare to see Trump use his own money to support an ally, no matter how important they are. 

Musk is the world's richest person, with billions of dollars in government contracts. He's also exerting sweeping influence over Trump's administration through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and traveling frequently with the president. 

During an interview with the Fox Business Network on Monday, host Larry Kudlow asked Musk “how are you running your other businesses” while also advising Trump.

“With great difficulty,” he said. 

“But there's no turning back, you say?” Kudlow responded.

“I'm just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud,” Musk said. 

Tesla has recently faced protests and vandalism. Police are investigating gunshots fired at a dealership in Oregon, and fire officials are examining a blaze that destroyed four Cybertrucks at a Tesla lot in Seattle. 

At times, the White House has needed to play cleanup for Musk, who had never worked in public service before and has admitted that he'll make mistakes along the way.

For example, Musk presented inflated estimates of fraud in government benefits like Social Security on Monday, leading Democrats to argue that he was planning cuts to the popular programs. 

“Most of the federal spending is entitlements,” Musk said in the interview. “That's the big one to eliminate.”

The next morning, a White House account on X criticized news organizations as “lying hacks” and told Democrats to “spare us the fake outrage” about reducing benefits. 

“He was clearly talking about the WASTE in the programs,” the White House posted.

FIRST ON FOX: A government accountability nonprofit is calling on the House to launch a probe into whether Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., misappropriated her taxpayer-funded member allowance.

Americans for Public Trust, a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization, sent a letter to the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) on Tuesday, questioning ""several troubling expenses"" from AOC's disbursements, which they claim are ""in contravention of federal law and the standards of the House of Representatives.""

Each member of Congess receives a Member Representational Allowance (""MRA""), a budget for official duties that ""may not be used for personal or campaign purposes,"" according to the Congressional Research Service. However, the ""Squad"" member is being accused of using these funds for ""campaign purposes.""

AOC reportedly made a payment of $3,700 to a ""Juan D Gonzalez"" and another for $850 to ""Bombazo Dance Co Inc.,"" with both expenditures described as being used for ""training.""

The progressive congresswoman has addressed the issue on social media, claiming in a post on X responding to a claim she is ""wasting tax dollars.""

""100% wrong,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote. ""None of this is taxpayer money, this is an FEC filing. Be loud and wrong about something else. Try again next time.""

The filing states that Ocasio-Cortez's ""assertion that these expenses are ‘an FEC filing,' and not reflective of her MRA – as well as her claim that '[n]one of this is taxpayer money' – is both troubling and obviously incorrect.""

""Either she does not know the difference between her campaign funds and MRA, or, more likely, she knows the highlighted expenses were not for official business and should have been paid by her campaign and reported to the FEC.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of Americans for Public Trust, said, ""Representative Ocasio-Cortez's troubling payments from her taxpayer funded account for activities such as dance classes should be investigated.""

""Representative Ocasio-Cortez's troubling payments from her taxpayer funded account for activities such as dance classes should be investigated. In the era of reining in government spending, the American people deserve to know lawmakers are being good stewards of their tax dollars.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's office for comment.

The congresswoman has faced ethics complaints in the past, including from the Heritage Foundation in 2023 accusing her of ""falsely accusing"" and ""defaming"" the creator of the Libs of TikTok Twitter account, Chaya Raichik.

Ocasio-Cortez also faced an ethics probe in 2023 after being accused of accepting ""impermissible gifts associated with her attendance at the Met Gala in 2021,"" which may have violated House rules, standards of conduct and federal law.

US President Donald Trump  has said he will ""buy a brand new Tesla"" after shares in the electric car firm fell more than 15%.

Trump blamed ""radical left lunatics"" boycotting the firm to ""attack and do harm"" to Tesla owner Elon Musk.

However, stock analysts said the main reason for the poor performance of the shares was fear about Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.

Trump's own economic policies on tariffs are also making investors nervous, analysts said.

US markets slumped on Monday as investors concerned about the economic effects of Trump tariffs sold shares.

This came after the US president hinted at a potential US recession, telling a TV interviewer that the world's biggest economy was in a ""period of transition"".

Investors fear Trump's tariffs could push up the pace of price rises and hit economic growth as firms pass on the costs of bringing goods into the country onto customers.

As part of the sell-off, shares in technology firms dropped, with Tesla stock sinking by 15.4%, while artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia, Facebook owner Meta, Amazon, and Google-parent Alphabet also fell sharply.

Tesla's shares recovered somewhat - rising 3.6% - when US markets opened on Tuesday. Other US tech stocks also regained some lost ground.

Tesla's initial drop came after a UBS analyst warned on Monday that new Tesla deliveries could be much lower than expected this year.

On Tuesday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform trying to drum up Tesla sales, asking ""Republicans, Conservatives, and all great Americans"" to support Musk, who has been putting his energies into trying to slash federal government jobs.

Despite his comments, Trump policies so far have been designed to limit electric car sales, including his revoking a 2021 order by former president Joe Biden that half of all car sales should be electric by 2030, and halting unspent government funds for charging stations.

Trump's tariffs could also hurt the manufacturer. Tesla chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said in January Tesla parts sourced from Canada and Mexico would be subject to the levies and that this could hit profitability.

Trump said on Tuesday Musk is doing a ""fantastic job"", but ""radical left lunatics"" are ""trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla"" in an effort ""to attack and do harm to Elon"".

""I'm going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,"" Trump added.

Tesla shares are back to around the level they were before the US election.

They spiked after Trump's win as investors bet on Musk's business benefitting from his backing the president.

Mr Musk has been heading up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which is not an official US government agency.

Doge has been trying to make huge cuts to federal funding, and Musk himself has has been voicing support for far-right politics.

His stance has been drawing criticism in the US. About 350 demonstrators protested outside a Tesla dealership in Portland, Oregon, last week, and nine demonstrators were arrested outside a New York City Tesla dealership earlier in March.

Linsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said that although there is ""an element"" of Elon Musk's politics ""having a brand impact"", there were other reasons for the share price fall.

Ultimately the drop ""comes down to hard numbers"", she said.

""When we look at new orders, for example in Europe and China, you can see that they've effectively halved over the last year,"" she said.

Sales in Europe have fallen sharply this year. Across the continent, they were down 45% in January compared to the same month in 2024, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).

There has also been a steep decline in China – a key market – and Australia.

Other experts have said Tesla is over-valued, so the fall is seen as a correction, while others have pointed to rising competition from some of Chinese electric vehicle companies.

Investors are ""certainly getting more worried about an economic slowdown too, so the richest-valued companies like Tesla have been hit hardest in recent days"", she added.

They have also been concerns that Musk has not been focusing on his firms.

In an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he said he was combining the Doge role with running his businesses ""with great difficulty"".

Alongside Tesla, his businesses include Space X, which has experienced serious failures in the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket, and the social media network X, which suffered an outage on Monday.

That both countries were able to make progress after a bitter White House meeting suggests Trump is always open to further negotiations.

                    The News Journal Names Dr. Janice Nevin Among Delaware's Most Influential Business Leaders                

ChristianaCare President and CEO Janice E. Nevin, M.D., MPH, has been recognized as a top business leader by Delaware Online/The News Journal.

For the fifth year in a row, Delaware Online/The News Journal recognized “the folks who continue to shape Delaware's future … those who have a big impact in the First State — from leaders in health care, law and business, as well as movers and shakers in the arenas of dining, entertainment, social media and more.”

Since 2014, Nevin has overseen ChristianaCare's ascension as a national health care leader in the areas of quality and safety, health equity, virtual health and value-based care. At the same time, she has guided ChristianaCare's expansion of services and programs throughout the region including Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

“I am particularly proud of our focus on quality and safety, health equity, improving access and driving down health care costs while increasing the value of our care,” Nevin said.

“We are doing that through programs like Hospital Care at Home, which provides virtual and in-person care by a team of physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and other providers. And our Medicaid accountable care organization has shown great reductions in spending — $6.2 million in 2023 alone — while improving the quality of care for nearly 30,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Delaware.

“Our quality and patient safety metrics have been nationally recognized by U.S. News and World Report, Newsweek, the American College of Surgeons and many more. We couldn't do any of this without our great staff, who inspire me every day. Our talented caregivers are truly ChristianaCare's greatest asset.”

A visionary and collaborative health care leader, Nevin has led ChristianaCare's transformation from a health care system to a system that truly impacts health. She is nationally recognized as a pioneer and thought leader in value-based care and population health, including her belief that truly great health care is built on the values of love and excellence. These values are exemplified in her commitment to health equity and making high-quality care more accessible and affordable for everyone in the communities that ChristianaCare serves.

In the heart of Crozet, a small family-owned bakery is bringing the flavors of Czech tradition to the community — one handmade pastry at a time. 

CROZET, Va. (CBS19 NEWS) -- In the heart of Crozet, a small family-owned bakery is bringing the flavors of Czech tradition to the community — one handmade pastry at a time.

“It's a labor of love, and it's a lot of labor,” said Marketa Johnson, co-owner of Praha Bakery.

For almost two years, Marketa and co-owner William Johnson have been serving up sweet and savory baked goods, with a special emphasis on kolaches and other yeast dough pastries.

“We love making everything from scratch. So we never buy pre-made dough, frozen dough — everything that we have here is made right here at Praha,” said Marketa Johnson.

That dedication to quality even extends to their ingredients, including their honey.

“We have anywhere from 20 to 70 beehives at any given time and harvest honey at least once a year,"" said William Johnson.

That honey plays a key role in their signature menu items.

“Our signature cake is the honey cake, which is also one of our most popular ones. And then we also take pride in the sourdough,"" said Marketa Johnson.

In 2023 alone, they produced over 3,000 pounds of honey, selling it at the bakery and incorporating it into their recipes.

As they approach their second anniversary in May, the couple reflects on their journey.

“Marketa's from Prague, I'm from Denver. We wound up here in Crozet and never wanted to leave — so we never did,"" said William Johnson.

“We're just really happy to be here in a town that we love, seeing people we've known for 13 years become our regular customers,"" Marketa Johnson said.

For the Johnsons, Praha Bakery isn't just a business — it's a way to share their culture, passion, and love of baking with the community.

FALL RIVER — This weekend marks the end of an era for another Fall River restaurant staple.

Just one week after the closure of a famous North End eatery, O Gil Restaurant will be bidding a bittersweet goodbye at the beloved family restaurant, a go-to for Portuguese cuisine in the city's South End for 34 years. 

Looking to get a taste of their authentic no-frills, all-flavor fare before it's too late? Better head to 915 County St. soon.

On Tuesday, longtime employee Debbie Esposito confirmed that Saturday, March 15, will be their last day of business.

""It's very sad, I've been here 32 years,"" said Esposito, a long time waitress and bartender who started there in 1993. ""But everything good comes to an end.""

The Tiverton resident is a veteran among the O Gil staff whose tenure at the small neighborhood spot goes back almost as far as its inception. 

Current owner Victor Fagundo opened O Gil in 1991, along with his brother-in-law Felisberto Sousa, who died in September 2024.

O Gil Restaurant — named after Fagundo's father, Gil Fagundo, who is credited with bringing Portuguese steak to Fall River — garnered a reputation over the years for serving one of the best Portuguese steaks — and more — in a city packed with Luso options. 

According to Esposito, among the things that made O Gil special was the family atmosphere and the love and care they poured into their cooking.

""Everything is homemade, our sandwiches are huge, our french fries are hand-cut, the soups are the best in the city, homemade chicken and kale,"" she said. ""They put a lot of heart and soul into it ... it was always a family restaurant.""

Since Fagundo and Sousa announced their desire to retire and put the restaurant up for sale in late 2023, locals have been anxiously counting down O Gil's final days.

And while the closure doesn't come as a shock for patrons, it's still a blow for the many who've long frequented the casual, homestyle spot tucked away on a Fall River side street. 

""Everybody's bummed out and upset,"" Esposito said.

The sale of the County Street property is not yet official but is expected to change hands this month, according to new owner Kristin Teves.

Teves, co-owner of North South Property Management along with her husband, is no stranger to the Fall River restaurant fixture, having managed the South End property for over 20 years.

Her plans include leasing the County Street location and renovations to the restaurant space are also expected.

While her hope is that the O Gil spot will continue to operate as a restaurant, Teves indicated that is no guarantee and the future of the building remains uncertain at this time.

""It's definitely a legacy here in Fall River,"" Teves said in a late February interview. ""Whenever you're in a group of Portuguese people, everyone has their opinion on their favorite steak and favorite meal in the city, and O Gil's is always in the top three. I'd like to keep it there for people that love it and for people that have grown up with it. It's truly a part of the city and I'd like to see it stay a part of the city.""","{'href': 'https://www.heraldnews.com', 'title': 'Fall River Herald News'}"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news","Stocks steady in Europe after US markets plunge","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gdwgjkk1no","Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:03:33 GMT","

A sell-off in global shares eased in Europe on Tuesday following a sharp fall in US stocks that came as investors raised concerns about the negative economic impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

It followed the president saying in a TV interview that the world's biggest economy was in a ""period of transition"", when asked about suggestions of a potential recession.

Since those remarks were broadcast on Sunday, top Trump officials and advisers have sought to calm investor fears.

The US S&P 500 share index fell nearly 3% on Monday, but in Europe most of the major markets opened little changed. 

In a Fox News interview broadcast at the weekend but recorded on Thursday, Trump appeared to acknowledge concerns about the economy. 

""I hate to predict things like that,"" he said. ""There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing.""

Charu Chanana, an investment strategist at investment bank Saxo, told the BBC:  ""The previous notion of Trump being a stock market president is being re-evaluated.""

On Monday in New York, the S&P 500, which tracks the biggest companies listed in the US, ended the trading day 2.7% lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2%.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq share index was hit particularly hard, sinking 4%.

Tesla shares fell by 15.4%, while artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant Nvidia was down more than 5%. Other major tech stocks including Meta, Amazon and Alphabet also fell sharply.

On Tuesday, Asian stocks fell sharply at first before recovering. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed down 0.6% and South Korea's Kospi ended 1.3% lower.

The dollar slid further against the pound and the euro on Tuesday, having fallen sharply since the beginning of the month.

However, there was little sign of the turbulence spilling into Europe. While the FTSE 100 index, which tracks the biggest companies listed in the UK, dipped 0.1%, Germany's Dax index rose 0.4% and the French Cac 40 climbed 0.2%.

""Trump is keeping political leaders guessing regarding his next moves on tariffs, but the problem is that he's also keeping investors guessing and that's reflected in the dire market mood,"" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at financial services firm KCM Trade.

""Whilst recession talk may be premature, the mere prospect of this coming to fruition is enough to put traders into a defensive mindset.""

Ruth Foxe-Blader of Foxe Capital told the BBC's Today programme that Monday had been a ""very difficult and chaotic day for the stock market in the US"" and ""the markets hate chaos"".

She said investors were reacting to Trump's policies - but also selling tech stocks they felt were overvalued.

Lindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said the drop in Tesla share price ""comes down to hard numbers"" with new orders halving in Europe and China over the past year.

She added there was ""an element"" of Elon Musk's politics ""having a brand impact"", but ""there's other angles"" including competition from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers and investors ""getting more worried about an economic slowdown"".

After trading closed on Monday, a White House official told reporters: ""We're seeing a strong divergence between [the] animal spirits of the stock market and what we're actually seeing unfold from businesses and business leaders.""

They added: ""The latter is obviously more meaningful than the former on what's in store for the economy in the medium to long term.""

In a separate statement later in the day, White House spokesman Kush Desai said ""industry leaders"" had responded to Trump's agenda, including tariffs, ""with trillions in investment commitments"".

Last week, the main US markets fell back to the level seen before Trump's election victory last November, which had initially been welcomed by investors due to hopes of tax cuts and lighter regulation.

Investors fear Trump's tariffs - which are taxes on goods applied as they enter the country - will lead to higher prices and dent growth in the world's largest economy.

The president introduced the measures after accusing China, Mexico and Canada of not doing enough to end the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the US. The three countries have rejected the accusations.

Economist Mohamed El-Erian said investors were initially optimistic about Trump's plans for de-regulation and lower taxes, while under-estimating the likelihood of a trade war.

He said the recent falls in the stock market, which started last week, reflect the adjustment of those bets.

""It's a complete change in what the market expected,"" he added, noting that investors are also responding to signs that businesses and households are starting to hold off on spending due to uncertainty, which could hurt economic growth.

But Kevin Hassett, an economic adviser to President Trump, has pushed back against those projecting this bleak outlook. 

In an interview with CNBC, Hassett said there were many reasons to be optimistic about the US economy and that that tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico and China were already bringing manufacturing and jobs to the United States. 

""There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward,"" he said. 

He admitted there were some ""blips in the data"" for this quarter, which he pinned on the timing of Trump's tariffs and the ""Biden inheritance"". 

That both countries were able to make progress after a bitter White House meeting suggests Trump is always open to further negotiations.

The mass layoffs will impact nearly 2,100 people who are set to be placed on leave from 21 March.

Endowed with minerals but losing ground to rebels, the Congolese government wants to boost security.

Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent US resident, was arrested for his role in last year's pro-Palestinian campus protests.

Actor and comedian Mo Amer explains why he avoided mentioning the 7 October attack in the show's storyline.
