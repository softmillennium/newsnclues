The disparities between men and women in prevalence, risk factors and symptoms of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) have a profound impact on prevention, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes for women, according to a new American Heart Association scientific statement published today in the Association's flagship, peer-reviewed journal Circulation.

"Peripheral vascular disease is often under-recognized and understudied in women," said Esther S.H. Kim, M.D., M.P.H., FAHA, chair of the writing group for the new scientific statement. Dr. Kim is the Izard Family Distinguished Chair in Cardiovascular Medicine, a professor of medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and director of the Center for Women's Cardiovascular Health at Atrium Health in Charlotte, North Carolina. "While differences in heart disease between men and women are increasingly recognized, equivalent focus on vascular diseases affecting blood vessels outside the heart remains lacking. In order to improve the quality of life and prolong the lives of women with PVD, more research is needed to identify and address these disparities."

The scientific statement, "Sex Differences in Peripheral Vascular Disease," summarizes current knowledge of the differences between men and women with PVD; highlights disparities in risk factors, screening, treatment and outcomes; and outlines key research priorities to mitigate these disparities and promote health equity.

The statement highlights numerous disparities in risk factors, symptoms, screening, treatment and outcomes for various types of PVD.

PVD leads to significant illness and health complications. However, the disparities between women and men hinder equitable outcomes. Identified disparities in effective prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care underscore the importance of tailored prevention and treatment strategies."

Esther S.H. Kim, M.D., M.P.H., FAHA, chair of the writing group for the new scientific statement

According to the statement, there is a need to prioritize research to help define differences in PVD between men and women. Future research, from research at the cellular level to clinical trials, should include sex in their design and reporting. Suggestions include:

In addition, the statement also includes suggestions that may help improve diagnosis and long-term prognosis for women with PVD:

This scientific statement was prepared by the volunteer writing group on behalf of the American Heart Association's Council on Peripheral Vascular Disease; the Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing; the Council on Clinical Cardiology; the Council on Genomic and Precision Medicine; the Council on Quality of Care and Outcomes Research; and the Stroke Council. American Heart Association scientific statements promote greater awareness about cardiovascular diseases and stroke issues and help facilitate informed health care decisions. Scientific statements outline what is currently known about a topic and what areas need additional research. While scientific statements inform the development of guidelines, they do not make treatment recommendations. American Heart Association guidelines provide the Association's official clinical practice recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>

A year ago, a new head of Social Security set out to stop the agency from financially devastating many of the people it was meant to help.

The agency had long made it a practice to reduce or halt benefit checks to recoup billions of dollars in payments it sent recipients but later said they never should have received.

Martin O'Malley, then the Social Security Administration commissioner, announced in March 2024 the agency would no longer cut off people's monthly old-age, survivors, and disability checks to recoup money they had allegedly been overpaid — a pattern he called "clawback cruelty." Instead, it would default to withholding 10% of monthly benefits. The new policy allowed people who already live on little to pay their rent and keep food on the table.

Last Friday, the Trump administration reversed that policy.

Beginning March 27, to recover new overpayments, the Social Security Administration will automatically withhold 100% of recipients' monthly benefits, the agency announced.

The agency said it was acting in the interest of fiscal responsibility and that the reversal would save the government about $7 billion over a decade.

"It is our duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding, as it was during the Obama administration and first Trump administration, to properly safeguard taxpayer funds," acting Commissioner Lee Dudek said in a news release.

Advocates for Social Security beneficiaries described the action as cruel and harmful.

"The results are predictable: more unnecessary suffering," said Kathleen Romig, who worked at the Social Security Administration under O'Malley and is now director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Kate Lang of the advocacy group Justice in Aging said she was heartbroken.

"Those who are most vulnerable, with the fewest resources, are the ones who will feel the harsh impacts of this change," she said. Many "are going to be unable to buy food or keep the roof over their head," she said.

In 2023, after an investigation by KFF Health News and Cox Media Group cast a spotlight on overpayments and clawbacks, lawmakers from both parties called on the Social Security Administration to change its approach.

The policy change a year ago was inspired in part by the plight of people such as Denise Woods, who was sleeping in her Chevy in Savannah, Georgia, in December 2023 while contending with lupus and congestive heart failure after the government cut off her disability benefits. The government was demanding she repay almost $58,000.

Many overpayments are the result of government error. It can take the government years to figure out it has been paying someone too much, and by then, the amount the government says it is owed can grow far beyond a beneficiary's ability to repay. And it has often demanded that recipients repay the full amount within 30 days.

As of October, the SSA was withholding at least a portion of monthly benefit payments from hundreds of thousands of people, according to data the SSA provided last fall to KFF Health News and Cox Media Group. The agency said it was withholding up to 10% from 669,903 people to recoup an overpayment. Asked whether those numbers covered all types of benefits administered by the SSA, the agency's press office didn't say.

“Under Trump's leadership, Social Security has reinstated a cruel policy of clawing back Social Security overpayments with no regard for an American's ability to pay or whether the overpayment was an error by the agency," said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.

The new plan to completely withhold monthly benefits from recipients who were allegedly overpaid does not extend to the Supplemental Security Income program, one of two Social Security programs for people with disabilities. SSI, as the agency explains, covers "people with disabilities and older adults who have little or no income or resources."

The government's estimate that cutting people off completely will save $7 billion over a decade implies it expects many more overpayments in the years ahead.

The SSA's March 7 announcement was part of a broader dismantling of Biden-era policies under President Donald Trump. It was also part of a broader upheaval at the Social Security Administration, which announced In February that it would cut its staff from about 57,000 to 50,000.

In an interview Monday, O'Malley predicted that the public will experience much longer wait times trying to get through to the agency by phone and longer waits for disability determinations.

Social Security runs on a very old computer system, he said, and driving people out of the agency who understand it "can only result in system collapse."

"The risk of totally shutting down the agency is greatly increased by people mucking around that don't know what they're doing," O'Malley said.

On the PBS NewsHour last week, he advised recipients to save money to prepare for an interruption of benefits.

Trump deputy Elon Musk has boasted of taking a chainsaw to the federal government and has called Social Security a Ponzi scheme. In a signed declaration filed in federal court last week, a recently retired SSA official, Tiffany Flick, said she "witnessed a disregard for critical processes" as members of DOGE — the Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump established by executive order — demanded access to sensitive Social Security systems, including files that contain beneficiaries' banking information.

New management at the SSA called its workforce "bloated." But, under the previous administration, the agency was telling a starkly different story.

A year ago, O'Malley told lawmakers that, as the number of people receiving benefits increased, "historic underfunding and understaffing" at the agency had created a "service delivery crisis."

Late last year, the agency provided data to KFF Health News showing that in September its workforce was near a 50-year low. As of last month, applicants for disability benefits were waiting an average of more than seven months for a decision, according to the SSA website.

The staffing cuts will lead to more overpayments than ever and will make it harder for the people affected to clear up mistakes, said Jen Burdick, an attorney at Community Legal Services of Philadelphia.

As KFF Health News and Cox Media Group revealed in 2023, about 2 million people a year were receiving notices from the SSA that they were overpaid and owed money back.

People can appeal overpayment notices, request a lower withholding rate, or ask the SSA to waive collection altogether, the agency said. The SSA does not pursue recoveries while an initial appeal or waiver request is pending, it said.

Shortly before O'Malley left the SSA in November, the agency implemented changes that made it easier for beneficiaries to get overpayments waived. The agency spelled out grounds for determining the beneficiary was not at fault — for instance, if the agency continued to issue overpayments after the beneficiary reported a change in their financial circumstances that should have led to a reduction in benefits. Those policy changes remain intact.

Several Republicans who expressed concern about clawbacks in the aftermath of 2023 news coverage did not respond to inquiries for this article or declined to comment. One of them was Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who is now chair of the Senate's Special Committee on Aging.

"Hardworking American taxpayers pay into Social Security all of their lives so that they can depend on it in the time they need it most," Scott said in a 2023 letter to the agency. "The fact that the SSA's actions are leaving some of them worse off, through no fault of their own, is absolutely unacceptable."

Kirk Vartan pays more than $2,000 a month for a high-deductible health insurance plan from Blue Shield on Covered California, the state's Affordable Care Act marketplace. He could have selected a cheaper plan from a different provider, but he wanted one that includes his wife's doctor.

"It's for the two of us, and we're not sick," said Vartan, general manager at A Slice of New York pizza shops in the Bay Area cities of San Jose and Sunnyvale. "It's ridiculous."

Vartan, who is in his late 50s, is one of millions of Californians struggling to keep up with health insurance premiums ballooning faster than inflation.

Average monthly premiums for families with employer-provided health coverage in California's private sector nearly doubled over the last 15 years, from just over $1,000 in 2008 to almost $2,000 in 2023, a KFF Health News analysis of federal data shows. That's more than twice the rate of inflation. Also, employees have had to absorb a growing share of the cost.

The spike is not confined to California. Average premiums for families with employer-provided health coverage grew as fast nationwide as they did in California from 2008 through 2023, federal data shows. Premiums continued to grow rapidly in 2024, according to KFF.

Small-business groups warn that, for workers whose employers don't provide coverage, the problem could get worse if Congress does not extend enhanced federal subsidies that make health insurance more affordable on individual markets such as Covered California, the public marketplace that insures more than 1.9 million Californians.

Premiums on Covered California have grown about 25% since 2022, roughly double the pace of inflation. But the exchange helps nearly 90% of enrollees mitigate high costs by offering state and federal subsidies based on income, with many families paying little or nothing.



Rising premiums also have hit government workers — and taxpayers. Premiums at CalPERS, which provides insurance to more than 1.5 million of California's active and retired public employees and family members, have risen about 31% since 2022. Public employers pay part of the cost of premiums as negotiated with labor unions; workers pay the rest.

"Insurance premiums have been going up faster than wages over the last 20 years," said Miranda Dietz, a researcher at the University of California-Berkeley Labor Center who focuses on health insurance. "Especially in the last couple of years, those premium increases have been pretty dramatic."

Dietz said rising hospital prices are largely to blame. Consumer costs for hospitals and nursing homes rose about 88% from 2009 through 2024, roughly double the overall inflation rate, according to data from the Department of Labor. The rising cost of administering America's massive health care system has also pushed premiums higher, she said.

Insurance companies remain highly profitable, but their gross margins — the amount by which premium income exceeds claims costs — were fairly steady during the last few years, KFF research shows. Under federal rules, insurers must spend a minimum percentage of premiums on medical care.



Rising insurance costs are cutting deeper into family incomes and squeezing small businesses.

The average annual cost of family health insurance offered by private sector companies was about $24,000, or roughly $2,000 a month, in California during 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Employers paid, on average, about two-thirds of the bill, with workers paying the remaining third, about $650 a month. Workers' share of premiums has grown faster in California than in the rest of the nation.

Many small-business workers whose employers don't offer health care turn to Covered California. During the last three decades, the percentage of businesses nationwide with 10 to 24 workers offering health insurance fell from 65% to 52%, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute. Coverage fell from 34% to 23% among businesses with fewer than 10 employees.

"When an employee of a small business isn't able to access health insurance with their employer, they're more likely to leave that employer," said Bianca Blomquist, California director for Small Business Majority, an advocacy group representing more than 85,000 small businesses across America.

Kirk Vartan said his pizza shop employs about 25 people and operates as a worker cooperative — a business owned by its workers. The small business lacks negotiating power to demand discounts from insurance companies to cover its workers. The best the shop could do, he said, were expensive plans that would make it hard for the cooperative to operate. And those plans would not offer as much coverage as workers could find for themselves through Covered California.

"It was a lose-lose all the way around," he said.

Mark Seelig, a spokesperson for Blue Shield of California, said rising costs for hospital stays, doctor visits, and prescription drugs put upward pressure on premiums. Blue Shield has created a new initiative that he said is designed to lower drug prices and pass on savings to consumers.

Even at California companies offering insurance, the percentage of employees enrolled in plans with a deductible has roughly doubled in 20 years, rising to 77%, federal data shows. Deductibles are the amount a worker must pay for most types of care before their insurance company starts paying part of the bill. The average annual deductible for an employer-provided family health insurance plan was about $3,200 in 2023.

During the last two decades, the cost of health insurance premiums and deductibles in California rose from about 4% of median household income to about 12%, according to the UC Berkeley Labor Center, which conducts research on labor and employment issues.

As a result, the center found, many Californians are choosing to delay or forgo health care, including some preventive care.



California is trying to lower health care costs by setting statewide spending growth caps, which state officials hope will curb premium increases. The state recently established the Office of Health Care Affordability, which set a five-year target for annual spending growth at 3.5%, dropping to 3% by 2029. Failure to hit targets could result in hefty fines for health care organizations, though that likely wouldn't happen until 2030 or later.

Other states that imposed similar caps saw health care costs rise more slowly than states that did not, Dietz said.

"Does that mean that health care becomes affordable for people?" she asked. "No. It means it doesn't get worse as quickly."

The pope rested peacefully overnight after his prognosis was "lifted" on Monday as he begins his 26th straight day in the hospital, the Vatican said.

Vatican sources told ABC News that Francis' prognosis being lifted means he's no longer in imminent danger, but the clinical picture still remains complex.

The 88-year-old pontiff will continue "for additional days, the pharmacological medical therapy in a hospital environment" due to the "complexity of the clinical picture and the significant infectious picture presented at hospitalization," the Vatican said.

"The improvements recorded in previous days have further consolidated, as confirmed by both blood tests and clinical objectivity and the good response to pharmacological therapy. For these reasons, the doctors decided to lift the prognosis," the Holy See, the Vatican's press office, said in a statement Monday.

The pope will move back to noninvasive mechanical ventilation and will continue an antibiotic treatment, the Vatican sources said.

Francis' doctors said there are positive signs of the pontiff's recovery, but caution remains, according to the Vatican sources.

Francis was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital on Feb. 14 and was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia.

Thursday will mark the 12th anniversary of when Pope Francis was voted to succeed Pope Benedict XVI, who previously resigned.

Australian mother Clementine Joyce is celebrating an important milestone in her latest pregnancy journey — reaching 25 weeks. The 31-year-old, from Sydney's Northern Beaches, has been pregnant a total of four times, each through in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

She's part of a rapidly growing group of Australian women turning to IVF to conceive, with some projections suggesting that within the next century, a third of all babies in the country could be born in this way.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reports that women are having children much later in life, with the highest fertility rates now seen in those aged 30 to 34. While overall fertility is steadily declining, the data also showed that pregnancy rates among women in their 40s are doubling, while those in their 20s are seeing a huge drop.

For Clementine, these figures come as no surprise. For her, IVF has resulted in her daughter, Val, and her current pregnancy. Speaking to Yahoo, the Sydneysider, a nurse, said the majority of her female friends have also struggled with conception. "I would say more of my friends who have tried for babies have struggled compared to those who haven't," she told Yahoo News Australia.

Clementine said that, eventually, many "ended up pregnant", either after trying "for over a year naturally" or from receiving some form of fertility help. She said "in comparison to most" her "IVF journey has actually gone smoothly". But it's not been without its difficulties.

"With IVF and infertility, you're always pending results or significant health news that puts you in a state of distress," she said. "Fertility and making babies feels like a competition. You feel like everyone around you is announcing a pregnancy while you're being left behind with an empty bank account, a barren uterus, guilt for not being able to provide, and no baby.

"There is this loud ticking clock where you know every second you're not pregnant, your chances are getting worse and worse. And even when, or if you get that phone call telling you you're pregnant, the hurdles you go through to maintain that pregnancy are so complicated and debilitating."

As young Australians delay starting a family, it's an increasingly common plight. "Women are starting to try to have babies basically at the end of their fertility window," she said.

Associate Professor Alex Polyakov, medical director at Genea Melbourne, is all too familiar with the struggles facing women like Clementine. He explained that Australia's declining fertility is driven solely by the fact that couples are delaying having kids.

More women are choosing to have children later in life, due to various factors including career advancement, financial stability and personal aspirations. The trend has been particularly noticeable in developed countries like Australia, where the average age of first-time mothers has steadily increased.

"Women are as healthy as they used to be. It's just that in the past – 30 to 40 years ago – the average age of the first motherhood was early 20s," he told Yahoo News.

"At the moment in Australia, the average age of first motherhood is 32 and the average age of IVF patients who come to see us for fertility treatment is 38 — but the best eggs are available in their mid-20s. By the time the woman is 38, the quality of eggs, and the number, drastically decreases.

"So that's the problem. It's a social problem, not a medical problem. And if it wasn't for migration, our population would actually be shrinking right now."

This week, NaturoBest, a prenatal vitamin brand, released data that suggested that within the next century, as many as one in three babies in Australia could be conceived via IVF.

Polyakov suggested that while it's within the realm of possibility, many variable factors will influence how women conceive in the future. He pointed out that just as scientific advancements in recent decades have significantly improved older women's chances of conceiving, similar breakthroughs are likely to continue, making it challenging to forecast future fertility and IVF rates.

He did predict however that within the next 100 years, there "will be technologies available" that will "allow all women to have babies" and "preserve their fertility much better" than what is available today.

"If you think about the progress in the last 50 years, it's been spectacular, but it's only accelerating, and so in the next 100 years, there will be technologies available where a woman at any age would be able to have a baby. And in the NaturoBest paper, they actually talk about this, creating eggs from peripheral or skin cells, or pluripotent cells — various stem cells."

But despite these potential future advancements, there are still significant emotional and personal challenges many continue to face in the journey to parenthood.

Clementine is determined to break the stigma surrounding IVF. She wants to empower women to openly discuss their struggles and share their experiences, in a bid to normalise the conversation and reduce the shame often associated with fertility challenges.

"I have a good friend who was doing IVF treatments at the same time, and she had eight failed transfers in a row. It's heartbreaking," she said. "To those going through the heartache of not falling pregnant or losing pregnancies. I feel it so hard. Try to be kind to yourself. It's cruel and unfair.

"With all the fertility treatments I've done, I have a higher chance of getting both ovarian and breast cancer. Children born via IVF are slightly more likely to have hepatic tumours. Women are more likely to develop postnatal depression (PND) after giving birth, and women with IVF pregnancies have a slightly increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage compared to those who conceive naturally.

"But, I've successfully gotten pregnant and been able to carry one pregnancy to full term, and hopefully this pregnancy as well. Getting pregnant naturally and easily would be ideal, but the reality is that it is going to be less and less common, and we need to accept that."
