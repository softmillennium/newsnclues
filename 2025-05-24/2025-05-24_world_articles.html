                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a post on his social media platform, Trump announced a “planned partnership” between U.S. Steel and Nippon, prompting confusion about the specific terms of the deal. Former U.S Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) called Trump's reversal “a betrayal of American workers. United Steelworkers international president David McCall said in response to Trump's announcement that “we cannot speculate” about the details of the arrangement. But he reiterated the union's concerns that “Nippon, a foreign corporation with a long and proven track record of violating our trade laws, will further erode domestic steelmaking capacity and jeopardize thousands of good, union jobs.” McCall on Thursday responded to the panel's recommendation with a scathing statement, warning that “allowing the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon, a serial trade cheater, will be a disaster for American Steelworkers, our national security, and the future of American manufacturing.” “It is simply absurd to think that we could ever entrust the future of one of our most vital industries—essential to both national defense and critical infrastructure—to a company whose unfair trade practices continue to this day,” said McCall. “For decades, Nippon has been dumping its products into our markets, costing us thousands of good, community-supporting jobs and undermining our steelmaking capabilities.” “Now, as it continues to make flashy promises about proposed investments, it remains clear Nippon is simply seeking to undercut our domestic industry from the inside,” he continued. “President Trump has publicly pledged to block this sale since January 2024. We now urge him to act decisively, shutting the door once and for all on this corporate sellout of American Steelworkers and defending U.S. manufacturing.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

The former leader of the Conservative party can be seen holding his daughter, Poppy Eliza Josephine Johnson, in an Instagram post shared on Saturday. Johnson shared a carousel of photographs announcing the news, adding that their baby was born on 21 May and that they are “totally smitten”. “I can't believe how pretty and tiny you are. Not sure I've slept a minute since you were born as can't stop looking at how completely lovely you are.” The couple was married in May 2021 at Westminster Cathedral and share three children, Wilfred, Romy and Frank, with Poppy joining as the “final gang member”. Carrie Johnson added: “Wilf, Romy and Frank are utterly delighted, particularly Romy who was desperate for a little sister. Johnson, 60, also shares four children with his ex-wife, the lawyer Marina Wheeler, and a child, born in 2009, as a result of an affair with the art consultant Helen Macintyre. Succeeding Theresa May, Johnson was prime minister from July 2019 until his resignation in September 2022.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Bending the Bars” rips away bipartisan propaganda by letting incarcerated artists speak their truth. “Bending the Bars” rips away bipartisan propaganda by letting incarcerated artists speak their truth. “I don't fuck with none of y'all cops,” rapped Julius Smith, aka Prince Jooveh, on the song “Hands Up.” “Eighty percent of y'all are cowards, y'all stay up in our business.” In one hand, he held a phone to hear the trap beat. In the other, he held a second phone to fire off lyrics. He had 30 minutes to get it right before time ran out — he was recording behind bars as a person incarcerated by the Florida Department of Corrections for 17 years. Jooveh had to finish before the guards told him time was up. The last line of his song was an echoing wail, “We are not free. The only thing we are guilty of is pain and poverty. In prisons across the United States, music beats against walls and bars. Many incarcerated people facing long sentences feel a welling-up in their throats: stories that need to be told. Now more than ever, art by people in prison is needed. Making music transforms how incarcerated people see themselves. Hearing their music also transforms how the public sees them. Trump hammers relentlessly on the scary headlines of “terrorists” and “violent criminals” to normalize breaking the rule of law and dismantling civil rights. “Honestly at first it was annoying,” said Gary Field, who has been incarcerated for over 20 years by the Florida Department of Corrections and who is a board member of CHIP, in an interview with Truthout. I listened and realized that they were incredibly talented. So many of them could easily have number one hits on the radio.” Bending the Bars rips away bipartisan perceptions and propaganda on crime and punishment by letting the artists speak their truth. The image that rises from their lyrics is of complex human beings who can be a part of society again — which is in stark contrast to the imagery of the “unredeemable, violent criminal” that has been dominant since the 1970s: This toxic caricature of incarcerated people began with President Richard Nixon's 1971 “war on drugs” and President Ronald Reagan's “get-tough-on-crime” turn, when many U.S. prisons shed their rehabilitation programs. The shift left the nearly 2 million people who are locked up with little to no resources to make a life after serving their sentences. Even after jail, many people with felony convictions can't vote, and the stigma of having had a felony conviction previously is like an invisible ball and chain, stopping them from getting jobs, housing and education. Cast out of society, they are driven back into the streets. It's no wonder that the U.S. has made a revolving-door prison-industrial complex. This system is why abolitionist organizations like CHIP figuratively break down prison walls by fighting draconian rules that further isolate jailed people. In Broward County, Florida, near where CHIP is based, Gov. Ron DeSantis ended free monthly calls for incarcerated people and reduced their authorized mail to postcards. Getting the voices of jailed people out matters. It matters to those inside: As Field tells Truthout, “The project brought people together. We would coordinate with CHIP to get outside collaborators. We got people in rival gangs to work with us. “When I was young, I got a scholarship to a prep school in Connecticut, met the children of bankers and senators. As he painted the scenes, the prison phone system told us in a robotic voice that he had one minute left. Field raced against the clock to share his reality but time ran out. “I'm so tired of these four walls,” raps “Ghostman” on the song “Four Walls.” “I'm so tired of these phone calls.” A major theme in Bending the Bars is showing the humanity of prisoners stereotyped by right-wing media. Rappers have always pointed out that criminals are often the victims of systemic racism and poverty. You can hear this in songs from rap's golden era — say in 1982's “The Message” by Grandmaster Flash, who raps about a broken city that breaks its people. You can hear it in KRS-One's 1993 hit, “Sound of the Police” where he booms his bass voice going, “Whoop! You can see it the famous scene in the 1998 film Slam where spoken word artist-activist Saul Williams rips a poem from his heart in a prison yard as fellow prisoners are stunned by its beauty. He wrote of hearing other enslaved people sing in the woods between plantations, “They told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Here is the truth: Art rescues us from oppression. Bending the Bars is one thread in a long quilt, woven by voices over the centuries, and one sorely needed now. The Trump administration constantly invokes images of “animalistic criminals” to justify deportation. Trump has long used racist stereotypes and fearmongering about incarcerated people to push a right-wing authoritarian takeover. This is why we need to see artists like Prince Jooveh, who says he rediscovered himself in music. “I got to see myself as an artist,” he said in an interview after he was released in February. I'm looking for a recording studio.” He was breathless on the phone. “I saw the effect my song had on people. The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

Garcia Venegas – who was born in Florida to Mexican parents – began filming the arrests with his mobile phone before officials reportedly knocked the device out of his hand and tried to arrest him as well. According to an interview with the Spanish-language US news outlet Telemundo, officials took out his wallet, removed his ID – which complies with higher federal security standards for state-issued driver's licenses as well as identification – and told him that it was fake. Four people at the job site were arrested, including Garcia Venegas's brother, who is undocumented. “I feel sad because, even though we were born here, that doesn't matter any more,” the cousin said. She added: “To have our skin color has, apparently, become a crime. “Anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including US citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest,” the DHS's statement to NBC said. Some local police and sheriff's departments have also been deputized to carry out federal immigration arrests. As the White House attempts to carry out a promise of “mass deportations” that vaulted Donald Trump to victory in November's presidential election, a number of US citizens have been caught up in its dragnet. Some, such as Garcia Venegas, have been detained by officials, then released. Although rare, the deportation of US citizens has also happened during prior administrations.</p>

Today was very challenging to stay with me on the court because I was going off at you quite a lot … so I want to thank you for staying here and earning with me this victory number 100.” Since claiming his 99th title when he won the gold medal in the men's singles at the 2024 Olympics in Paris eight months ago, Djokovic has endured a difficult run of form. He has particularly struggled on clay, recently exiting the Monte-Carlo Masters and Madrid Open in his first match of each tournament. And for much of Saturday's match, it seemed as if the milestone would elude the Serb once again. At 2-2 in the first set, he was unable to capitalize on two break points and that came back to haunt him when Hurkacz took the set thanks to a double fault from Djokovic in the 12th game. But as the match progressed, Djokovic – who turned 38 on Friday – showed the kind of resolute determination which appeared to have deserted him of late, breaking Hurkacz four times in a tiebreak after each player had held serve throughout the second set. Having been broken by Hurkacz in the first game of the third set, it looked for a long time as though the win was slipping away from Djokovic again. But his quality came to the fore again, and he broke back to make it 4-4 before winning another tiebreak. “I know it's a bitter taste in the mouth to lose the match like this,” Djokovic told Hurkacz in his on-court interview afterward. 9 whom Djokovic beat to win his very first ATP title in 2006.

MOSCOW, May 24. /TASS/. The French authorities arrested Pavel Durov so they could use his messaging app Telegram to influence the recent presidential election in Romania, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.

"As it happens, [French President Emmanuel] Macron had Durov arrested not in order to use this barbaric method for addressing the app's internal issues, but to direct the election in Romania, as he understood that the candidate from liberal dictatorship was unable to win under any legitimate setups," she wrote on Telegram. "What was made public was an accusation of a gross crime complete with evidence."

On May 18, Telegram founder Durov said the app refused to comply with a request from "a Western European country" to take down the channels of Romanian conservatives ahead of the elections. In a subsequent post on X, he said the request came from the chief of France's Directorate-General for External Security, Nicolas Lerner, earlier this spring. The French foreign intelligence agency denied issued any such requests, saying all they did was to remind Durov of his responsibility to keep terrorism and child pornography off his social media platform.

Durov later said he was willing to testify about the alleged outside interference in Romania's presidential election. According to the businessman, the French foreign intelligence agency sought to obtain IP addresses of some Romanian, Moldovan and Ukrainian nationals under the guise of fighting terrorism and child pornography.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eighteen people were injured, four critically, in a knife attack Friday in the German city of Hamburg, authorities said. Hamburg police said they have arrested a 39-year-old German woman, who they believe acted alone in carrying out the attack at the city's Central Station, after a major police operation. She is in police custody and expected to be brought to a court on Saturday, police said. The victims are aged between 19 and 85 years old. Police said there was “concrete” evidence that the suspect suffers from a mental illness. In a statement late on Friday, Hamburg police said the attacker had acted “apparently indiscriminately, stabbed passersby, injuring some of them critically.” Related article Two killed, 11 injured after car rams crowd in German city of Mannheim Following the attack, Germany's Friedrich Merz thanked the city's emergency responders for their assistance and said that his “thoughts are with the victims and their families,” according to federal government spokesperson Stefan Kornelius. “It is shocking when travelers are attacked in a treacherous and cowardly manner,” Dobrindt said. Hamburg's Central Station is the busiest passenger railway station in Germany, with more than 550,000 travelers per day, according to the city's website. Germany has faced rising rates of knife crime in recent years, with some incidents stirring up tensions over migration ahead of parliamentary elections in February. Some in the country were concerned by a series of high-profile attacks allegedly carried out by asylum seekers or migrants. Last year, a Syrian man turned himself in and confessed to stabbing to death three people and wounding several others at a festival in the western German city of Solingen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, who had earlier called controls 'a failure,' said Trump wanted U.S. firms to 'win. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Saturday praised U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to boost U.S. technology as the leading chipmaker announced a partnership with a group of Swedish businesses to develop AI infrastructure in Sweden. Nvidia NVDA-T will provide its latest generation AI data centre platform to a group of Swedish companies, including telecoms gear maker Ericsson and drug developer AstraZeneca. Nvidia has announced a number of similar partnerships in recent weeks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE after the Trump administration rescinded a rule put in place by previous President Joe Biden that would have restricted exports of AI chips. Huang, who had earlier called controls “a failure,” said President Donald Trump wanted U.S. firms to “win”. “American technology companies were very successful in China four years ago, we have lost about 50% of the market share and competitors have grown,” he said on Saturday in Norrkoping, where he was due to receive an honorary doctorate from Linkoping University. The Trump administration has introduced sweeping tariffs saying they would stimulate growth, bring home manufacturing jobs and raise tax revenues. Huang said many policies related to re-industrialisation were “very visionary”. “Manufacturing in the United States, securing our supply chain, having real resilience, redundancy and diversity in our manufacturing supply chain - all of that is excellent,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has accused French President Emmanuel Macron of detaining Telegram founder Pavel Durov for the purpose of interfering with the electoral processes in Romania. The accusation comes shortly after Durov claimed that French authorities had enquired with him regarding the issue. “It turns out that Macron had Durov arrested not even to address internal issues with the messenger using such barbaric methods, but to influence the elections in Romania, realizing that the candidate from the liberal dictatorship wouldn't be able to win under any legal circumstances,” Zakharova wrote on Telegram. Earlier this month, Durov revealed that Lerner had asked him to censor conservative voices on the social media platform during the election campaign in Romania. Durov in turn accused French authorities of deflecting criticism by linking him to unrelated criminal investigations involving users of his platform. Durov was arrested in France last August and charged with complicity in crimes allegedly carried out by Telegram users. The Russian-born entrepreneur, whose company is headquartered in Dubai, was ultimately released on €5 million ($5.46 million) bail and allowed to leave the country in mid-March. Last Sunday, the conservative EU critic George Simion lost a run-off vote against pro-Brussels Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan by a single-digit margin. Following Simion's petition, Durov offered to testify before the Romanian authorities about the interactions with French officials, saying he would do so “if it helps Romanian democracy.” Ahead of the second round of voting, Romania's Foreign Ministry alleged that Moscow was attempting to influence the outcome.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. Finland will supply heavy ammunition to Ukraine using proceeds from frozen Russian assets, the country's Ministry of Defence said on May 19. The move is part of a broader European Union initiative to channel profits from immobilized Russian assets into support for Ukraine's defense. The Finnish government says the deal not only reinforces its support for Ukraine but also benefits its national defense industry. The funds come from frozen Russian assets," said Finnish Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen. The Finnish Defense Ministry did not provide details on the timeline, type of ammunition, or delivery logistics due to operational security concerns. In October 2024, the Group of Seven (G7) approved nearly $50 billion in loans for Ukraine to be repaid from the proceeds of those frozen funds. The EU has also launched a separate initiative on funneling military aid to Ukraine by similarly using the funds. Kyiv has consistently urged allies to formalize mechanisms for seizing frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine's defense and reconstruction. Western governments have primarily relied on reallocating interest income generated by the frozen funds to support Kyiv rather than confiscating the assets outright. The Kremlin has warned of retaliation if Russian assets are confiscated for Ukraine's benefit. In early 2024, Moscow amended its legislation to allow counter-seizure of Western-owned property in response to asset seizures abroad. We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. The EU has formally approved its 17th package of sanctions imposed on Russia over aggression in Ukraine, including measures against almost 200 shadow fleet vessels, top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas announced on May 20. "New measures also address hybrid threats and human rights. The 17th package was supported by EU ambassadors last week, but has since then been criticized as weak and watered down. The package also targets components vital to Russia's defense industry, namely chemicals, materials, and dual-use goods. The EU has threatened Russia with additional sanctions unless President Vladimir Putin commits to a ceasefire and agrees to seriously engage in peace efforts. President Volodymyr Zelensky also announced that a new "strong EU sanctions package" is underway. While European leaders have proclaimed that additional sanctions are coordinated with Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump, who held a phone call with Putin on May 19, said he does not intend to impose new measures on Moscow to avoid disrupting peace efforts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's illegal immigrant deportation push has officials looking for new places to put illegal immigrants if their home nations won't accept their citizens back. However, if that fails, the section also allows for the agency to remove aliens to any country that will accept them. Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo confirmed the agreement on Feb. 5, saying that they would accept not only Guatemalan deportees but those from other nations as well. “We have agreed to increase by 40 percent the number of flights of deportees, both of our nationality as well as deportees from other nationalities,” Arévalo said during a news conference with Rubio. The U.S. Embassy in Panama announced on May 6 that Panama has “significantly contributed” to the U.S. government's efforts to put an end to illegal immigration by sending a flight with 81 illegal immigrants from Cameroon, Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka to their countries of origin. The package includes financial and travel assistance back to their home countries, organized through the CBP Home App. “If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest, and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest. DHS is now offering illegal aliens financial travel assistance and a stipend to return to their home country through the CBP Home App,” said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. “This was a voluntary charter flight, not an [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] operation,” DHS said in its announcement Will you do that as a favor to us?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa described them as “cowards,” according to the BBC. On May 22, during a meeting with Ramaphosa in the Oval Office, Trump presented what he said was evidence of this. Showing printouts of news articles and footage of South African extremists calling for white farmers to be killed, Trump repeated the allegation that the South African government is confiscating white-owned land. South Africa's International Relations Minister, Ronald Lamola, told The Epoch Times that Trump and his administration are “totally misguided” in offering asylum to Afrikaners. There's no type of persecution or discrimination against any whites in South Africa.” “They believe these crimes happened to them because they are white,” said the source, requesting anonymity because he did not have permission to speak with the media. These people can't get any information about what's happened to their cases. He said “a fair number” of the asylum seekers that had arrived in the United States were farmers who had farmed their land for generations. “Whether they're white or black makes no difference to me,” said Trump. “But white farmers are brutally killed and their land is being confiscated in South Africa.” At the moment, “there's no state-supported confiscation of farms happening,” said Jaco Minnaar, who heads South Africa's largest agricultural association, AgriSA. But, he told The Epoch Times, white-owned farms are “frequently” invaded. “These land invasions are often instigated by local politicians and radical groups. However, University of Stellenbosch criminologist Guy Lamb said there's “nothing normal” about crime in South Africa. “There's a sense that South Africans of all races are under siege from criminals, with the state unable to protect them. An expanded definition of unemployment, which includes those who've given up looking for work, is more than 43 percent. Du Preez said, “So we have millions of black people, especially jobless youth, with nothing to do all day. If there's going to be a race revolution, this is where it's coming from. Several leftist and extremist groups in South Africa have suggested exactly this. Julius Malema, the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), South Africa's fourth largest political party, often sings a song called “Kill the farmer,” and has said a “revolution” of poor black people is coming to drive whites out of South Africa. Most successful commercial farmers are Afrikaners,” he told The Epoch Times. “Must whites in South Africa continuously bend the knee in gratitude that we haven't been exterminated yet?” asked Kallie Kriel, who leads Afrikaner rights organization AfriForum. “In this context, President Trump's offer is a tremendous acknowledgement, they feel someone in power, the most powerful political leader on earth, is listening to them and recognizing their fear and suffering.” “Of course there will be millions more blacks in poverty. “These critics can come see for themselves what it's like to live in so-called ‘white privilege.' These Afrikaners now in America, I wish them all the best.”</p>

SANYO-ONODA, Yamaguchi — An about 100-meter-long okonomiyaki was made by a total of about 500 people in Sanyo-Onoda, Yamaguchi Prefecture, on May 5. The “Making Long Okonomiyaki” project was started in 2014 by an organizing committee of local volunteers. However, the participants had not yet applied to Guinness World Records. This year's project was held at a rice paddy in the city. Iron cooking plates were arranged in a line, heated to 300 C and then greased with oil. About 500 participants, ranging from children to the elderly, were assigned to their respective segments where they cooked the okonomiyaki batter containing locally produced vegetables and other ingredients. A Guinness World Records certifier confirmed that the 100.57-meter-long okonomiyaki was unbroken and cooked through enough to eat. “Flipping it over was difficult for me,” said a 15-year-old female junior high school student from the city. “I am excited to see this okonomiyaki recognized by Guinness World Records.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>
