                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vincent Kompany's side reclaimed the Bundesliga title from Bayer Leverkusen this season and will now shift their focus to next month's Club World Cup. Bayern begin their post-season campaign in Cincinnati on June 15 against Auckland City, followed by Boca Juniors in Miami on June 21, and wrap up the group stage against Benfica in Charlotte on June 24. However, some club staff have been left frustrated after being told they won't travel with the team due to cost-cutting measures - despite players' families being flown out at the club's expense. Altschaffl added: 'There's a whole week where families are allowed to come. Falk then explained: 'You have to say, a few employees were annoyed. They're cutting costs everywhere, so only a small group of employees is allowed to go over, but the families are.' The cost-cutting measures are said to have been put in place by sporting director Max Eberl include a directive to reduce squad expenses by 20 per cent. Those affected include middle management, lower-level staff, and matchday stewards — many of whom will be left behind as the squad heads to the U.S. Among those having their expenses covered by Bayern is Harry Kane's wife, Katie Goodland - despite the striker reportedly earning £400,000 per week. Nevertheless, Bayern boss Kompany has set sights on winning the Club World Cup this summer. 'You know, I think we're part of a club here with Bayern Munich where every trophy is important, so by the time we get to America, it will be a priority.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA World Cup is coming back to New Jersey for the first time in more than 30 years in 2026, and a local artist is helping define how the world will see it. Rich Tu, a visual artist raised in South Orange and now based in Brooklyn, was selected by the region's host committee to pen the official poster for the New York/New Jersey host region. Tu said his composition was meant to reflect the cultural depth of both sides of the Hudson and blend local identity with global scale. "What I love about New Jersey is it's so much more than what people think it is," Tu said. It was part of a rollout of official artwork for each of the 16 host stadiums across North America, as the U.S. is set to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and Canada. Tu's vivid, high-energy design is centered on a multicolored soccer ball engulfed in the flames of the Statue of Liberty's torch. Dominated by bold colors, the flame is rendered in fiery reds and oranges, while the torch itself is depicted in cool green and teal tones. "It's bold, like the people of this region." There are florals for the Garden State and a splash of Knicks orange. "This poster is a bold celebration of everything that makes the NY/NJ region so dynamic — our diversity, creativity, and unmistakable energy," said Bettina Garibaldi, the regional host committee's chief marketing and communications officer. "Rich Tu's design captures the essence of who we are: a region that stands out." Tu said his poster draws inspiration from past World Cup visuals, including Lance Wyman's work during the 1970 Mexico campaign. Having a place in the history of the World Cup and its identifying art for his home region is both gratifying and deeply humbling, he said. "Just to be a part of the history is crazy." The poster is on display at 352 Marin Blvd., in Jersey City and set to join the permanent collection at Poster House in New York, the country's only museum dedicated to poster art. The digital version has also been on display in Times Square and at MetLife Stadium, where both the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2026 FIFA World Cup are scheduled to take place. Tu, who earned degrees from Rutgers University and New York City's School of Visual Arts art college, is a partner at the studio Sunday Afternoon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Pontiac Silverdome once stood as one of America's great sporting venues. It also hosted a range of other massive events, including WrestleMania III -- which boasted a record attendance of 93,173 -- and the first-ever indoor FIFA World Cup match. Both are records that stand to this day. It was also the first World Cup to adopt a new three points for a win system, instead of the old two points for a win approach, and goalkeepers were no longer allowed to pick up deliberate back-passes in another rule change. Three decades later, and it is odd to think about what soccer was like without those rules. But it's fair to say the first indoor World Cup match was a harder sell. The Silverdome hosted the tournament's first indoor game on June 18, 1994, when hosts the USA held Switzerland to a 1-1 draw in front of a crowd of 73,425 for their Group A clash. Grass for the surface was grown locally by Michigan State University, and later installed in the venue, which went on to host four more matches. Switzerland beat Romania 4-1 in the second match at the Silverdome, while Sweden later beat Russia 3-1 in Group B, before drawing 1-1 with Brazil. The Silverdome didn't have a working cooling system and because it was an air-supported stadium, the air could not escape through circulation, so temperatures inside would climb past 90F (32C) in the summer, with 40% humidity. US midfielder Thomas Dooley described it as 'the worst place I have ever played at.' Tab Ramos, meanwhile, said it was 'probably the hottest game' he had ever played in, and noted that 'the field felt like we were running in sand.' They moved to Ford Field in 2002, and after that, activity in the Silverdome dropped drastically. It still staged some low-key events, like Monster Jam in 2006, while the parking lot was also converted into a drive-in theater for three years between 2003 and 2006. More than two decades on, and a $2.4bn plan to abandon another NFL franchise's 80-year home is in doubt. But back in 2009, the Silverdome itself was purchased for just $583,000, despite a cost of $225million to build in 1975, by Greek-born Canadian real estate developer Andreas Apostolopoulos. He vowed to 'revive the stadium as a big-event venue' by investing millions of dollars, and it reopened in 2010 with another monster truck event. AC Milan and Panathinaikos FC even played an exhibition game there August in 2011, but ultimately, the lack of events coming into the venue, combined with the 2013 roof collapse, put any further development plans on hold. Another of the NFL's oldest stadiums, meanwhile, is hoping to avoid a similar fate and has been handed a $4.7 billion project lifeline. Amazon later developed the Silverdome site into both a distribution facility and delivery center. What stands on the site is now a far cry from the Silverdome in its heyday, which will be remembered fondly for hosting NFL, NBA and World Cup games -- even if the latter offered far from ideal playing conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Crazy,” said Gomez, now one of ESPN's soccer analysts. He was called up from his MLS team, Charlotte FC, this week and added to the 27-man roster for June matches, with the Gold Cup matches to follow. From East Hartford to a top MLS draft pick, Patrick Agyemang may have bloomed late but he's made up for lost time “He may not have the pedigree of some of the (forwards) in that pool, who were playing in Europe at a young age, with top set-ups and resources or recognition,” Gomez said. “He's got a nose for the goal, one of those intangibles that goal-scorers must have. That's a handful for any defender around the world.” As the 2026 World Cup approaches, Agyemang's story will surely become an international phenomenon, the almost unfathomable rise from East Hartford High, where he didn't start right away, to Division III college soccer at Eastern Connecticut, then to Rhode Island, to MLS and to the USMNT, scoring three goals in his first four caps. But when Coach Mauricio Pochettino announced his roster, it raised a few eyebrows. Dom Amore: USA men's soccer goalkeeper Matt Turner returning to play in Connecticut, where remarkable rise began “Now you have 17 of 27 culled from Major League Soccer. “I'm all for that, but a year out from the World Cup, it's not really about identifying players, it's about solidifying the project you have, that you have been working on for quite some time.” “If you're a coach and (Agyemang) is not your starter,” Gomez said, “and the game calls for somebody to shake something up, somebody to make something out of nothing, somebody to be a difference maker, having a player with those intangibles can come in very handy. I think that gives him an advantage over other (candidates). … When he has played, he's scored, and take it from a guy who used that same ability to get onto the U.S. national team for the World Cup. “I had an opportunity in East Hartford right before the World Cup, coming on at halftime and scoring and I heard it from the coaches, ‘One of the reasons we brought you on is you have this knack of scoring goals in limited time. Casey D'Annolfo, from Conard-West Hartford, will coach Tufts men's lacrosse in the Division III national championship game for the second time in three years. Boldly charging into Division I at warp speed, this CT school may find sailing not always smooth The University of New Haven, moving to Division I next season, has reworked and released its football schedule for 2025. The Chargers will play as an independent program, with a mix of Division II, III and FCS opponents, including a few of its future conference rivals from the NEC. Road games include Marist, Mercyhurst, Albany, Duquesne, LIU and Sacred Heart. Home games include Saginaw Valley State, Pace, Western Connecticut and Merrimack. Duquesne, LIU and Mercyhurst are NEC opponents, Sacred Heart and Merrimack are FCS independents who play for a “Yankee Conference title.” Marist plays in the FCS Pioneer League, Albany in the CAA, Pace and Saginaw Valley are Division II, WCSU is D-III. *The phrase “we don't rebuild, we reload” has become a tired mantra and, in fact, very wishful thinking in many places. But UConn men's and women's basketball, with their brand and access to the transfer portal, can claim this offseason as a legit reload. *Ran into John Gwynn, “microwave” scorer on UConn men's 1989-90 Dream Season team, and his daughter, Nicole this week. Nicole Gwynn, who played at Wethersfield High, just finished her college career at Georgia Southern with 1,569 points, and is now hoping to play overseas. *Windsor High has announced its latest class of Hall of Fame inductees during its baseball game against Tolland at Dunkin Park this week. They are: Terrance Knighton ('04), football, basketball, who played in the NFL from 2009-16; Wayne Dobrutsky ('79), football/baseball; Mairin Dudek ('98), soccer, softball; Paul Lepak ('04), soccer; Cole Ormsby ('13), football; Michael Phang ('14), soccer, track; Kelsey Jepsen ('14), swimming; Dominique Fox, coach; Neil Beaulieu, contributor. They will be inducted Nov. 1 at LaNote in East Windsor. More information will be at the Hall of Fame's website. *Some exciting movement for local baseball players in the pros this week. Waterford's Mike Burrows, who finished last season with the Pirates and picked up a late-season win at Yankee Stadium, was recalled from Triple A to make his first MLB start Thursday. … Frank Mozzicato, from Ellington and East Catholic, Royals first-round pick in 2021, was moved up to Double A Northwest Arkansas this week, a crucial step. Mike Noyes of Granby, a high-IQ walk-on who eventually earned a scholarship during the Kevin Ollie era, is an assistant coach/director of player development. Noyes graduated from UConn with his degree in math and actuarial science in 2017, then worked for the Grizzlies as data scientist and video coordinator. *UNH is planning a memorial service for its legendary baseball coach, Frank “Porky” Vieira on June 17 at 10:30 a.m. at the school's baseball field. *Earlier this month, SCSU hired Joe Loth to be its new football coach. Loth was 77-45 with six postseason appearances in 12 seasons at Western Connecticut. Dom Amore's Sunday Read: Soto, Judge, Knicks in a NY minute; Paige Bueckers' challenge and more Two months into a 15-year, three-quarter billion dollar contract, he has not looked, or sounded like the same confident, exuberant player he was across town. If the narrative that he regrets his choice begins to harden like cement, it will be very difficult to get completely rid of it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City are yet to gauge any further clarity over whether Pep Guardiola will be able to count upon Rico Lewis and James McAtee at the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. Not only are Manchester City expected to bring with them their full first-team squad, but there is also an expectance in some quarters that the tournament could also feature some new signings, should deals progress over the coming weeks. That largely concerns Rico Lewis and James McAtee, who are likely to be demanded for action with England Under-21 set-up this summer, as they gear up to compete at the Under-21 European Championships in Slovakia. Speaking to reporters during his pre-match press conference ahead of Manchester City's visit to Fulham on Sunday afternoon, Pep Guardiola was quizzed on whether either player would be at the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup given their clash of duties. “Not yet,” he responded when asked whether a decision had already been taken on the matter. “It normally happens when you go to the World Cup or European Cup we are already on holidays, that's why they go. But now the situation is here, they have to talk.” I don't know who is going to pay it. But I don't know the resolution right now.” Manchester City are set to embark on an initial three matches as part of their group stage at the tournament, taking on Italy's Juventus, Morocco's Wydad AC, and the United Arab Emirates' Al Ain.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea are set to welcome back many loanees this summer ahead of their Club World Cup campaign, including midfielder Andrey Santos. Andrey Santos is one player who has been earmarked to return to Chelsea next season following his successful loan spell with RC Strasbourg in Ligue 1. Having captained the side, he scored 11 goals and contributed five assists in 34 appearances for the French club in 2024-25. The 21-year-old penned an emotional farewell on Instagram earlier this week. He wrote: "It's hard to begin this text without being moved. Today, I say goodbye with my head held high, to a club that I fell in love with inexplicably, and for which I gave everything from start to finish. "From my very first day here, I've always been made to feel very welcome by everyone, from the players/staff to the fans and supporters of Strasbourg. "I had the privilege of being captain, and here I had my first full season in Europe, and with many goalsHere was born the greatest love of my life, the greatest gift that God has given me, who is my son, here my family and I were very happy and we will be eternally grateful for all the love and affection of you all. "I'd like to thank everyone for every moment we spent together. Santos' performances, unsurprisingly, have attracted attention from across Europe. However, Chelsea have no plans to let the Brazilian depart. "We're going to the Club World Cup, so we are laser focused on the Club World Cup," said Boehly. We're really excited about him and what he can add to the squad." Santos will bolster Chelsea's midfield which already includes the likes of Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia and Enzo Fernandez.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>News broke via The Times last night that the competition will finally take place after years of speculation, and now we will get to see the best teams across both Hemispheres compete against each other in direct competition. Club World Cups are a growing trend within the sporting landscape, with the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup set to take place later this year, and now rugby is following suit. The new competition will see eight teams from the Champions Cup, seven from Super Rugby Pacific and one from Japan go head-to-head once every four years to be crowned the Club World Champions. Chairman Dominic McKay confirms Rugby World Club Cup for 2028 ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/GDNkvXjN5K Commenting on the news, EPCR Chairman, Dominic McKay said: “One of those projects is the Rugby World Club Cup. “This is something we've spoken about at EPCR for the last two or three years – we've been trying to work our way through this project to see if we can deliver it. “And over the last few days we've had great meetings with our Board, great meetings with our General Assembly, who represent the three leagues and stakeholders from seven unions, and everyone is unanimous about wanting to deliver a World Club Cup – through EPCR.” Irish legend explains the ‘best thing' about Henry Pollock being ‘a guy who irritates everybody' We've got some ambitious plans for both the Investec Champions Cup and EPCR Challenge Cup, which we'll unveil over the coming weeks. “And, to elevate the whole of professional club rugby, we want to create this World Club Cup proposition in 2028 and 2032 with our friends from the South. They already have that in Europe and South Africa for the Investec Champions Cup and EPCR Challenge Cup, so we want to broaden the family a bit further. “I couldn't be more thrilled that our stakeholders are supporting us and we look forward to sharing more information with the players and our fans in the coming weeks and months.” READ MORE: How to watch Northampton Saints vs Bordeaux in the Champions Cup final</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex Freeman was caught by surprise when he saw his name listed in the United States preliminary 60-man roster for next month's Concacaf Gold Cup tournament. When the June training camp roster for the U.S. men's national team was released on Thursday, however, he almost shed a tear at the thought of seeing what was once a dream turn into a reality. It's the hard work I've been putting out the past 3-4 years, and it's all working out," Freeman said on Friday. Freeman, 20, has been on a rapid rise this year for Orlando City. Just a year ago, he logged 20-plus games played in MLS Next Pro with Orlando City B, having only played 15 minutes in all competitions with Orlando City. This year, though, he's the team's starting right back with 14 games played so far. The most consistent playing time with Orlando's first team. He's one of 27 players selected ahead of the U.S.'s two games against Turkey on June 7 in Connecticut and Switzerland on June 10 at GEODIS Park in Nashville. By then, Freeman should know if he's made the official Gold Cup tournament roster for the U.S., which officially kicks off June 15 against Trinidad and Tobago. The official Gold Cup roster is due June 4, according to a spokesperson from US Soccer. This week's news for Freeman, who's the son of former Green Bay Packers Hall of Famer Antonio Freeman, has served as confirmation for his efforts in the past year. "I was in the preliminary roster, and I was just grateful for that in the moment, and being in the final roster, it's a good start to my first-team season with Orlando, and it's something I'm very grateful for to be able to represent the badge, my country." "He's just telling me to keep my head down. More news is to come, and if I keep working, this will be something that happens regularly, and that's the goal ... being able to be called up to the national team regularly."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LOCAL ALERT: Public visitation for the late Va. Rep. Gerry Connolly to be held Monday from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Fairfax Memorial Funeral Home. GENEVA (AP) — FIFA president Gianni Infantino says Cristiano Ronaldo might play in the Club World Cup because of a unique transfer window. “Cristiano Ronaldo might play in the Club World Cup,” Infantino told online streamer IShowSpeed. “There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup, who knows. Still a few weeks time, will be fun.” FIFA confirmed Wednesday that last-minute transfer signings are open to all teams going to tournament, which fueled more speculation that one of them will try to sign the 40-year-old Ronaldo on a short-term deal, potentially a loan. Such a move would be unprecedented in modern soccer though could appeal to FIFA by boosting the profile and ticket sales of an inaugural tournament being played in 11 U.S. cities. Speculative reports have linked Ronaldo to the one Saudi club that qualified, Al Hilal, the Brazilian club Palmeiras and Wydad of Morocco, even though that club is currently banned by FIFA from registering new signings. Transfers can be made from June 1-10 and again June 27-July 3 according to exceptional rules FIFA approved in October. “The objective is to encourage clubs and players whose contracts are expiring to find an appropriate solution to facilitate the players' participation,” FIFA said in Wednesday's statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arsenal fans took to the streets of Lisbon ahead of a huge Women's Champions League final meeting with Barcelona, while thousands of Sheffield United and Sunderland supporters made their way to Wembley 100% collective, complete domination of virtually every match they played. There's a terrific podcast on the history of the Champions League called that includes a (very) detailed analysis of that magnificent Ajax team. Really shocked that no one is saying anything about the Neville ban. I get that it is a private arena and that the owners can pretty much do anything it wants. However, if Neville is banned for what he said, it has a chilling effect on everyone commenting on sports who may well be hesitant to criticise because it may lead to a similar ban...the other side of the coin is that rich owners can us the courts and lawyers to prevent and hinder criticism. Weather permitting, England will wrap victory against Zimbabwe today in the Test match at Trent Bridge. “As a fan of cycling, I am not surprised by Scott McTominay winning the Serie A player of the year award,” writes Balaji. “Just look at the illustrious list of cyclists who have been let go by INEOS team under Jim Ratcliffe. In the current Giro, two of the stage winners last week – Lucas Plapp and Richard Carapaz – rode for INEOS before their current team.” (Still think the McTominay situation was more nuanced, and that it's a wonderful human story that doesn't need to be polluted by pointing fingers at Manchester United, but who cares.) Fifa's president Gianni Infantino says “there are discussions” over a move that could see Cristiano Ronaldo play at the Club World Cup this summer. Speaking to YouTuber and streamer IShowSpeed, Infantino said: “Ronaldo might play for one of the teams as well at the Club World Cup. Cristiano Ronaldo might play in the Club World Cup. “There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup... who knows, who knows.” PA Media In other news, Manchester United have shortlisted Simon Cowell as a potential replacement for Ruben Amorim. Barney Ronay has written a seriously good piece, even by his standards, on the utter state of everything Lineker's 33 years at the Beeb. And so, here we are, talking about this crap as though it is genuine political discourse. But there are still some things worth saying about this same crap. The first, and most obvious, is that Lineker should also not be dehumanised for making this mistake. He is not an avatar of hate, just as he also not a free speech hero silenced by The Cabal. He is, like all of us, a human trying to understand the world, while being bombarded by extreme information via a deeply addictive and confusing platform, one that also offers the chance for an instant, emotive response. 1989 Milan rout Steaua Bucharest in the European Cup final 1997 Barcelona desperately need a goal against Deportivo to stay in the title race. 2000 Real Madrid end a shambolic season by winning the Champions League Please do send your questions to matchday.live@theguardian.com or post them before the line. Nerves are a g- oh bloody hell SOMEBODY PICK UP BONMATI. The Fan Zone yesterday was so much fun. It's not going to be easy but who knows. McTominay wins Serie A player of the year award In the immortal words of Richie Aprile, look at this [expletive] line-up. Roberto Mancini, Ronaldo, Francesco Totti, Christian Vieri, Kaka, Andrea Pirlo, Fabio Cannavaro, Pavel Nedved, Cristiano Ronaldo, Victor Osimhen, Gianluigi Buffon, Leonardo Bonucci, Alberto Gilardino, Carlos Tevez, Zlatan, Mauco Icardi, Rafael Leao, Diego Milito, Zinedine Zidane, Lautaro Martinez. Another plug for Tom Garry's WCL final preview Their first came against Arsenal, in the 2012-13 season. “They are in the final for a reason. They eliminated Real Madrid and scored four against Lyon, but if we are in our best version then many things can turn out well. So Scott McTominay was basically played in the wrong position by United? This isn't really true, certainly not in his last season at Old Trafford. Erik ten Hag usually played McTominay as a goalscoring midfielder; the problem was how to fit McTominay and Bruno Fernandes in the same team in a 4-2-3-1 formation. But as with the ostensibly ridiculous sale of Gerard Pique to Barcelona for peanuts in 2008, there were sound reasons for it. Talking of club legends, Napoli's four Serie A titles are indelibly associated with three players: Diego Maradona, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Scott McTominay. Let's start with a bit of news from the north east, where – on today of all days – Newcastle legend* Dan Burn has signed a one-year extension to his contract. “I'm delighted to sign a new deal here,” Burn said. It'll be tough to top this season but hopefully we can do that over the next couple of years. It's a dream come true to be playing for this club and I'm delighted that I get to keep doing it.” Rob Smyth will be taking the reins of this matchday live for the next few hours while I head off for a break. Manchester United's women picked up a significant cash injection of $1m US dollars after finishing as the runners-up in the inaugural World Sevens Football event in Estoril, Portugal, but ultimately missed out on the top prize of $2.5m as Bayern Munich struck late through Sarah Zadrazil to win the final 2-1. The German club, whose humorous goal celebrations became a running theme throughout the tournament, clearly rejoiced in the small-sided, fun-orientated format and their captain Glódís Perla Viggósdóttir said: “From the moment we got here, we were all in a tournament that you would play when you were a kid. We're used to playing with a lot of pressure on our shoulders so to just come here and enjoy it was nice.” Fans of National League playoff finalists Southend United and Oldham Athletic face a nightmare journey to Wembley Stadium next Sunday due to TfL engineering works. Most people will therefore be forced to travel via Wembley Central, which can only be accessed through the Bakerloo Line and Lioness Line. As a result, ticket sales have been capped at 17,500 per club due to safety concerns. Around 30,000 Southend fans were initially expected to attend the match. All three playoff finals this weekend are scheduled to kick-off one minute past the hour as part of the Every Minute Matters campaign. You may be wondering why the Championship playoff final kicks off at 3:01pm rather than 3pm this afternoon. Manchester City wrap up their Premier League campaign on Sunday with a game Pep Guardiola believes is “by far” their most important of the season. The City manager said: “If we want to play in the Champions League, we have to take a result there. This is what we are going to do. Of course, it's really important.” Asked if it was the most important game of the season, Guardiola said at a press conference: “By far.” City go into the game in third place on 68 points, two ahead of Newcastle, Chelsea and Aston Villa. Given a superior goal difference over all their rivals, a draw should be sufficient for City but Guardiola is taking nothing for granted against a Fulham side that could finish as high as ninth. “If I think that the fact that I'm an Arsenal fan is going to get in the way I have to shift, because that's not my focus for the day – my job is to be a player, a player that wants to do it for the fan in me.” Suzanne Wrack spoke to Arsenal defender Leah Williamson this week about her journey from being a mascot for the Gunners in 2007 to now playing in a Champions League final. “In Lisbon for the WCL final with my daughter Eleanor. Weather fantastic - just nailed our first Pastel de Nata for breakfast. Seen a couple of Barca fans also far. Our very own Ben Fisher will be on hand to answer any Championship playoff final questions at around 1:15pm BST this afternoon. Send them in to Matchdaylive@theguardian.com or leave a comment below! In case you missed it, Scott McTominay was the hero as Napoli secured the Serie A title with a 2-0 win over Cagliari last night. As always, I want to hear from you today! Are you in Lisbon for the Women's Champions League final? Because I can confirm that in London it's absolutely miserable - take note if you're heading to Wembley. Feel free to also send in any score predictions, feelings, thoughts and all that jazz. A disappointed Jurgen Klopp turned off the TV when he heard fans of his former team Liverpool booing Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is set to leave this summer after two decades at the club, during a 2-2 home draw with Arsenal earlier this month. I honestly couldn't have been more disappointed in this moment. England international Alexander-Arnold also featured prominently as Liverpool won the Premier League again this season under new manager Arne Slot. Slot earlier said he was not sure if Alexander-Arnold would make his final appearance for the club in Sunday's home game against Crystal Palace, after which Liverpool would lift the Premier League trophy. Klopp, who is set to attend Sunday's match, held up an Alexander-Arnold Liverpool shirt to show his support for the player. Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah, who leads the league's scoring charts with 28 goals, also spoke out earlier in support of his teammate, saying Alexander-Arnold did not deserve the boos. Klopp said Liverpool fans should not forget what Alexander-Arnold has done for the club. If somebody should be angry about this, it's the owners, but they're not.” Hello, good morning and welcome to another matchday live! Arsenal face Barcelona in the Women's Champions League final at Estádio José Alvalade, with Renée Slegers in search of her first major trophy as a manager. Also this afternoon is the Championship playoff final between Sheffield United and Sunderland. Fans were in full voice across London yesterday as they prepared for the highly-anticipated Wembley meeting, with a place in the Premier League at stake. Sheffield United finished 14 points above their rivals in the table earlier this month, but as we all know anything can happen at the home of English football. And it's the Scottish Cup final at Hampden Park, where Aberdeen take on league champions Celtic. I'll be getting you warmed up and ready for these games throughout the day with the help of Rob Smyth, so be sure to stick with us!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (May 22, 2025) – U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team head coach Katie Schoepfer has named 24 players to the first training camp after her team qualified 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, which starting this year, will be staged annually and has been expanded from 16 to 24 nations. The camp will take place from May 27-June 3 in Fayetteville, Ga., site of the currently under construction Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center, which will host the majority of YNT camps after its completion in 2026. Players born on or after Jan. 1, 2008, are age-eligible for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. That match will take place on June 28 (6:30 p.m. CT) and the teams will also play a closed-door international on July 1 at The University of Kansas Health System Training Center, which is also home to the Current. Japan has won one FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup and finished runners-up twice. Just eight players on this roster participated in the qualifying tournament as Schoepfer takes a deeper dive into the player pool to evaluate players who could contribute to the World Cup Team. The players that were in Costa Rica for the Concacaf tournament were goalkeeper Evan O'Steen, defenders Pearl Cecil, Lauren Hemann, Gacie Milam and Sydney Schmidt, midfielders Jaiden Rodriguez and Chloe Sadler and forward Ashlyn Anderson. Rodriguez scored twice in the three goals while Anderson tallied four times. Cecil, a center back, and Schmidt scored once each. O'Steen, who plays her youth club for Solar SC, also is on the books for the Dallas Trinity in the USL Super League, but she has not seen action this year. Goalkeeper Hannah Folliard, defenders Marlee Raymond and Milam and midfielder Brooke Bunton -- all of whom are named to this camp -- were alternates on the Concacaf qualifying team. Fourteen countries have qualified so far for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. China PR, Japan, Korea DPR and Korea Republic have qualified from Asia via nominations by the Asian Football Confederation based on results of the last three editions of AFC U-17 Women's Asian Cup in Thailand in 2017 and 2019 and in Indonesia in 2024. New Zealand and Samoa have qualified from Oceania via the 2024 OFC U-16 Women's Championship. From Africa, in addition to host Morocco, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Zambia have earned berths via the 2025 African U-17 Women's World Cup qualifiers.</p>
