Jamie Foxx has been feeling all the love and he continues to slide back into his work in the aftermath of his health issues. Fox just shared further recollections of drugged up on pain medication in the hospital and reading conspiracy theories about his health, with some even involving P. Diddy. When talking about his medical situation, the Back in Action star has been open about his need to remain funny during that crisis. There were, however, times, at which Jamie Foxx really was out of it, as he explained during a roundtable for THR. It was also during that time that he sought to find out what “the outside world” was saying about his situation: [I see things like,] ‘Puffy tried to kill me.' No, Puffy didn't try to kill me. Jeremy Renner Recalls ‘Chatting' With Imaginary Jamie Foxx And More While On Pain Meds Following Snowplow Accident, As Well As How His Family Reacted For some time now, there have been rumors that Puff Daddy (or Sean Combs) has used his influence to harm people. Nevertheless, it sounds like some fans were convinced that the Sean John founder was involved in Jamie Foxx's illness. Of course, as seen above, Foxx shut down that assumption, though, months ago, he did joke about Diddy possibly being involved in some way. There has been something of a little Foxx/Diddy saga that's persisted in recent months, though. In addition to the aforementioned barb Foxx shared about the Grammy-winning rapper, it was rumored that Diddy's arrest was linked to Foxx's medical problems. Someone claimed that during a show, Foxx confirmed he called the feds on Diddy, though other people in attendance have denied that account. When they said I was a clone, that made me flip. I'm sitting in the hospital bed, like, ‘These bitch-ass motherfuckers are trying to clone me.' He just calmly goes, ‘I think we're going to lower your dosage.' I honestly can't even imagine being in his position, as the notion of being doped up on medication and reading conspiracy theories about one's self seems wild. What I'd conclude from this is that strong medication and rumor-fueled Internet conspiracy theories just don't mix. Given his upbeat attitude, I wouldn't be surprised if he continues to joke about his hospital stay and even throws in the occasional Diddy or baby oil barb as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tourists are cancelling their trips abroad after a woman who has been referred to as Japan's 'Baba Vanga' made a terrifying prediction for a disaster set to strike in just two months' time. Baba Vanga, the renowned blind Bulgarian mystic, was known for her bleak but accurate predictions. Despite having passed away in 1996, she eerily predicted world events including the 9/11 attacks and the death of Princess Diana. Now, Ryo Tatsuki, who has been heralded as Japan's answer to the famed prophet, has warned that 'a crack will open up under the seabed between Japan and the Philippines, sending ashore waves three times as tall as those from the Tohoku earthquake', CNN reports. In 1999, after consistently having what she described as visions of the future, Tatsuki released her book which was titled, 'The Future I Saw'. In 2021, Tatsuki released an updated version of 'The Future I Saw' which included a prediction of a major disaster in mid-2025. Now, as the date draws closer, many travellers who had holidays booked to Japan for July are getting cold feet and postponing their trips or cancelling altogether. According to CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, a travel agency based in Hong Kong, bookings to Japan dropped by half during the Easter holiday. Tourists from China and Hong Kong, which are the country's second- and fourth-largest sources of tourists, respectively, have been the most likely to cancel or postpone their Japan travel plans. This was further exacerbated after China's embassy in Tokyo stoked concerns by releasing an official warning to Chinese citizens in late April to take caution when travelling, studying or buying real estate in Japan. Japanese officials have since attempted to quell the panic with a series of official statements to reassure travellers that these were simply 'unscientific rumours'. 'It would be a major problem if the spread of unscientific rumours on social media had an effect on tourism,' Yoshihiro Murai, governor of Miyagi prefecture, said at a press conference on Wednesday. 'There is no reason to worry because Japanese are not fleeing abroad … I hope people will ignore the rumours and visit.' To date, Tatuski's most accurate prediction was that a major disaster would occur in March 2011. Sure enough, in March 2011, Japan was hit by a devastating 9.1 magnitude earthquake and tsunami in the northern Tohoku region which ended up claiming the lives of over 18,000 people. Despite this, psychics from Japan and Hong Kong have since shared similar warnings of a catastrophic disaster taking place in July 2025, inadvertently adding to the panic. In her predictions for the Year of the Snake, feng shui master Qi Xian Yu, who is also often referred to as Master Seven, said: 'The coming year will see more natural disasters such as earthquakes and fires, and traffic and aviation accidents. We should also be careful of travelling to countries in the northeast direction, such as Japan and South Korea.' Japan is no stranger to earthquakes, being situated along the Ring of Fire, an area that is notorious for its intense seismic and volcanic activity. There have been mounting fears of the 'big one' ever since the Japanese government warned back in January that there was an 80 per cent chance of a severe earthquake hitting the country's southern Nankai Trough within 30 years. According to Tokyo's metropolitan government, 'Nankai Trough earthquakes are massive quakes that have repeatedly occurred at an interval of approximately every 100 to 150 years with their epicentral areas located along the plate boundary between Suruga Bay in the central prefecture of Shizuoka and the Hyuganada Sea off the southern main island of Kyushu'. Oracle Ryo claimed she began having premonitions in the early 1980s after a number of her vivid dreams came true. Her book has recently gained renewed interest after a number of her premonitions made in hindsight appeared to mirror real life events. She claims to have seen images of Queen frontman Freddie Mercury dying suddenly in a dream on November 24, 1976. She is also thought to have predicted the death of Princess Diana. The prophet has previously said that her predictive dreams arrive in a period of time that can be divided by five. Then in 1995, Tatsuki said that dreamed an old man led her to 'cracked earth', leading her to predict that the Japanese city of Kobe would be 'cracked' in either 15 days or 15 years. And thus her prophecy came true as 15 days later, Kobe was struck by an insidious earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people. Since a number of her predictions turned out to be true, Tatsuki has been compared to the Bulgarian prophetess, Baba Vanga. She became a cult figure after supposedly predicting major world events such as 9/11, the Covid-19 pandemic and even Princess Diana's death.</p>
