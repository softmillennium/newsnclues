                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The clay-court tournament is one where a slower surface speed puts an emphasis on the ability to win extended rallies and play off the baseline rather than relying on a dominant serve. Those conditions create an environment where certain players have thrived, though none more than Rafael Nadal, who won 14 French Open titles in his career and racked up an absurd 112-4 record at the event while winning every final he made. While Nadal's absence will be notable, even after he'd fallen from his incredible career heights, his biggest career rival will be in action as Novak Djokovic looks to build on the momentum of winning his 100th career title when he defeated Hubert Hurkacz in the finals of the Geneva Open, ending a title drought that extended back to when he won gold at the 2024 Olympics. Djokovic sits at +1200 to win Roland Garros, which may seem like long odds, but places him as third most likely to win the men's tournament. Those odds result from the dominance of the new generation of stars like last year's French Open winner Carlos Alcaraz, 22, and Italy's Jannik Sinner, 23. Alvaraz has won four Grand Slam tournaments to Sinner's three, though Sinner won the Australian Open to pick up the first Grand Slam title of the year. Poland's Iga Swiatek has won five Grand Slam titles in her career, including four titles at Roland Garros. Swiatek has won the French Open each of the past three years and is looking to extend that run to four this year. America's best hope for a French Open winner is 21-year-old Coco Gauff. She won the U.S. Open in 2023 and is now on the hunt for her second Grand Slam singles title. Gauff is one of two women, along with Mirra Andreeva, listed at +500 heading into the tournament. Men's tournament: Upsets happen and could make for a fun tournament, but this does feel like a two-horse race between Sinner and Alcaraz. A clash in the finals would be thrilling but depend on overcoming some potentially tricky matches along the way. When considering the clay surface, that potential match becomes a battle of Alcaraz's movement and speed against the cleaner ball-striking and forehand of Sinner. Alcaraz has four consecutive wins over Sinner, including in straight sets in the finals in Rome one week prior to the start of the French Open. Rome marked Sinner's return to the court after serving three months of a doping ban after a settlement centering around accidental exposure due to what was ruled accidental contamination. Should Sinner and Alcaraz meet in the finals, another straight set win for Alcaraz would be unexpected, but a win in the end still feels like the most likely outcome. As mentioned, Swiatek has won four of the five most recent French Opens, including the three most recent. Her form is simply off heading into Roland Garros, and it doesn't set up a promising situation for the defending champ. Sabalenka is an obvious threat to run away with the tournament, but she may have a tougher path to the finals than expected. Swiatek and Sabalenka are situated on the same side of the bracket, meaning if they both win all of their matches, they would meet in the semifinals. Gauff was given a much better draw, with Andreeva as her biggest possible obstacle to making the finals (their potential meeting would come in the semifinals). Gauff's serving is an issue, but the clay makes a dominant serve less of an important factor. As long as she can minimize the double faults, Gauff plays so well off the baseline and has such a friendly draw heading into the tournament that she can make a deep run. If she meets her biggest possible challenge (Andreeva) in the semifinals, she clearly has the edge based on recent results. It would then take one good match in the finals to take down her second career Grand Slam title. There is no gambling offered on this site.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic added the latest historic achievement to his stellar career on Saturday at the Gonet Geneva Open, where he claimed his 100th tour-level title. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings rallied for an absorbing 5-7, 7-6(2), 7-6(2) victory over sixth seed Hubert Hurkacz to triumph at the clay-court ATP 250. Djokovic overturned a 2-4 deficit in the deciding set before sealing victory after three hours, five minutes, the longest match of this year's tournament. After claiming the gold medal at last year's Paris Olympics, Djokovic had remained agonisingly on 99 titles, while twice coming close to the century. With his victory in Geneva, Djokovic joined Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only men in the Open Era to win 100 or more titles. MILESTONE UNLOCKED üîì@DjokerNole joins Roger Federer (103) and Jimmy Connors (109) as the only men to record 100 or more ATP Tour titles across their careers in the Open Era ü§©#ItAllAddsUp pic.twitter.com/3scGl9ehxo ‚ÄúPrimarily I want to thank my wife and kids for coming for three days on their school break just to be with me,‚Äù Djokovic said to his family. ‚ÄúMy team, thank you, not only for being with me in the good times, but also in the bad times. Only you know how difficult it is to sustain this level of craziness from me on the court. I want to thank you for earning, together with me, this victory number 100.‚Äù In 2023, Djokovic produced an outstanding season, in which he claimed seven titles, including a record 24th major and seventh Nitto ATP Finals trophy. His dominance was underscored by his run to within one victory of completing the Calendar Grand Slam, falling just short to Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final. However, the following campaigns have brought unexpected challenges. Djokovic was forced to withdraw ahead of his Roland Garros quarter-final in 2024 to undergo knee surgery, but made a miraculous recovery to reach the Wimbledon final and claim the Olympic gold medal that had eluded him for so long. That triumph in the French capital would be his last for a while. After suffering opening round defeats in Doha, Indian Wells, Monte-Carlo and Madrid this year, Djokovic claimed that he was confronting a ‚Äúnew reality‚Äù in his career. Yet with his resurgence in Geneva, Djokovic has proved that the fire still burns. He will now travel to Roland Garros, where his sights are firmly set on winning a record 25th Grand Slam title. There were nerves from both players, highlighted by Djokovic hitting his first double fault on set point in the opener, but he channeled the fighting spirit for which he has become known. Hurkacz did not drop a point in his opening three service games of the final set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, but Djokovic remained resolute to upend his opponent and notch his eighth consecutive Lexus ATP Head2Head win over the Pole (8-0). "He probably broke himself in the third, when he was 4-3 up, but this is what happens at the highest level. Incredible match, 7-6 in the third with a full stadium, beautiful atmosphere. I'm just grateful to clinch the 100th here.‚Äù Hurkacz underwent meniscus surgery in July last year before reaching a career-high World No. In Geneva, he was aiming to win his ninth ATP tour trophy and second on clay before he came unstuck by a remarkable comeback from Djokovic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‚ÄúThat would be the dream, and I'd love to be the first Paralympic champion if I can,‚Äù Rizvi said. Also an avid runner, Rizvi has completed two marathons and although jogging with a guide is great, tennis offers more. ‚ÄúOn a tennis court, I have absolute freedom because I know where the boundaries are, no one needs to tell me which way to turn, I don't need to have a cane or anything of this sort,‚Äù he told The Associated Press during a practice session at the National Tennis Center in southwest London. ‚ÄúIt's just the absolute sense of freedom to know that I can run comfortably, make my own decisions, and then be able to play points or rallies. The foam ball contains a bell so players can audibly track it. ‚ÄúWhat I find interesting about blind tennis is it's incredibly technical,‚Äù said Rizvi, who also possesses a big serve. The problem-solving aspect of the sport is something Rizvi enjoys ‚Äî no surprise given that he studied engineering at University College London. ‚ÄúYou really need to anticipate after you've heard the first bounce where the second and third will be,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou obviously can't see how your opponent has hit the ball, so it's a lot of anticipation and a lot of practice and getting used to different trajectories that the ball can take. Rizvi didn't even know that tennis was an option until he visited Metro Blind Sport in London a decade ago. ‚ÄúI can almost assure you that if you did a survey of blind and partially sighted people,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe majority of them wouldn't have any idea because it's not televised, it's not in any other mainstream events, so how are people supposed to find out?‚Äù The Lawn Tennis Association supports a visually impaired program that includes practice sessions at the governing body's National Tennis Center. The LTA also runs tournaments each year and sends ‚ÄúTeam GB‚Äù to an international competition. Rizvi noted that there's not much financial backing in the sport. There's no prize money at tournaments and players often fund their own travel. ‚ÄúGoverning bodies need to take a more active role and try and give parity to all forms of disability tennis not just the ones that have made it big like wheelchair tennis, for example.‚Äù Rizvi, who is married and works in finance , originally represented his native Pakistan but for the past year has been part of England's program since gaining British citizenship. Last year's world championships in Italy were the largest to date with 117 players from 20 countries, the International Blind Tennis Association said. Rizvi has won several national titles, a European championship, the world championship in 2023 ‚Äî as well as gold that year at the ISBA World Games. The International Paralympic Committee handbook spells out that the sport or discipline must be ‚Äúwidely and regularly practiced‚Äù in at least 32 countries and three continents. ‚ÄúI really want it to be in the Paralympics,‚Äù Rizvi said, ‚Äúbut I also want this to be a mainstream sport which can be part of the ATP Tour, part of Grand Slam tournaments , just like wheelchair tennis has made such amazing leaps forward. I'd love for blind tennis to be there as well because it's definitely got the potential.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Frances Tiafoe has struggled to find any consistent form in 2025 and has reached just one quarterfinal this season. Second-round defeats became a theme over the coming months, as Tiafoe held an underwhelming 4-4 record across his next four tournaments. Bouncing back in Houston, Tiafoe reached his first final of the season, coming up short against fellow American Jenson Brooksby. Unable to carry that momentum forward, Tiafoe won just four of his next nine matches ahead of the French Open. During his pre-tournament press conference, Tiafoe was asked for his thoughts on the tennis balls used on the ATP Tour after several players made complaints recently. ‚ÄúI think that's an excuse,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think all of the balls are horrendous, other than the US Open balls, to be honest with you. ‚ÄúTennis players are not afraid to make excuses. Are we going to have just one ball on tour? The other guy is playing with them too, it's not really important.‚Äù World number three Alexander Zverev said the balls were a ‚Äòjoke' recently, after losing to Lorenzo Musetti at the Italian Open. ‚ÄúBalls were a joke today,‚Äù said Zverev. ‚ÄúGenerally speaking, this is a subject we've had over the last three, four years now. Players are talking about it all the time. They say we play with the same ball in Monaco, Madrid, Munich. ‚ÄúThen we come here and the ball is totally different. It's very difficult to hit winners here. ‚ÄúFor me, for my game style, today was not easy because at the end of the day I'm still somebody that tries to play aggressive.‚Äù ‚ÄúLast tournament on clay, which I get really excited about, then we get on the real stuff, the grass and then the summer hardcourts, where tennis actually matters.‚Äù Tiafoe hinted at his love for the US Open when he said that's when ‚Äòtennis actually matters', but how has he actually performed at the four Grand Slam events? The American will no doubt hope to improve upon his record in 2025, when he takes on Roman Safiullin in the first round. Tiafoe was fined $120,000 for his behavior in Shanghai, as he'll no doubt hope to have better control of his emotions when he takes on Safiullin for a second time. Safiullin and Tiafoe will face off for a place in the second round of the French Open on Sunday, May 25.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic was competing in his second ATP Tour final of the year A battling Novak Djokovic made another bit of tennis history as he clinched his 100th ATP singles title with a comeback victory over Hubert Hurkacz in Geneva. The 38-year-old had won all seven of his previous matches against Poland's Hurkacz but had to grind out victory this time around, coming from a break down in the third set to win 5-7 7-6 (7-2) 7-6 (7-2). Djokovic's children ran onto court afterwards to congratulate their father, with wife Jelena watching in the stands. A relieved Djokovic now travels to Paris - where he will face American Mackenzie McDonald in the first round - with his bid for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title firmly on track. However, it remains to be seen how quickly he will recover from a final lasting three hours and eight minutes. Rivals attempt to dethrone Swiatek at French Open - women's preview This is Djokovic's first title since Olympic gold in Paris last year - and marks a high point in a difficult year for the tennis great. The clay season has been particularly tricky as Djokovic lost his opening matches in Monte Carlo and Madrid in straight sets before opting out of the Italian Open. In truth, it was Djokovic's errors, rather than excellent play from his opponent, that decided the first set. Serving to force a tie-break, an unfortunate net cord gave Hurkacz his first break point of the set - and a dreadful double fault from Djokovic handed it over. Service games rattled by from both players before the Pole played a dreadful game at 4-3 up. With Hurkacz's body tight and arm full of tension, an error handed Djokovic the break back, with the world number six shaking his racquet in celebration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here, we look back at where Djokovic's staggering haul of trophies has come from. The Serbian has won a record 10 Australian Open men's singles titles, while his haul of seven Wimbledon titles is only beaten by Federer in the Open Era. Djokovic is the only man to have won all four Grand Slam titles on at least three occasions. The Serbian has also won six Miami Open and six Italian Open titles in his career, with five Indian Wells titles among his greatest successes. Djokovic is a seven-time champion at the ATP Finals, with a 15-year gap between his first and last triumphs at the year-end championships. Who could forget Djokovic's stunning triumph at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games last summer? After suffering heartbreaking defeats in his four previous Olympic appearances, the Serbian finally struck gold by beating Carlos Alcaraz in an enthralling gold medal match. Jim Courier reveals what is a ‚Äògood sign' for Novak Djokovic ahead of French Open Boris Becker ‚Äòlost for words' over Novak Djokovic's split with Andy Murray Djokovic has won 15 titles at ATP 500 level, with his most successful event being the China Open. Finally, Djokovic has won 13 titles at ATP 250 tournaments, across a period spanning close to two decades ‚Äì from title No 1 in 2006 to No 100 in 2025. Djokovic is also notably a two-time Qatar Open champion, with the event since having been upgraded to ATP 500 status.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Casper Ruud is one of tennis' most well-liked figures, always coming across as a very affable and approachable individual. A supremely gifted tennis player too, he is one of many who has seen his career somewhat thwarted by the Big Three, particularly Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. The French Open represents his best chance, given his penchant for the iconic clay surface which adorns this event. However, when given the chance, he was more than keen to voice his opinion on various matters including one minor issue he holds with the ATP Tour. Chatting about the distribution of matches across each surface, he noted: ‚ÄòThe thing is like, Wimbledon is so nice. ‚ÄòI have to reset my game completely because I don't feel like my spin shots are working.' ‚ÄòThe thing is like, I played a junior two times and the first year it was like 30 degrees every day and sunny. Tennis started on grass and clay so it's fun to play on them, the most historic surfaces. ‚ÄòNow most of the tournaments are on hard which I wish they weren't but, what can you do?' Whilst he might claim to enjoy Wimbledon, it is clear where Ruud's favoured surface remains. And, having already removed one monkey from his back this year by finally winning a Masters 1000 final, there's no reason why he can't go one step further at the upcoming French Open. After all, he is a two-time finalist at this event, with the clay season almost always marking the most successful period of his year historically. That is why Ruud is one of three players who could win the French Open outside of Sinner and Alcaraz, the two obvious favourites. Should he keep his focus and play his best tennis, the title is there for the taking.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 Roland Garros draw is out, and defending champion Iga Swiatek faces a difficult path in her quest for a fifth Coupe Suzanne Lenglen trophy. 5, her lowest at a Slam since the 2022 Australian Open, Swiatek hasn't reached a final since winning the trophy in Paris last year. 26 seed Marta Kostyuk looms in the third round, while potential fourth-round opponents include No. 21 Jelena Ostapenko -- who holds a 6-0 record against Swiatek. 4 seed and last year's runner-up Jasmine Paolini, fresh off her second WTA 1000 title in Rome. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka, who opens against Kamilla Rakhimova. Sabalenka has also landed in a section full of landmines: No. 27 seed Leylah Fernandez, Danielle Collins or Olga Danilovic could be third-round opponents, while either No. 22 seed Clara Tauson could await in the last 16. 6 seed Mirra Andreeva head the third quarter, which contains another popcorn first round between No. She has won a tour-leading three titles this season so far, including a third trophy in Madrid three weeks ago. Can she convert that dominance into a first Roland Garros title? She's dominated the head-to-head against Collins 7-0, but trails Anisimova 5-2. A potential third round against Fernandez would be their first meeting since the Canadian memorably upset Sabalenka in the 2021 US Open semifinals. Tauson and Zheng both defeated her in their most recent encounters this year, in Dubai and Rome respectively. She takes on 2021 runner-up Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the first round; next could be Miami semifinalist Alexandra Eala, who will make her Grand Slam main-draw debut against Emiliana Arango. 28, is slated to meet Zheng in the third round; No. 11 seed Diana Shnaider is projected in the last 16. Meanwhile, Petra Kvitova will return to the Grand Slam stage for the first time since returning from maternity leave against Viktorija Golubic, with the winner to face either Anisimova or a qualifier. First-round matches to watch: [1] Aryna Sabalenka vs. Kamilla Rakhimova, Olga Danilovic vs. [27] Leylah Fernandez, [22] Clara Tauson vs. Magda Linette, [SR] Petra Kvitova vs. Viktorija Golubic, [28] Peyton Stearns vs. Eva Lys, Alexandra Eala vs. Emiliana Arango, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova vs. [8] Zheng Qinwen She's yet to drop a set to either Raducanu or Kostyuk in seven combined meetings, and though she trails Rybakina 4-3 overall, Swiatek has won both of their matches this season. The exception remains 2017 champion Jelena Ostapenko, who owns a 6-0 record against her. With Rybakina and Ostapenko potentially looming in the fourth round, Swiatek's path isn't easy, but the draw may have lightened slightly with the withdrawal of Belinda Bencic, who had originally been scheduled to face Rybakina in the first round. Paolini, fresh off a confidence-boosting title on home soil in Rome, could face hard-hitting Australian teenager Maya Joint in the second round, No. 29 seed Linda Noskova in the third and No. First-round matches to watch: Anastasia Potapova vs. [29] Linda Noskova, Zeynep Sonmez vs. [13] Elina Svitolina, [WC] Iva Jovic vs. Renata Zarazua, Emma Raducanu vs. Wang Xinyu 14 seed and 2023 finalist Karolina Muchova, has not played since Miami due to a left wrist problem. Their section also contains three unseeded former Top 10 players who have all suffered shoulder injuries of late. Marketa Vondrousova, the 2019 finalist, underwent shoulder surgery last year, and has not competed since February because of the same issue. Ons Jabeur and Maria Sakkari both ended their 2024 seasons early due to shoulder problems, and have struggled to regain peak form on their return; they are down at No. 25 seed Magdalena Frech, with Vondrousova potentially awaiting in the second round in what would be a rematch of the 2023 Wimbledon final. Whoever emerges from that could face Pegula in the third round. Meanwhile, Muchova and Sakkari could meet in the second round if they defeat Alycia Parks and Elsa Jacquemot respectively. Andreeva, the winner of two WTA 1000 titles already this year, opens against Cristina Bucsa and is projected to face another player on the comeback trail, No. Badosa has been sidelined for two months due to a recurrence of her back injury, only returning this week in Strasbourg. Indeed, her first round against Osaka marks unfinished business between the two. They were scheduled to meet in the second round of Rome two weeks ago before Badosa withdrew just half an hour ahead of the match. First-round matches to watch: [17] Daria Kasatkina vs. Katerina Siniakova, Naomi Osaka vs. [10] Paula Badosa, [14] Karolina Muchova vs. Alycia Parks, [WC] Lois Boisson vs. [24] Elise Mertens, [25] Magdalena Frech vs. Ons Jabeur It's possible to draw both positives and negatives from Gauff's clay season so far. From the glass-half-full perspective, there's no arguing with back-to-back WTA 1000 finals in Madrid and Rome, particularly given that the former US Open champion had failed to make the semifinals in her six prior tournaments. On the other hand, back-to-back losses in finals would have been unwelcome for a player who had previously won nine of her 10 tour-level title matches. Gauff, the 2022 finalist in Paris, has a manageable draw to build on her recent form. 15 seed Barbora Krejcikova in the fourth round; the Wimbledon champion has only just returned from a six-month hiatus with a back injury this week in Strasbourg. The other Top 20 seed in Gauff's section, No. 20 Ekaterina Alexandrova, started 2025 in hot form but withdrew from Rome and Strasbourg due to a shoulder injury. Keys, a semifinalist here in 2018, has yet to reach a final following her Australian Open title run -- though the American's power game, bolstered by the confidence of a Grand Slam trophy, could well click on the major stage again. 9 seed Emma Navarro, who defeated her at two Grand Slams last year. First-round matches to watch: Varvara Gracheva vs. [31] Sofia Kenin, [23] Beatriz Haddad Maia vs. Hailey Baptiste, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro vs. [9] Emma Navarro, [15] Barbora Krejcikova vs. Tatjana Maria, [30] Anna Kalinskaya vs. Marie Bouzkova</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Will her idol, Rafael Nadal, get the tribute his success deserves? Is this the denouement for line judges on tennis courts? The 2025 French Open promises to be a cracker. At this point, Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek probably isn't thinking about becoming the first woman in the Open Era to win four consecutive French Opens. She likely just wants to get to the second week the way she's been playing of late. She's one of the best women ever on clay. Chris Evert thinks she will break her record of seven Roland Garros titles, and if she were to never play the tournament again, ≈öwiƒÖtek would already be in statue territory. So the question this year is two-pronged: Can she find her form and cement her reputation as maybe the most untouchable woman on red clay, given that Evert played in a far smaller world when tennis was far less competitive. It's an argument Evert makes anytime ≈öwiƒÖtek's greatness comes up ‚Äî and those two prongs go hand in hand. A draw can look very open, until it's closed. The French Open is the only Grand Slam to resist the appeal of electronic line calling (ELC), with Wimbledon to abandon 147 years of history by ditching line judges for this summer's event. This has led to several disagreements between players and umpires, with some players taking a photo of the mark to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that the technology is wrong. In theory, those players should welcome umpires getting off their chairs to inspect marks. But as tournaments before ELC showed, they are more likely to end up arguing with them about which mark is correct and whether or not that mark is touching a line. The vast majority of players are in favour of ELC, even the ones who grouse about calls that have gone against them. Those officials will have to make good on that claim over the next couple of weeks, as they deal with a group of players so used to machines that they will be expecting close to perfection. So why shouldn't Roland Garros send him off for a third time? Sunday night's ceremony on Court Philippe-Chatrier should be better. Nadal won't have to endure the ovations in sweaty clothes while still angry and depressed after a loss. The 14-time champion, who recently declared that he does not miss tennis because he left it behind satisfied with his achievements, will be the star of his show. A Grand Slam wouldn't be a Grand Slam nowadays without some sort of political machinations going on in the background, and this year's French Open is no different. On Thursday at Roland Garros, as well as learning who they would be facing in the first round, a group of the world's best players were meeting with executives from the four Grand Slams. They were there to follow up on a letter they'd sent in March, calling for a greater share of tournament revenue. As well as asking for a more equitable revenue split, it asked for a greater say in how the sport was run. These points, and a request for the majors to make financial contributions to welfare programmes, such as pensions and healthcare, were all raised by the handful of players present in Thursday's meeting. Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Andrey Rublev may yet find the glory they have been seeking. But time is running out and they've been heading in the wrong direction. Only Zverev is still there ‚Äî and he hasn't played top-10 tennis for months. In a news conference ahead of the French Open, Tsitsipas was sanguine about the challenges ahead, especially compared with what he faced a few years back. ‚ÄúI feel like the lineup right now is much more difficult than it was back then,‚Äù he said. Medvedev said the longevity of Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic colored expectations. ‚ÄúIf we take them out, I feel like a lot of players after getting closer to 30 or after 30 maybe drop their level, then maybe come back,‚Äù he said in a news conference. ‚ÄúIt's just the physical part of something getting to us. Regardless, with each passing Slam, their chances of winning one dim. Nadal believes that playing clay-court matches at night is a sin. The French Open night session is a fixture of the tournament, so no dice there, but his belief is a gateway into understanding a Grand Slam, which is affected by the weather more than any other: not because rain stops play, but because rain hits clay. A matchup can swing based on atmospheric conditions, and if a match goes long, it can evolve through different weather conditions and change character completely. At last year's event, heavy rain in the first few days played havoc with the schedule and turned matches into a sludgy, heavy affair. So check the weather at Roland Garros, not only to understand if an umbrella will be required. (Top photo: Jacques Demarthon / AFP via Getty Images)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zachary Cohen dives into his tournament futures for the 2025 French Open. The French Open officially begins on Sunday, May 25th, when Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek will start to think about defending last year's titles. We cover everything here at VSiN, which is why we're known as ‚ÄúThe Sports Betting Network.‚Äù Tennis is a big part of that, so subscribe now and get ready for a fun summer. Aryna Sabalenka To Win Quarter 1 (-140 ‚Äì 2.5 units): I had Sabalenka to win her quarter in Rome, where I thought she had a pretty easy draw. And if Sabalenka does get by Collins, she should beat Clara Tauson or Amanda Anisimova to set up a rematch with Zheng. Well, Sabalenka had a 6-0 record against Zheng before losing to the 22-year-old in the Eternal City, and I just don't think that edge is gone. Meanwhile, Zheng played an incredible match in that one, and her serve was especially on. She won 82.4% of her first serve points in that match, which is well above her season-long first serve points won percentage of 69.9%. That doesn't feel like something Zheng will be able to replicate, and Sabaleka should level up on the bigger stage. Coco Gauff To Win Quarter 4 (-140 ‚Äì 2.5 units) & Win Tournament (+550 ‚Äì 1.5 units): Gauff made the finals in both Madrid and Rome, and she did that without reaching her top level. The American was running hot and cold as a server, and her forehand was a bit leaky ‚Äî as it always seems to be. However, Gauff has now proven that she can make deep runs at big tournaments without playing her best. That said, I trust her to emerge from one of the weakest quarters there is on the men's or women's sides. Kalinskaya just pulled out of Strasbourg, so her health is a question mark. And Krejcikova has been in witness protection since winning Wimbledon last year. So, Gauff should really have no problem at least setting up a match to reach the semis, and I'd like her chances against whoever she sees there. That's why I'm putting a big play on Gauff to win the quarter. And even if you don't like Gauff to beat Sabalenka, or whoever else, in the final, you'll like having a +550 ticket to play with in that match. Beatriz Haddad Maia To Reach Quarterfinals (+700 ‚Äì 0.5 units): I'm taking a chance on Haddad Maia to reach the quarterfinals. However, Haddad Maia has always been a good clay-court player. Haddad Maia is 44-35 on the surface in her career, and she's 12-7 in the 19 matches she has played at Roland Garros. Haddad Maia also made good use of the week before this tournament. Instead of just heading to Paris in awful form, Haddad Maia went to work on her game and find some confidence in Strasbourg. In that tournament, she beat Clara Tauson, Ashlyn Krueger and Emma Navarro. It just feels like she has snapped back into form, and a confident Haddad Maia can make a run in this tournament. NOTE: In the name of transparency, I should mention that I also have 3 units on Swiatek to win this tournament at +110 from a couple of months ago. I thought Swiatek would have an awesome clay-court season, silence all of her doubters and be the odds-on favorite to win her fifth title in Paris. I now feel terrible about that ticket, as Swiatek played poorly on the dirt and is out there to win this at +430 odds. Jannik Sinner To Win Tournament (+250 ‚Äì 2 units): I jumped on Sinner to win this tournament in the opening set of his beatdown of Casper Ruud in Rome. At that number, I'd still be jumping to back the Italian. There are only two questions that Sinner needs to answer now: Can he snap a four-match losing streak to Carlos Alcaraz, and can he do it on the Spaniard's favorite surface? In the Rome final, Sinner had two break points to win Set 1, but he wasn't able to cash in on either of them. I'm confident that with a little more time on court, he should be able to do a bit better in big moments. Also, Sinner's forehand was a mess in that final, with TennisViz and Tennis Data Innovations giving him his second-lowest forehand Shot Quality (7.6) since the start of 2024. Sinner's forehand is the biggest weapon in tennis. And if Sinner is hitting the ball as well as he's capable of, that should make up for the difference in movement between these two. I also don't think Alcaraz is capable of reaching the same level he reached against Sinner in that final. I have serious doubts about whether he can play that smart of a match against Sinner again. I actually think Sinner has a better coaching team around him. Novak Djokovic To Win Quarter 2 (+250): For more on why I'm backing Djokovic to win Quarter 2, check out the feature I wrote on the 24-time Grand Slam champion! Lorenzo Musetti To Win Quarter 3 (+180 ‚Äì 2.5 units): Gill Alexander, Drew Dinsick and I all love Musetti to win Quarter 3. None of us spoke before Gill's Beating The Book French Open MegaPod, but we all lit up when we got to talking about this portion of the draw. Musetti just has a tremendous ability to cover the court, pound the ball with heavy topspin from both wings and just make magic happen. Musetti is just clearly a top-tier clay-courter, and his playing style should make him very difficult to beat in a best-of-five setting. So, with Holger Rune and Taylor Fritz being the two highest-seeded players outside of him in Quarter 3, it's worth putting a pretty big play on Musetti to make the semifinals. Both of those players have serious limitations and concerns heading into the event.</p>

Djokovic will attempt to secure his first tournament victory since winning Olympic gold in Paris last summer when he faces Poland's Hubert Hurkacz in Saturday's final. He is aiming to become only the third player to reach a century of ATP titles after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer. He also lost both of his previous matches on clay this season before this week, but appears to be finding form ahead of the start of Roland Garros on Sunday. Djokovic will start his bid for a fourth French Open triumph and record-breaking 25th Grand Slam singles title when he faces American Mackenzie McDonald in the first round. On Friday, he took the first set against former Wimbledon semi-finalist Norrie courtesy of a break in the seventh game. The Serb battled back from 5-2 down in the second set to force a tie-break, but saw a match point come and go as Britain's Norrie sent the tie into a decider. But Djokovic raced into a 3-0 lead in the third, losing just one point across those first three games. He closed it out on his second match point after another run of three straight games. Former world number six Hurkacz saw off 128th-ranked Austrian Sebastian Ofner 6-3, 6-4 to reach his first final since losing to Jannik Sinner in Halle last June.</p>
