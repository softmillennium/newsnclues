                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Journalists who cover the US military say they are extremely concerned by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's constraints on press access at the Pentagon. They say the newest restrictions, outlined Friday night, appear to be “a direct attack on the freedom of the press and America's right to know what its military is doing.” Friday night's announcement is part of a pattern. Since January, Hegseth and his Trump administration allies have taken numerous steps to stifle independent media. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, has set the tone by assailing his former colleague Jennifer Griffin (Fox's national security correspondent) and other journalists. Almost as soon as Hegseth took charge, some of the country's biggest news outlets were booted from their dedicated Pentagon workspaces. In what the Defense Department called a “media rotation program,” smaller and explicitly pro-Trump media outlets were offered workspaces. A few weeks later, the Pentagon said the press briefing room would be closed “when not in use for public briefings.” Top Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell, a close friend of Hegseth's, has only held one press briefing to date. Hegseth himself stood accused of mishandling sensitive information in March when he sent detailed plans about a military operation in Yemen to a Signal group that included The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg. The changes announced on Friday will make it more difficult for journalists to reach Hegseth. It will also eliminate “the media's freedom to freely access press officers for the military services who are specifically hired to respond to press queries,” the Pentagon Press Association pointed out. The association said it is “puzzled” about why the Defense Department “is devoting such attention to restricting Pentagon media instead of engaging with it as senior leaders have long done.” He has denounced what he called the “hoax press” and promoted himself by appearing on Fox opinion shows hosted by his friends. He also enlisted right-wing content creators to increase the Defense Department's promotional efforts on social media. Podcaster Graham Allen, who helped Hegseth full-time for several months and said Friday that he was moving into a part-time role, dismissed a CBS journalist's objections to the new restrictions by saying, “you can cry harder.” “It keeps voters informed, strengthens democratic oversight, and sends a clear message to the world that America stands for openness and accountability,” Balsamo said.

A federal judge ordered the Trump administration return a deported Guatemalan national, claiming the government did not give him a sufficient opportunity to express his concern over being deported to Mexico.

Judge Brian Murphy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled Friday that the deported foreigner, labeled as “O.C.G.” in court filings, had received a withholding of removal fromGuatemala, but was deported to Mexico despite expressing fear of returning to Mexico where he claims he was raped and held hostage. Murphy ordered the Trump administration “facilitate” the deported man's return to the U.S. for due process on his claims of persecution in Guatemala and Mexico.

“On balance, the Court finds that the public benefits from living in a country where rules are followed and where promises are kept. Rules are tedious and frustrating, but they also keep us fair and honest,” Murphy said. “The return of O.C.G. poses a vanishingly small cost to make sure we can still claim to live up to that ideal.”

The deported man's lawyers said he is in Guatemala, after being given the option of staying in Mexico or returning to Guatemala. The deported man claims he is “living in constant fear of his attackers, being unable to leave the place where he is staying, not being able to rely on the police to protect him, and not being able to see his mother for fear of exposing her to violence, among other hardships.”

JUDGE BLOCKS EXECUTIVE ORDER TARGETING JENNER & BLOCK LAW FIRM

The order to facilitate the return of the deported Guatemalan national comes as a legal battle continues to unfold in the deportation of Salvadoran national and alleged MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

The Trump administration has been ordered to return Abrego Garcia, but neither the U.S. nor the Salvadoran government has returned the deported foreign national as the case in federal court continues.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran and the United States concluded a fifth round of high-stakes nuclear talks in Rome on Friday amid growing skepticism in Tehran about the chances of a deal as Washington hardens its position. A senior Trump administration official said Friday more talks are needed and both sides agreed to meet “in the near future.” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Friday's nuclear talks with the US “are too complicated to be resolved in two or three meetings.” He said however that Iran and US delegations “have completed one of the most professional rounds of negotiations,” in a televised interview on state-run IRIB news. Araghchi reiterated Tehran's red lines before he departed for Rome on Friday. “Figuring out the path to a deal is not rocket science,” he posted on X before his flight. The Trump administration has demanded Iran stop all uranium enrichment activity, which Witkoff says “enables weaponization.” Uranium, a key nuclear fuel, can be used to build a bomb if enriched to high levels. US officials have yet to comment publicly on the outcome of Friday's talks. On Saturday, a senior Iranian lawmaker told CNN that Tehran is disappointed with the progress of nuclear talks and is considering a “Plan B” if they fail – though he did not specify what it would entail. “I got disappointed and do not have much hope that the negotiations will lead to a deal. Rezaei said it was too early to judge whether the talks could succeed. “So far we have not seen much seriousness on their (US') part,” he added. Speaking Thursday, Araghchi said Iran was open to enhanced monitoring by international inspectors but would not relinquish its right to pursue nuclear energy, including uranium enrichment. Washington is offering to wind back crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for de-nuclearization. The US had previously sent mixed signals about whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium, but in recent weeks it has hardened its stance, insisting that no enrichment will be permitted. That shift has prompted officials in Tehran to question Washington's commitment to a deal, as Iran has repeatedly said enrichment is a red line in negotiations. Related article Iran's supreme leader says US-Iran talks unlikely to succeed Initially, the sources noted, some Iranian officials believed Washington might seek a “win-win” compromise. They said that Tehran no longer takes seriously US efforts to distance itself from Israel's hardline stance on Iran, and it sees proposals made by the American side as following the agenda of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has insisted that no enrichment be allowed in Iran. Witkoff on Friday met with Ron Dermer, a confidant of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Rome on the sidelines of talks, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN. Washington has kept up the pressure on Iran with fresh sanctions and threats of war even as diplomatic talks continue. On Wednesday, the US State Department announced new measures, identifying Iran's construction sector as being “controlled directly or indirectly” by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and 10 strategic materials that it said Iran is using in connection with its nuclear, military or ballistic missile programs. “With these determinations, the United States has broader sanctions authorities to prevent Iran from acquiring strategic materials for its construction sector under IRGC control and its proliferation programs,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. “The US's consecutive rounds of sanctions only reinforce our people's deeply held belief that the American decision makers are set to make every malign effort to hinder Iran's development & progress. Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group in Brussels, said there is a misguided perception in Washington that a weakened Iran is more likely to compromise. For Iran, capitulation is seen as a worse than an Israeli strike on its nuclear facilities, he added. “Iran would be reluctant to make concessions from a position of weakness, because if it does so, then it will put itself on a slippery slope that could result in regime collapse,” Vaez said. Multiple American officials told CNN this week that the US has obtained new intelligence suggesting that Israel is preparing to strike Iranian nuclear facilities even as the Trump administration pursues a diplomatic deal with Tehran. Related article New intelligence suggests Israel is preparing possible strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, US officials say But threats of war will only lead to Iran “doubling down on its current position,” Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at London's Chatham House think tank, told CNN. In an interview with CNN's Jim Sciutto on Thursday, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee signaled potential American support for Israel's nuclear plans under the right conditions. “I can't imagine the US would object to a sovereign nation defending itself against what they perceive as a legitimate threat to their very lives,” Huckabee said. Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, said the Trump administration has “unnecessarily walked themselves into a dead-end by insisting on zero enrichment,” fueling the idea that Israeli strikes will follow if Iran doesn't back down. “They won't play the patience game any longer,” Parsi said. “If the Israelis were to do anything, it has to be clearly understood that it is not about destroying the program at this point, because they don't have that capability.” Parsi added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump scored hugely this week when the House gave him a one-vote victory on his “big beautiful bill” of tax cuts, spending increases, and immigration initiatives. For past presidents, that would have been enough for a winning week, but for Trump 2.0, it was just another day and week filled with the non-stop action he has shown since returning to the Oval Office. On Friday, for example, he returned to his dizzying tariff agenda, threatening Apple and Samsung with a 25% tax on cellular phones made overseas and a 50% tariff on European goods for failing to take his previous threats seriously. Midweek, he welcomed the black president of South Africa into the Oval Office, where he challenged him on reports of white farmers being murdered. Democratic pollster John Zogby failed the president mostly over his chaotic tariff policies. Judging by President Donald Trump's standard, this was a pretty dull week. He announced his Golden Dome missile defense plan, met with South African President Ramaphosa and threatened more tariffs on European Union goods and iPhones made outside the U.S. For any other president it would have been a very busy week. There were the usual wins and losses in court, but no one seems terribly excited about them. Former President Ronald Reagan's plan never came to fruition and didn't have the technological capabilities we have now. Trump's plan — though he wants it by the time he leaves office, which ain't happening — should be vastly more capable. It will probably be modeled on Israel's layered “Iron Dome” defense but will — obviously — have to be far larger to protect America. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa walked into a buzzsaw of criticism in the White House. Ramaphosa's government has been discriminating against white landowners. Trump's criticisms, which included showing a video of evidence, may cause Ramaphosa's fall. The Washington Post said Trump's evidence was false. It wasn't, but that's the Post for you. They are just another voice for the Democrats who don't have anything to say except “orange man bad.” Washington, by the way, is pretty much a lawless city. Not unlike President Donald Trump himself, I have no idea what he is doing with his tariff policy. This is not really funny as it is creating both confusion and angst among a wide range of stakeholders in this country and abroad. Trump argues that his policy is creating a record-setting number of jobs. The House passed his “big beautiful bill” by a one-vote margin, and it will have an even tougher time in the Senate. Then there was the cryptic-crypto dinner with investors at one of his golf clubs. The president is determined to break all the rules, look as guilty as hell, and get away with whatever it is again and again. If his goals are to confuse as many people as possible and thumb his nose at every rule and LAW that gets in his way, he gets an A+ this week. But this grader is a tad old-fashioned so I give him an F, and note that there are two of them in “tariff.“ Jed Babbin is a Washington Examiner contributor and former deputy undersecretary of defense in the administration of former President George H.W.

A CNN anchor is the co-author of a buzzy new book that sheds light on President Joe Biden's apparent mental decline in office and the cover-up orchestrated by his team, but various CNN figures were critical in the past of narratives that questioned his fitness. As Jake Tapper and co-author Alex Thompson promote "Original Sin," an account of the cover-up that features high-level Democratic sources, media critics have noted CNN and other mainstream outlets downplayed or were even hostile to the suggestion that Biden could be losing his grip before last year's debate against President Donald Trump. President Joe Biden's mental acuity in office is the subject of a new book. Videos of Biden freezing up or appearing confused at various events went viral throughout 2024, but the White House aggressively pushed back, saying some of them were edited in a misleading fashion or didn't show what they purported. CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz pushed the White House's narrative last year about a video of Biden appearing to freeze up at a fundraiser with Jimmy Kimmel, saying Biden had merely "looked out at the crowd for a few seconds" before walking offstage with President Barack Obama, adding that "Republicans and right-leaning media outlets" "used this moment to say that President Biden froze." Moments later during a panel discussion, CNN commentator and former Kamala Harris adviser Jamal Simmons called Biden's fundraiser moment an "obviously selected video." "These are cheap fakes, [as] the White House and Biden people are calling them," Simmons told CNN's Erin Burnett. "The Biden White House falsely- when people showed that clip and asked what was going on- said it was a ‘cheap fake.' They did this all the time when there was video that seemed to show Biden acting in an odd or unusual, seemingly out-of-it way, they would call it a ‘cheap fake.' It was actual video," Tapper said last week. In a story in the aftermath of the Robert Hur report where Biden was memorably described as an elderly man with a poor memory, CNN's website published an article expressing concerns about both Biden and Trump and what type of cognitive ability was normal for a person in their 80s. The article cited a professor who said Biden's issues with word recall were not necessarily indicative of someone having memory issues. Biden at times during the interview with Hur had difficulty remembering when he was vice president and the year of his son Beau's death in 2015. Audio from then-President Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur reveals that he, and not the special counsel, brought up Beau Biden's death. "Ageism is not just what people do to each other. Ageism is also a mindset that you carry within yourself," the professor said. Ex-CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy repeatedly hammered proponents of the idea that Biden was in mental decline in his "Reliable Sources" newsletter before leaving CNN last year. "For years, and particularly over the last few months, MAGA Media has portrayed Biden as a senile, mentally incapacitated elderly man who cannot remember what he had for breakfast, let alone run the federal government," Darcy wrote in a newsletter last June, before the then-president's disastrous debate. Darcy declared the debate would give Biden an easy chance to "puncture the narrative" that he lacked fitness for office, suggesting Republicans had stupidly lowered the bar so much that Biden would easily clear it and come out of the debate stronger. "That's a worry for right-wing media figures, which risk seeing their bogus narrative about Biden being ripped up in real time," he wrote. Darcy also blasted the Wall Street Journal report last June about Biden's behind-the-scenes decline in his newsletter, saying it "owes its readers — and the public — better." Asked for comment by Fox News Digital about his past coverage, Darcy, who left CNN last year to start his own newsletter called Status, pointed to his newsletter Wednesday where he declared conservative media outlets were taking an undeserved victory lap.

(Photo by Lorenzo Bevilaqua/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images) "For years, right-wing media pushed a warped narrative of Joe Biden as a brain-dead puppet controlled by sinister, shadowy forces. Even after Biden dropped out of the race last July, "The View" co-host and CNN commentator Ana Navarro was committed to defending his mental acuity in office. Later that week, Manhattan Institute official Reihan Salam wondered if Biden should even stay in office until his term ended, but Navarro erupted that any talk about his state behind the scenes was mere speculation. I have seen him after he has had five different events in 24 hours," Navarro said at one point. CNN has stood behind Tapper's past reporting in light of his new job, pointing to examples when he aggressively covered the subject. For his part, however, Tapper has said he feels "humility" about his past work on Biden and praised conservative media outlets for discussing what was in plain sight. Fox News Digital's Joseph A.

Between 2019 and 2020, the average number of weekly emergency department visits for gunshots increased by 37 percent, and largely stayed high through the following year. A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world. A Pew survey that year found that 58 percent of Americans believed crime should be a top priority for the president and Congress, up from 47 percent in 2021. The FBI's 2023 crime report found that murder was down nearly 12 percent year over year, and in 2024 it kept falling to roughly 16,700 murders, on par with pre-pandemic levels. The early numbers for 2025 are so promising that Jeff Asher, one of the best independent analysts on crime, recently asked in a piece whether this year could have the lowest murder rate in US history. All of which raises two questions: What's driving a decrease in crime every bit as sharp as the pandemic-era increase? We shouldn't jump to conclusions about this year's crime rates based on the early data, especially since we're just now beginning the summer, when violent crime almost always rises. Crime data in the US is also patchy and slow — I can tell you how many soybeans the US raised in March, but I can't tell you how many people have been murdered in the US this year. But what we can tell looks very good. The Real-Time Crime Index, an academic project that collects crime data from more than 380 police agencies covering nearly 100 million people, estimates there were 1,488 murders in the US this year through March, compared to an estimated 1,899 over the same months last year. Violent crime overall is down by about 11 percent. Motor vehicle theft, which became an epidemic during the pandemic, is down by over 26 percent. In Baltimore, which The Wire made synonymous with violent, drug-related crime, homicides fell to 199 last year, its best showing in over a decade. City emergency rooms that were once full of gunshot victims have gone quiet. How much lower could it go nationally? So far this year, according to Asher, murder is down in 25 of the 30 cities that reported the most murders in 2023. Asher argues that if the numbers hold, “a 10 percent or more decline in murder nationally in 2025 would roughly tie 2014 for the lowest murder rate ever recorded.” The closure of schools during the pandemic, especially in already higher-crime cities in the Northeast, meant far more young men — who are statistically more likely to be either perpetrators of violent crime or victims of it — on the streets. The closure of social services left fewer resources for them to draw on; and the sheer stress of a once-in-a-lifetime health catastrophe set everyone on edge. As the pandemic eased, though, those buffers came back, providing a natural brake on violent crime. The White House under President Joe Biden poured hundreds of millions of dollars into community violence interruption programs, which aim to break the cycle of retribution that can lead to homicide. Baltimore's Group Violence Reduction Strategy has brought together community groups and law enforcement to deter the people considered most likely to get involved in gun violence. Even though Floyd's murder triggered a nationwide reckoning around police violence, recent data shows that police killings kept increasing, in part because fear of crime often stopped momentum around reforms. Here in New York, even as overall crime on the subways has fallen to historical lows, felony assaults on the trains have kept rising, fueling fears of lawlessness. But what we can say is most people don't seem to notice the positive trends. An October 2024 poll by Gallup found that 64 percent of Americans believed there was more crime nationwide than the year before, even though by that time in 2024, the post-pandemic crime drop was well under way. One of the most reliable results in polling is that if you ask Americans whether crime is rising, they'll say yes. Astonishingly, in 23 of 27 national surveys done by Gallup since 1993, Americans reported that they thought crime nationwide was rising — even though most of those surveys were done during the long crime decline. By definition, a murder is an outlier event that grabs our attention, inevitably leading the nightly local news. Sometimes, as during the pandemic, that bias can match reality. But if we fail to adjust to what is actually happening around us — not just what we think is happening — it won't just make us think our cities are more dangerous than they really are. It'll sap energy for the reforms that can really make a difference. A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter.

Late last month, some 14,000 baby chicks in Pennsylvania were shipped from a hatchery — commercial operations that breed chickens, incubate their eggs, and sell day-old chicks — to small farms across the country. They were reportedly abandoned in a US Postal Service truck in Delaware for three-and-a-half days without water, food, or temperature control. The thousands of survivors — mostly chickens, but also some turkeys and quails — were taken to Delaware's First State Animal Center and SPCA, which worked tirelessly to find homes to take in the animals as pets. The incident has received extensive national news coverage, and it highlights an often hidden aspect of America's network of small poultry farms and backyard chicken operations: the shipping of millions of live baby animals in the mail to be raised for eggs or meat. Most chicks survive their journey through the mail, but many don't. In 2020, 4,800 chicks shipped to farmers in Maine perished due to postal service delays, while in 2022, almost 4,000 chicks destined for the Bahamas died on the tarmac at Miami International Airport from heat exposure. There are plenty of other stories of chicks dying in the mail, and backyard chicken enthusiasts say it's not uncommon for a few birds out of every 50 or so that they order from hatcheries to die in the mail or shortly after arriving. It's a weird-sounding story with aggrieved customers and sometimes, a hopeful outcome, like the thousands of rescued birds in Delaware. But many more farmed animals die in transportation than most of us realize. Animals raised for food are often transported numerous times throughout their lives, and they're typically treated like cargo rather than living, feeling animals. More than 9 billion chickens raised for meat annually in the US are kept on factory farms — long, windowless buildings that look more like industrial warehouses than farms. The birds have been bred to grow enormous, which causes a number of health problems, and in these overcrowded facilities, disease spreads quickly. The conditions are so awful that up to 6 percent die before they can even be trucked to the slaughterhouse. That's over half a billion animals each year. Once the survivors reach about 6.5 pounds, they're quickly and tightly packed into crates. Those crates are then stacked one atop another onto a truck bound for the slaughterhouse. They're still babies, at just 47 days old, but 6.5 pounds is their average “market weight.” Most chicken farms are located close to a slaughterhouse, so the trip isn't too long — often 60 miles or less, according to the National Chicken Council. But “even if it is a short journey, the weather and the stocking density has a huge effect on mortality,” Adrienne Craig, an attorney at the Animal Welfare Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for more humane conditions in animal transport, told me. They can also become stressed and physically aggressive toward one another when packed so tightly. The US poultry industry doesn't publish statistics on how many animals die in transport — what they call “DOAs” (dead on arrival). (The National Chicken Council didn't immediately respond to a request for industry DOA figures.) To put that into context, around 33 million cattle are slaughtered for beef each year in the US. The DOA rate is even higher for pigs, with about a million every year either dead on arrival at the slaughterhouse, unable to move or keep up with other pigs after unloading, or in such a terrible state that they must be euthanized on arrival. These long distances mean the animals are living in one another's urine and feces while on the truck, and, according to Craig, they can experience bruising when jostled around as truckers navigate curves and bumpy roads. Animals have no federal protections in transportation trips under 28 hours, and the federal Twenty-Eight Hour Law, intended to reduce their suffering on those longer journeys, is poorly — and rarely — enforced. A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us. The average consumer, if they think about farm animal suffering at all, may only think about it in the context of factory farms or slaughterhouses. But the factory farm production chain is incredibly complex, and at each step, animals have little to no protections. That leads to tens of millions of animals dying painful deaths each year in transport alone, and virtually no companies are ever held accountable. But such modest measures would cut into their margins, and if there's one thing that should be understood about almost every major US meat company, it's this: They will always cut corners on animal welfare to increase profit unless they're legally required to change.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark (22) is ushered back to the bench area by teammates after being called for a flagrant foul on Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese during the second half an WNBA basketball game in Indianapolis, Saturday, May 17, 2025. Checkered flags and “Welcome race fans” signs on every block. Neatly trimmed lawns decorated with cutout Indy cars, a mock Borg-Warner Trophy, even an inflatable version of the track's familiar golden, winged logo. The Pacers flags and Caitlin Clark jerseys are easy to see all over town, including Gasoline Alley a few steps from the speedway's famous Brickyard. Pacers & Racers weekend is in high gear. “This is an epic weekend, an incredible opportunity to put Indianapolis on the minds of virtually every major sports fan on the planet,” said Chris Gahl, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Visit Indy. “Our initial research shows no other city in the U.S. has hosted this diverse level of major sporting events in such a short amount of time.” It may be an anomaly nationally, but Indianapolis is built to thrive in this sort of spotlight. And through every virtually twist — even an NCAA men's basketball tournament held entirely in and around Indy — the reviews have come back with races. On Saturday afternoon, Clark and the Fever host the defending WNBA champion New York Liberty in front of a sellout crowd early in a season with title hopes for a team boasting perhaps the biggest star in the league. They went on to lose all three series, too. Even the Oscar Mayer Wienermobiles came to town Friday. In a state where the greatest athletic feats often have been defined by auto racing or basketball, this weekend seems like a fitting marriage even to locals. Just ask IndyCar team owner-driver Ed Carpenter, a longtime Pacers fan and the stepson of former speedway president and CEO Tony George. “(Having the other events) just makes it that much more special.” Carpenter hopes to attend Sunday night's game — even if he wins the 500 — and now finds himself surrounded in Gasoline Alley by a growing legion of crossover fans Former IndyCar driver and broadcaster James Hinchcliffe was there for Game 2 and the triumvirate of Kyle Kirkwood, Colton Herta and Marcus Ericsson went to Game 2 of the Indiana-Milwaukee series. Scott McLaughlin, a Knicks fans, has a wager on the series with Carpenter and may attend Sunday's game if he's not drinking the milk in victory lane. “How'd that go?” fellow driver Alexander Rossi asked after the Pacers' thrilling Game 1 victory on Wednesday. “Real bad, we lost the unloseable,” McLaughlin said. I have to buy the equivalent -- if the Pacers win in six games -- if they win in seven, the bet is off, or I win -- I have to buy the equivalent up to 2500 bucks of his (coffee/java).” Film director Spike Lee is expected to be in his familiar spot inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse while his old foil, Reggie Miller, calls the game for TNT. Two tickets to each event would cost you nearly $4,000. Kyle Larson, who is making his second attempt at a different kind of race day double — completing 500 miles at Indianapolis and 600 more in Charlotte's NASCAR nightcap — already has made that trip. He went to the Fever game Tuesday night. “Outside the car, it's been crazier this year logistics-wise,” Larson said. Going to the Fever game was fun.” Three years ago, Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton made his IndyCar debut in a two-seater with Mario Andretti. “Being on the track and kind of seeing how fast all the cars go, and to meet Colton was pretty dope,” Boston said. Colton told us how many things could fit in the track and that's insane. Gahl said hotels are virtually sold out in Central Indiana and everywhere from Lafayette to Bloomington, roughly one-hour drives from Indy; downtown, the average cost is about $550 per night with a three-night minimum and restaurant reservations are scarce. Local merchandisers are capitalizing, too, selling blue-and-gold shirts that read “Zoom Baby,” a play off the late Bob “Slick” Leonard's radio calls of “Boom Baby” for Pacers' 3-pointers. “You've got to enjoy the moment, let the excitement and pressure go, focus on the task at hand right in front of you,” Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard said.</p>

Secretary Pete Hegseth denied China's assertion that Golden Dome was an effort to turn space into a 'war zone,' arguing it was only for defense of the homeland. The new rules ban credentialed reporters from most of the Department of Defense headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, without official approval and escort, Hegseth said in a memorandum. Hegseth described the protection of classified national intelligence information and sensitive unclassified information on operational security as "an unwavering imperative for the Department." Hegseth described the protection of classified national intelligence information and operational security as "an unwavering imperative for the Department." Hegseth's order will also soon require members of the Pentagon press corps to sign a form acknowledging their responsibility to protect national intelligence and sensitive information.

"We also anticipate a forthcoming announcement of additional security measures and enhanced scrutiny on the issuance of [credentials]," the memo said. "Failure by any member of the resident or visiting press to comply with these control measures will result in further restrictions and possibly revocation of press credentials."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I admit that by 2024, the American public had made up their mind, right, that they wanted the Democratic Party to nominate somebody new, and it was absolutely a mistake for the party to not listen to those voters,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) told NBC News. But on the other side of the election, and as Democrats grapple with a bombshell book alleging a cover-up of Biden's mental state, previously loyal politicians are now calling Nov. 5 an indictment. Murphy said Biden “was in control” during their interactions, while Khanna said he, too, saw no signs of decline when they met face to face. Both are also believed to have presidential ambitions, with a crowded but open field expected in 2028. A Democratic strategist downplayed the comments made by Murphy and Khanna. “I don't think their strategy is to break with the party. “Democrats need to do a better job messaging around their core values and showing voters that they will fight for them.” Still, Biden's health is becoming wrapped up in a broader critique of the party as Democrats look to demonstrate they will learn from their mistakes and set a better tone for the future. Andy Beshear (D-KY) has criticized Democrats for speaking in coded language that does not resonate with the working class. Pete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary under Biden, has also described the Democratic brand as being in need of repair, prescribing a message that is not simply focused on opposing President Donald Trump. On the question of Biden's fitness, some have been willing to go further than others. Buttigieg told an audience in Iowa this month that “maybe” the former president should not have run. “I was busy doing the connection and voter registration,” she said. But Dean Phillips, the former House Democrat who challenged Biden on a platform of generational change, has embarked on a media tour of op-eds and TV appearances to claim that he was right despite his alienation from the party. David Hogg, a Democratic National Committee vice chairman, has elevated his national profile but risked his standing in the DNC for promising to primary older incumbents in Congress. Khanna is among those Democrats who repeatedly defended Biden's mental acuity during the presidential campaign. “They should have been doing this in 2023,” Comfort told the Washington Examiner. “To me, it seems very convenient for them to suddenly make a break when, ultimately, they have been supportive of party leadership in the past couple of years. Democratic strategist Peter Daou, who once advised Hillary Clinton‘s 2008 campaign before leaving the party in 2020, said that “even Democratic voters, I think up to 50% of voters, wanted somebody other than Biden.” “So seeing Democratic officials and, you know, consultants, strategists, and media figures suddenly coming out of the woodwork, saying, ‘Oh, it was a mistake to run Biden,' is way too little, too late,” Daou told the Washington Examiner. “The Biden team were doing all sorts of tricks and really just like, putting pressure on state parties and local officials to prevent any challenges to him.” On whether Democrats are capable of change, especially in a two-party system, Daou added: “I don't think Democrats can do anything to reform themselves. … I look at all of that as rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.”</p>

Gary Sinise told Fox News Digital that he feels 'fulfilled' in his life right now and it would take a lot to get him away from his family to film a new project. Gary Sinise would make a Hollywood comeback — if the opportunity was right. "I can't leave home for the amount of time that I used to go and shoot a movie or something like that, but if the right thing came along — under the right circumstances and it felt right and the timing was good and it didn't take me away from home too much — I would absolutely consider it," Sinise said. Back in 2019, Sinise took a break from Hollywood to care for his son McCanna, known as Mac, who was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called chordoma. WATCH: Gary Sinise would return to Hollywood under the 'right circumstances' And I've been able to build a foundation. I've been able to take care of the family. I was able to take care of my son during a very difficult time because he needed round-the-clock nursing care and that's not paid for by the insurance. So, there were a lot of things I've been able to do because I had a successful movie and television career," said Sinise. I'm not out there pounding the pavement right now. Occasionally doing a paid speech or paid narration or something that only takes a little bit of time, doesn't take me away from home too long," he said. Sinise told Fox News Digital that there were projects he passed on to be home with his family. WATCH: Gary Sinise turned down opportunities to be with his family "There have been some things I've had to say I was unavailable for the amount of time that it would take. Some television series that would take me away from home, you know, every week and that kind of thing. I just can't do it with the situation that we're in now. I have to find the right... kind of thing," he said. Gary Sinise was famously cast on "CSI: NY" for nine years. Sinise said he's been talking to some people about projects that would align with his current lifestyle. Leaving home for long periods of time is just not anything I want to do," he said. "I put in my time doing that for many years and had some great wonderful projects, and they took me away from home quite a bit when my kids were young." Gary Sinise appears during the 26th National Memorial Day Concert in 2015. "Right now, I want to stay home a lot more, and I'm fulfilled with the mission of the Gary Sinise Foundation." The actor founded his foundation in 2011 to support veterans, first responders and their families through various programs, including smart homes, mental wellness initiatives and community outreach. Sinise told Fox News Digital that he initially got involved in the event after being invited by Hollywood actor, Joe Mantegna. Gary Sinise co-hosted the 2012 PBS National Memorial Day Concert. Gary Sinise at the 2013 PBS National Memorial Day Concert. "He called me and said, ‘Have you heard about the National Memorial Day Concert?' He said, 'Well, I just got involved with it a couple of years ago. It's a big concert on the West Lawn of the Capitol, and it's televised on PBS,'" Sinise said. Mantegna then invited Sinise and his band to perform at the 2005 Memorial Day concert. The following year, he was asked to come back and co-host with Mantegna. WATCH: Gary Sinise says the Memorial Day Concert is about remembering fallen heroes Sinise described the annual concert as a "national memorial service for our fallen heroes." "Memorial Day is about remembering and honoring those who have sacrificed, given their lives in service to our country over the years. We still have over 130,000 Americans buried in 26 different cemeteries overseas because of the sacrifices that were made during World War II and what not. That's a lot of sacrifice to keep us free over the years," he said. Gary Sinise will be hosting his 36th annual National Memorial Day Concert on Sunday. During the show, military service members and their families are showcased, and a spotlight is shined on those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.

The Indiana coroner working to identify victims from Fox Hollow Farm says "several tragedies" still remain. In late April, Hamilton County Coroner Jeff Jellison announced his office had identified the remains of Daniel Thomas Halloran at Fox Hollow Farm in Westfield, Indiana. He's the 10th victim of suspected serial killer Herb Baumeister, but investigators have linked Baumeister to at least 25 victims. A spokesperson for the coroner's office previously told Fox News Digital it still has three DNA profiles that haven't been identified. Jellison said his office is working through 10,000 bone fragments and doesn't know how many victims might be identified but told Fox News Digital in an interview there are "several tragedies." "We have 10,000 bone and bone fragments, so how many victims, you know, that will be is undetermined," Jellison said. "I heard someone say recently that one death is a tragedy, two or more deaths is a statistic. And I think we have several tragedies because you have to treat each one of these individuals separately. "So, we look at it really, you know, it's not how many potential victims do we have, but let's just continue working hard to identify. And then, at the end, we'll tally that up." Hamilton County Coroner Jeff Jellison speaks during a press conference to announce the first public funeral and dedication services to honor victims of suspected serial killer Herb Baumeister Aug. 22. Jellison said in an interview he plans on continuing to identify more victims until he's no longer in office. Law enforcement believes Baumeister lured gay men to his home during the 1980s and 1990s, where he would kill them and bury their bodies on his 18-acre property, known as Fox Hollow Farm. The original sign at Fox Hollow Farm has been replaced with a replica after the original was stolen Oct. 16, 2012. He often went to gay bars in the Indianapolis area when his family was out of town and, according to detectives, he would find men to bring home. Baumeister owned the Sav-A-Lot thrift store chain. Baumeister killed himself in 1996 at a Canadian park shortly after bone fragments were found on his property, prompting authorities to launch an investigation. A recent ABC News documentary, "The Fox Hollow Murders: Playground of a Serial Killer," revealed investigators believe Baumeister recorded his victims using a hidden camera inside his basement's air vent. Reporters interview a police officer outside the entrance of Fox Hollow Farm in Westfield, Ind., July 2, 1996. "Something to relive … the murders," said retired Hamilton County Sheriff's Office Det. … I was suspicious that if Herb was videotaping any activity that might have been going on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart Joint Base Andrews, Md., Friday, May 23, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday that U.S. Steel will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh as part of what he called a “planned partnership” that seemed to signal that he'll approve a bid by Japan-based Nippon Steel to make a big investment in the iconic American steelmaker, if not buy it outright. More recently, Trump suggested that Nippon Steel would invest in U.S. Steel, not buy it, and one union official suggested Friday that the federal government will have a role in the company's management going forward. But investors seemed to take Trump's statement as a sign that he's approving some sort of merger, sharply pushing up U.S. Steel's shares, and the companies issued approving statements. Nippon Steel said the partnership is a “game changer — for U.S. Steel and all of its stakeholders, including the American steel industry, and the broader American manufacturing base.” U.S. Steel said it “will remain American, and we will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel that brings massive investment, new technologies and thousands of jobs over the next four years.” Nippon Steel's nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden on his way out of office and, after Trump became president, subject to another national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Neither company explained Friday how the partnership would be structured. Japan's chief tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa told reporters Friday that he was closely watching the development. He said Nippon Steel has made a proposal that could win support from U.S. Steel and make a good investment for both Japan and the U.S. Josh Spoores, the Pennsylvania-based head of steel Americas analysis for commodity researcher CRU, said that, from what he's seeing, “this ‘partnership' is a green light for the acquisition.” Shares of U.S. Steel jumped 21% on the news, and continued rising in aftermarket trading. It has been opposed by the United Steelworkers union. “It's sounds like the deal's done,'' said Jason Zugai, vice president of the United Steelworkers union local at U.S. Steel's Irvin finishing plant near Pittsburgh. Zugai said he was “relieved, happy and thankful.'' He hadn't seen anything on paper but, he said, his understanding was that Nippon “will make all the profit'' and the federal government will have “a golden chair'' that allows it to veto any plans to idle or shut down U.S. Steel plants. To sweeten the deal, Nippon Steel had offered up a $2.7 billion commitment to upgrade U.S. Steel's two blast furnaces and pledged that it wouldn't import steel slabs that would compete with the facilities. U.S. Steel's CEO David Burritt warned last September that blocking Nippon Steel's bid would mean U.S. Steel would “largely pivot away” from investing in its two blast furnaces — one just outside Pittsburgh and one in Gary, Indiana — and it would raise “serious questions” about remaining headquartered in Pittsburgh. As recently as December, Trump said he was “totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company.” Last month, Trump ordered a new national security review of Nippon Steel's proposed bid.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bruce Springsteen performs at a campaign rally supporting Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, Oct. 28, 2024, in Philadelphia. In this photo combo Bruce Springsteen, left, appears at the 2024 Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto, Sept. 8, 2024 and Kid Rock during a visit to the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, March 31, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — Even as his fame and wealth have soared over the decades, Bruce Springsteen has retained the voice of the working class' balladeer, often weighing in on politics — most notably when he was a regular presence on Barack Obama's presidential campaign. At a concert in Manchester, England, Springsteen denounced President Donald Trump's politics, calling him an “unfit president” leading a “rogue government” of people who have “no concern or idea for what it means to be deeply American.” “The America I love, the America I've written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration,” Springsteen said in words that he included on a digital EP he released a few days later. (A few more days later, he began another gig with the nonpolitical but saliently titled track “No Surrender.”) Trump shot back and called Springsteen highly overrated. “Never liked him, never liked his music or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy — just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,” he wrote on social media. For decades, Springsteen has salted his songs with social and political commentary, and it's hardly surprising: One of his self-described musical heroes, the activist folk singer Woody Guthrie, played a guitar upon which was written, “This machine kills fascists.” Here is a look at some Springsteen lyrics that ventured into current events and the plights of people caught up in them. BACKSTORY: Springsteen's most misinterpreted song — misread by Ronald Reagan and many politicians after him — tells the tale of a Vietnam vet who lost his brother in the war and came home to no job prospects and a bleak future. The driving, catchy chorus — composed primarily of the words from the song's title, which made misunderstanding it easier — turned it into an anthem, albeit one that was not a burst of patriotism but a bitter description of veterans' circumstances. LYRIC: “Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores/Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more.” “My Hometown” is about a 35-year-old man remembering how he used to ride proudly around his town with his father when he was little. Foreman says, ‘These jobs are goin', boys, and they ain't comin' back. LYRIC: “No secret, my friend — you can get killed just for living in your American skin.” BACKSTORY: A song written about the 1999 police killing of unarmed Guinean immigrant Amadou Diallo, who was standing in front of his apartment building in the Bronx when he was peppered with 41 bullets — 19 of which went into his body. The case captivated and divided New York City, and the song's release alienated Springsteen from some of his fan base, which included cops (whose lives he had sometimes chronicled in earlier songs like “Highway Patrolman”). We'd rush ‘em in our Broncos and force 'em back down into the river below.” BACKSTORY: Barely a year after “American Skin,” Springsteen turned back to first responders in the wake of 9/11, venerating them with a song that tells of a firefighter ascending the steps of one of the Twin Towers to save people — and, presumably dying along the way. BACKSTORY: A lament from an underemployed American man who can't get more than odd jobs after the financial crisis of 2007-2008. BACKSTORY: Springsteen revisits the theme of a dying hometown, this time with more aggressiveness than lament, keying in on the financial crisis of 2007-2008. BACKSTORY: An almost biblical parable about pain and old hatreds. A veteran in Galveston Bay, who'd fought in Vietnam, watches as an immigrant Vietnamese shrimper protects himself and sets out to kill him one night — but it ends with unexpected results and quiet hope. LYRIC: “So I bought a .44 Magnum, it was solid steel cast. And in the blessed name of Elvis, well, I just let it blast ‘til my TV lay in pieces there at my feet. And they busted me for disturbin' the almighty peace.” It came months before Michael Douglas' anger-management-failure movie “Falling Down” depicted an enraged man losing it and tearing a swath through Los Angeles because of the stresses of modern culture. LYRIC: “My ship Liberty sailed away on a bloody red horizon. Oblique but devastating, particularly with such somber words against an upbeat melody reminiscent of his early work, it suggested there was still time to correct course. Which touches on a frequent Springsteen theme: possibility amid the hardship and challenge.

The Trump administration said Columbia University violated a civil rights law because it acted with “deliberate indifference towards student-on-student harassment of Jewish students from October 7, 2023, through the present.”

The Health and Human Services Department announced the violation on Thursday night and said “Columbia continually failed to protect Jewish students” because it didn't establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism until the summer of 2024, among several other reasons.

“The findings carefully document the hostile environment Jewish students at Columbia University have had to endure for over 19 months, disrupting their education, safety, and well-being,” said Anthony Archeval, acting director of the Office for Civil Rights at HHS. “We encourage Columbia University to work with us to come to an agreement that reflects meaningful changes that will truly protect Jewish students.”

It's unclear whether the administration will enforce penalties on Columbia aside from the more than $400 million in grants and contracts the administration has already suspended. “We understand this finding is part of our ongoing discussions with the government,” a spokesman for the university said in a statement to the New York Times.

One way the Trump administration could punish Columbia further is through the False Claims Act.

The act, which allows the government to recover funds lost due to fraud and impose penalties, has enabled the Trump administration to accuse institutions of fraud for accepting federal funds tied to their compliance with civil rights laws.

The Trump administration has found numerous institutions, especially schools, in violation of civil rights statutes such as Title VI, Title VII, and Title IX due to race-based opportunities, scholarships, and hiring, a lack of enforcement against campus antisemitism, and allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's sports.

Columbia was the epicenter of the pro-Palestinian protests last year and has been accused of allowing antisemitism to occur on its campus for years.

HOUSE PASSES LANDMARK ‘ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' TO DELIVER TRUMP'S TAX CUTS

HHS also said Columbia didn't respond properly to Jewish student complaints, didn't abide by its policies when addressing misconduct against Jewish students, did not investigate or punish antisemitic vandalism, or enforce its time, place, and manner restrictions for protests held on campus.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani attends the 34th Arab League summit, in Baghdad, Iraq, Saturday, May 17, 2025. President Donald Trump attends a business meeting at Qasr Al Watan, Friday, May 16, 2025, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration granted Syria sweeping exemptions from sanctions Friday in a big first step toward fulfilling the president's pledge to lift a half-century of penalties on a country shattered by 13 years of civil war. While broad, the administration's actions could possibly be reversed. A Treasury Department action suspended enforcement of sanctions against anyone doing business with a range of Syrian individuals and entities, including Syria's central bank. Syria is now led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former militia commander who helped drive longtime autocratic leader Bashar Assad from power late last year. “The only other option was Syria becoming a failed state and civil war,” said Mouaz Moustafa, a Syrian American advocate who had campaigned for quick, broad relief. “Now there is hope for a future democratic Syria.” They specifically block postwar reconstruction, so while they can be waived for 180 days by executive order, investors are likely to be wary of reconstruction projects when sanctions could be reinstated after six months. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Friday that in return for sanctions relief, Trump expects “prompt action by the Syrian government on important policy priorities.” The group that he led, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, was originally affiliated with al-Qaida, although it later renounced ties and took a more moderate tone. It is still listed by the U.S. as a terrorist organization. Trump met al-Sharaa last week in Saudi Arabia, a day after announcing his intention to lift the sanctions: “We're taking them all off. Rubio said sanctions relief must start quickly because Syria's transition government could be weeks from “collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions.” But asked by lawmakers this week what sanctions relief should look like overall, Rubio gave a one-word explanation: “Incremental.” While some sanctions can be quickly waived through executive actions like those taken Friday, Congress would have to permanently remove the penalties it imposed. A proposal circulated among administration officials this week broadly emphasized taking all action possible, as fast as possible, according to U.S. officials familiar with the plan who were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Last week, a State Department proposal laid out a three-phase road map with temporary, partial relief initially and setting sweeping conditions for Syrians to meet for any future phases of relief or permanent lifting of sanctions, one of the officials said. Supporters of sanctions relief say that might be impossible, given the subjectivity of determining which groups meet that definition and at what point they can be declared removed. Other conditions for moving to the second phase are for the new government to take custody of detention facilities housing Islamic State fighters and to move forward on absorbing a U.S.-backed Kurdish force into the Syrian army. Israel has been suspicious of the new government, although Syrian officials have said publicly that they do not want a conflict with Israel. Since Assad fell, Israel has launched hundreds of airstrikes and seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in Syria. Associated Press writers Matthew Lee and Fatima Hussein in Washington contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more. Using combined observations from ground-based telescopes over nearly four years, the researchers saw the distant galactic neighbors charging toward each other at more than 1.1 million miles per hour (1.8 million kilometers per hour). One repeatedly wielded its intense beams of radiation at the other, dispersing gas clouds and weakening its opponent's ability to form new stars. What Noterdaeme and his colleagues spied was a distant snapshot of the two galaxies in the process of merging into one large galaxy 11 billion light-years away. The intense gravitational influence of a black hole draws matter toward it in such an energetic way that dust and gas heat up to millions of degrees and become luminous, according to NASA. These luminous materials spiral around the black hole before entering, forming what's called an “accretion disk,” and jets of energetic matter beam out away from the center. However, researchers observed that after being dispersed by the radiation, the clouds were not dense or large enough to create new stars. Quasars have been known to essentially “switch off” from time to time, said study coauthor Sergei Balashev, a researcher at the Ioffe Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia, which could give molecular clouds the opportunity to reform. Until now, this effect had only been theorized but not confirmed through direct observation. Scientists initially wanted to observe this particular quasar more closely because of its unique features among thousands of low-resolution spectra, which are like fingerprints for distant celestial objects, offering clues about composition, temperature and activity within them. However, the light from quasars is so powerful that it often outshines their own host galaxies, making it difficult to observe other galaxies close by, according to Noterdaeme, the study's co-lead author. Related article Largest celestial object of its kind discovered in the distant universe Highly dynamic, luminous quasars are rare, according to NASA. “At first, we just knew there was some molecular gas between the (attacking galaxy's) quasar and us. It's only after, when we started to look with bigger telescopes, that we detected there were actually two galaxies,” Noterdaeme said. Since the light from these objects came from billions of light-years away in the early universe, it's possible the two galaxies have already merged by now, but there is no way to be sure, Balashev said. Scientists believe quasars and galaxy mergers used to be far more common earlier in the universe's lifetime, said Dong-Woo Kim, an astrophysicist with the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who was not involved in the research. Galaxies merge when they are pulled toward each other by gravity, and the universe used to be more densely packed together. Over time, the universe has expanded, and more galaxies have combined into larger ones, Kim said. Related article Once ‘dead' thrusters on the farthest spacecraft from Earth are in action again Though less frequent, galaxy mergers are still happening all the time, Kim said. Even our own Milky Way is expected to merge with the Andromeda galaxy in a few billion years, but the study team isn't certain yet whether the “cosmic joust” phenomenon is a common feature when two galaxies collide and form a larger one. “Research like this can teach us more about the birth of new galaxies and observe how they evolve over time.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump signed four nuclear energy-related executive orders on Friday that will speed up reactor testing, allow the Departments of Energy and Defense to build nuclear reactors on federally owned land, overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and boost the United States' mining and enrichment of uranium, a senior White House official said. The president also signed an order to restore what the White House called “gold-standard science,” which comes as the administration has cut billions in federal grants that fund scientific research and slashed staffing at several science-focused agencies. “We're signing tremendous executive orders today that really will make us the real power in this industry, which is a big industry,” Trump said during an Oval Office signing ceremony. The actions come as Trump's proposed budget calls for cutting over $400 million from the Energy Department's Office of Nuclear Energy. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum — who, along with nuclear energy company executives, joined Trump in the Oval Office — lamented what he said has been “over regulation” and heralded venture capital investment in the industry. One nuclear-related executive order speeds up reactor testing at Department of Energy national laboratories, expediting applications and review processes and enabling a pilot program for construction over the next two years, the official told reporters ahead of the Oval Office signing. A second order aims to reduce regulations for the Departments of Energy and Defense to build nuclear reactors on federal land, which the official said would allow “for safe and reliable nuclear energy to power and operate critical defense facilities and AI data centers.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pointed to what he said is a national security imperative. “By having small modular nuclear capabilities, which are rapidly being fielded, that we can use on our bases here and around the world, we're creating an environment where, if things happen elsewhere, the military can be reliable,” he said. A spokesperson for the White House Office of Science and Technology said the new reactors would be “small and advanced.” A fourth order “is focused on reinvigorating the US nuclear industrial base,” which the official said will allow the US to “start mining and enriching uranium and expanding domestic uranium conversion and enrichment capacities.” However, the US is years away from getting its enrichment capabilities up and running at full capacity. A bipartisan law passed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine put a stop to that, and scientists and companies are racing to produce it at home. Trump wrote that the the administration seeks to “facilitate increased deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies, such as Generation III+ and IV reactors, modular reactors, and microreactors, including by lowering regulatory and cost barriers to entry,” and it also plans to increase US nuclear energy capacity from around 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050. DOGE has been synonymous with sweeping cuts across the federal government. The order aimed at reforming the NRC also said the organization “has failed to license new reactors even as technological advances promise to make nuclear power safer, cheaper, more adaptable, and more abundant than ever,” and calls for them to “adopt science-based radiation limits.”</p>
