                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the Bitcoin price skyrockets past former all-time highs (ATH), one technical analyst has ignited a wave of excitement across the crypto community with his bold new prediction. The $325,000 Bitcoin price forecast by Gert van Lagen, a prominent crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) is based on a technical analysis chart spanning BTC's movements from 2009 and 2025. Each of Bitcoin's past bull markets, according to the analysis, has ended with a near-vertical explosive surge, where price accelerates rapidly before crashing into a corrective phase. This surge has always been defined by a price angle of at least 82 degrees from the bottom. Additionally, the upper trendline of this wedge intersects with the forecasted market top of Wave 5, which sits at around $325,000. Notably, this bullish prediction relies heavily on Bitcoin maintaining strong momentum and completing Wave 5 as a single clean impulse move, without any deviation or elongation, just like past cycles. Lagen's bold $325,000 price forecast for Bitcoin comes with an exceptionally near-term timeline. The market expert predicts that BTC could reach this ambitious target as soon as July 5, 2025, which is just over a month away. The analyst's projected trajectory of Bitcoin's surge to a market top also aligns closely with the past patterns that followed each Bitcoin halving cycle. These halving events have triggered strong bull markets during past cycles. The current rally also follows Bitcoin's fourth and most recent halving event, which took place on April 20, 2024, reinforcing the repetitive and cyclic nature of Bitcoin's price movements. A Historic Correction Could Follow This Price Surge Beyond the dramatic $325,000 Bitcoin price prediction, Lagen's analysis also carries a foreboding bearish outlook. He cautions that after Bitcoin reaches this projected market top, what comes next may be a high time frame price crash, possibly lasting several years. Once the five-wave structure is completed, Lagen expects Bitcoin to enter its first true Wave 2 correction at the highest degree.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wall Street Gets Ethereum's 'Digital Oil', Says Etherealize Co-Founder Vivek Raman For well over a century, oil has been viewed as a strategic commodity, playing an essential role in transportation and manufacturing, among other critical industries. For Ethereum's proponents, drawing comparisons has been useful—but even then, the analogy is far from perfect. When Vivek Raman introduced Etheralize in January, the former banker and business development firm's co-founder formalized efforts to onboard Wall Street. ETH, whether it's being consumed to send transactions or power smart contracts, fuels Ethereum's network. “I think it is hard to come up with the right metaphor,” Grayscale Head of Research Zach Pandl told Decrypt. “It will be interesting to see whether investors begin to appreciate the scarcity of ETH, even if they're not yet kind of using the chain from a transactional standpoint.” Another major difference between Ethereum and oil is that the latter commodity does not offer yield. Within the coming years, financial institutions are expected to grow more comfortable with the practice of tokenization, in which real-world assets, such as stocks and bonds, are represented on-chain. Regulatory shifts under U.S. President Donald Trump could be a key driver. However, several funds have been tokenized on Ethereum by staid financial firms, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Much like oil is a neutral asset connecting myriad industries to each other, Ethereum could be seen as a non-sovereign asset for the modern financial system, Raman argued. “In this ecosystem where the world's assets are all tokenized by different counterparties, [...] the only neutral asset that's global, that connects all of these, is ETH,” he said. “It becomes more and more important as a global trading pair, as a strategic asset to hold if you want to stay in neutrality between all of these different tokenized assets.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

Global economic uncertainties and trade policy shifts are creating ripple effects across cryptocurrency markets, with Dogecoin showing resilience despite recent downward pressure. 

The meme coin has formed a clear bearish channel with resistance at $0.236, though strong buying emerged at support levels, indicating investor confidence remains despite broader market concerns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Kentucky-based cryptocurrency investor has been accused of torturing an Italian tourist in a high-end New York City apartment. The victim alleged that he had been held captive for more than two weeks. Upon investigation, police found several Polaroid photos in the Prince Street apartment, which Woeltz rented for an estimated $30,000 to $40,000 per month. These photos depicted the victim undergoing various forms of torture. The victim was reportedly tied up with an electric cord, Tased, pistol-whipped, forced to consume cocaine, and threatened with an electric chainsaw, reports the New York Post. The conflict reportedly stemmed from a cryptocurrency dispute, with Woeltz trying to extort millions of dollars from the victim through a series of gruesome tortures.

Post the incident, the victim was immediately taken to Bellevue Hospital for medical attention, while Woeltz was arrested and charged with multiple offenses including second-degree assault, first-degree kidnapping, and criminal possession of a weapon. Along with Woeltz, 24-year-old Beatrice Folchi from Manhattan was also arrested and charged with first-degree kidnapping and first-degree unlawful imprisonment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoins are leading today's crypto bloodbath with top assets like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA), correcting between 5-and 7% in the last 24 hours. This was due to renewed fears of a tariff war sparked by President Donald Trump. Trump threatened a 50% tariff on the European Union, citing stalled negotiations, which rattled market sentiment. This pullback comes after Bitcoin recently reached fresh highs above $111,500, driven by ETF inflows, stablecoin legislation progress, and increased institutional buying. However, these supportive factors have failed to shield altcoins, which remain under pressure in the short term. In a Telegram message, Haiyang Ru, co-CEO of HashKey Group, said: But if BTC's volatility picks up again, traders may rotate into regulated stablecoins — especially with new frameworks in the U.S. and Hong Kong easing that transition.” The global macro uncertainty has once again gripped crypto market as tariff tensions continue to escalate and US Treasury yields have surged to 4.5%. Altcoins like Ethereum will play a decisive role in deciding future trajectory, after 50% upside over the past month. Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes had predicted a significant altcoin season this summer, with Ethereum expected to outperform Solana in the upcoming rally. According to Hayes, this altcoin season will differ from 2021, when nearly every cryptocurrency surged by 100x. Instead, the market may see a more selective and measured rally this time. With Solana solidifying its position in the crypto ecosystem, Solaxy ($SOLX) is making waves as an innovative blockchain solution designed to enhance Solana's performance and scalability. Solaxy tackles persistent issues such as network congestion, scalability bottlenecks, and transaction failures during peak activity periods. By processing transactions off-chain and bundling them into optimized batches for final settlement on Solana's mainnet, Solaxy aims to improve transaction reliability and network efficiency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" Now, as a Wall Street giant suddenly flips from gold to bitcoin, the bitcoin price is braced for a huge week that will see U.S. president Donald Trump's vice president JD Vance speak alongside Trump's crypto czar David Sacks at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. "This is more than a headline moment—it's a signal,” David Bailey, the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher and organizer of the conference BTC Inc who has become an unofficial advisor to the Trump administration on bitcoin, said in a statement. During last year's Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, then presidential candidate Donald Trump announced that he'd create a bitcoin strategic reserve if he won the White House in November—a promise he followed through on in March via an executive order. This year, U.S. vice president JD Vance is headlining the conference, due to speak at 9am on Wednesday, while Trump's crypto czar David Sacks and executive director of the president's council of advisers on digital assets Bo Hines will address the conference on Tuesday. Earlier this week, Trump's son Eric, who has fully embraced bitcoin and crypto via his World Liberty Financial decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that was founded in response to the Trump family being debanked by Wall Street, posted to X that “this is just the beginning of this incredible ride.” The bitcoin price rally in recent weeks, coming as Trump hosted the top holders of his controversial memecoin for a gala dinner, has spurred a flood of bullish bitcoin price predictions that include bitcoin replacing the U.S. dollar within ten years. “Institutions are turning to bitcoin because of uncertainty,” Ryan Chow, the chief executive of bitcoin DeFi protocol Solv, said in emailed comments. This week, JPMorgan's bitcoin-skeptic chief executive Jamie Dimon announced it will begin offering bitcoin to clients as Wall Street gradually warms up to crypto while companies around the world are looking to follow software company-turned-bitcoin acquisition vehicle MicroStrategy in buying and holding bitcoin as a long-term investment. “Bitcoin reaching an all-time high is a powerful reflection of how far the digital asset ecosystem has come," Vincent Chok, the chief executive of corporate treasury services company First Digital, said via email.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto space has never been more exciting, especially with news circulating about traditional financial giants like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citi, and Wells Fargo possibly launching a joint stablecoin. This could be a game-changer, but it's not just stablecoins that deserve your attention. In fact, many of the best altcoins of 2025 are looking to capitalize on the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized assets, and new technologies. This is a significant development, as these major players in banking have largely stayed on the sidelines, hesitant to fully embrace crypto. Stablecoins, which are pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, offer a sense of stability in the otherwise volatile crypto market. With these financial giants moving into the space, they may appeal to both retail and institutional investors seeking safer, less volatile options. However, while stablecoins may offer short-term stability, the true innovation in blockchain lies within altcoins. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is revolutionizing digital wallet management with a user-friendly platform that supports multiple cryptocurrencies, cross-chain transfers, and top-tier security powered by Fireblocks MPC-CMP technology. Priced at $0.025075, $BEST raised over $12.6M during its presale, signaling strong investor confidence. As major financial institutions like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo explore stablecoin initiatives, the decentralized wallet and token space is gaining traction. If you staked $1,000 worth of $BEST today, at a 15% annual percentage yield (APY), you could accumulate additional tokens throughout the year. Token buyers also enjoy reduced transaction fees, early access to new projects, and benefits in Best Wallet's iGaming partnerships. As Best Wallet continues to disrupt the market with innovative features, $BEST offers significant long-term growth potential — making it one of the most promising altcoins to watch in 2025. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is transforming the creator economy by tokenizing real-world assets such as real estate and commodities, allowing people to buy, sell, and trade them as digital assets. People can also generate AI-driven photos and videos, which are approved by creators, creating new revenue streams. The project raised nearly $500K during its presale, and you can buy $SUBBD right now for $0.055475. As financial institutions explore stablecoin initiatives, the decentralized content and asset tokenization space is gaining significant momentum. With staking rewards offering 20% APY during the presale, $SUBBD provides an attractive opportunity for early investors. As the platform grows and blockchain adoption accelerates, $SUBBD is set to become a key player in both the crypto and creator economies. Think of it like a super-fast highway for blockchain, where developers can quickly deploy apps without getting stuck in traffic. One of $NEAR's coolest features is its sharding technology, called Nightshade. It splits the blockchain into smaller parts (called shards), allowing the network to process a lot more transactions at once. Instead of dealing with complicated crypto addresses, users get simple, human-readable account names. Currently priced at $2.81, $NEAR has been gaining momentum with over 1K projects already running on its network. It's quickly becoming one of the most reliable platforms in decentralized space. As traditional financial institutions like JPMorgan and Bank of America explore blockchain technology, $NEAR's scalability and developer-friendly approach make it a key player in the future of decentralized finance. As traditional financial institutions start exploring the crypto space, innovative altcoins like Best Wallet Token, SUBBD Token, and NEAR Protocol are leading the charge in decentralized finance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is facing scrutiny after speaking at a private event for top investors in his $TRUMP memecoin while standing behind a lectern emblazoned with the official presidential seal — a move that may violate federal law. According to US law, the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison. When asked about potential conflicts of interest, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president's involvement was personal. “It is not a White House dinner,” she told reporters. Forbes has previously reported its use as golf markers at several Trump-owned clubs. Under the emoluments clause, a US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress. Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin recently climbed above $111,000, marking a fresh all-time high and stirring new interest across the crypto space. After a small pullback, the focus is turning to altcoins, with several showing early signs of movement. This pattern has played out in past bull runs, and many traders now expect the same again. They are watching closely for any signs of capital rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins. Bitget Research Chief Analyst Ryan Lee told CoinDesk that the start of an altcoin run may depend on a drop in Bitcoin's market dominance. If that happens, it could open the door for coins like Solana and XRP to gain more ground. Similarly, eToro Australia analyst Reece Hobson told Decrypt that two conditions could set off an altcoin rally. First, he says more liquidity needs to flow into the system, likely through monetary easing. Some market watchers believe the signs of an altcoin season are already appearing. According to trader Carl Moon, Bitcoin's market share is already falling, which he says could mark the start of an altcoin breakout. Ash Crypto took a more cautious stance, encouraging traders to be patient. He noted that in past market cycles, altcoin rallies have typically been brief, lasting just four to five months. In the last cycle, major altcoin gains took place between January and May 2021. Based on those patterns, he believes another surge is likely—but timing it will require patience. Meanwhile, Mena Theodorou, co-founder of Coinstash, gave a more cautious view. This stage tends to keep focus and capital centered on Bitcoin, making it less likely for altcoins to see a strong, market-wide rally in the short term. Traders looking for clear signals are keeping a close eye on Bitcoin's market dominance. While some believe a drop would help altcoins, others suggest dominance might need to rise further before altcoin interest returns. This difference in view shows that even within the market, there's no single answer. While excitement is growing, the full rotation into altcoins hasn't happened yet. Traders and analysts alike are waiting to see what comes next, knowing that past cycles have always followed a similar path—first Bitcoin, then the rest. Now, all eyes are on whether that next step is just around the corner. Maximize your Cointribune experience with our "Read to Earn" program!

Biometric data has the potential to revolutionize health analytics and pharmacology by providing personalized insights into drug efficacy and health trajectories. However, its governance presents significant ethical challenges, particularly around individual ownership and privacy. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a sustainable and ethical framework that integrates biometric data with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). We developed a customized NFT framework with advanced smart contract functionalities that enhance privacy protection and decentralized authentication of biometric data ownership. This approach ensures the secure and ethical management of digital health data while reinforcing individuals' control over their biometric information. By leveraging cryptographic techniques for privacy protection, this framework enhances both the security and efficiency of personal health data management, offering a new perspective on ownership in digital health. Furthermore, a sustainable economic model is proposed to facilitate ethical transactions of tokenized biometric data within the NFT marketplace. The implications of this study extend beyond technology and commerce, offering valuable insights into human behavior in emerging digital economies and contributing to the creation of a more sustainable and equitable digital health ecosystem. The rapid evolution of technological innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), is reshaping numerous sectors at an unprecedented pace. These advancements critically depend on the availability and quality of data, following the principle that higher-quality data lead to more significant insights and outcomes. Among various data types, biometric data stand out for their depth and potential utility, ranging from daily health indicators to complex genomic profiles1. This vast array of data enables a sophisticated understanding of health and lifestyle patterns, enhancing predictive models for pharmacological interventions and physiological simulations conducted in silico2. However, the accumulation and management of such sensitive biometric data pose significant ethical and governance challenges, particularly regarding ownership rights, which are rarely conferred upon the data creators. This misalignment between data generation and proprietary rights raises serious concerns about privacy, control, and the equitable use of personal information3. Traditional methods—such as encryption4, secure hardware5, anonymization6, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)7—ensure privacy and security, but they primarily focus on access control rather than decentralized ownership or monetization. While ZKPs support privacy-preserving authentication, they are computationally intensive and lack data portability. Privacy-focused databases ensure regulatory compliance but depend on centralized trust, limiting user autonomy. In contrast, NFTs offer a decentralized framework enabling verifiable ownership, secure transactions, and traceability. When combined with advanced cryptographic methods, NFTs provide a scalable and privacy-enhancing solution for sensitive data management. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a transformative solution to these challenges. NFTs are unique digital tokens powered by blockchain technology, representing scarce digital assets with distinct value within a blockchain network. While previous studies have explored the integration of biometric data with NFTs2,8,9,10, they have primarily remained conceptual, focusing on theoretical discussions rather than practical implementation. In contrast, the objective of this study is to develop a secure and decentralized framework—Cell-NFT—for the ownership, management, and application of biometric data using NFT technology. Unlike previous research focused on domains like the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)11,12, the Cell-NFT framework introduces innovations specifically tailored for healthcare. These innovations include standardized data management, robust ownership mechanisms, and cryptographic privacy-enhancing techniques, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations in healthcare and biotechnology. Traditional database systems, while efficient at storing and retrieving data, rely on centralized control for access management and data integrity. This centralized approach introduces risks such as unauthorized modifications, lack of transparency, and dependence on intermediaries for trust. In contrast, blockchain technology offers a decentralized solution, where data integrity is cryptographically verifiable, and records are tamper-proof. By integrating these features, the Cell-NFT framework ensures that biometric data ownership and transactions are transparent, auditable, and resistant to manipulation. The metadata schema for Cell-NFTs is not a simple replication of traditional database functions but is designed to leverage blockchain's unique advantages in data security and provenance tracking. Unlike conventional databases, where data integrity depends on a central authority, blockchain-based metadata guarantees tamper-proof records, cryptographically verifiable ownership, and decentralized access control. This approach is particularly valuable in biomedical applications, where regulatory compliance, transparency, and auditability are essential. Traditional databases are vulnerable to unauthorized modifications and require extensive trust in intermediaries, whereas blockchain mitigates these risks by providing a transparent and immutable ledger of all recorded interactions. By incorporating these features, our approach offers significant improvements in data integrity, security, and long-term reliability compared to conventional storage solutions. Our research presents a pioneering methodology that integrates biometric data into NFTs to establish robust ownership records. By tokenizing biometric information, this framework preserves individual uniqueness and represents biological identity within the digital sphere, enabling secure certification of data ownership. Biometric NFTs contain comprehensive digital life data, enabling their governance and exchange across diverse digital platforms and marketplaces. The accompanying metadata schema is designed to boost both accessibility and practical use by streamlining data sharing and transactions, thereby enhancing management workflows and reinforcing the foundation of a secure and efficient digital health infrastructure. Tokenized biometric data have diverse applications, including use by hospitals and pharmaceutical companies. To address limitations in current NFT-based healthcare and biotechnology solutions, our framework employs a metadata schema and ecosystem designed to achieve enhanced data security, streamlined processes, and improved accessibility. This tokenization introduces societal benefits, such as improved data management security and the emergence of new industries centered on innovative digital assets. Issuance of NFTs using biometric data. (a) Types of biometric data derived from the human body. (b) Process of collecting cardiomyocytes from urine as biometric data. (c) Impact of NFTs created from the collected cardiomyocytes and their associated metadata. Biometric data can be generated from various human physiological functions, including facial recognition, cardiac and pulmonary metrics, and biological sample analysis (Fig. These data are crucial for understanding individual health, identity, and physiological function. A central aim of this research is to tokenize such biological information, with a particular focus on cardiomyocytes, given their central role in heart function. By tokenizing these cells, we enable virtual ownership of an individual's heart through NFTs. These NFTs encapsulate encrypted metadata on the blockchain, which includes key information such as genetic data, experimental details, and ownership records. In addition to cardiomyocytes, other types of biometric data—such as those derived from various cell types (Fig. The metadata from these cells can be utilized for identity authentication. For this study, cells were derived from noninvasive, easily collectible urine samples and subsequently dedifferentiated into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Fig. Notably, iPSCs can differentiate into various cell types, including osteocytes, neurons, and muscle cells. Given that NFTs can be produced in video format, dynamic representations of the cardiomyocytes—such as heartbeats—are provided as supplementary videos (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2), enhancing the personal connection to the tokenized data and their market value. Biological data can include unique identifiers such as cell-specific DNA and RNA sequences obtained from whole-genome sequencing (Supplementary Fig. Image data consist of captured cell images that are minted as NFTs. Within the Image and Experimental data, it is feasible to demonstrate the process of obtaining cells from an individual to establish ownership rights over the NFTs. Cell imaging serves a dual purpose: it is both scientifically valuable and aesthetically engaging. This dual function has been recognized by companies like GE Healthcare, which organizes cell imaging competitions, as well as by renowned academic institutions such as the University of Queensland, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Stanford. These institutions host contests to showcase beautiful cell images, further highlighting the appeal of cellular imagery. Such collections not only attract attention for their visual impact but also provide a rich dataset, capturing the interest of the scientific community eager to extract detailed biological and experimental information. Cardiomyocytes derived from urine samples are isolated through three critical steps, as illustrated in Fig. The first step involves isolating urine-derived cells (UDCs) from urine samples. These UDCs are then reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) through electroporation, a non-viral technique that avoids the risks of oncogene activation associated with viral reprogramming methods15 (Supplementary Fig. (a) Three steps for obtaining cardiomyocytes from urine. (c) Confocal image of cardiomyocytes stained with cardiac troponin T, alpha-actinin-2, and Hoechst 33,342 (scale bar: 20 μm). (d) Spontaneous contraction and expansion of cardiomyocytes, mimicking a natural heartbeat. Figure 2b illustrates a potential approach for acquiring comprehensive genetic information from UDCs using whole genome sequencing. This sequencing provides a detailed view of an individual's unique genetic code, aiding in identity authentication16. Furthermore, since lifestyle and environmental factors can impact genomic data over generations17, storing such diverse biometric data on the blockchain (as shown in Fig. Cardiomyocytes exhibit rhythmic contraction and expansion, mimicking the natural heartbeat at a rate of 60 beats/min (Fig. Integrating human life data into the metaverse marks a pioneering development, garnering significant interest from potential NFT participants. This integration serves two important purposes: it helps alleviate apprehensions individuals may have about the metaverse while also offering a unique, personal way to preserve and memorialize the biological data of loved ones in a virtual space. This token encapsulates extensive information, with its value being inherently linked to the intrinsic attributes and cell origin. 3a, these Cell-NFTs are available for acquisition in the contemporary metaverse marketplace using digital currencies such as Ethereum20. Ethereum utilizes the environmentally sustainable Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism21,22,23, which significantly reduces the energy consumption typically associated with mining. This eco-friendly approach offers substantial environmental benefits, particularly for large-scale applications. In contrast, Proof of Work (PoW) mining requires considerable electrical energy and computational resources for block creation and verification, resulting in enhanced security. Moreover, PoW's decentralized nature fosters a secure, independent network. As such, many blockchain platforms suitable for the creation of these added-value tokens will emerge, with the most effective methods likely evolving through collaboration with major projects like Bitcoin, Bitmobick, and Ethereum. Similar to conventional NFTs, each Cell-NFT is accompanied by a descriptive section that provides potential investors with a summary of the tokenized cell, thereby enhancing its appeal. 3b, metadata are categorized into three domains: “Biological data,” “Image data,” and “Experimental data.” The integration of these metadata categories is fundamental to the minting of each Cell-NFT. (b) Detailed breakdown of each metadata category. (c) URL of the minted Cell-NFT containing cardiomyocytes and its associated metadata. (d) Metadata schema for the Cell-NFT with cardiomyocytes. Once minted, Cell-NFTs are made available on OpenSea, a prominent NFT marketplace. These tokens hold value beyond marketplace transactions; they also have practical applications in sectors like healthcare and pharmaceuticals, depending on their intended purpose. URLs linking to these NFTs are displayed in Fig. Although OpenSea offers a public-facing platform, it ensures the privacy of metadata by concealing its detailed content. The metadata of a Cell-NFT comprise various types of cell-related information, organized within a structured schema as shown in Fig. This schema includes sections such as “name,” “description,” “image,” “donator,” “experimentation,” and “processing procedure,” each detailing specific aspects of the cell. Additionally, comprehensive metadata associated with the Cell-NFT can be accessed through the designated metadata URLs in Fig. The Cell-NFT ecosystem introduces a groundbreaking approach to the representation and transaction of cellular data, as illustrated in Fig. This ecosystem enables the value and ownership of biological data to be represented as NFTs. In this system, ownership of a Cell-NFT not only confers biological data but also confers tangible economic value, making the NFT tradable in various NFT marketplaces. 4a, when a cell donor wishes to tokenize their biological data, they request a Cell-NFT issuer to facilitate the creation of Cell Storage. The issuer, which can be an individual or institution, plays a critical role in validating the NFT prototype through consensus from a pool of trusted issuers. Upon issuance, Cell Storage provides a unique contract address to the Cell-NFT issuer and updates the donor's affiliated smart contract. If a buyer or researcher expresses interest in the cell's data, Cell Storage acts as an intermediary, alerting the donor to any incoming offers or bids (Fig. A real-world scenario from a researcher's perspective illustrates how Cell-NFTs can be minted, traded in marketplaces, and utilized in scientific experiments. This ecosystem ensures the donor retains control over the funds held in the Cell Storage, allowing them to manage withdrawals and deposits at their discretion. A key feature of the ecosystem is its flexibility for secondary market trading. After an initial purchase, the buyer or researcher can list the Cell-NFT on an open marketplace (Fig. 4d), allowing secondary buyers to participate in the transaction. In essence, the Cell-NFT ecosystem merges biotechnology with digital assets, offering a new paradigm for bio-data issuance, ownership, and exchange. Our exploration of the convergence between biometric data and blockchain technology, culminating in the creation of Cell-NFTs, represents a transformative step in the digitalization of biological assets. The Cell-NFT model offers an innovative solution by using blockchain to manage access permissions for biometric data, ensuring individual autonomy, transparent governance, and regulatory compliance. While previous research has primarily conceptualized the application of biometric data to NFTs2,8,9,10, our study provides actionable proposals for its implementation. We have developed an integrated NFT system that overcomes prior challenges related to data security, increased risks, cumbersome processes, and limited user engagement. Recent studies emphasize blockchain's potential in improving financial ecosystems and fostering societal trust through decentralized systems24. Building on these insights, the Cell-NFT framework not only advances biometric data management but also contributes to broader economic efficiency and blockchain innovation. This reinforces the social value of secure, self-sovereign digital identity solutions, particularly in healthcare. A key element in this transformation is the valuation of biometric data, which varies based on factors like rarity, sensitivity, and application. Establishing a robust valuation framework that accounts for data scarcity, its significance in healthcare, and its research potential is essential. Ensuring fair compensation for individuals while promoting ethical trading practices is crucial for fostering a sustainable and transparent Cell-NFT marketplace. The implications for medical diagnostics and therapeutics demand careful consideration of ethical and regulatory frameworks. As NFT adoption grows, legal standards continue to evolve, requiring ongoing compliance. Our framework does not facilitate the commercialization or unrestricted trading of biometric data but functions as a cryptographic mechanism for access control, ensuring individual ownership and autonomy. It enforces explicit, revocable consent while adhering to ethical guidelines that prioritize privacy and prevent unauthorized use. By design, the system prevents biometric data from being commodified, reinforcing responsible and compliant management. Recent studies highlight the cybersecurity concerns and legal complexities of blockchain regulations across jurisdictions25. These studies underscore the need for alignment with NIST and ISO standards to ensure compliance. The Cell-NFT framework strengthens trust, security, and legal compliance in biometric data management by aligning with global regulations. It enables individuals to maintain control over their data via NFTs while adhering to laws such as HIPAA26,27, GDPR28, and the Australian Privacy Act29. These regulations require explicit consent, breach reporting, and user rights to access, modify, or delete data. Ethical standards like the Australia's National Statement30 and global standards like the Declaration of Helsinki31 further emphasize informed consent, confidentiality, and responsible data handling. Ensuring ethical and legal compliance in NFT-based biometric data management is critical, especially in the context of data breaches, misuse, and privacy violations. Key risks include unauthorized access, data manipulation, and accidental loss, which can compromise privacy. The Cell-NFT framework mitigates these risks through encryption, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and real-time monitoring. Smart contracts enforce compliance, while automated audit trails and breach notification mechanisms ensure transparency and regulatory adherence (GDPR, HIPAA). These strategies collectively strengthen trust, security, and accountability in decentralized biometric data management. To safeguard ethical data usage further, we propose using smart contracts to enforce data usage conditions. These contracts would ensure secure, automated transactions and transfer ownership of Cell-NFTs only when ethical standards are met. By implementing these measures, biometric NFTs align with global privacy regulations, ethical standards, and emerging regulatory requirements for digital assets. Compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and local data protection laws is essential to responsibly manage biometric data. Trust in the Cell-NFT framework is reinforced through blockchain's immutable data storage, verifiable ownership via NFTs, and decentralized authentication via smart contracts. This trust is further bolstered by cryptographic security, decentralization, and blockchain transparency, which protect the integrity and confidentiality of biometric data. Market dynamics, including demand, supply chains, and secondary sales, will significantly impact the value and liquidity of Cell-NFTs. Pricing models will incorporate factors like data uniqueness, demand for health data, and research potential. Ensuring fair trade and robust market mechanisms will be essential for the widespread adoption of the system. A formal threat model has been developed to address risks such as data leakage, unauthorized access, smart contract vulnerabilities, and Sybil attacks. To mitigate these risks, the Cell-NFT framework employs encryption, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure data security and integrity. Ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Cell-NFT system requires continuous optimization, adaptive strategies, and efficient user management. A dynamic metadata structure supports regular updates, while a user-friendly interface with role-based access controls enhances both security and accessibility. To address scalability, our framework incorporates Layer 2 solutions like rollups and sidechains, improving transaction throughput while reducing gas fees and computational overhead. A hybrid storage model securely stores biometric data off-chain, recording only cryptographic proofs on-chain to minimize storage costs and enhance blockchain efficiency. Additionally, off-chain processing and decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Arweave) ensure data integrity, regulatory compliance, and tamper-proof record-keeping. These improvements collectively enhance performance, scalability, and cost-effective decentralized access control in an evolving technological landscape. While we acknowledge the limitation of not conducting direct experimental validation, this literature-driven comparative analysis provides a solid foundation for assessing the feasibility and potential impact of Cell-NFT. Traditional databases typically process transactions at approximately 500 TPS, while Cell-NFT, using Layer 2 scaling solutions, achieves 50 TPS while enhancing security. Centralized databases offer lower storage costs, whereas Cell-NFT mitigates high on-chain storage expenses by leveraging IPFS for off-chain data management. Furthermore, blockchain ensures immutable, decentralized security, whereas traditional databases rely on centralized administration, making them more susceptible to unauthorized modifications and security breaches. Future work will focus on metadata standardization and retrieval within the Cell-NFT framework. The JSON-based schema will ensure interoperability, adhering to RDF and DCAT standards. Cross-platform adoption will be facilitated through integration with RESTful APIs, OData protocols, and schema validation. Additionally, we plan to collaborate with healthcare institutions and industry partners to conduct pilot studies, evaluating the feasibility, security, and regulatory compliance of the Cell-NFT framework. These empirical investigations will bridge the gap between theoretical design and real-world implementation, ensuring scalability and adoption in secure data transactions. Urine samples were collected from individual donors in compliance with the ethical guidelines outlined in the 64 th World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all donors before sample collection. The participation was voluntary, and only self-reported healthy individuals were included as eligible donors. Each donor provided between 250 and 300 mL of urine, which was stored in sterilized laboratory tubes at −4 °C until further processing. Epithelial cells were isolated from urine samples as described previously13. To isolate UDCs, the primary medium (PM) was prepared by combining DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Welgene), REGMTM SingleQuotsTM supplements (Lonza), and 100 µg/mL Primocin® (InvivoGen). The RE medium consisted of REGMTM basal medium (Lonza), 10% FBS (Welgene), REGMTM SingleQuotsTM supplements (Lonza), and 100 µg/mL Primocin® (InvivoGen), while the MC medium contained DMEM high glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10% FBS (Welgene), 1X MEM GlutaMaxTM (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 µg/mL Primocin® (InvivoGen), 5 ng/mL Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF, Peprotech), 5 ng/mL Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF)-AB (Peprotech), and 5 ng/mL Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF, Peprotech). A 12-well plate was coated with either Matrigel or 0.1% gelatin solution for over an hour to facilitate cell adherence before urine collection. The sample was washed with the washing buffer, followed by a second centrifugation and washing step. After aspirating the supernatant, the resulting pellet was resuspended in 3 mL of primary medium containing 10 µM ROCK inhibitor and transferred to a single well of a 12-well plate, where the cells were incubated at 37 °C (day 0). On days 2 and 3, 1 mL of primary medium was added to the well each day. On day 4, most of the medium was aspirated, leaving 1 mL, to which 1 mL of REMC medium was added. From day 4 onward, 1 mL of the existing medium was removed and replaced daily with 1 mL of fresh REMC medium. Upon observing cell colony formation around day 9, the medium was replaced with fresh REMC medium. Upon reaching 70% confluency, the cells were detached using 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA and subcultured onto a new plate coated with Matrigel or 0.1% gelatin. UDCs were reprogrammed to iPSCs as previously described13. The electroporation medium (EM) was prepared using DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS (Welgene). To enhance the viability of iPSCs during reprogramming, a ROCK inhibitor (Cayman) was included. The Yamanaka factors pCXLE-hOCT3/4-shp53-F, pCXLE-hSK, and pCXLE-hUL (all from Addgene) were utilized to reprogram UDCs into iPSCs. Before reprogramming, either Matrigel or 0.1% gelatin solution was applied to a 35 mm dish for over an hour. The Yamanaka factors (hOCT3/4, hSK, and hUL) were prepared at a concentration of 1 µg/µL. The UDCs were detached using 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA, followed by centrifugation at 300 ×g for 3 min. After aspirating the supernatant, the cells were counted for electroporation, with 6 × 105 cells required per 100 µL tip. The cells were then resuspended in 100 µL R buffer for electroporation. After electroporation, the cells were transferred to a 35 mm dish containing EM (day 0), and the cultures were maintained in E8 medium with daily medium changes. After 14 days, cell morphology transitioned from elongated to rounded, indicating the formation of iPSCs. The areas with rounded morphology were isolated by mechanical passaging, and a ROCK inhibitor was added to the E8 medium to ensure stable passaging. Stable iPSC lines were established after several rounds of mechanical passaging. Cardiomyocyte differentiation from iPSCs was carried out as described previously14. To differentiate iPSCs into cardiomyocytes, RPMI Media (Gibco) and B-27 Supplements, both with and without insulin (Gibco), were used to prepare the cardiomyocyte differentiation media. Insulin is known to inhibit cardiac differentiation during the initial five days of iPSC differentiation14. Consequently, RPMI media supplemented with insulin-free B-27 was used up to day 5, after which the medium was switched to RPMI with B-27 containing insulin. To promote differentiation into the mesodermal lineage, a GSK3 inhibitor, CHIR 99021 (Sigma Aldrich), and a Wnt ligand production inhibitor, IWP (Sigma Aldrich), were added to the media. For single-cell dissociation of iPSCs, Accutase (Sigma Aldrich) was employed. Before seeding, iPSCs were coated on a 12-well plate with either Matrigel or a 0.1% gelatin solution for 1 h to enhance cell adherence. The iPSCs were then dissociated into single cells using Accutase for 8 min at 37 °C. The dissociated cells were collected and centrifuged at 200 ×g for 3 min. Approximately 0.5–1.5 × 106 cells per well were seeded into the 12-well plate with E8 media containing ROCK inhibitor (day 4). On day 0, the medium was aspirated and replaced with RPMI containing insulin-free B-27 and 12 µM CHIR 99,021. On day 1, the media were changed to RPMI with insulin-free B-27. On day 3, 1 mL of RPMI with insulin-free B-27 and 5 µM IWP2 was added to the medium. The media were then replaced on day 5 with RPMI containing insulin-free B-27, and on day 7, the medium was switched to RPMI with B-27 containing insulin. From this point onward, media changes were performed every 3 days using RPMI with insulin-containing B-27 (Supplementary Fig. Successful differentiation was confirmed by observing cardiomyocyte beating, a hallmark of cardiac differentiation, as shown in Supplementary videos 1 and 2. For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). They were then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min, followed by a PBS wash. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, the cells were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T). The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-cTNT (Santa Cruz) and anti-ACTN2 (ABclonal) primary antibodies. After incubation, the cells were washed with PBS-T, and Alexa Fluor 488- and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were applied at 20 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed again with PBS-T, followed by incubation with 1 µg/mL Hoechst 33,342 in PBS for 1 h, and a final wash with PBS. Fluorescence was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) (Supplementary Figs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has fallen last month briefly over geopolitical uncertainties following Trump's tariff-induced assault on many countries, triggering fears of a global economic turmoil. However, with some of those concerns reducing, after events like the US signing a trade deal with China, the digital currency has been gaining momentum. The GENIUS Act played a further role in its upward surge. While the bill has received support from some Democrat members because of which it moves forward in the US Senate, there are growing concerns that US President Donald Trump — once a crypto sceptic — and some of his supporters from the crypto and tech industry could personally benefit from it. Trump and his wife Melania have issued their own meme coins and have an active interest in the crypto market going up. At its core, the GENIUS Act focuses on regulating stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to more predictable assets like the US dollar. Among others, it also allows big tech companies to issue stablecoins, in what is being seen as a big win for many of Trump's supporters from the industry, who threw their weight behind him in the run-up to the Presidential bid and have continued their support to him since his reelection. The bill says that issuers must comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorism regulations, as well as privacy requirements under existing banking laws. It requires that crypto issuers must fully back stablecoins with fiat currency or high-quality liquid assets at a 1:1 ratio. If American lawmakers don't shape it, others will – and not in ways that serve our interests or democratic values. Innovation in this space is happening, with or without us. As per a fact sheet released by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Ranking Member of the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, said, “A strong bill would ensure that consumers enjoy the same consumer protections when using stablecoins as they do when using other payment systems, close loopholes that enable the illicit use of stablecoins by cartels, terrorists, and criminals, and reduce the risk that stablecoins take down our financial system. There are also concerns around potential conflict of interest for US President Donald and his growing cryptocurrency firm, could inappropriately benefit from crypto. “This bill provides even more opportunities to reward buyers of Trump's coins with favors like tariff exemptions, pardons and government appointments,” Warren said in a speech ahead of the vote. Another concern in the legislation is that it allows big tech companies to issue stablecoins. Companies like Meta had previously tried to make an unsuccessful foray into the crypto industry. As per the New York Times, some changes have been made to the bill to assuage concerns around the involvement of tech companies, requiring that they seek approval from a regulatory committee before issuing their own stablecoins. While that appeared to assuage concerns of some Democrat members, not everyone was on board. “Despite new language on this issue, the final bill fails to prohibit Big Tech companies from issuing stablecoins. While the bill purports to place restrictions on some Big Tech companies' ability to issue stablecoins, those restrictions are riddled with straightforward and easily identifiable loopholes,” Warren said in her fact sheet. He once also tailed a food delivery worker for over 12 hours to quantify the amount of money they make, and the pain they go through while doing so. In his free time, he likes to nerd about watches, Formula 1 and football. Harvard filed a lawsuit, prompting the judge's swift intervention.</p>

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is establishing itself as a key player in the global cryptocurrency economy and setting trends rather than following them in the digital currency space, Pakistan Crypto Council's (PCC) Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib said on Friday.

Mr Saqib told a private news channel that the country is gaining recognition from international tech companies and investors for its  growing potential in digital and crypto finance

“For the first time, we are not standing behind the world but we are establishing our own trend in the digital currency landscape,” CEO said. He added, “Global tech leaders and companies are now looking toward Pakistan to explore its crypto potential.”

Mr Saqib emphasised the enthusiasm of Pakistani youth for crypto adoption, suggesting the nation could spearhead digital finance in the region. “Pakistan has the potential to become a regional leader in digital finance, exporting innovation and becoming an epicentre for emerging markets,” he said.

He also pointed to the creation of Pakistan's Digital Assets Authority as a key  step towards “strong and smart regulation.”

The objective, Mr Saqib explained, “is to ensure that global-level companies can now be built in Pakistan, not just in the U.S. or Europe.”

PCC chief stressed the importance of empowering Pakistani freelancers and tech followers to become entrepreneurs. “Pakistan is progressing in this space faster than  neighbouring countries,” he said, asserting that “the world is  recognising our place in the digital economy.”
