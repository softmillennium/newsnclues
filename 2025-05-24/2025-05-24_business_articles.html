                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump touted his administration's changes to the military during a commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point on Saturday that at times resembled a campaign-style speech. "You are the first West Point graduates of the golden age of America," Trump, wearing his trademark red, 'Make America Great Again' hat, said to the graduating class. "This is the golden age, and you are going to lead the army to summits of greatness that has never reached before," he added. During remarks that spanned almost an hour, Trump promoted an "America First" worldview and he touted the strength of the U.S. military, which he claimed credit for bolstering. His remarks mixed elements of a traditional graduation speech, such as advice to the students, with aspects reminiscent of his 2024 campaign speeches, including criticisms of his predecessors. Trump also used the remarks to highlight his administration's achievements. "A big part of that job is to be respected again, and you are, as of right now, respected more than any army anywhere in the world," he continued. He accused past administrations of sending some U.S. soldiers "on nation building crusades to nations that wanted nothing to do with us." Trump's remarks come as his administration has zeroed in on military academies as part of its broader crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs (DEI) across the country. He praised those efforts during his address. "We've liberated our troops from divisive and demeaning political trainings," Trump said. West Point eliminated a number of cultural clubs, such as the Asian-Pacific Forum Club, the Japanese Forum Club and the Latin Cultural Club, following Trump's executive order removing DEI programs from the military, NBC News reported. The Pentagon has also directed military academies, including West Point, to remove books that include mentions of racism or sexism from their libraries, according to the New York Times.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The veterinary epidemiologist was recruited by the U.S. Navy to take care of aging dolphins in 2001.Venn-Watson planned to research the dolphins to get a better understanding of infectious diseases, but "instead, very quickly pivoted to studying chronic diseases and diseases of aging," which she's done for more than 20 years, she told CNBC Make It in February.While dolphins in the wild typically live to around 20 years old, Navy dolphins were living much longer beyond the ages of 40 and 50, Venn-Watson says. Though some dolphins were developing conditions like chronic inflammation, high cholesterol and even changes in their brains similar to that of Alzheimer's, others were completely healthy in old age.After analyzing thousands of samples collected over the span of about 50 years, Venn-Watson and her team were able to determine what the healthiest aging dolphins had in common. "We thought it was going to be omega-3′s, because all they eat are fish. And instead, it was C15:0, a saturated fatty acid I had never heard of," she says.Venn-Watson and her team discovered a new essential fatty acid, C15:0, which like omega-3′s, can improve health outcomes in mammals. And additional research by experts outside of her team have supported this claim. Their discovery marks the "first essential fatty acid to be found in more than ninety years," a finding which earned Venn-Watson a spot on CNBC's 2025 Changemakers List earlier this year.With her husband, a Navy physician, Venn-Watson started Seraphina Therapeutics, and developed a C15:0 supplement for humans. She also published a book about her findings called "The Longevity Nutrient," in March. To up her intake of the longevity nutrient in her own diet, Venn-Watson eats certain foods that are high in C15:0. 1 food she eats to get more of the fatty acid. "Key ways I do that are through grass-fed cheeses that come from grass-fed animals; those have some of the highest C15:0 levels," she says. Often, it's her daily snack that helps her increase how much of the longevity nutrient she's getting: "I'll have a cheese snack almost every day." "We've also learned fiber has a lot of importance. So, classic cheese and crackers (high-fiber crackers, so not the ones that are chock full of processed carbs)," Venn-Watson says. "And pecorino, for example, has some of the highest nutritious content, including C15:0." I probably have fish every day and dairy fat," she says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bedeviled by leaks to the media during his short tenure, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a series of restrictions on the press late Friday that include banning reporters from entering wide swaths of the Pentagon without a government escort — areas where the press has had access in past administrations as it covers the activities of the world's most powerful military. Newly restricted areas include his office and those of his top aides and all of the different locations across the mammoth building where the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Space Force maintain press offices. The media will also be barred from offices of the Pentagon's senior military leadership, including Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, without Hegseth's approval and an escort from his aides. He said it was necessary for national security. "While the department remains committed to transparency, the department is equally obligated to protect (classified intelligence information) and sensitive information, the unauthorized disclosure of which could put the lives of U.S. service members in danger," wrote Hegseth. The Pentagon Press Association expressed skepticism that operational concerns were at play — and linked the move to previous actions by Hegseth's office that impede journalists and their coverage. "There is no way to sugarcoat it. Today's memo by Secretary Hegseth appears to be a direct attack on the freedom of the press and America's right to know what its military is doing," it said in a statement Friday night. Hegseth also said reporters will be required to sign a form to protect sensitive information and would be issued a new badge that more clearly identifies them as press. It was not clear whether signing the form would be a condition of continued access to the building. Two months ago, the department was embarrassed by a leak to The New York Times that billionaire Elon Musk was to get a briefing on the U.S. military's plans in case a war broke out with China. That briefing never took place, on President Donald Trump's orders, and Hegseth suspended two Pentagon officials as part of an investigation into how that news got out. Trump's former national security adviser, Mike Waltz, took responsibility for Goldberg being included and was shifted to another job. The administration has taken several aggressive actions toward the press since Trump took over, including FCC investigations into ABC, CBS and NBC News. Restrictions imposed on The Associated Press' access to certain White House events earlier this year led to a court battle that is ongoing. The White House has also increased access for conservative media that are friendly to the president. Nevertheless, a study released earlier this month found that Trump had more frequent exchanges with reporters during his first 100 days in office than any of his six predecessors. Hegseth, however, has been far less available. The Pentagon has taken other steps to make it more difficult for reporters, including taking office space away from eight media outlets, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and NBC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Online sports betting is legal in some states. Before participating, verify the legality in your specific state. My first month doing arbitrage betting, I made a little over $2,000. The process is pretty straightforward: I've opened accounts on about 12 different sportsbook platforms, like FanDuel and DraftKings, and I pay to subscribe to a service call OddsJam, which helps me find the best bets. On one sports betting platform, I bet $100 to win $150 that Alex Ovechkin would get over three and a half shots on goal. During the same game, on another betting site, I had the exact opposite bet, where I bet Alex would get under three and a half shots on goal. The chances were betting $130 to win $119, so my total payout would be $249. So, for both bets, I had a total wager of $230. But because one of the bets had to win and the other bet had to lose, my payout would either be $249 or $250, and I was guaranteed either $19 or $20 in profit, depending on the outcome. For the returns I'm getting, I needed initial capital of about $20,000 and maybe one to two hours per day. But anyone can really be profitable with this. Online arbitrage betting is legal, depending on the state you're in, but of course, the sportsbook sites don't really like it because they're losing money. Each platform has different terms of service, but when they catch you — and they will because they have algorithms dedicated to detecting these kinds of bets — your account will probably get restricted so you can't bet as much money. That means you'll have to play more often or bet on more games to see the same returns. If you're betting on very obscure sports that aren't usually bet on — like you're betting $2,000 that some cricket game in India is going to go a certain way — they're going to be able to figure out that you're probably arbitraging. So you can kind of mitigate the risk by not taking bets that are super obscure and just doing more main lines that are very, very common, which will help you remain undetected for a while. I would say you could probably last a week or two on average before the casinos catch on. I lasted around two weeks on most of my sports books, but there were a couple that got me within three or four days, so I wasn't able to be super profitable on them, but it was still fun in the first couple of days to take advantage of the bigger bets. You'd think it would probably be in the site's best interest to disband your account if you were just exploiting them and taking money from them. But, as arbitrage betters, we actually do provide a little bit of value to the sportsbook sites, because they can study an arbitrage player's activity for signals on where they can tighten up their odds. It's actually kind of like a value feedback loop where we provide a service — almost like consulting — and help them make sure that other players aren't taking advantage of them and getting bets at a better value than they should be, which allows them to stay more profitable over time, and in return, they allow us to use their platform to place these bets, knowing that we'll probably squeeze out a little bit of profit. I learned about arbitrage betting from my roommate, who has been doing it for years. He's been averaging between $30,000 and $40,000 a year with this side hustle and bought himself a Tesla with his winnings. I knew he was doing it, but I was always kind of skeptical of the time commitment that it would take, the amount of starting capital I would need, and the learning curve behind it, because it seemed kind of complex. It ended up being really, really easy once I put a little bit of time into it, and it wasn't overly complicated, so my roommate and I started a blog and social media channels to teach other people our strategy. One thing you have to keep in mind is taxes. Every state and player is different, but I know that I'll have to pay taxes of around 20% of my earnings. But even taking that money into account, it feels worthwhile. I'm assuming I'll be able to keep this going because my roommate's been doing it for years, and he's been able to remain profitable. I'm hoping that in the future, my winnings could serve as a down payment on a house, a wedding ring for my girlfriend, a new car, or just, you know, a fallback fund if things go really south and I lose my job or something like that especially with the economy the way it is. I have no idea exactly where I'll spend the money, but my plan is to save it and invest it wisely.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Saturday praised U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to boost U.S. technology as the leading chipmaker announced a partnership with a group of Swedish businesses to develop AI infrastructure in Sweden. Nvidia will provide its latest generation AI data center platform to a group of Swedish companies, including telecoms gear maker Ericsson and drug developer AstraZeneca. Nvidia has announced a number of similar partnerships in recent weeks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE after the Trump administration rescinded a rule put in place by former President Joe Biden that would have restricted exports of AI chips. Huang, who had earlier called controls "a failure," said Trump wanted U.S. firms to "win." "American technology companies were very successful in China four years ago, we have lost about 50% of the market share and competitors have grown," he said on Saturday in Norrkoping, where he was due to receive an honorary doctorate from Linkoping University. "The President would like American technology to win with Nvidia and American companies to sell chips all over the world and to generate revenues, tax revenues, invest and build in the United States," he said. The Trump administration has introduced sweeping tariffs, saying they would stimulate growth, bring home manufacturing jobs and raise tax revenues. Huang said many policies related to re-industrialization were "very visionary." "Manufacturing in the United States, securing our supply chain, having real resilience, redundancy and diversity in our manufacturing supply chain — all of that is excellent," he said.

House tax bill would gut the rooftop solar industry, executives warn.

Solar panels on the roofs of homes in Tucson, Arizona.

The troubled, $20 billion US residential solar market's future rests on whether Senate Republicans will challenge their brethren in the House of Representatives and change provisions of the massive tax and spending bill that executives and analysts alike say would devastate the industry.

The bill passed by the House this week would strip away tax credits for companies that lease rooftop solar systems as well as homeowners who buy them outright. The industry is already reeling from tariffs on imported equipment, high interest rates and reduced state incentives in California, the nation's biggest residential solar market. One major rooftop solar company — Sunnova Energy International Inc. — is laying the groundwork for a bankruptcy filing, and analyst Philip Shen at Roth Capital Partners warned the bill as written would effectively shut down the industry, starting next year. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google's phones, tablets, and, yes, XR glasses are all about to be supercharged by AI. Bank of America analysts this week even called Google's slew of new AI announcements a "Trojan horse" for its device business. For years, Apple's iOS and Google's Android have battled it out. The two have also gradually converged; iOS has become more customizable, while Android has become cleaner and easier to use. The company is reportedly trying to rebuild Siri entirely using large language models. During Google's I/O conference this week, the search giant bombarded us with new AI features. Perhaps the best example was a particularly grabby demo of Google's "Project Astra" assistant helping someone fix their bike by searching through the bike manual, pulling up a YouTube video, and calling a bike shop to see if certain supplies were in stock. "It has long been the case that the best way to bring products to the consumer market is via devices, and that seems truer than ever," wrote Ben Thompson, analyst and Stratechery author, in an I/O dispatch this week. "Android is probably going to be the most important canvas for shipping a lot of these capabilities," he added. Apple has done a good job of locking users into its ecosystem with iMessage blue bubbles, features like FaceTime, and peripherals like the Apple Watch that require an iPhone to use. Google's Pixel phone line, meanwhile, remains a rounding error when compared to global smartphone shipments. While iPhone users will get some of these new features through Google's iOS apps, it's clear that the "universal assistant" the company is building will only see its full potential on Android. Perhaps this could finally get iOS users to make the switch. "We're seeing diminishing returns on a hardware upgrade cycle, which means we're now really focused on the software upgrade cycle," Bernstein senior analyst Mark Shmulik told Business Insider. Without major changes by Apple, Shmulik said he sees the gap in capabilities between Android and iOS only widening. "If it widens to the point where someone with an iPhone says, 'Well my phone can't do that,' does it finally cause that switching event from what everyone has always considered this incredible lock-in from Apple?" Internally, Google has been preparing for this moment. "We are going to be very fast-moving to not miss this opportunity," Google's Android chief Sameer Samat told BI at last year's I/O. "It's a once-in-a-generation moment to reinvent what phones can do. A year on, Google appears to be doing just that. Much of what the company demoed this week is either rolling out to devices imminently or in the coming weeks. Google still faces the challenge that its relationships with partners like Samsung have come with the express promise that Google won't give its home-grown devices preferential treatment. So, if Google decides to double down on its Pixel phones at the expense of its partners, it could step into a business land mine. Of course, Google needs to think about more than smartphones. Google this week demoed glasses that have a visual overlay to instantly provide information to wearers, which Meta's glasses lack and Apple's first version will reportedly also not have. The success of Meta's glasses so far is no doubt encouraging news for Google, as a new era of AI devices is ushered in. "I don't know about an open goal," said Shmulik of Apple, "but it does feel like they've earned themselves a penalty kick." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Smead was driving around Northern Alabama on Thursday, pitching potential clients on why it's an optimal time to buy into his Smead Value Fund (SMVLX). He knows it may not be an easy sell. His energy and homebuilder holdings have gotten hammered recently, and the fund has had a rough 12 months. Since May last year, it's down 11% while the S&P 500 has risen 10%. Every investment discipline has its hard times, and it's during those periods when investors make money. That's why Smead is warning against investing in the S&P 500, which remains just below its all-time highs. "Even though the index has been a really good idea from 1981 to now in a rising market, every investment discipline goes through cold stretches," Smead said. "The longer it goes on making people rich, the more likely it is for a catch-up period." One would probably expect Smead, a value manager, to question the merits of investing in a growth-led index like the S&P 500. But he has the long-term track record to lend him credibility — over the last 15 years, he's beaten 94% of similar funds, according to Morningstar data. In 2021, Smead crushed the market by returning 40% by betting heavily on unloved economic reopening stocks and ignoring pandemic darling tech stocks. According to a March report from Invesco, from 1983 to 2015, the Shiller CAPE ratio has explained 78% of the S&P 500's forward 10-year returns. That shows that a FOMO attitude is driving the market, she said, and prices are surging at a pace well ahead of earnings growth. Steve Sosnick, the chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said in a client note on Thursday that we've seen "one of the most powerful momentum surges that I can remember" in the weeks since Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs were paused. But market conditions have more or less been momentum-driven since the Great Recession stock-market bottom in 2009, Smead said. Eventually, he warns, things will turn in the other direction. "This is the most difficult market of my 45 years." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia launched dozens of drones and ballistic missiles at Kyiv overnight in one of the biggest combined aerial attacks on the Ukrainian capital of the three-year war, damaging several apartment buildings and injuring 15 people. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a social media post it had been a "tough night" for Ukraine, and called for new international sanctions to pressure Moscow into agreeing to a ceasefire. In the early hours of the morning, Reuters witnesses saw and heard successive waves of drones flying over Kyiv, and a series of explosions jolted the city. Pictures from Reuters photographers showed an orange-red glow lighting up the city as plumes of smoke blew across the horizon. On the top floor of one apartment building, smoke and flames billowed out of a balcony window as firefighters tried to approach. By daybreak, government officials reported damage in six districts of the Ukrainian capital, and a total so far of 15 people wounded. The attacks come as U.S. President Donald Trump is encouraging Russia and Ukraine to sit down for ceasefire talks to end the war, but has pushed back against a European plan to impose new sanctions on Russia. She fled to a bomb shelter at a nearby school, then at daylight returned to inspect the damage. All the windows of her apartment were smashed, and the floor was covered in fragments of glass. "I'd like Trump to see this," she said, standing in her kitchen. Can he really not see this? ...It's the destruction of a people, they are just destroying us," she said, referring to the Russian military. In the street below her third-floor windows, trees had been splintered by the blast and car windows were smashed. Municipal workers were using a mini-excavator to clear up debris from the ground. Ukraine's air force said that Russia had fired 14 ballistic missiles at targets across Ukraine overnight and launched 250 long-range drones, with Kyiv the main target. The strikes followed several days of Ukrainian drone strikes — some 800 attacks — on targets inside Russia, including the capital Moscow. Hours before the drones and missiles reached Kyiv, Russia and Ukraine had exchanged several hundred prisoners, in a move that Trump suggested could be a prelude to progress on peace talks. Russian negotiators said they were preparing a memorandum that would serve as the starting point for the next round of peace talks. No date or venue has been agreed. "Russia still has not sent its 'peace memorandum.' Instead, it is sending deadly drones and missiles at civilians," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote in a post on the Telegram social media platform. "Only additional sanctions against key sectors of the Russian economy will force Moscow to agree to a ceasefire." There was no immediate comment from Russia on the overnight attacks. But it says Kyiv needs to accept the reality that Russia controls part of its territory, and it must not be used as a bridgehead for Western states to threaten Russia. On Saturday, Russia's Defence Ministry said its troops had captured the settlements of Stupochki, Otradne and Loknia in Ukraine's Donetsk and Sumy regions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aerobavovna, which was founded in 2023, is supplying Ukraine's military with tethered, helium-filled balloons equipped with airborne radio repeaters, extending the range and effectiveness of the country's drones. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has been defined by drone warfare, but drone operators have faced a number of challenges, including line-of-sight obstacles, which can cause drones to lose contact if radio signals are disrupted, and electronic warfare systems, which can jam communications. The company's aerostats are designed for surveillance, communication, and first-person-view (FPV) drone signal transmission, and help establish stable communication signals in the battlefield's tricky conditions. Fitted with antennas and radio repeaters, Aerobavovna's aerostats anchor high over the battlefield to help Ukrainian drones continue operating in spite of obstacles and to maintain comms over much greater distances. "For ground drones, it's crucial because their ground-to-ground signal would only reach the first hill; beyond that, you lose direct line of sight and, consequently, the connection," he said, adding that about 50 balloons were deployed "all around the front line" in Ukraine. While aerostats aren't new technology, Aerobavovna's products have been designed to meet the demands of the modern battlefield, allowing for rapid deployment times. Aerobavovna's balloons, which the firm says can be deployed in five to 25 minutes, are made with lightweight polymers and can remain airborne for up to seven days. They can lift repeater systems up to a height of 1 km (about 0.6 miles) and carry a payload of up to 25 kg (around 55 lbs), the company said. The company, which says it produces around 10 to 20 balloons per month, recently announced that it had developed a new aerostat capable of carrying more advanced equipment. In an interview with the Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi, engineers from Aerobavovna said they had created a new model that can hold a payload of up to 66 lbs, enabling it to carry more powerful equipment such as electronic warfare systems. While the company has found success supplying tethered aerostats to the Ukrainian military, it continues to grapple with technical and structural hurdles as it scales. One persistent challenge is maintaining stability and precision in airborne conditions, especially critical for payloads like FPV drone radio repeaters, which require highly accurate antenna positioning. Despite strong demand and a battlefield-proven product, capital is scarce for Ukrainian hardware startups. Vysoven said the company has received investment offers in the range of $40 million, but considers that far below what's needed and called that figure "a shame."</p>
