                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The life science group Sartorius launches the new Octet® R8e biolayer interferometry (BLI) system, providing researchers with its most advanced detection capabilities to date for real-time, high-throughput analysis of protein-protein, protein-small molecule, and other biomolecular interactions. Leveraging Sartorius' proprietary BLI technology for fast, real-time, and label-free kinetic characterization of binding interactions, the Octet® R8e provides next-level sensitivity for accurate data generation at the lowest detection limits, expanding analyte range to low-molecular weight (> 100 Da) and low-abundance (>10 pM) analytes. Compatibility with 96- and 384-well plate formats offer additional flexibility in assay design, allowing customization to each study's unique scale, complexity, and cost requirements. "The combination of high sensitivity and the ability to reduce sample size to 40 μL with our custom 384-well microplates gives researchers maximum freedom and significant cost efficiencies, without sacrificing data quality." Sample integrity is a common challenge in BLI assays when long-term kinetic measurements are required to observe slow binding interactions or dissociations. A new evaporation cover created for the Octet® R8e system minimizes sample evaporation from 96-well microplates, maintaining sample concentrations for up to 16 hours. This ensures accuracy over extended assay durations, allowing for greater data collection capabilities without manual intervention. "The advanced evaporation protection is a game changer, supported by data showing excellent reproducibility between replicates over 16-hour experiments. "Together with its best-in-class performance, the R8e provides scientists with a powerful and streamlined alternative to SPR-based platforms, backed by a brand trusted worldwide as the genuine BLI technology." Octet® BLI systems have a large global install-base in regulated environments across pharma, biotech, and CRO organizations, with successful use in numerous investigational new drug applications. Empowering scientists with quality data, flexibility, and a user-friendly design, the Octet® R8e system is designed to accelerate biopharmaceutical research at every stage—from drug discovery to development, bioprocessing, and quality control—while equipping labs for future applications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Aging (Aging-US) Volume 17, Issue 4, on April 1, 2025, titled "Examining frailty phenotypes of community-dwelling older adults in Taiwan using the falls risk for older people in the community – Taiwan version (Tw-FROP-Com)." A research team led by first author Ya-Mei Tzeng and corresponding authors Yu-Tien Chang and Yaw-Wen Chang from the National Defense Medical Center studied older adults in Taiwan and found that unintentional weight loss is the most significant individual predictor of fall risk among the common signs of frailty. This finding highlights the importance of early detection and tailored interventions to reduce fall-related injuries among aging populations. In Taiwan, they rank as the second leading cause of accidental death among those aged 65 and older. The researchers evaluated five signs of frailty-weakness, slowness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and unintentional weight loss-using a locally adapted fall risk screening tool, Tw-FROP-Com. Of these, 18.7% were classified as frail, and nearly one-third had experienced a fall in the past year. All five frailty signs were associated with increased fall risk, but statistical analysis showed that unintentional weight loss had the strongest association, even after adjusting for factors like age and previous falls. Rather than relying on a broad frailty label, this study found that analyzing each frailty feature individually provided more accurate predictions of fall risk. Weight loss, in particular, was also associated with conditions such as malnutrition, muscle decline, or chronic illness. "Treating frailty as five distinct components provided a more precise prediction of fall risk than using a dichotomous frailty measure (Yes/No)." Because it does not require complex equipment or physical testing, it can be widely applied to identify older adults at risk. Interventions such as nutritional support, physical activity, and weight monitoring can then be offered before a fall occurs. The researchers recommend that public health programs and healthcare providers focus on each specific frailty sign, especially unintentional weight loss, rather than relying only on overall frailty status. As the global population ages, targeted fall prevention strategies like these may help older adults live healthier, more independent lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A case in which a sperm donor was later found to be carrying a cancer-causing pathogenic variant in his gametes has highlighted the problems of regulating gamete donation at European and international level, the annual conference of the European Society of Human Genetics will hear today (Saturday). Dr Edwige Kasper, a specialist in genetic predisposition to cancer at the Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France, will say that the lack of cross-border regulation in Europe can result in the multiple use of gametes in families and risks inbreeding and the abnormal dissemination of inherited diseases. TP53 provides instructions for making a tumour suppressor protein, keeping cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. The letter said that the donor was in good health, but that his biological children could be at risk of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare inherited disorder that predisposes to the development of cancers. Some of these children had already developed leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and this led to any use of the donor's gametes being definitively blocked. After discussion with French networks, the researchers presented these cases at a meeting of the European Reference Network on genetic tumour risk syndromes (GENTURIS) in 2024. Simultaneously, a number of Genetics and Paediatric Departments across Europe were investigating their own cases, leading to 67 children from 46 families in eight European countries being tested, with the variant being found in 23 of them and cancer found in ten to date. Alterations in the TP53 gene cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, one of the most severe inherited predispositions to cancer that is characterised by a broad spectrum of tumours at an early age. This is heavy and stressful for carriers, but we have seen its effectiveness in that it has enabled early detection of tumours and thus improved patients' chances of survival," says Dr Kasper. "Because animal models of Li-Fraumeni syndrome have shown that exposure to genotoxic chemotherapy or X-rays accelerated tumour development, these children should avoid radiation-based imaging techniques such as mammography and PET scans, if possible." "Although the variant would have been practically undetectable in 2008 when the individual started to donate sperm, there are many things that could have been and still need to be improved," says Dr Kasper. Currently, laws on sperm donation differ from one European country to another. Private sperm banks usually limit donation from one donor to 75 countries worldwide. The law in France sets a limit of ten births per donor. "My advice to French parents would be to favour a medically assisted procreation procedure in France, where donation is voluntary, anonymous, and free. While donor examinations are routinely conducted in many countries, in France, gamete donation is medically supervised for both donors and recipients. Importantly, any suspicion of a genetic disorder must be promptly reported and investigated. Above all, each donor is limited to a maximum of ten births across the country, and the import or export of gametes may only be requested by an approved centre and is subject to authorisation from the Agence de la Biomédecine. "The fact that the case in point is very rare does not mean that it will not reoccur, and gonadal mosaicism – where one or more groups of cells possess a different genetic makeup - has previously been reported in a sperm donor with reference to neurofibromatosis type 1. Chair of the conference Professor Alexandre Reymond said: "While current legislation on assisted reproduction usually does not cross borders, this is a good example of why wider oversight is needed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A breakthrough study, led by scientists at Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland, has uncovered how daylight can boost the immune system's ability to fight infections. The team focused on the most abundant immune cells in our bodies, called 'neutrophils', which are a type of white blood cell. These cells move quickly to the site of an infection and kill invading bacteria. The researchers used zebrafish, a small freshwater fish, as a model organism, because its genetic make-up is similar to ours and they can be bred to have transparent bodies, making it easy to observe biological processes in real time. "In earlier studies, we had observed that immune responses peaked in the morning, during the fish's early active phase," says lead researcher Associate Professor Christopher Hall, from the Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology. "We think this represents an evolutionary response such that during daylight hours the host is more active so more likely to encounter bacterial infections," says Hall. With this new study, published in Science Immunology, and led by two doctoral researchers, neutrophils were found to possess a circadian clock that alerted them to daytime, and boosted their ability to kill bacteria. Most of our cells have circadian clocks to tell them what time of day it is in the outside world, in order to regulate the body's activities. Light has the biggest influence on resetting these circadian clocks. Given that neutrophils are the first immune cells to be recruited to sites of inflammation, our discovery has very broad implications for therapeutic benefit in many inflammatory diseases. This finding paves the way for development of drugs that target the circadian clock in neutrophils to boost their ability to fight infections." Current research is now focussed on understanding the specific mechanisms by which light influences the neutrophil circadian clock. A light-regulated circadian timer optimizes neutrophil bactericidal activity to boost daytime immunity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel's intensified military operations continue to threaten an already weakened health system, amidst worsening mass population displacement and acute shortages of food, water, medical supplies, fuel and shelter. Only 19 of Gaza Strip's 36 hospitals remain operational, including one hospital providing basic care for the remaining patients still inside the hospital, and are struggling under severe supply shortages, lack of health workers, persistent insecurity, and a surge of casualties, all while staff work in impossible conditions. Of the 19 hospitals, 12 provide a variety of health services, while the rest are only able to provide basic emergency care. At least 94% of all hospitals in the Gaza Strip are damaged or destroyed. The increased hostilities and new evacuation orders issued across northern and southern Gaza in the past two days threaten to push even more health facilities out of service. North Gaza has been stripped of nearly all health care. Al-Awda Hospital is only minimally functional, serving as a trauma stabilization point. It faces an imminent risk of closure due to ongoing insecurity and restricted access. The hospital's third floor was reportedly attacked on Wednesday, injuring a staff member. The third and fourth floors were reportedly hit, injuring two health workers. Patient triage tents, including one provided by WHO, caught fire, which also burned all medical supplies in the warehouse and destroyed vehicles in the basement. A WHO mission attempting to reach the hospital today was impeded. The Indonesian Hospital is out of service due to continued military presence since 18 May, making it inaccessible. WHO team had planned to deliver food and water to patients, assess their conditions, and identify critical equipment for transfer. Kamal Adwan Hospital, which had the only centre to treat patients with severe acute malnutrition in North Gaza, went out of service on 20 May after intense hostilities in its vicinity, forcing patients to evacuate or be discharged prematurely. In southern Gaza, Nasser Medical Complex, Al-Amal, and Al-Aqsa hospitals are overwhelmed by a surge of injured people, worsened by a new wave of displacement to Deir al Balah and Khan Younis. The European Gaza Hospital remains out of service following an attack on 13 May, cutting off vital services including neurosurgery, cardiac care, and cancer treatment – all unavailable elsewhere in Gaza. Currently, across the Gaza Strip, only 2000 hospital beds remain available, for a population of over 2 million people, grossly insufficient to meet the current needs. Of these, at least 40 beds are at risk of being lost as they are in hospitals within newly declared evacuation zones, while an additional 850 could be lost if conditions deteriorate at facilities near these zones. With each hospital forced out of service, patients lose access to health care, and WHO and partners' efforts, to sustain Gaza's health system are undone. Amid constant fear and insecurity, health workers, including those from national and international emergency medical teams, continue delivering urgent care in Gaza. WHO calls for the active protection of health care. WHO calls for aid at scale to be allowed into Gaza through all possible routes, and for unimpeded humanitarian access to reach people wherever they are. Echoing the United Nations' Relief Chief, WHO reiterates that the UN and its partners have a clear, principled and effective plan to deliver aid with safeguards against diversion, a system that has worked and must be enabled to continue.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A noted expert on health policy issues, Julie is the author of the critically praised reference book "Health Care Politics and Policy A to Z," now in its third edition. Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. released a report from his commission to "Make America Healthy Again" that described threats to the health of the American public — but notably included nothing on threats from tobacco, gun violence, or a lack of health insurance. Also this week, Rovner interviews University of California-Davis School of Law professor and abortion historian Mary Ziegler about her new book on the past and future of the "personhood" movement aimed at granting legal rights to fetuses and embryos. Plus, for "extra credit," the panelists suggest health policy stories they read this week they think you should read, too: Julie Rovner: The Washington Post's "White House Officials Wanted To Put Federal Workers 'in Trauma.' It's Working," by William Wan and Hannah Natanson. Anna Edney: Bloomberg News' "The Potential Cancer, Health Risks Lurking in One Popular OTC Drug," by Anna Edney. Sarah Karlin-Smith: The Farmingdale Observer's "Scientists Have Been Studying Remote Work for Four Years and Have Reached a Very Clear Conclusion: 'Working From Home Makes Us Happier,'" by Bob Rubila.
