            Eighteen people were injured, four critically, in a knife attack Friday in the German city of Hamburg, authorities said.
    


            Hamburg police said they have arrested a 39-year-old German woman, who they believe acted alone in carrying out the attack at the city's Central Station, after a major police operation. She is in police custody and expected to be brought to a court on Saturday, police said.
    


            Seven people were “badly injured,” while seven others were “lightly injured,” police said. The victims are aged between 19 and 85 years old.
    


            The four critically injured, who include a 24-year-old female, 24-year-old male, 52-year-old female and 85-year-old female, are in a stabilized condition, police said in an update on Saturday.
    


            Investigations into the incident are ongoing. Police said there was “concrete” evidence that the suspect suffers from a mental illness.
    


            In a statement late on Friday, Hamburg police said the attacker had acted “apparently indiscriminately, stabbed passersby, injuring some of them critically.”

            Following the attack, Germany's Friedrich Merz thanked the city's emergency responders for their assistance and said that his “thoughts are with the victims and their families,” according to federal government spokesperson Stefan Kornelius.
    


            Federal Minister of the Interior Alexander Dobrindt also said his thoughts were with the victims and thanked the emergency services. “It is shocking when travelers are attacked in a treacherous and cowardly manner,” Dobrindt said.

            Infection-causing fungi responsible for millions of deaths a year will spread significantly to new regions as the planet heats up, new research predicts — and the world is not prepared.  



            Fungi are absolutely everywhere. A vast kingdom of organisms, from mold to mushrooms, they grow in environments such as soil, compost and water. They play an important role in ecosystems but can have a devastating impact on human health: Fungal infections kill an estimated 2.5 million people a year, and a lack of data means that number could be far higher.
    


            Yet we are still very far from understanding them, especially how these incredibly adaptable organisms will respond to a warming climate.
    


            A team of scientists from Manchester University used computer simulations and forecasts to map the potential future spread of Aspergillus, a common group of fungi found all over the world that can cause aspergillosis, a life-threatening disease primarily affecting the lungs.
    


            They found certain Aspergillus species will expand their range as the climate crisis intensifies, pushing into new parts of North America, Europe, China and Russia. The study, published this month, is currently being peer reviewed.
    


            “Fungi are relatively under-researched compared to viruses and parasites, but these maps show that fungal pathogens will likely impact most areas of the world in the future,” said Norman van Rijn, one of the study's authors and a climate change and infectious diseases researcher at the University of Manchester.
    


            The field has seen new attention thanks to the popular HBO television drama “The Last of Us,” which follows people trying to survive in a world where an infectious mutant fungus has turned most of the population into violent monsters. (HBO and CNN share the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)
    


            It's fiction, van Rijn said, but he hopes it will raise the profile of fungal infections that are killing millions in reality.
    


            Aspergillus fungi grow like small filaments in soils all over the world. Like almost all fungi, they release huge numbers of tiny spores that spread through the air.
    


            Humans inhale spores every day but most people won't experience any health issues; their immune system clears them.
    


            It's a different story for those with lung conditions including asthma, cystic fibrosis and COPD, as well as people with compromised immune systems, such as cancer and organ transplant patients, and those who have had severe flu or Covid-19.
    


            If the body's immune system fails to clear the spores, the fungus “starts to grow and basically kind of eat you from the inside out, saying it really bluntly,” van Rijn said.
    


            Aspergillosis has very high mortality rates at around 20% to 40%, he said. It's also very difficult to diagnose, as doctors don't always have it on their radar and patients often present with fevers and coughs, symptoms common to many illnesses.
    


            Fungal pathogens are also becoming increasingly resistant to treatment, van Rijn added. There are only four classes of antifungal medicines available.
    


            This all spells bad news as the climate shifts open up new areas for Aspergillus to colonize.
    


            Aspergillus flavus, a species that tends to prefer hotter, tropical climates, could increase its spread by 16% if humans continue burning large amounts of fossil fuels, the study found. It's predicted to push into parts of northern America, northern China and Russia.
    


            This species can cause severe infections in humans and is resistant to many antifungal medications. It also infects a range of food crops, posing a potential threat to food security. The World Health Organization added Aspergillus flavus to its critical group of fungal pathogens in 2022 because of its public health impact and antifungal resistance risk.
    


            Aspergillus fumigatus, which prefers more temperate climates, is predicted to spread northwards toward the North Pole as global temperatures rise. Its spread could increase by 77.5% by 2100, the study found, potentially exposing 9 million people in Europe.
    


            Conversely, temperatures in some regions, including sub-Saharan Africa, could become so hot they are no longer hospitable to Aspergillus fungi. This could bring its own problems, as fungi play an important role in ecosystems, including healthy soils.
    


            As well as expanding their growing range, a warming world could also be increasing fungi's temperature tolerance, allowing them to better survive inside human bodies.
    


            Extreme weather events such as drought, floods and heatwaves can affect fungi, too, helping to spread spores over long distances. There have been spikes in fungal disease following natural disasters, such as the outbreak after the 2011 tornado in Joplin, Missouri.
    


            The new Aspergillus study “rightfully shines a light on the threat of fungi that dwell in our natural environment and how under-prepared we are to cope with shifts in their prevalence,” said Elaine Bignell, co-director of the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the research.
    


            Many uncertainties remain, however, and there is still a huge amount of research to be done, she told CNN.
    

Candidiasis that develops in the mouth or throat is called “thrush” or oropharyngeal candidiasis. Candidiasis in the vagina is commonly referred to as a “yeast infection.” Invasive candidiasis occurs when Candida species enter the bloodstream and spread throughout the body.

            Despite the deadly nature of aspergillosis, there is a real lack of data on where the pathogen is in the environment and who gets infected, said Justin Remais, a professor of environmental health sciences at UC Berkeley, who was not involved in the research.
    


            He is leading a study of more than 100 million patients across the United States, which identified more than 20,000 aspergillosis cases between 2013 and 2023. The number of cases is increasing about 5% each year, he said.
    


            “Fungal pathogens are becoming increasingly common and resistant to treatment, and we are only beginning to understand how climate change is contributing,” he told CNN.
    


            People are used to hearing about diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites, but much less so fungal diseases, said Bignell. “There is a desperate need to reverse this trend given the lethality,” she said.
    


            “Any of us in the future might be affected.”

 The White House has initiated a significant shift in policy toward Damascus by easing longstanding sanctions and appointing a special envoy, following US President Donald Trump's recent meeting with Syria's interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.

Al-Sharaa, also known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Julani, rose to prominence as the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Islamist group with ties to Al-Qaeda, which led a coalition of opposition groups that toppled longtime leader Bashar Assad last year.

“I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” Trump announced at an investment forum in Riyadh last week, where he met al-Sharaa and expressed hope that the new government would “succeed in stabilizing the country.”

On Friday, the US Treasury Department issued General License 25 (GL25), authorizing previously prohibited transactions under the Syrian Sanctions Regulations (SSR). The measure effectively lifts restrictions on dealings with Syria's central government, including the Central Bank of Syria, several state-owned banks, energy firms, telecommunications providers and national carriers such as Syrian Arab Airlines.

Simultaneously, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a 180-day waiver of the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, suspending some of the most punitive measures passed by Congress in 2019. The waiver covers financial services, engineering, and logistics support for projects involving water, electricity, sanitation, and public health. Rubio described the move as a “first step” in fulfilling Trump's new “vision” for Syria.

Earlier this week, Rubio warned US lawmakers that a civil war of “epic proportions” could erupt in Syria within weeks. Although the country's new leadership “didn't pass their background check with the FBI,” Rubio said the US must support them in order to prevent wider regional instability. He defended Trump's approach, arguing that maintaining a pragmatic foreign policy means the US human rights agenda is “different in certain parts of the world” than in others.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated in February that the sanctions were “harming the Syrian people” and should be lifted without preconditions.

In order to oversee Washington's growing ties with Damascus, Trump has appointed Tom Barrack, his ambassador to Turkey and longtime confidant, as US Special Envoy for Syria. Barrack said on Friday that the administration's goal was to “integrate Syria into a peaceful, cooperative Middle East,” and hinted that reopening the US Embassy in Damascus was “on the table.”

While sanctions relief is significant, most measures remain temporary, with GL25 expiring in six months unless renewed. Congress would need to pass legislation to permanently repealing the Caesar Act and related sanctions packages imposed since Syria was designated a state sponsor of terrorism in 1979.

 The Trump administration has moved to drastically overhaul the National Security Council (NSC), reportedly placing more than 100 officials on administrative leave and slashing the powerful advisory and coordination body's staff, as part of what one White House source described as an effort to “gut the Deep State.”

Multiple reports on Friday confirmed that staff across nearly all NSC directorates – including those handling key global hotspots such as Ukraine, Iran and the Indo-Pacific – were dismissed with little notice. According to CNN and Reuters, employees received emails late Friday afternoon informing them they had just 30 minutes to clear their desks.

An administration official described the reorganization to Axios as a strategic shift aimed at reducing bureaucratic interference and concentrating foreign policy decision-making at the highest levels of government, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio – who is also serving as acting national security adviser – playing a central role.

“The NSC is the ultimate Deep State,” the official said. “It's Marco vs. the Deep State. We're gutting the Deep State.”

Rubio, who has led efforts to downsize the State Department and USAID, emphasized that the goal is to return the NSC to its “original purpose” as a coordinating body, not a policy-shaping institution.

“The NSC will now be better positioned to collaborate with agencies,” he told Axios in a statement, without confirming the exact scope of the cuts.

According to officials who spoke anonymously, the plan is to cut the NSC staff to around 50 people – down from more than 300 under the Biden administration, and even below the leaner structure Trump implemented during his first term. Entire directorates may be eliminated or consolidated, including those overseeing Africa policy and NATO coordination, multiple sources told Reuters.

Senior administration officials reportedly cited Trump's recent reversal of Syria sanctions as an example of the new top-down model. “The president gave the order. The cabinet followed. No need for endless layers of committees,” one official told Axios. “This is reverse workflow in action.”

The dismissals came just weeks after Trump fired former national security adviser Mike Waltz and nominated him as ambassador to the United Nations, following leaks involving sensitive military plans. Waltz had reportedly lost influence after inadvertently inviting a journalist into a private chat about Yemen airstrikes.

The abrupt reorganization, carried out just ahead of Memorial Day weekend, marks one of the most sweeping institutional shake-ups of Trump's second term to date. It reportedly affected both career officials and Trump's own political appointees.

The White House did not comment publicly on the staffing decisions, but Rubio is expected to continue leading the NSC indefinitely, with deputy national security advisers Andy Baker and Robert Gabriel assisting him under the new structure.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has accused French President Emmanuel Macron of detaining Telegram founder Pavel Durov for the purpose of interfering with the electoral processes in Romania.

The accusation comes shortly after Durov claimed that French authorities had enquired with him regarding the issue.

“It turns out that Macron had Durov arrested not even to address internal issues with the messenger using such barbaric methods, but to influence the elections in Romania, realizing that the candidate from the liberal dictatorship wouldn't be able to win under any legal circumstances,” Zakharova wrote on Telegram.

On Saturday, Durov said, citing Romanian journalist Marius Tuca, that Nicolas Lerner, the head of France's foreign intelligence agency, the DGSE, had visited the country just two days before the vote.

Earlier this month, Durov revealed that Lerner had asked him to censor conservative voices on the social media platform during the election campaign in Romania. The agency has publicly denied the allegation. Durov in turn accused French authorities of deflecting criticism by linking him to unrelated criminal investigations involving users of his platform.

Durov was arrested in France last August and charged with complicity in crimes allegedly carried out by Telegram users. The Russian-born entrepreneur, whose company is headquartered in Dubai, was ultimately released on €5 million ($5.46 million) bail and allowed to leave the country in mid-March.

Romania's Constitutional Court promptly annulled the results of the first round of the presidential election carried out in November 2024, alleging that independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu had secured an unexpected lead with the help of Russian interference. Georgescu was disqualified from the re-run.

Last Sunday, the conservative EU critic George Simion lost a run-off vote against pro-Brussels Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan by a single-digit margin. Simion challenged the results on Tuesday, alleging “external interferences by state and non-state actors,” but the nation's Constitutional Court unanimously rejected the petition.

Following Simion's petition, Durov offered to testify before the Romanian authorities about the interactions with French officials, saying he would do so “if it helps Romanian democracy.”

Ahead of the second round of voting, Romania's Foreign Ministry alleged that Moscow was attempting to influence the outcome. The Kremlin ridiculed the allegations, comparing the process with a mess and stating that it shouldn't even count as a proper vote.

WASHINGTON, May 24. /TASS/. The era of uncontested US dominance is now over, US Vice President JD Vance said, addressing a Naval Academy Graduation Ceremony in Annapolis, Maryland, on Friday.

""In the wake of the Cold War, America enjoyed a mostly unchallenged command of the commons, airspace, sea, space, and cyberspace. But the era of uncontested US dominance is over,"" he stated.

""Today, we face serious threats in China, Russia, and other nations determined to beat us in every single domain - from spectrum to low Earth orbit, to our supply chains, and even our communication infrastructure,"" Vance maintained.

MOSCOW, May 24. /TASS/. The French authorities arrested Pavel Durov so they could use his messaging app Telegram to influence the recent presidential election in Romania, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.

""As it happens, [French President Emmanuel] Macron had Durov arrested not in order to use this barbaric method for addressing the app's internal issues, but to direct the election in Romania, as he understood that the candidate from liberal dictatorship was unable to win under any legitimate setups,"" she wrote on Telegram. ""What was made public was an accusation of a gross crime complete with evidence.""

On May 18, Telegram founder Durov said the app refused to comply with a request from ""a Western European country"" to take down the channels of Romanian conservatives ahead of the elections. In a subsequent post on X, he said the request came from the chief of France's Directorate-General for External Security, Nicolas Lerner, earlier this spring. The French foreign intelligence agency denied issued any such requests, saying all they did was to remind Durov of his responsibility to keep terrorism and child pornography off his social media platform.

Durov later said he was willing to testify about the alleged outside interference in Romania's presidential election. According to the businessman, the French foreign intelligence agency sought to obtain IP addresses of some Romanian, Moldovan and Ukrainian nationals under the guise of fighting terrorism and child pornography.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Frustration is growing amid increasing signs US could wash its hands of Ukraine, but some observers counsel patience

Gen Keith Kellogg, Donald Trump's somewhat estranged special envoy on Ukraine, is said by some US diplomats to like to joke that the president did indeed say he would solve the Ukraine crisis in 24 hours, he just never specified which 24 hours.

Dark humour may be all that is left to Europeans as they absorb not just Trump's refusal to impose the promised “bone-crushing sanctions” over Russia's rejection of a 30-day ceasefire but also the increasing signs that the administration will wash its hands of Ukraine and instead focus on forging a new economic partnership with Russia.

The mood among the European leaders who heard Trump's description of his two-hour phone call with Vladimir Putin on Monday – a call that brought a ceasefire no closer – was said to range from despondent to apoplectic. Accounts vary of whether Trump told the European leaders that Putin did not want peace, or simply that Putin thought he was winning. Either way, no sanctions were imposed.

Yet, only 24 hours before, Alexander Stubb, the Finnish president and sometime Trump golf partner, had spoken optimistically of Trump losing patience with Putin's prevarications and of the possibility that the US Senate would start the process this week of imposing sanctions drawn up by the president's close ally Lindsey Graham that would penalise countries that buy Russian oil. The seven hours Stubb had spent in March on Trump's golf team nursing a tournament victory seemed to have been to no avail.

Trump blamed big egos and said the conditions for a deal could only be agreed by the warring parties, “because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of”. He said he still thought “something might happen, and if it doesn't happen I'll simply step aside and they'll have to move on”. He continued: “Once again, this was a European matter and it should have remained a European matter.” The vice-president, JD Vance, simply said: “This is not our war.”

But days before, Kellogg had referred to a 20-point US peace plan starting with a ceasefire that had been shared with the Europeans, completely contradicting Trump's claim that only the warring parties could have a view on Ukraine's future.

The episode raises what is now the holy grail of modern diplomacy: how best to influence the US president's thinking, whether it is over Ukraine, Gaza, Iran or China.

A former US diplomat close to the Ukraine talks urged Europeans to be patient with Trump. “He has gut instincts, those instincts are OK, they are not always wrong, he zigzags, and in the case of Ukraine he is most governed by the tactics he needs to get a ceasefire,” the former diplomat said.

“He is quite aware and not naive in this. He knows the only reason there is not a ceasefire is because Vladimir Putin wants to wage war. So he knows his target is to pull Putin in tactically. He is dangling rewards – the G8, resource deals, lifting sanctions, summit meetings.

“Putin does not want to do this. He has no interest in a ceasefire. He has an interest in eliminating Ukrainian national identity and taking it over. He is playing this out deliberately. He is playing games. He is moving the goalposts almost every day and trying to get everyone to follow him … Trump has continuously made excuses for him, but in the hope he can pull him in.”

The former diplomat said Trump had four basic objectives in Ukraine. “Trump genuinely wants a ceasefire and the killing to stop. He wants reciprocity so he will be able to tell the US taxpayer ‘you are not throwing your money away on Ukraine'. He wants to deter Putin from doing it again, but he wants Europe to take the lead in preventing him attacking again. I find that acceptable.

“The US and Ukraine are more in alignment on the ceasefire than they have been at any point since Trump took office. Trump has said on several occasions he will not throw Ukraine under the bus as an independent state.”

That judgment was confirmed by Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, who told a Senate hearing this week: “Russia wants what they do not currently have and are not entitled to, and Ukraine wants what they cannot regain militarily. And that's been the crux of the challenge.”

As to the possibility of Trump fulfilling his threat first made in March to hit Russia with punishing sanctions, the Europeans have few options but to wait. They have invested heavily in Graham, a South Carolina Republican senator and someone to whom Stubb talks most days. Graham spoke this week to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.

The former US diplomat said: “Congress cannot force Trump to do anything, but they can be in a position to say we can pass legislation on sanctions to strengthen Trump's position. The Republicans on the Hill are not portraying this as an alternative to Trump but saying ‘this is how we support his strategy'.”

As such, the 80 senators who support Graham's bill imposing tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil must also wait for Trump's green light. Of course, that light may never turn green. Rubio told the Senate foreign relations committee: “If you start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking.”

Moreover, Russian accounts of the two-hour call between Putin and Trump dwell on its warm personal nature and Trump's praise for Russian sacrifice in the second world war. In return, Putin offered to pen a memorandum on a possible peace accord. No deadlines were agreed.

As a result, Europe's nightmare – Trump walking away from Ukraine – draws nearer. But there are many ways to walk away. Would he turn off the intelligence, unilaterally lift sanctions on Russia and block even lend-lease agreements that would allow Ukraine to buy US weaponry? In the slow transition to Europe taking the lead in supporting Ukraine, Trump can cooperate or be disruptive. “It can be a managed process or chaotic and fractious,” said Jack Watling, of the defence thinktank Rusi.

The new US ambassador to Nato, Matthew Whitaker, told the Lennart Meri conference in Tallinn – an annual gathering of diplomats and security experts – that after the Nato summit in June the US would lay out plans for troop withdrawal from Europe. Although Whitaker told his audience the withdrawals would be done in an orderly way, not everyone was reassured. Bruno Tertrais, an associate expert at the Institut Montaigne, said: “The words ‘Trump' and ‘orderly' in the same sentence do not inspire confidence.”

Some reduction in the 100,000 US troops in Europe is manageable for the continent, given the Biden administration surged roughly 20,000 troops after the Ukraine invasion, but the scale and method of the withdrawal matters.

And it is hard for the Nato summit to agree a new set of capability targets if the scale of US withdrawals will not be known until the autumn. “Nato decisions on capabilities will be made without knowing the future US force posture in Europe,” said Torrey Taussig, of the Atlantic Council. “These decisions about capability targets for meeting Europe's own defences and a ceasefire force in Ukraine are near-term decisions, yet we do not know what America's contribution to Europe will look like.”

The sense of frustration is deepened because the European Nato members feel they have agreed a fiscally demanding package on defence spending in time for the Nato summit that addresses all Trump's complaints about freeloading. Nato states will adopt a new target over the next five to seven years of reaching 3.5% of GDP spent on hard defence and 1.5% on cybersecurity and defence-related infrastructure investment such as roads and bridges to improve troop mobility. (The aim is for the hard defence component to rise annually by 0.2%.)

That might be enough to get Europe over the hump of the Nato summit without Trump exploding but it does not deal with the more fundamental problem of Trump's benign view of Russia. Stubb argues Europe has to understand Trump's take on great-power politics and find a way to disabuse him. “What we fail to see in Europe is that the US and its foreign policy doctrine is based on global competition, not Ukraine and Russia. We have to get out of the mindset that the US is only focused on Ukraine. It is not.”

Stubb added: “Trump's worldview is not far from what we saw in the 19th-century concert of powers – a big power era sometimes of competition and sometimes cooperation. We have to convince the US administration that free trade and common rules are better than transactional deals, and we show we are serious about defence in Europe and that we are security providers and not security consumers.”

If Trump's vision is broadly one of 19th-century great-power spheres of influence, Stubb argues, then it is necessary to convince Trump that Russia is not a great power and is not worth jettisoning Ukraine and its allies for. “We need to explain that Russia is not any more a big power, economically. It is smaller than Italy, slightly larger than Spain [in terms of its economy],” he said. “Militarily it wanted to deny the independent sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine three years ago. It has advanced less than one percentage point this year, and its interest rate is over 20% and its reserves are out. These are the kind of messages that you have to convey. It is not an easy game, but you just have to keep on engaging the American administration.”

The Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski offers a variation: that the great power of the future is Europe, not Russia. He argues Putin has “woken a giant” in the continent. “He has yet no idea how costly this is going to be. Since President Trump came to power we have already doubled our defence spending,” he said.

Sikorski predicts that by the end of the decade, when Nato countries meet the new spending targets, Europe will dwarf Russia. “We are a $19tn economy. Russia will be a trillion-dollar economy. As Europe, without the US, we are spending two and half times more than Russia on a peace footing than Russia is spending on a war footing. All it takes is to spend the money better, on the basis of learning the lessons from Ukraine and then having the will to gel this into a fighting force. We should be grateful to the US for telling it like it is.”

But that is five years hence, and the immediate issue is whether Europe and Ukraine, with the US on the sidelines, have the means to make Putin reassess the price of victory.

Watling, the defence analyst, argued that Ukraine risks leaving gaps on an extended frontline this summer, but if it can survive then Russia will have exhausted its stocks and be reliant on new production, making its war machine more vulnerable to international supply chains. He said Ukraine's problem was not manpower but training and ammunition.

Either way, iron has entered the soul of European leaders. They fear Trump is unpersuadable and set on a different course, leaving Europe as the protector of Ukraine.

Kaja Kallas, Europe's foreign policy chief, said she had been through the five stages of grief over the transatlantic relationship and reached acceptance, but even so she cannot hide the loss.

“The issue of trust is like a vase,” she said. “You broke the vase, you can glue it back together, but it is not the same vase.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Exclusive: Critics and defendant's legal team accuse US president of trying to do favor for Salvadorian leader

Donald Trump's administration is attempting to dismiss criminal charges against a top MS-13 leader in order to deport him to El Salvador, according to newly unsealed court records – igniting accusations from critics and the defendant's legal team that the US president is trying to do a favor for his Salvadorian counterpart, who struck a deal with the gang in 2019.

According to justice department records, the MS-13 figure in question, Vladimir Antonio Arevalo-Chavez, has intimate knowledge of that secretive pact, which – before eventually falling apart – involved Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele's government ceding money and territory to the gang, who in return promised to reduce violence from its side and provide Bukele's party with electoral support.

Attempts by the Trump administration to expel Arevalo-Chavez are part of its own deal with Bukele to allow for the US to incarcerate immigrants in a maximum security Salvadoran prison. CNN reported in April that Bukele's government had specifically asked for nine top MS-13 leaders to be brought back to El Salvador from the US.

Critics of Trump who are defending Arevalo-Chavez's rights see the move to deport him as a way to prevent him from testifying in a US court, or becoming a federal government cooperator, to limit disclosures about Bukele's past ties to the gang as much as possible.

Arevalo-Chavez is a member of the “Ranfla Nacional”, which is considered to be a directors' board of sorts for the MS-13 gang. Federal charges pending against him in New York include racketeering, terrorism and conspiring to commit narco-terrorism.

A filing from the US justice department – dated 1 April but not unsealed until Thursday – said federal prosecutors want to dismiss charges against Arevalo-Chavez for “sensitive and important foreign policy considerations”.

Prosecutors added that “geopolitical and national security concerns of the United States” and said permitting “the prosecution of the defendant to proceed in the first instance in El Salvador” was also a factor.

Arevalo-Chavez is still in the US, with his attorneys requesting more information about the reasons behind the dismissal of charges and the intended deportation.

The judge ruled in April to not relocate him anywhere, preventing his being placed into the custody of the US's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), which would lead to his deportation.

“The ‘geopolitical and national security concerns' appear to be an effort by the government to support a ‘deal' with El Salvador to assist Bukele in suppressing the truth about a secret negotiation he had with MS-13 leaders in return for our government using El Salvador prisons,” Arevalo-Chavez's attorneys said in a separate filing also unsealed on Thursday. That filing in particular mentioned the notorious Cecot prison built to house alleged gang members.

The US attorney's office for New York's eastern federal district, where Arevalo-Chavez is being prosecuted, declined to comment Friday when asked by the Guardian. Arevalo-Chavez's attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In mid-March, the US justice department quietly dismissed charges against another top Ranfla Nacional member and expelled him to El Salvador to be detained at Cecot, an acronym whose full name in Spanish means “the terrorism confinement center”. That other Ranfla leader, Cesar Humberto López-Larios, was facing similar charges in New York and also reportedly had insight about the deal Bukele previously struck with the gang.

“This is collusion between two governments, the US and El Salvador, to cover up a gang pact by dropping charges on known gangsters in order to disappear them before they can testify,” said political science professor Michael Ahn Paarlberg at Virginia Commonwealth University. “It's a criminal conspiracy between the Trump and Bukele administrations.

“The irony is both of them claim to be tough on crime.”

According to a justice department indictment, in 2019, the MS-13 leadership forged a pact with top Bukele administration officials. El Faro, a Salvadoran news organization, first reported on secretive meetings during which Bukele officials would enter prisons in El Salvador to negotiate directly with the Ranfla leaders.

As part of the deal, MS-13 would receive certain money- and land-related concessions while agreeing to reduce the amount of violence they inflicted in El Salvador. Additionally, some top MS-13 leaders were released from prison – and the gang promised to leverage its networks to support Bukele's political party in the 2021 legislative elections, according to prosecutors.

The pact purportedly collapsed in 2022, leading Bukele to engage in a massive offensive against gangs in the country. Critics say that so-called state of exception crackdown led to a trampling of due process and human rights in the Central American nation – while also allowing Bukele to further consolidate power there.

For years, Bukele has attempted to suppress any evidence of his ties to MS-13 by either attempting to recapture Ranfla leaders or by ignoring US extradition requests.

US federal law enforcement agencies have long pursued MS-13's criminal networks. In 2020 and in 2022, two separate federal indictments in New York charging 27 leaders of the gang were handed up and unsealed.

In 2021, the US treasury department sanctioned two top Bukele officials for their alleged “corruption”, saying they engaged in “covert negotiations between government officials and the criminal organization” in order to secure the secret pact with MS-13. The treasury department also alleged that Bukele's administration in 2020 provided financial incentives to MS-13 to reduce gang violence in exchange for “political support”.

Arevalo-Chavez, one of the co-defendants in the 2022 indictment, had “participated in negotiations with the government of El Salvador on behalf of MS-13”, said the justice department, then controlled by Joe Biden's presidential administration. Arevalo-Chavez left El Salvador and went to Mexico, where he helped run the gang's operations there.

The Mexican government arrested Arevalo-Chavez in February 2023 and quickly transferred him to the US, where the FBI and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) took custody. He is in custody in a federal detention facility while his case proceeds.

Relations between El Salvador and the US have improved since Trump took office. In 2021, tensions between Biden officials and the Bukele government flared when, despite an international arrest warrant and extradition request, Salvadoran officials quietly released Ranfla Nacional leader Elmer Canales-Rivera from prison. US prosecutors alleged in a 2023 letter that he was personally escorted out of prison by a high-level Bukele official, given a firearm and driven to the Guatemalan border for his escape.

The Bukele administration then attempted to recapture Canales-Rivera. According to reporting from El Faro, Bukele's government discussed a plan to pay a Mexican cartel to find Canales-Rivera and return him to El Salvador. The Mexican government found him first, arrested him, and expelled him to the US in November 2023.

Eight Ranfla Nacional leaders remained in US custody after López-Larios one was expelled in March. Two of them pleaded guilty earlier this year.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Incident next to Gujarat border occurs weeks after four-day conflict between countries

Indian border troops have shot dead a Pakistani man they say crossed the international frontier and did not stop when challenged.

The shooting occurred two weeks after conflict erupted between the two nuclear-armed countries that led to four days of violence and more than 70 people being killed before a ceasefire was agreed.

India's border security force (BSF) said its troops had spotted “one suspicious person advancing towards the border fence”, which lies beyond the international frontier, in Gujarat state's Banaskantha district on Friday evening.

“They challenged the intruder, but he continued to advance, prompting them to open fire,” the BSF said in a statement on Saturday. “The intruder was neutralised on the spot.”

The Gujarat and Rajasthan states of India, which share a border with Pakistan's south-eastern Sindh province, have been hubs of drug smuggling, and many Pakistani drug smugglers have been arrested or killed there. Millions of dollars worth of drugs have been seized in both states, and also on the Gujarat coast on the Arabian Sea.

Pakistani officials privy to the information said India did not reveal the real identity of the individual and described the statement as “vague”. A Pakistani official questioned how the man managed to get so far from the border in Banaskantha district, and said they were “investigating the killing and identity of the person”.

The recent conflict began after India blamed Pakistan for a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in April that killed 26 people. Islamabad denied New Delhi's claims it backed the militant group.

India launched missile strikes, claiming to have targeted terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan, which responded by firing missiles at Indian military targets. Soon after the the ceasefire, New Delhi said any future terrorist attacks on its territory would be considered an act of war.

Pakistan has denied any involvement in the militant attack in Kashmir. It has become more vocal in blaming India for a rising wave of militant attacks that have struck Pakistan, particularly in the regions of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Pakistan has repeatedly accused India of using proxy militant groups to carry out terrorist attacks in order to destabilise the country, which India has denied.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

European and North American cybercrime investigators said they have dismantled the heart of a malware operation directed by Russian criminals after a global operation involving British, Canadian, Danish, Dutch, French, German and US police.

International arrest warrants have been issued for 20 suspects, most of them living in Russia, by European investigators, while indictments were unsealed in the US against 16 people.

Those charged include the alleged leaders of the Qakbot and Danabot malware operations, including Rustam Rafailevich Gallyamov, 48, who lives in Moscow and Aleksandr Stepanov, 39, AKA JimmBee, and Artem Aleksandrovich Kalinkin, 34, AKA Onix, both of Novosibirsk, Russia, the US Department of Justice said.

Cyberattacks aimed at destabilizing governments or simple theft and blackmail are becoming increasingly pernicious. The high-street retailer Marks & Spencer is one of the most high-profile and recent victims in the UK this month.

The Europeans, led by the German crime agency, Bundeskriminalamt (BKA), released public appeals in their attempts to track down 18 suspects believed to be involved in the Qakbot malware family, along with a third malware known as Trickbot.

BKA and its international counterparts said the majority of the suspects were Russians. The Russian national Vitalii Nikolayevich Kovalev, 36, already wanted in the US, is one of BKA's most wanted.

He is allegedly behind Conti, considered to be the most professional and best-organized ransomware blackmail group in the world, with Kovalev described as one of the “most successful blackmailers in the history of cybercrime” by German investigators.

Using the pseudonyms Stern and Ben, BKA said that he is claimed to have attacked hundreds of companies worldwide and extracted large ransom payments from them.

Kovolev, 36, from Volgorod, is believed to be living in Moscow, where several firms are registered in his name. He was identified by US investigators in 2023 as having been a member of Trickbot.

Investigators also believe he was at the helm of Conti and other blackmail groups, such as Royal and Blacksuit, founded in 2022. His own cryptowallet is said to be worth about 1 billion euros (US$1.1 billion)

BKA said that of the 37 perpetrators they identified, they had enough evidence to issue 20 arrest warrants.

The US attorney's office in California unsealed the details of charges against 16 defendants who allegedly “developed and deployed the DanaBot malware.”

The criminal infiltrations into victims' computers were “controlled and deployed” by a Russia-based cybercrime organization that has infected more than 300,000 computers around the world, particularly in the US, Australia, Poland, India and Italy.

It was advertised on Russian-language criminal forums and also had an “espionage variant used to target military, diplomatic, government and non-governmental organizations,” the indictment says.

“For this variant, separate servers were established, such that data stolen from these victims was ultimately stored in the Russian Federation,” it added.

Vision-impaired Taiwanese singer  Ricky Hsiao (蕭煌奇) won a gold medal in judo at the  2025 Summer World Masters Games yesterday.

Hsiao, a four-time winner of Best Male Taiwanese Singer  and a three-time recipient of Best Taiwanese Album at  Taiwan's Golden Melody Awards, triumphed in the para- judo 90-kilogram weight class.

Hsiao secured the gold medal after achieving two  consecutive wins at the competition, taking down opponents  including Taiwanese vision-impaired bassist Kuo Chien- cheng (郭謙成) whom Hsiao professionally collaborates  with in their respective music careers.

After his win, Hsiao spoke to reporters about entering the  sports event with a shoulder injury, admitting he was very  worried about making it worse.

Hsiao said that even his doctor  advised him to withdraw from the competition, but he  decided to push through because he had already signed up.

He added that he also wanted to set an example for others  who enjoy sports and to remind himself that there are not  many things to fear in life.

“So I felt like I had to compete,” he said, “even if I  got some injuries.”

The 2025 Summer World Masters Games was not Hsiao's  first foray into an international sports event as a judoka.

The 48-year-old singer has represented Taiwan multiple  times as a para-athlete throughout his life, with his most  memorable achievement being a bronze medal at the 1994  FESPIC Games (Far East and South Pacific Games for the  Disabled) held in Beijing, China.

The most prestigious competition Hsiao fought in was the  1996 Paralympics in Atlanta, Georgia, where he took  seventh place for judo.

Hsiao said yesterday that both sport and music play  important roles in his life.

“To me, both are very important,” Hsiao said. “Sport  gives me great motivation to create good music, so winning  medals in both fields makes me feel accomplished.”

The Chinese Anti-Doping Agency (CHINADA) has on Friday denounced the Enhanced Games and called on the global sports community to collectively oppose the competition that endorses the use of banned substances.

The Enhanced Games are to debut in May next year in Las Vegas with swimming, athletics and weightlifting on the agenda for athletes using substances banned in official competition, to the dismay of anti-doping bodies such as the World Anti-Doping Agency.

Participants could earn prize money totaling up to US$500,000 per event, plus bonuses for surpassing a world record.

CHINADA denounced the event in a statement to Chinese state news agency Xinhua on Friday, calling it “a distorted competition that turns pure sports competition into a drug contest, which serious[ly] contradicts the purpose of the World Anti-Doping Code.”

“It severely threatens the physical and mental health of athletes as well as the spirit of sport. In addition, its publicity tactics reveal its nature as a capital-driven initiative,” it said. 

“CHINADA hereby expresses our firm opposition to any attempt to portray doping as so-called scientific advancements, and calls on the global sports community to stand united in rejecting the Enhanced Games,” it added.

The Enhanced Games operate under the principle that banning performance-enhancing drugs in major competitions does not protect athletes, but rather stifles their performance. Organizers have called on athletes to join the competition.

However, CHINADA said the Enhanced Games organizers lure athletes with high prizes into risking their health and feeding public appetite for a “gladiator show.”

SANYO-ONODA, Yamaguchi — An about 100-meter-long okonomiyaki was made by a total of about 500 people in Sanyo-Onoda, Yamaguchi Prefecture, on May 5. It was recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's longest okonomiyaki.

The “Making Long Okonomiyaki” project was started in 2014 by an organizing committee of local volunteers. At first, a 50-meter-long and a 90-meter-long okonomiyaki were made in 2019. However, the participants had not yet applied to Guinness World Records.

This year's project was held at a rice paddy in the city. Iron cooking plates were arranged in a line, heated to 300 C and then greased with oil. About 500 participants, ranging from children to the elderly, were assigned to their respective segments where they cooked the okonomiyaki batter containing locally produced vegetables and other ingredients. In time with a call, participants successfully flipped the okonomiyaki in unison.

A Guinness World Records certifier confirmed that the 100.57-meter-long okonomiyaki was unbroken and cooked through enough to eat.

After being recognized, the participants enjoyed the freshly cooked okonomiyaki together.

“Flipping it over was difficult for me,” said a 15-year-old female junior high school student from the city. “I am excited to see this okonomiyaki recognized by Guinness World Records.”

Finland will supply heavy ammunition to Ukraine using proceeds from frozen Russian assets, the country's Ministry of Defence said on May 19.

The move is part of a broader European Union initiative to channel profits from immobilized Russian assets into support for Ukraine's defense. Finland has reached an agreement with the European Commission to implement the measure through the European Peace Facility (EPF), the ministry said in a statement.

Under the agreement, Finland will provide 90 million euros (approximately $100 million) worth of heavy ammunition procured from domestic suppliers. The Finnish government says the deal not only reinforces its support for Ukraine but also benefits its national defense industry.

""We were able to negotiate additional funding for Finland's support for Ukraine. The funds come from frozen Russian assets,"" said Finnish Defense Minister Antti Hakkanen. 

""The products are purchased from Finnish industry to boost employment at home and sent to Ukraine to help its defense. I am very pleased with the outcome.""

The Finnish Defense Ministry did not provide details on the timeline, type of ammunition, or delivery logistics due to operational security concerns.

In March, Finland announced its 28th military aid package for Ukraine, valued at approximately 200 million euros (now $225 million). 

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Western countries have frozen approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets, with two-thirds held in the EU.

In October 2024, the Group of Seven (G7) approved nearly $50 billion in loans for Ukraine to be repaid from the proceeds of those frozen funds. The EU has also launched a separate initiative on funneling military aid to Ukraine by similarly using the funds.

Kyiv has consistently urged allies to formalize mechanisms for seizing frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine's defense and reconstruction.

Western governments have primarily relied on reallocating interest income generated by the frozen funds to support Kyiv rather than confiscating the assets outright.

The Kremlin has warned of retaliation if Russian assets are confiscated for Ukraine's benefit. In early 2024, Moscow amended its legislation to allow counter-seizure of Western-owned property in response to asset seizures abroad.

The EU has formally approved its 17th package of sanctions imposed on Russia over aggression in Ukraine, including measures against almost 200 shadow fleet vessels, top EU diplomat Kaja Kallas announced on May 20.

""New measures also address hybrid threats and human rights. More sanctions on Russia are in the works,"" Kallas said on X.

The step comes as the U.S. signals disinterest in imposing additional sanctions against Russia, even as Moscow refuses Western-backed ceasefire proposals.

The 17th package was supported by EU ambassadors 
 last week, but has since then been criticized as weak and watered down.

The new sanctions target members of Russia's military and political elite and foreign entities in China or the United Arab Emirates, accused of helping the Kremlin evade already-imposed measures.

The EU will also sanction more than 20 entities and individuals disseminating disinformation, and 20 judges and prosecutors involved in legal cases against Russian opposition, specifically Vladimir Kara-Murza and late Alexei Navalny.

The package also targets components vital to Russia's defense industry, namely chemicals, materials, and dual-use goods.

The EU has threatened Russia with additional sanctions unless President Vladimir Putin commits to a ceasefire and agrees to seriously engage in peace efforts. President Volodymyr Zelensky also announced that a new ""strong EU sanctions package"" is underway.

While European leaders have proclaimed that additional sanctions are coordinated with Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump, who held a phone call with Putin on May 19, said he does not intend to impose new measures on Moscow to avoid disrupting peace efforts.

Police in southwestern Ontario say four people are dead after a multi-vehicle crash.

Ontario Provincial Police say emergency crews responded around 4:30 p.m. Friday to the scene of a crash northeast of London between a transport truck and two SUVs.

Sgt. Ed Sanchuk says the collision took place at the intersection of Thorndale Road and Cobble Hills Road. 

He says four people inside one of the SUVs died at the scene.

A fifth passenger with serious life-threatening injuries was airlifted to hospital.

Sanchuk says the driver and passenger of the second SUV and the truck driver all had minor injuries.

Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, who had earlier called controls 'a failure,' said Trump wanted U.S. firms to 'win.'Ann Wang/Reuters

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Saturday praised U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to boost U.S. technology as the leading chipmaker announced a partnership with a group of Swedish businesses to develop AI infrastructure in Sweden.

Nvidia NVDA-T will provide its latest generation AI data centre platform to a group of Swedish companies, including telecoms gear maker Ericsson and drug developer AstraZeneca. 

Nvidia has announced a number of similar partnerships in recent weeks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE after the Trump administration rescinded a rule put in place by previous President Joe Biden that would have restricted exports of AI chips. 

Huang, who had earlier called controls “a failure,” said President Donald Trump wanted U.S. firms to “win”.

“American technology companies were very successful in China four years ago, we have lost about 50% of the market share and competitors have grown,” he said on Saturday in Norrkoping, where he was due to receive an honorary doctorate from Linkoping University. 

“The President would like American technology to win with Nvidia and American companies to sell chips all over the world and to generate revenues, tax revenues, invest and build in the United States,” he said. 

The Trump administration has introduced sweeping tariffs saying they would stimulate growth, bring home manufacturing jobs and raise tax revenues. 

Many businesses and economists, though, have warned tariffs could have the opposite effect and lead to a recession in the United States and a global downturn by pushing up costs, upending supply chains and hurting consumer and business confidence.

Huang said many policies related to re-industrialisation were “very visionary”. 

“Manufacturing in the United States, securing our supply chain, having real resilience, redundancy and diversity in our manufacturing supply chain - all of that is excellent,” he said.

A power outage hit the glitzy resort on the French Riviera as the Cannes Film Festival was drawing to a close. Officials have said the outage came after a substation and an electricity pylon were vandalized.

A major power outage hit the area around the French Riviera resort of Cannes on Saturday, the final day of the Cannes Film Festival.

The power cut began just after 10:00 a.m. local time (8:00 a.m. GMT) due to a fire that broke out overnight in a substation in the nearby village of Tanneron. The fire has since been extinguished.

Cannes mayor David Lisnard had said officials believe it was ""targeted in a criminal act.""

In Villeneuve–Louet, about 15 kilometers (9 miles) northeast of Cannes, three pillars of an electricity pylon holding up a high-voltage power line were cut, prosecutors from the Alpes-Maritimes department said.

""The Prosecutor's Office of Alpes-Maritimes condemns in the strongest possible terms these acts against the integrity of our infrastructures,"" a statement said. 

It added that power supplies were being ""progressively"" restored.

According to grid operator RTE, the power outage affected 160,000 homes in Cannes and the surrounding area.

The outage caused traffic lights to fail and led to traffic jams in the glitzy holiday resort. Shops were closed on one of the main streets.

Teams from RTE and supplier Enedis were working to restore the network. 

The Cannes Film Festival organizers said the closing ceremony would not be affected by the power outage.

The festival announced it had ""switched to an alternative electricity power supply, which enables us to maintain the events and screenings planned for today in normal conditions, including the closing ceremony."" 

However, morning screenings at the festival's cinemas were briefly interrupted while the supply switched to generators.

At the closing ceremony, scheduled to start at 16:40 GMT, French actress Juliette Binoche and her jury will announce the winners of the festival's top prizes. Twenty-two films are competing for the Palme d'Or this year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Enhanced Games world record claim: What does it mean?","https://www.dw.com/en/enhanced-games-world-record-claim-what-does-it-mean/a-72628920","Sat, 24 May 2025 02:57:50 GMT","

An event dubbed ""Olympics on Drugs"" and backed by the Trump family has moved a step closer to reality. The Enhanced Games claim one of its doped athletes has already broken a world record and now has a venue and date.

Whatever its legitimacy, the organizers of the Enhanced Games know how to grab attention. A launch on Wednesday was accompanied by a glossy one-hour film, a sales platform for prescription performance enhancers and the claim of a new 50-meters freestyle world record by Greek swimmer Kristian Gkolomeev.

""He should be retired, but in fact, he's swimming faster than any human being has ever done so. Why? Because he used technology and science to enhance his performance,"" boasted founder Aron D'Souza.

""Once the world realizes that, I think everyone is going to want it. Every middle-aged guy who once played competitive sport and is now suffering from back pain is going to say, 'What is he on and how do I get it?'""

Gkolomeev, who has failed to reach the podium in his four Olympic performances, will not be credited by any official body for a number of reasons; there is no independent adjudication, he was wearing an inline full-body open water suit that falls outside World Aquatics standards and, most pertinently, there was no doping control. In fact, performance-enhancing drugs are demanded by organizers who also claim Gkolomeev broke another world record in jammers, shorts which are allowed in the Olympics.

Not in any meaningful sense. World Aquatics, who govern swimming, have been as dismissive of the Enhanced Games as most of their fellow sporting bodies.

""The Enhanced Games are not a sporting competition built on universal values like honesty, fairness and equity: they are a circus, built on shortcuts,"" read a statement from swimming's global governing body.

While it's apparent that Gkolomeev was doped, it is not clear what with. The Enhanced Games have not revealed what substances the 31-year-old took, citing personal confidentiality, despite consistently promising transparency.

Much of the promotion has been around two things – money and drugs. At Wednesday's launch, D'Souza revealed that the first event would feature four swimming races, four athletics sprints and a weightlifting competition. Each event winner is to receive $500,000 (€440,000) with a $1 million bonus for world records in the 50-meters freestyle and 100-meter sprint and $250,000 for other world records.

Investors including Donald Trump Jr., Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, German tech investor Christian Angermayer and former Coinbase Chief Technology Officer Balaji Srinivasan will hope to profit from the organization's ""Telehealth Platform"" it says will launch in August in a number of US states. The website currently offers ""priority access"" to a ""fully tailored enhancement plan” for a fee of $99. The Enhanced Games say this is all legal with most banned substances in high-level sport available on prescription in the United States. They also insist they will go by the book.

While the drug-selling aspect of the Enhanced Games will be operational soon, the actual event will not take place until next May 21-24 in Las Vegas. This will be less than a month before the United States co-hosts the football World Cup and two years before Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Olympics.

Only four athletes, all swimmers, have so far confirmed their participation. They are: Andriy Govorov, the Ukrainian 50-meters butterfly world record holder and bronze medallst at the 2017 World Championships, 21-year-old Bulgarian swimmer Josif Miladinov, a silver medalist at the 2019 European Championships and retired Australian world champion James Magnussen.

The worlds of sports and medicine have been near-universal in their condemnation of the concept.

""Thinking that because you do medical checks on the spot is going to give you a good idea of the health risks of abuse of doping substances, again, is medical and scientific nonsense,"" said World Anti-Doping Agency science director Olivier Rabin.

""It's like the Roman circus, you know, you sacrifice the lives of people purely for entertainment. What's the value of this? I don't think any responsible society should move in that direction.""

Speaking to DW earlier this year, Chris Raynor, a sports medicine doctor at Cornwall Community Hospital in Canada, told DW the dangers are dramatic.

""There are always effects associated with these medications. It can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, a heart attack, sudden cardiac death,"" he explained .

Former US swimmer and Olympic medalist Allison Wagner, who was beaten at major events by many swimmers who were either proven or suspected dopers, said that sport itself is at stake.

""For me and for so many athletes, sport has been about learning and incorporating values such as integrity and fair play, and these Enhanced Games make a mockery of that.""

D'Souza argues that doping in professional and amateur sport is inherent and his proposal is a safer method that ""makes sport a fair, level, transparent field so that innovation can be illustrated in a very public way to support technological progress.""

Speaking to DW earlier this year, he added that ""individuals should be able to take risks for themselves with free and informed consent."" 

Magnussen said the Enhanced Games have reinvigorated his passion for the sport but sees them as separate from clean competition. 

""I was waking up each day with an enthusiasm to train, to compete. I felt so healthy, so motivated. It's honestly the happiest I've been in seven years,"" he said.

""As athletes we have a greater risk appetite than the general population and see an event like the Enhanced Games as an opportunity.""

German police do not consider the knife attack at Hamburg Central Station to be politically motivated and believe the attacker has a mental illness. The magistrate ordered to place the suspect in psychiatric clinic.

The suspect in Friday's knife attack at Hamburg Central Station was ordered by a magistrate to be placed in a psychiatric clinic on Saturday.

According to police, the detention order is for attempted murder in conjunction with 15 counts of grievous bodily harm.

Earlier in the day, the German police said that they do not see any political motive behind the attack.

""Rather, there are now very concrete indications of a mental illness in the suspect,"" the police stated on Saturday, without giving further details on her condition.

Police added that there are currently no indications that 39-year-old German woman was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. However, they did not provide further details.

According to the police, the suspect, a native of Lower Saxony, has no fixed abode.

In recent months, Germany has been rocked by a series of violent attacks, many of which were motivated by jihadism or right-wing extremism.

The stabbing incident took place on platform 13/14 at Hamburg Central Station on Friday evening just after 6:00 pm (1600 GMT) leading to a major police and rescue operation.

Thanks to the brave intervention of two bystanders, the knife attack at Hamburg Central Station was quickly stopped.

""The very quick intervention on the platform was able to stop the attack,"" the police said on Saturday.

The emergency services team was able to quickly arrest the woman who did not resist being taken into custody. Investigators currently believe that the attack was the act of a lone perpetrator. 

The knife used in the attack has been secured. Police said there are many eyewitnesses who need to be interviewed.

Eighteen people, ranging in age from 19 to 85, were injured in the Friday's attack.

Three women, aged 24, 52, and 85, as well as a 24-year-old man, were hospitalized with life-threatening injuries.

Seven others were seriously injured and seven more sustained minor injuries. Police said that injured were all stable.

On Saturday, Hamburg Mayor Peter Tschentscher said that some of the injured have been discharged from the hospital.

""It is a great relief. I hope they recover well and wish them and their families a lot of strength,"" Tschentscher wrote on the social media platform X, without specifying how many people were released.

Four people from Bremen were also injured in the knife attack at Hamburg Central Station, the local authorities said.

Bremen Mayor Andreas Bovenschulte said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the attack. He added: ""Fortunately, we have received the news today that all 18 injured people are now out of danger. I wish everyone involved a full recovery as quickly as possible.""

Meanwhile, trains were running on schedule again at Hamburg Central Station the morning after the attack, a Deutsche Bahn spokeswoman confirmed to dpa news agency early Saturday.

Ever since she was 10, Shreya Mishra Reddy dreamed of attending Harvard University.

So when she got into Harvard Business School in 2023, she couldn't quite believe her luck.

“I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would be accepted,” she says. “Everybody at home in India was in complete celebration mode, we were overjoyed.”

But this week, just as Ms Reddy, 33, was on the cusp of graduating and achieving her lifelong ambition, everything was thrown into doubt.

On Thursday, the Trump administration revoked the university's ability to enrol foreign students and ruled current international students have to leave the university or lose their visa status.

Describing the moment she saw the news while she was on a call for her job at Visa, Ms Reddy told The Telegraph: “My heart just skipped a beat and I went completely numb, I couldn't process it.”

It marked a new low in relations between the White House and the Ivy League university, which has sued the administration, claiming it was wielding a “campaign of retribution” against the university after it refused to bow to demands overhaul admissions and teaching practices.

The Trump administration has been on a collision course with universities in the US in the wake of the pro-Palestine protests which erupted on campuses last year.

The White House claims universities including Harvard have not done enough to stamp out anti-Semitism on campus.

Harvard is the only university so far to have pushed back against the administration's demands, refusing to acquiesce even when the government froze $2.2 billion in federal grants.

Recommended

While a US judge on Friday temporarily blocked the foreigners ban, the future of the 6,800 international students at Harvard – and the hundreds more expected to start this autumn – now hangs in the balance.

“It's come as a blow, and I am still trying to understand the ramifications,” said Ms Reddy, who took out a loan to finance the $90,000 fee.

She has one module left in her leadership development course, and was expected to graduate in July.

“To put in so much effort, time and everything, all the resources, into applying for a school, getting accepted, and then having been a student there from November 2023 onwards and juggling work as well as as well as the studies, it's not been easy,” she says.

“I'm on borrowed time in the US as an F1 visa holder,” she adds, noting that her visa expires in January and she will have to leave the country.

“I am pretty sure that if I don't finish my program this year, I may not be able to come back,” she adds.

Other international students who would be impacted if the ban goes into effect include Marie Chantel Montás, who has just completed the third year of her PhD in global health.

Ms Montás, 29, who is from the Dominican Republic, says attending Harvard has been “the best experience of my life”.

So when she read about the Trump administration attempting to revoke Harvard's ability to enrol international students, she was in “complete shock”.

She is working on a specialised PhD, for which she has already secured full funding, and the idea of simply transferring to another university is not an option for her.

“I am just feeling upset and sad,” she says. “I feel like this year has been very tumultuous, one after the other. So just that, it's more the sense of like, well, I just passed my exams, and being, you know, just became a candidate, and then this happens.”

The mood on campus right now is “dampened”, according to Swedish undergraduate Leo Gerdén, who is expecting to graduate on Thursday.

“It's very hard to focus on anything else at the moment, it has definitely changed the sentiment around everything with commencement. It feels so hard to leave this place not knowing whether it will be the same next semester,” he says.

“People are so worried.... it's been people's dream, just like me, to come to this place and then it can all be taken away from us because we're being used as poker chips in a battle between the White House and Harvard.”

High-profile international students who could have their plans to study at Harvard upended include Princess Elisabeth, the first in line to Belgium's throne.

Belgium's Royal Palace said it is waiting to find out whether Elisabeth, 23, who completed her undergraduate degree at Oxford, can return to the university for her second year.

“We are looking into the situation, to see what kind of impact this decision might have on the princess, or not. It's too early to say right now,” said the palace's communications head, Xavier Baert.

Henry Tavistock, the Duke of Bedford's son, is believed to have just completed his first year at the university, where he is part of the Harvard Rugby Football Club team.

If he is unable to complete his course it will come as a blow to the family given Mr Tavistock's father and grandfather both attended the Ivy League university.

But it is not just students already at Harvard who could be impacted by the ruling, but also international students who managed to secure a spot at one of the best universities in the world.

Giulio Pellino, 17, had only just come down from the excitement of finding out he got Harvard last month when he read about the ban.

Now, instead of looking forward to his final summer before hunkering down in one of the campus's many hallowed libraries, the teenager from Wuppertal, Germany, is unsure whether he will even be able to start.

“It is unsettling for many of us, not just for me, because I or international students in general, really want to call the US our academic home, but I am still optimistic,” he tells The Telegraph.

Giulio, who hopes to major in economics, still hopes he can begin studying in September, but said he is considering a gap year if it's not possible.

“Getting into Harvard was just a dream come true moment, and I hope I can continue this dream,” he says.

“Bending the Bars” rips away bipartisan propaganda by letting incarcerated artists speak their truth.

“Bending the Bars” rips away bipartisan propaganda by letting incarcerated artists speak their truth.

“I don't fuck with none of y'all cops,” rapped Julius Smith, aka Prince Jooveh, on the song “Hands Up.” “Eighty percent of y'all are cowards, y'all stay up in our business.” In one hand, he held a phone to hear the trap beat. In the other, he held a second phone to fire off lyrics. He had 30 minutes to get it right before time ran out — he was recording behind bars as a person incarcerated by the Florida Department of Corrections for 17 years. Jooveh had to finish before the guards told him time was up.

The last line of his song was an echoing wail, “We are not free. The only thing we are guilty of is pain and poverty. The poor get prison. The rich get richer.”

In prisons across the United States, music beats against walls and bars. Many incarcerated people facing long sentences feel a welling-up in their throats: stories that need to be told.

In June 2025, the new album Bending the Bars — produced by the prison abolitionist group Community Hotline for Incarcerated People (CHIP) — will be released. Singles are already online from its 16 tracks. Some tell of love lost. Some lament youthful mistakes. Some expose the racism of the prison-industrial complex.

Now more than ever, art by people in prison is needed. Making music transforms how incarcerated people see themselves. Hearing their music also transforms how the public sees them. The image of incarcerated people is being used by the Trump administration to make the case for deportations. Trump hammers relentlessly on the scary headlines of “terrorists” and “violent criminals” to normalize breaking the rule of law and dismantling civil rights. The goal is not to deport people who break the law, but to lay the groundwork for assaulting citizens who protest his plans to create an authoritarian police state.

“Honestly at first it was annoying,” said Gary Field, who has been incarcerated for over 20 years by the Florida Department of Corrections and who is a board member of CHIP, in an interview with Truthout. “When I got to prison, I'd hear the men battle rapping. They'd use whatever they had. Bang cups on the bars. Beat their chests. I listened and realized that they were incredibly talented. So many of them could easily have number one hits on the radio.”

Bending the Bars rips away bipartisan perceptions and propaganda on crime and punishment by letting the artists speak their truth. The rappers tell us about their lives and hopes, grudges and fears. They mourn lives they'll never live. The image that rises from their lyrics is of complex human beings who can be a part of society again — which is in stark contrast to the imagery of the “unredeemable, violent criminal” that has been dominant since the 1970s: This toxic caricature of incarcerated people began with President Richard Nixon's 1971 “war on drugs” and President Ronald Reagan's “get-tough-on-crime” turn, when many U.S. prisons shed their rehabilitation programs. The shift left the nearly 2 million people who are locked up with little to no resources to make a life after serving their sentences.

Beyond the 2 million behind bars are 4 to 5 million on parole. According to prison therapists, 15 to 20 percent of incarcerated people have mental illnesses. Even after jail, many people with felony convictions can't vote, and the stigma of having had a felony conviction previously is like an invisible ball and chain, stopping them from getting jobs, housing and education. Cast out of society, they are driven back into the streets. It's no wonder that many return to prison. It's no wonder that the U.S. has made a revolving-door prison-industrial complex.

This system is why abolitionist organizations like CHIP figuratively break down prison walls by fighting draconian rules that further isolate jailed people. In Broward County, Florida, near where CHIP is based, Gov. Ron DeSantis ended free monthly calls for incarcerated people and reduced their authorized mail to postcards. No letters. Just postcards.

Getting the voices of jailed people out matters. It matters to those inside: As Field tells Truthout, “The project brought people together. We would coordinate with CHIP to get outside collaborators. We had no high-tech audio equipment. We had to use phones to record. We got people in rival gangs to work with us. I'm a people-person. I was the house man, and I'd talk to everyone.” Field cites his own life story to challenge prison stereotypes. “When I was young, I got a scholarship to a prep school in Connecticut, met the children of bankers and senators. I traveled to Europe, and I ended up in prison at 46. I'm an odd bird.”

He talked about his life and the dramatic twists and turns it took. As he painted the scenes, the prison phone system told us in a robotic voice that he had one minute left. Field raced against the clock to share his reality but time ran out.

“I'm so tired of these four walls,” raps “Ghostman” on the song “Four Walls.” “I'm so tired of these phone calls.” A major theme in Bending the Bars is showing the humanity of prisoners stereotyped by right-wing media. The tactic of flipping the script is one of the oldest, deepest and strongest traditions in Black art, whether literature, painting or music.

Hip Hop flips the script on racism. Rappers have always pointed out that criminals are often the victims of systemic racism and poverty. You can hear this in songs from rap's golden era — say in 1982's “The Message” by Grandmaster Flash, who raps about a broken city that breaks its people. You can hear it in KRS-One's 1993 hit, “Sound of the Police” where he booms his bass voice going, “Whoop! Whoop!” like a cop car swooping in. You can see it the famous scene in the 1998 film Slam where spoken word artist-activist Saul Williams rips a poem from his heart in a prison yard as fellow prisoners are stunned by its beauty.

Black art displaying Black humanity goes back to the beginning: Frederick Douglass's 1845 autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, has one of the most powerful scenes of Black art. He wrote of hearing other enslaved people sing in the woods between plantations, “They told a tale of woe which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains.”

Here is the truth: Art rescues us from oppression. Bending the Bars is one thread in a long quilt, woven by voices over the centuries, and one sorely needed now. The Trump administration constantly invokes images of “animalistic criminals” to justify deportation. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put it this way, “So the president has discussed this idea publicly. … American citizens to be deported, these would be heinous violent criminals who have broken our nation's laws repeatedly.”

Trump has long used racist stereotypes and fearmongering about incarcerated people to push a right-wing authoritarian takeover. Now he is extending that fearmongering to dissidents and political enemies — and next, could be you. This is why we need to see artists like Prince Jooveh, who says he rediscovered himself in music. “I got to see myself as an artist,” he said in an interview after he was released in February. “I got a job. I'm looking for a recording studio.” He was breathless on the phone. “I saw the effect my song had on people. It was electrifying.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent. Under pressure from an array of McCarthy-style tactics, academics, activists and nonprofits face significant threats for speaking out or organizing in resistance.

Alexander G. Ramos, 62, who lived in Newport Beach, Calif., faces 20 years in federal prison if found guilty, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles.

A federal magistrate judge ordered Ramos to be jailed without bond and scheduled his arraignment for June 30.

Ramos, a Mexican national, worked for a company in Newport Beach that specialized in the purchase of classic cars. He was removed from the United States in 2017 but returned, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

Prosecutors say he was employed at the Newport Beach company from 2017 to September 2024, when he was fired from his position in the risk management department.

Court documents filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office allege Ramos knew his employer's loans and had relationships with title agents or other partners across the United States. Ramos also oversaw requests by the company's title and risk department to its accounting department for payment to title agents, sometimes submitting requests himself, prosecutors said.

Ramos allegedly arranged to overpay outside parties, including a Las Vegas DMV services business. The checks were supposed to cover expenses for tax, titling, and licensing associated with car purchases.

He then allegedly told those entities where to direct the extra money, including by sending the funds to bank accounts that he controlled, prosecutors said.

Law enforcement reviewed the financial records and allegedly found that about $7 million in checks and wire payments were deposited into Ramos-controlled bank accounts from the outside entities.

The investigation also allegedly revealed that some of the checks and wire payments made out to the company where Ramos worked were intended as refunds to clients who had overpaid vehicle registration fees, officials reported.

Instead of being returned to Ramos's employer, Ramos allegedly moved the funds to other accounts he controlled for his personal use. Some of the money was paid for a home in Irvine, prosecutors allege.

The median price of an Irvine home was $1.6 million in April, according to Redfin.

The money transfers allegedly date back to at least January 2020, according to court documents.

The FBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa described them as “cowards,” according to the BBC.

On May 22, during a meeting with Ramaphosa in the Oval Office, Trump presented what he said was evidence of this.

Showing printouts of news articles and footage of South African extremists calling for white farmers to be killed, Trump repeated the allegation that the South African government is confiscating white-owned land.

When Ramaphosa denied this, Trump maintained: “You do allow them to take land—and then when they take the land, they kill the white farmer, and when they kill the white farmer, nothing happens to them.

“You're taking people's land away from them, and those people, in many cases, are being executed. They're being executed, and they happen to be white.”

South Africa's International Relations Minister, Ronald Lamola, told The Epoch Times that Trump and his administration are “totally misguided” in offering asylum to Afrikaners.

“Who can provide proof of any persecution of a specific race in South Africa?” he asked. “There's no proof. There's no type of persecution or discrimination against any whites in South Africa.”

The Epoch Times has been told by a source connected to the U.S. Embassy in Johannesburg that many of the 8,000 Afrikaner applications for asylum reviewed so far contain “horrific details” of crimes committed against them or their close relatives.

“They believe these crimes happened to them because they are white,” said the source, requesting anonymity because he did not have permission to speak with the media.

“These crimes were documented in cases opened by the South African police, and in many cases the perpetrators have never been found. These people can't get any information about what's happened to their cases. It appears there have been no investigations.”

On May 13, the first group of 59 Afrikaners was welcomed in Washington by Deputy Secretary of State, Christopher Landau, and Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, Troy Edgar.

He said “a fair number” of the asylum seekers that had arrived in the United States were farmers who had farmed their land for generations.

“Now, [they] face the threat—not only of expropriation—but also of direct violence … Many of these folks have experience with threatening invasions of their homes—their farms—and a real lack of interest or success of the government in doing anything about this situation,” Landau said.

Hours earlier, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that there's a genocide in South Africa, with the victims often white farmers.

“Whether they're white or black makes no difference to me,” said Trump. “But white farmers are brutally killed and their land is being confiscated in South Africa.”

Pretoria says the “nil compensation” clause in the act will only be used when it is “equitable and in the public interest.”

At the moment, “there's no state-supported confiscation of farms happening,” said Jaco Minnaar, who heads South Africa's largest agricultural association, AgriSA.

But, he told The Epoch Times, white-owned farms are “frequently” invaded.

“These land invasions are often instigated by local politicians and radical groups. A farmer will wake up and there will be a large group of people occupying a section of his farm,” Minnaar said.

“In many cases the police are slow to act, or they don't act at all, and the large group turns into a squatter camp, and the farm is rendered worthless.”

Bennie van Zyl, who leads the Transvaal Agricultural Union, which represents thousands of Afrikaner farmers, told The Epoch Times the murders of white farmers and their families are often “very brutal, with torture involved, but it can't yet be defined as a white genocide … and there's no evidence that the government is involved.”

Lamola said the murders of white farmers are “part of a normal crime trend.”

However, University of Stellenbosch criminologist Guy Lamb said there's “nothing normal” about crime in South Africa.

“The country has one of the highest murder and rape rates in the world,” he told The Epoch Times. “There's a sense that South Africans of all races are under siege from criminals, with the state unable to protect them. So the fact that Trump's Afrikaners are telling the U.S. government horror stories about crime is not shocking at all. Most South Africans have similar stories to tell.”

Isolated in rural areas, white farmers in particular are “easy targets,” Lamb said.

“They're attacked not because they're white, but because they're perceived to have money and firearms,” he said.

Max du Preez, a veteran South African journalist, described South Africa as “a country at war with itself.”

“Look, we aren't Ukraine where cities are being bombed. But we are a country where a lot of men consider rape to be a sport,” he told The Epoch Times: “We are a country where murder is extremely common and very few are ever solved. Violent crime is everywhere.”

The country's official unemployment rate is almost 33 percent. An expanded definition of unemployment, which includes those who've given up looking for work, is more than 43 percent.

Du Preez said, “So we have millions of black people, especially jobless youth, with nothing to do all day. They're angry. If there's going to be a race revolution, this is where it's coming from. It's a ticking time bomb.”

He said Trump's executive order and offer of asylum to Afrikaners “is part of a narrative of fear that's been pervasive in white South Africa, and elsewhere, for generations: The fear of a black uprising that results in the mass killing of whites similar to the Rwandan genocide … The fear that blacks finally take revenge on whites for apartheid.”

Several leftist and extremist groups in South Africa have suggested exactly this.

Julius Malema, the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), South Africa's fourth largest political party, often sings a song called “Kill the farmer,” and has said a “revolution” of poor black people is coming to drive whites out of South Africa.

Professor Hein Willemse of the Afrikaans Department at the University of Pretoria, said many Afrikaners feel “besieged.”

“Land is very important to the Afrikaner. Most successful commercial farmers are Afrikaners,” he told The Epoch Times.

“Take their land away and take away their rights to mother tongue education—which we also see happening—and their rights to employment, through affirmative action, plus the fact that they're often victims of crime, and they feel backed into a corner. They feel their culture is being erased.”

“Must whites in South Africa continuously bend the knee in gratitude that we haven't been exterminated yet?” asked Kallie Kriel, who leads Afrikaner rights organization AfriForum. “In this context, President Trump's offer is a tremendous acknowledgement, they feel someone in power, the most powerful political leader on earth, is listening to them and recognizing their fear and suffering.”

He said South Africa is “a mix of privileged whites and privileged blacks.”

“Of course there will be millions more blacks in poverty. I mean, look at the population numbers,” said Kriel.

“These critics can come see for themselves what it's like to live in so-called ‘white privilege.' These Afrikaners now in America, I wish them all the best.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

            Social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, was briefly inaccessible for thousands of US users early Saturday, according to Downdetector.com, which tracks internet disruptions.
    


            The site appears to have resolved the outage, as DownDetector reports are down to 690 as of 11:30 a.m. ET.
    


            Users in the United States began reporting issues on DownDetector at about 8 a.m. ET on Saturday. By 8:26 a.m. ET, more than 25,000 US users reported issues with the X platform on the mobile app and website. Users also reported issues with the server connection.
    


            More than 11,000 users in the United Kingdom and hundreds in other countries have also reported issues.
    


            DownDetector tracks user-reported issues, so the numbers may not reflect the full scale of X's outage.
    


            Problems accessing X on Friday stemmed from a data center outage, according to a post by X's engineering team on Friday at 8:03 p.m. ET. Tech magazine Wired reported there was a fire at a data center leased by X in Hillsboro, Oregon, on Thursday morning.
    


            According to Downdetector, users began experiencing issues on Thursday at about 2:00 p.m. ET. According to the X developer platform, there was a site-wide outage from Thursday to Friday that has been “resolved.” But logins with X began experiencing “degraded performance” on Friday and the “incident is ongoing.”
    


            “Our team is working 24/7 to resolve this. Thanks for your patience — updates soon,” X wrote in the post.
    


            “Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms. I must be super focused on X/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out,” Elon Musk, who acquired the platform in 2022, wrote in response to a post on X Saturday morning which said the outages may stem from the data center fire. “As evidenced by the X uptime issues this week, major operational improvements need to be made. The failover redundancy should have worked, but did not.”
    


            X did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            In late March, X experienced a widespread outage that was due to a “massive cyberattack,” according to Musk.
    


            X said in 2024 that the site averages about 250 million daily active users. Musk announced on March 28 that he sold X to xAI, his artificial intelligence start-up.

(CNN) — Astronomers have for the first time spotted two galaxies in the throes of a deep-space “duel.”
    


            Using combined observations from ground-based telescopes over nearly four years, the researchers saw the distant galactic neighbors charging toward each other at more than 1.1 million miles per hour (1.8 million kilometers per hour). One repeatedly wielded its intense beams of radiation at the other, dispersing gas clouds and weakening its opponent's ability to form new stars.
    


            “That's why we call it a ‘cosmic joust,'” said Pasquier Noterdaeme, a researcher for the Paris Institute of Astrophysics and the French-Chilean Laboratory for Astronomy in Chile who was part of the team that made the discovery.
    


            What Noterdaeme and his colleagues spied was a distant snapshot of the two galaxies in the process of merging into one large galaxy 11 billion light-years away. The findings, described in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature, provide a rare look into earlier times in the universe, when star formation and galaxy mergers were more common.
    


            Working with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, the researchers found that the “attacking” galaxy's piercing radiation comes from within its bright core, a quasar, powered by a supermassive black hole.
    


            The intense gravitational influence of a black hole draws matter toward it in such an energetic way that dust and gas heat up to millions of degrees and become luminous, according to NASA. These luminous materials spiral around the black hole before entering, forming what's called an “accretion disk,” and jets of energetic matter beam out away from the center.

            Each blast of the quasar's ultraviolet waves are about a thousand times stronger than the radiation of our Milky Way, causing hydrogen molecules from some of the “victim” galaxy's star-forming nurseries to split and disperse, according to the study.
    


            Stars form when large clumps of gas and dust reach a critical mass and collapse under their own gravity. However, researchers observed that after being dispersed by the radiation, the clouds were not dense or large enough to create new stars.
    


            As additional material from the victim galaxy is drawn within reach of the supermassive black hole, it fuels the quasar with more energy. Quasars have been known to essentially “switch off” from time to time, said study coauthor Sergei Balashev, a researcher at the Ioffe Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia, which could give molecular clouds the opportunity to reform.
    


            “It's really the first time that we can see the radiative effect of a quasar on the molecular gas of a nearby galaxy,” Balashev said. Until now, this effect had only been theorized but not confirmed through direct observation.
    


            Scientists initially wanted to observe this particular quasar more closely because of its unique features among thousands of low-resolution spectra, which are like fingerprints for distant celestial objects, offering clues about composition, temperature and activity within them.
    


            “It's really (like) finding a needle in a haystack,” Balashev said. However, the light from quasars is so powerful that it often outshines their own host galaxies, making it difficult to observe other galaxies close by, according to Noterdaeme, the study's co-lead author.

            Highly dynamic, luminous quasars are rare, according to NASA. Only about 1,000 of these objects are known to exist in the early days of the universe, Anniek Gloudemans, a postdoctoral research fellow at the National Science Foundation's NOIRLab, previously told CNN via email.
    


            “At first, we just knew there was some molecular gas between the (attacking galaxy's) quasar and us. It's only after, when we started to look with bigger telescopes, that we detected there were actually two galaxies,” Noterdaeme said.
    


            While the dueling pair appears to be overlapping in the low-resolution spectra, the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ALMA revealed the galaxies are actually separated by thousands of light-years. Using the Very Large Telescope, the researchers were able to study the density and distance of the gas affected by the quasar's radiation.
    


            Since the light from these objects came from billions of light-years away in the early universe, it's possible the two galaxies have already merged by now, but there is no way to be sure, Balashev said.
    


            Scientists believe quasars and galaxy mergers used to be far more common earlier in the universe's lifetime, said Dong-Woo Kim, an astrophysicist with the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who was not involved in the research.
    


            Galaxies merge when they are pulled toward each other by gravity, and the universe used to be more densely packed together. Over time, the universe has expanded, and more galaxies have combined into larger ones, Kim said.
    


            Noterdaeme said that 10 billion years ago was an interesting time in the universe, adding that astronomers call this period when stars formed at a rapid rate the “noon of the universe.”

            Though less frequent, galaxy mergers are still happening all the time, Kim said. Even our own Milky Way is expected to merge with the Andromeda galaxy in a few billion years, but the study team isn't certain yet whether the “cosmic joust” phenomenon is a common feature when two galaxies collide and form a larger one.
    


            “It's an exciting field to study,” Kim said. “Research like this can teach us more about the birth of new galaxies and observe how they evolve over time.”

Follow:


            President Donald Trump signed four nuclear energy-related executive orders on Friday that will speed up reactor testing, allow the Departments of Energy and Defense to build nuclear reactors on federally owned land, overhaul the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and boost the United States' mining and enrichment of uranium, a senior White House official said.
    


            The president also signed an order to restore what the White House called “gold-standard science,” which comes as the administration has cut billions in federal grants that fund scientific research and slashed staffing at several science-focused agencies.
    


            “We're signing tremendous executive orders today that really will make us the real power in this industry, which is a big industry,” Trump said during an Oval Office signing ceremony.
    


            The actions come as Trump's proposed budget calls for cutting over $400 million from the Energy Department's Office of Nuclear Energy.
    


            Interior Secretary Doug Burgum — who, along with nuclear energy company executives, joined Trump in the Oval Office — lamented what he said has been “over regulation” and heralded venture capital investment in the industry. He went on to praise Trump for committing to “energy dominance” that he said would allow the US to “win the AI arms race with China.”
    


            “What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50,” he added.
    


            One nuclear-related executive order speeds up reactor testing at Department of Energy national laboratories, expediting applications and review processes and enabling a pilot program for construction over the next two years, the official told reporters ahead of the Oval Office signing. A second order aims to reduce regulations for the Departments of Energy and Defense to build nuclear reactors on federal land, which the official said would allow “for safe and reliable nuclear energy to power and operate critical defense facilities and AI data centers.”
    


            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pointed to what he said is a national security imperative.
    


            “By having small modular nuclear capabilities, which are rapidly being fielded, that we can use on our bases here and around the world, we're creating an environment where, if things happen elsewhere, the military can be reliable,” he said.
    


            A spokesperson for the White House Office of Science and Technology said the new reactors would be “small and advanced.”
    


            Trump will also require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission – the federal body that licenses nuclear reactors – to make decisions on nuclear reactor licenses within 18 months through a third executive order.
    


            A fourth order “is focused on reinvigorating the US nuclear industrial base,” which the official said will allow the US to “start mining and enriching uranium and expanding domestic uranium conversion and enrichment capacities.”
    


            However, the US is years away from getting its enrichment capabilities up and running at full capacity. As CNN has reported, until 2023, the US got the vast majority of its enriched uranium from Russia. A bipartisan law passed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine put a stop to that, and scientists and companies are racing to produce it at home.
    


            Trump wrote that the the administration seeks to “facilitate increased deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies, such as Generation III+ and IV reactors, modular reactors, and microreactors, including by lowering regulatory and cost barriers to entry,” and it also plans to increase US nuclear energy capacity from around 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050.
    


            The executive orders do not include removing or replacing NRC commission members, the official said. But pressed on if the actions would result in any reduction in staff, the official said, “Reduction in staff is undetermined at this point, but the executive orders do call for a substantial reorganization of the organization.”
    


            The text of the order reforming the NRC, released later Friday, said that “the current structure and staffing of the NRC are misaligned with the Congress's directive that the NRC shall not unduly restrict the benefits of nuclear power,” directing them to consult with the Department of Government Efficiency to “reorganize the NRC to promote the expeditious processing of license applications and the adoption of innovative technology.”
    


            “The NRC shall undertake reductions in force in conjunction with this reorganization, though certain functions may increase in size consistent with the policies in this order, including those devoted to new reactor licensing,” the order stated.
    


            DOGE has been synonymous with sweeping cuts across the federal government.
    


            The order aimed at reforming the NRC also said the organization “has failed to license new reactors even as technological advances promise to make nuclear power safer, cheaper, more adaptable, and more abundant than ever,” and calls for them to “adopt science-based radiation limits.”
    


            “Instead of efficiently promoting safe, abundant nuclear energy, the NRC has instead tried to insulate Americans from the most remote risks without appropriate regard for the severe domestic and geopolitical costs of such risk aversion,” the order stated.
    


            Asked about the timeline of getting new reactors online, the official said that the administration is looking to test and deploy nuclear reactors within the remainder of Trump's term.

            Journalists who cover the US military say they are extremely concerned by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's constraints on press access at the Pentagon. They say the newest restrictions, outlined Friday night, appear to be “a direct attack on the freedom of the press and America's right to know what its military is doing.”
    


            The sharp words from the Pentagon Press Association came after Hegseth announced “additional credentialing procedures for press at the Pentagon in the interest of national security.”
    


            The changes make key parts of the Pentagon building off-limits to journalists unless they have an official escort.
    


            Further restrictions are likely in the coming weeks, according to a Pentagon memo that alluded to a forthcoming pledge to protect military secrets and tougher scrutiny of press credentialing.
    


            Friday night's announcement is part of a pattern. Since January, Hegseth and his Trump administration allies have taken numerous steps to stifle independent media.
    


            Hegseth, a former Fox News host, has set the tone by assailing his former colleague Jennifer Griffin (Fox's national security correspondent) and other journalists.
    


            Almost as soon as Hegseth took charge, some of the country's biggest news outlets were booted from their dedicated Pentagon workspaces. In what the Defense Department called a “media rotation program,” smaller and explicitly pro-Trump media outlets were offered workspaces.
    


            A few weeks later, the Pentagon said the press briefing room would be closed “when not in use for public briefings.”
    


            Top Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell, a close friend of Hegseth's, has only held one press briefing to date.
    


            On Friday, Parnell said on X that the access restrictions are “pragmatic changes to protect operational security.”
    


            The memo outlining the restrictions said that “while the department remains committed to transparency, the department is equally obligated to protect (classified intelligence) and sensitive information, the unauthorized disclosure of which could put the lives of U.S. service members in danger.”
    


            Hegseth himself stood accused of mishandling sensitive information in March when he sent detailed plans about a military operation in Yemen to a Signal group that included The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg.
    


            The changes announced on Friday will make it more difficult for journalists to reach Hegseth. It will also eliminate “the media's freedom to freely access press officers for the military services who are specifically hired to respond to press queries,” the Pentagon Press Association pointed out.
    


            The association represents scores of journalists who regularly cover the military. In a statement, the association said it has been trying to reach out to Hegseth and his aides “to keep in place a professional working relationship that has persisted for decades,” but to no avail.
    


            The association said it is “puzzled” about why the Defense Department “is devoting such attention to restricting Pentagon media instead of engaging with it as senior leaders have long done.”
    


            Hegseth's public comments indicate that he views the media as the opposition.
    


            He has denounced what he called the “hoax press” and promoted himself by appearing on Fox opinion shows hosted by his friends.
    


            He also enlisted right-wing content creators to increase the Defense Department's promotional efforts on social media.
    


            Podcaster Graham Allen, who helped Hegseth full-time for several months and said Friday that he was moving into a part-time role, dismissed a CBS journalist's objections to the new restrictions by saying, “you can cry harder.”
    


            But Mike Balsamo, the president of the National Press Club, said independent coverage of the military is in everyone's interest.
    


            “It keeps voters informed, strengthens democratic oversight, and sends a clear message to the world that America stands for openness and accountability,” Balsamo said. “Restricting access doesn't protect national security. It undermines public trust.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is ordering a major overhaul of the National Security Council that will shrink its size, lead to the ouster of some political appointees and return many career government employees back to their home agencies, according to two U.S. officials and one person familiar with the reorganization.

The number of staff at the NSC is expected to be significantly reduced, according to the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel matter. 

The shake-up is just the latest shoe to drop at the NSC, which is being dramatically made over after the ouster early this month of Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, who in many ways had hewed to traditional Republican foreign policy.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been serving as national security adviser since the ouster of Waltz, who was nominated to serve as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations.

The move is expected to elevate the importance of the State Department and Pentagon in advising Trump on important foreign policy moves. But, ultimately, Trump relies on his own instincts above all else when making decisions.

The NSC, created during the Truman administration, is an arm of the White House tasked with advising and assisting the president on national security and foreign policy and coordinating among various government agencies.

Trump was frustrated in his first term by political appointees and advisers who he felt gummed up his “America First” agenda.




There were roughly 395 people working at the NSC, including about 180 support staff, according to one official. About 90 to 95 of those being ousted are policy or subject-matter experts seconded from other government agencies. They will be given an opportunity to return to their home agencies if they want.

Many of the political appointees will also be given positions elsewhere in the administration, the official said.

The NSC has been in a continual state of tumult during the early going of Trump's second go-around in the White House.

Waltz was ousted weeks after Trump fired several NSC officials, just a day after the influential far-right activist Laura Loomer raised concerns directly to him about staff loyalty. Loomer has in the past spread 9/11 conspiracy theories and promoted QAnon, an apocalyptic and convoluted conspiracy theory centered on the belief that Trump is fighting the “deep state,” and took credit for the ouster of the NSC officials that she argued were disloyal.

And the White House, days into the administration, sidelined about 160 NSC aides, sending them home while the administration reviewed staffing and tried to align it with Trump's agenda. The aides were career government employees, commonly referred to as detailees.

This latest shake-up amounts to a “liquidation” of NSC staffing, with both career government detailees on assignment to the NSC being sent back to their home agencies and several political appointees being pushed out of their positions, according to the person familiar with the decision.

A White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity confirmed that the overhaul, first reported by Axios, was underway. Andy Baker, the national security adviser to Vice President JD Vance, and Robert Gabriel, an assistant to the president for policy, will serve as deputy national security advisers, according to the White House official.

Waltz, during his short tenure heading the NSC, came under searing criticism in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on an encrypted messaging app that was used to discuss planning for a sensitive military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen.

Waltz has taken responsibility for building the text chain but has said he does not know how Goldberg ended up being included.

Loomer had encouraged Trump to purge aides who she believes are insufficiently loyal to the “Make America Great Again” agenda. 

She also complained to sympathetic administration officials that Waltz was too reliant on “neocons” — shorthand for the more hawkish neoconservatives within the Republican Party — as well as what she perceived as “not-MAGA-enough” types, the person said.

It wasn't just Loomer who viewed Waltz suspiciously. He was viewed with a measure of skepticism by some in the MAGA world who saw the former Army Green Beret and three-term congressman as too tied to Washington's foreign policy establishment.

On Russia, Waltz shared Trump's concerns about the high price tag of extensive U.S. military aid to Ukraine. But Waltz also advocated for further diplomatically isolating President Vladimir Putin — a position that was out of step with Trump, who has viewed the Russian leader, at moments, with admiration for his cunning in dealings with Trump's predecessors.

His more hawkish rhetoric on Iran and China, including U.S. policy toward Taiwan, seemed increasingly out of step with Trump, who — setting aside belligerent rhetoric about taking over Greenland from Denmark — has tilted more toward military restraint and diplomacy in facing some of the United States' most challenging issues with adversaries.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Friday that U.S. Steel will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh as part of what he called a “planned partnership” that seemed to signal that he'll approve a bid by Japan-based Nippon Steel to make a big investment in the iconic American steelmaker, if not buy it outright.

Still, Trump's statement left it vague as to whether he is approving Nippon Steel's bid after he vowed repeatedly to block the deal to prevent U.S. Steel from being foreign-owned. 

More recently, Trump suggested that Nippon Steel would invest in U.S. Steel, not buy it, and one union official suggested Friday that the federal government will have a role in the company's management going forward. But investors seemed to take Trump's statement as a sign that he's approving some sort of merger, sharply pushing up U.S. Steel's shares, and the companies issued approving statements.

Nippon Steel said the partnership is a “game changer — for U.S. Steel and all of its stakeholders, including the American steel industry, and the broader American manufacturing base.” U.S. Steel said it “will remain American, and we will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel that brings massive investment, new technologies and thousands of jobs over the next four years.” 

Nippon Steel's nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden on his way out of office and, after Trump became president, subject to another national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.




In his statement Friday, Trump said that “after much consideration and negotiation, US Steel will REMAIN in America, and keep its Headquarters in the Great City of Pittsburgh.”

What Trump called a “planned partnership” will add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, he said, although it wasn't clear what the terms of the deal would be or who would control U.S. Steel under the arrangement. Neither company explained Friday how the partnership would be structured.

Japan's chief tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa told reporters Friday that he was closely watching the development. He said Nippon Steel has made a proposal that could win support from U.S. Steel and make a good investment for both Japan and the U.S.

Josh Spoores, the Pennsylvania-based head of steel Americas analysis for commodity researcher CRU, said that, from what he's seeing, “this ‘partnership' is a green light for the acquisition.”

Shares of U.S. Steel jumped 21% on the news, and continued rising in aftermarket trading.

U. S. Steel's board and stockholders approved Nippon Steel's bid last year. It has been opposed by the United Steelworkers union. The union had no immediate comment Friday. 

A union official who defied the United Steelworkers' leadership to support Nippon Steel's bid said Friday that the federal government could take on a major role in the deal.

“It's sounds like the deal's done,'' said Jason Zugai, vice president of the United Steelworkers union local at U.S. Steel's Irvin finishing plant near Pittsburgh. 

Zugai said he was “relieved, happy and thankful.'' 

He hadn't seen anything on paper but, he said, his understanding was that Nippon “will make all the profit'' and the federal government will have “a golden chair'' that allows it to veto any plans to idle or shut down U.S. Steel plants.

Keeping U.S. Steel's headquarters had always been part of Nippon Steel's bid to buy it. To sweeten the deal, Nippon Steel had offered up a $2.7 billion commitment to upgrade U.S. Steel's two blast furnaces and pledged that it wouldn't import steel slabs that would compete with the facilities.

Nippon Steel also had pledged not to conduct layoffs or plant closings during the term of the existing labor agreement and to protect the best interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters.

U.S. Steel's CEO David Burritt warned last September that blocking Nippon Steel's bid would mean U.S. Steel would “largely pivot away” from investing in its two blast furnaces — one just outside Pittsburgh and one in Gary, Indiana — and it would raise “serious questions” about remaining headquartered in Pittsburgh. 

As recently as December, Trump said he was “totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company.”

Then in February, Trump suggested that Nippon Steel wouldn't buy U.S. Steel, as it had planned, but that it would instead invest in U.S. Steel.

Last month, Trump ordered a new national security review of Nippon Steel's proposed bid.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration granted Syria sweeping exemptions from sanctions Friday in a big first step toward fulfilling the president's pledge to lift a half-century of penalties on a country shattered by 13 years of civil war.

While broad, the administration's actions could possibly be reversed. Syrians say they need permanent relief to secure the tens of billions of dollars in investment needed to rebuild after a conflict that fragmented the country, displaced or killed millions of people, and left behind thousands of foreign fighters.

A measure by the State Department waived for six months a tough set of sanctions imposed by Congress in 2019. A Treasury Department action suspended enforcement of sanctions against anyone doing business with a range of Syrian individuals and entities, including Syria's central bank.

Syria is now led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former militia commander who helped drive longtime autocratic leader Bashar Assad from power late last year.

President Donald Trump announced last week that the U.S. would roll back the heavy financial penalties in a bid to give the interim government a better chance of survival. 

The Trump administration said businesses and investors are getting the protection against sanctions they need to come back to Syria, calling it “the opportunity for a fresh start.”

“The only other option was Syria becoming a failed state and civil war,” said Mouaz Moustafa, a Syrian American advocate who had campaigned for quick, broad relief. “Now there is hope for a future democratic Syria.”




The congressional sanctions, known as the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, had aimed to isolate Syria's previous rulers by effectively expelling those doing business with them from the global financial system. They specifically block postwar reconstruction, so while they can be waived for 180 days by executive order, investors are likely to be wary of reconstruction projects when sanctions could be reinstated after six months.

The Trump administration said Friday's actions were “just one part of a broader U.S. government effort to remove the full architecture of sanctions.” Those penalties had been imposed on the Assad family for their support of Iranian-backed militias, their chemical weapons program and abuses of civilians.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Friday that in return for sanctions relief, Trump expects “prompt action by the Syrian government on important policy priorities.”

Al-Sharaa's own past has fueled doubts. The group that he led, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, was originally affiliated with al-Qaida, although it later renounced ties and took a more moderate tone. It is still listed by the U.S. as a terrorist organization.

But if al-Sharaa's government fails, the U.S. and others fear renewed conflict in Syria and a power vacuum that could allow a resurgence of the Islamic State and other extremist groups.

“If we engage them, it may work out, it may not work out. If we do not engage them, it was guaranteed to not work out,” Rubio told lawmakers this week.

Trump met al-Sharaa last week in Saudi Arabia, a day after announcing his intention to lift the sanctions: “We're taking them all off. Good luck, Syria. Show us something special.”

Rubio said sanctions relief must start quickly because Syria's transition government could be weeks from “collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions.”

But asked by lawmakers this week what sanctions relief should look like overall, Rubio gave a one-word explanation: “Incremental.”

While some sanctions can be quickly waived through executive actions like those taken Friday, Congress would have to permanently remove the penalties it imposed.

A proposal circulated among administration officials this week broadly emphasized taking all action possible, as fast as possible, according to U.S. officials familiar with the plan who were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Last week, a State Department proposal laid out a three-phase road map with temporary, partial relief initially and setting sweeping conditions for Syrians to meet for any future phases of relief or permanent lifting of sanctions, one of the officials said.

Removing “Palestinian terror groups” from Syria is first on the list of conditions to get to the second phase. Supporters of sanctions relief say that might be impossible, given the subjectivity of determining which groups meet that definition and at what point they can be declared removed.

Other conditions for moving to the second phase are for the new government to take custody of detention facilities housing Islamic State fighters and to move forward on absorbing a U.S.-backed Kurdish force into the Syrian army.

To get to phase three, Syria would be required to join the Abraham Accords — normalized relations with Israel — and to prove that it had destroyed the previous government's chemical weapons.

Israel has been suspicious of the new government, although Syrian officials have said publicly that they do not want a conflict with Israel. Since Assad fell, Israel has launched hundreds of airstrikes and seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in Syria.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Drive through the neighborhoods surrounding Indianapolis Motor Speedway and it looks like Christmas in May.

Checkered flags and “Welcome race fans” signs on every block. Neatly trimmed lawns decorated with cutout Indy cars, a mock Borg-Warner Trophy, even an inflatable version of the track's familiar golden, winged logo.

Yet the “Racing Capital of the World” is eagerly and happily sharing the Memorial Day weekend stage with the Indiana Pacers and the Indiana Fever, two teams straight from the Hoosier State's lifeblood of basketball. 

The Pacers flags and Caitlin Clark jerseys are easy to see all over town, including Gasoline Alley a few steps from the speedway's famous Brickyard.

Pacers & Racers weekend is in high gear.

“This is an epic weekend, an incredible opportunity to put Indianapolis on the minds of virtually every major sports fan on the planet,” said Chris Gahl, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Visit Indy. “Our initial research shows no other city in the U.S. has hosted this diverse level of major sporting events in such a short amount of time.”

It may be an anomaly nationally, but Indianapolis is built to thrive in this sort of spotlight.

The city has hosted the Super Bowl, two NBA All-Star Games, multiple international and national championships and, of course, now the 109th running of the Indianapolis 500. And through every virtually twist — even an NCAA men's basketball tournament held entirely in and around Indy — the reviews have come back with races.

On Saturday afternoon, Clark and the Fever host the defending WNBA champion New York Liberty in front of a sellout crowd early in a season with title hopes for a team boasting perhaps the biggest star in the league. An estimated 350,000 race fans are expected for Sunday's midday Indy 500 race, including the first sold-out grandstands since 2016. The weekend will be capped Sunday night when the Pacers host the New York Knicks for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals.

It's the fourth time an NBA game has converged with race day, and the Pacers lost each of the first three — to the Knicks in 1999, to the Pistons in 2004 and to the Heat in 2013. They went on to lose all three series, too.

The off-court, off-track stories such as the Team Penske cheating scandal, the WNBA investigation into alleged racial comments directed at Angel Reese after a Fever game and the call for international peace from Israeli-born, Russian-raised pole winner Robert Schwarzman have played into the buildup. Even the Oscar Mayer Wienermobiles came to town Friday.

In a state where the greatest athletic feats often have been defined by auto racing or basketball, this weekend seems like a fitting marriage even to locals. Just ask IndyCar team owner-driver Ed Carpenter, a longtime Pacers fan and the stepson of former speedway president and CEO Tony George.

“I think it celebrates the city, the people that live here and the fans that make the pilgrimage to the race,” he said. “(Having the other events) just makes it that much more special.”

Carpenter hopes to attend Sunday night's game — even if he wins the 500 — and now finds himself surrounded in Gasoline Alley by a growing legion of crossover fans

Six-time IndyCar Series champion Scott Dixon and three-time 500 winner Dario Franchitti attended Game 3 of the Indiana-Cleveland series. Former IndyCar driver and broadcaster James Hinchcliffe was there for Game 2 and the triumvirate of Kyle Kirkwood, Colton Herta and Marcus Ericsson went to Game 2 of the Indiana-Milwaukee series. Scott McLaughlin, a Knicks fans, has a wager on the series with Carpenter and may attend Sunday's game if he's not drinking the milk in victory lane.

“How'd that go?” fellow driver Alexander Rossi asked after the Pacers' thrilling Game 1 victory on Wednesday.

“Real bad, we lost the unloseable,” McLaughlin said. “We had a good wager. I have to buy the equivalent -- if the Pacers win in six games -- if they win in seven, the bet is off, or I win -- I have to buy the equivalent up to 2500 bucks of his (coffee/java).”

The red carpet isn't just being rolled out for the Pacers and the racers. Film director Spike Lee is expected to be in his familiar spot inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse while his old foil, Reggie Miller, calls the game for TNT. It's unclear how many big wigs from the race will make the 15-minute drive (in good traffic) to the arena for the game. Two tickets to each event would cost you nearly $4,000.

Kyle Larson, who is making his second attempt at a different kind of race day double — completing 500 miles at Indianapolis and 600 more in Charlotte's NASCAR nightcap — already has made that trip. He went to the Fever game Tuesday night. 

“Outside the car, it's been crazier this year logistics-wise,” Larson said. “Going to New York and having a full day of media there and then flying back here. Going to the Fever game was fun.”

The interest and intrigue goes the other way, too.

Three years ago, Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton made his IndyCar debut in a two-seater with Mario Andretti. Last weekend, Fever coach Stephanie White, an Indiana native, returned to the track while Fever center Aliyah Boston, the 2023 WNBA Rookie of the Year, got her first glimpse at the historic and vast 2.5-mile oval.

“Being on the track and kind of seeing how fast all the cars go, and to meet Colton was pretty dope,” Boston said. “The track is huge. Colton told us how many things could fit in the track and that's insane. You don't understand how big it is till you're there.”

Gahl said hotels are virtually sold out in Central Indiana and everywhere from Lafayette to Bloomington, roughly one-hour drives from Indy; downtown, the average cost is about $550 per night with a three-night minimum and restaurant reservations are scarce. Local merchandisers are capitalizing, too, selling blue-and-gold shirts that read “Zoom Baby,” a play off the late Bob “Slick” Leonard's radio calls of “Boom Baby” for Pacers' 3-pointers.

In the midst of so much going on in a 36-hour window, the Pacers, racers and the Fever are all following the same playbook: Ignore the distractions and celebrate this incredible weekend.

“You've got to enjoy the moment, let the excitement and pressure go, focus on the task at hand right in front of you,” Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard said. “It should be exciting and fun.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Even as his fame and wealth have soared over the decades, Bruce Springsteen has retained the voice of the working class' balladeer, often weighing in on politics — most notably when he was a regular presence on Barack Obama's presidential campaign. 

This month, though, his music and public statements have ended up as particularly pointed and contentious.

At a concert in Manchester, England, Springsteen denounced President Donald Trump's politics, calling him an “unfit president” leading a “rogue government” of people who have “no concern or idea for what it means to be deeply American.”

“The America I love, the America I've written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration,” Springsteen said in words that he included on a digital EP he released a few days later. (A few more days later, he began another gig with the nonpolitical but saliently titled track “No Surrender.”)

Trump shot back and called Springsteen highly overrated. “Never liked him, never liked his music or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy — just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,” he wrote on social media.

For decades, Springsteen has salted his songs with social and political commentary, and it's hardly surprising: One of his self-described musical heroes, the activist folk singer Woody Guthrie, played a guitar upon which was written, “This machine kills fascists.”




Here is a look at some Springsteen lyrics that ventured into current events and the plights of people caught up in them.

___

LYRIC: Down in the shadow of the penitentiary, out by the gas fires of the refinery: I'm 10 years burnin' down the road; nowhere to run, ain't got nowhere to go.”

YEAR/ALBUM: 1984, “Born in the USA”

BACKSTORY: Springsteen's most misinterpreted song — misread by Ronald Reagan and many politicians after him — tells the tale of a Vietnam vet who lost his brother in the war and came home to no job prospects and a bleak future. The driving, catchy chorus — composed primarily of the words from the song's title, which made misunderstanding it easier — turned it into an anthem, albeit one that was not a burst of patriotism but a bitter description of veterans' circumstances.

LYRIC: “Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores/Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more.”

YEAR/ALBUM: 1984, “Born in the USA”

BACKSTORY: As he moved into his second decade of fame, Springsteen started touching on themes of economic distress more. “My Hometown” is about a 35-year-old man remembering how he used to ride proudly around his town with his father when he was little. But now, he laments, “they're closin' down the textile mill across the railroad track. Foreman says, ‘These jobs are goin', boys, and they ain't comin' back.'” 

LYRIC: “No secret, my friend — you can get killed just for living in your American skin.”

YEAR/ALBUM: 2001, “Live in New York City.”

BACKSTORY: A song written about the 1999 police killing of unarmed Guinean immigrant Amadou Diallo, who was standing in front of his apartment building in the Bronx when he was peppered with 41 bullets — 19 of which went into his body. The case captivated and divided New York City, and the song's release alienated Springsteen from some of his fan base, which included cops (whose lives he had sometimes chronicled in earlier songs like “Highway Patrolman”).

LYRIC: “Shelter line stretchin' ‘round the corner. Welcome to the new world order. Families sleepin' in their cars in the southwest — no home, no job, no peace, no rest.”

YEAR/ALBUM: 1995, “The Ghost of Tom Joad”

BACKSTORY: Keying in on the ethos and tone of Steinbeck's Depression-era classic “The Grapes of Wrath,” Springsteen chronicles modern-day people at the fringes of society trying to get by on the road. “The highway is alive tonight,” he says, “but nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes.”

LYRIC: “At night they come across the levy in the searchlight's dusty glow. We'd rush ‘em in our Broncos and force 'em back down into the river below.”

YEAR/ALBUM: 1995, “The Ghost of Tom Joad”

BACKSTORY: The tale of a lonely, widowed border patrol agent who falls for one of the illegal immigrants caught crossing the border. It leads him to confront his hypocrisy and leave the job, still searching for the woman he met fleetingly. Its companion song on the album, “Across the Border,” was written from the perspective of a Mexican man dreaming of America (“For you I'll build a house high upon a grassy hill, somewhere across the border”).

LYRIC: “Lost track of how far I've gone — how far I've gone, how high I've climbed. On my back's a 60-pound stone; on my shoulder a half-mile line.”

YEAR/ALBUM: 2002, “The Rising”

BACKSTORY: Barely a year after “American Skin,” Springsteen turned back to first responders in the wake of 9/11, venerating them with a song that tells of a firefighter ascending the steps of one of the Twin Towers to save people — and, presumably dying along the way. He sings of a “sky of blackness and sorrow, sky of love, sky of tears, sky of glory and sadness, sky of mercy, sky of fear.” He takes no political position but — in his typical way — shows one of history's most political events through the lens of a regular person caught up in it. 

LYRIC: “The banker man grows fat, working man grows thin. It's all happened before and it'll happen again.”

YEAR/ALBUM: 2012, “Wrecking Ball”

BACKSTORY: A lament from an underemployed American man who can't get more than odd jobs after the financial crisis of 2007-2008. The work he does as a handyman sends him toward hopelessness, and he feels a lack of dignity. “You lose what you've got and you learn to make do. You take the old, you make it new,” the protagonist sings. But, he also allows, “If I had me a gun, I'd find the bastards and shoot 'em on sight.”

LYRIC: “Send the robber barons straight to hell — the greedy thieves who came around and ate the flesh of everything they found. Whose crimes have gone unpunished now, who walk the streets as free men now.”

YEAR/ALBUM: 2012, “Wrecking Ball”

BACKSTORY: Springsteen revisits the theme of a dying hometown, this time with more aggressiveness than lament, keying in on the financial crisis of 2007-2008. It functioned as a protest song and a rallying cry against greed and its carriers. The same album featured the song “Wrecking Ball,” a defiant challenge to people who would tear down beloved parts of northern New Jersey in the name of “progress.”

LYRIC: “Billy sat in front of his TV as the South fell and the communists rolled into Saigon. He and his friends watched as the refugees came, settled on the same streets and worked the coast they'd grew up on.”

YEAR/ALBUM: 1995, “The Ghost of Tom Joad”

BACKSTORY: An almost biblical parable about pain and old hatreds. A veteran in Galveston Bay, who'd fought in Vietnam, watches as an immigrant Vietnamese shrimper protects himself and sets out to kill him one night — but it ends with unexpected results and quiet hope. 

LYRIC: “So I bought a .44 Magnum, it was solid steel cast. And in the blessed name of Elvis, well, I just let it blast ‘til my TV lay in pieces there at my feet. And they busted me for disturbin' the almighty peace.”

YEAR/ALBUM: 1992, “Human Touch”

BACKSTORY: An expression of sardonic rage at the emptiness and hopelessness that the unremitting feed of cable TV had brought to the world. This is less political and more social, though it reflected some of the disillusionment of the age about the brain rot of popular culture. It came months before Michael Douglas' anger-management-failure movie “Falling Down” depicted an enraged man losing it and tearing a swath through Los Angeles because of the stresses of modern culture.

LYRIC: “My ship Liberty sailed away on a bloody red horizon. The groundskeeper opened the gates and let the wild dogs run.”

YEAR/ALBUM: 2007, “Magic”

BACKSTORY: A twist on the old-fashioned warning song, written from the vantage point of the future. (“We're livin' in the future, and none of this has happened yet.”) This was a commentary on a post-9/11 America that — as the song suggests — is headed in a bad direction. Oblique but devastating, particularly with such somber words against an upbeat melody reminiscent of his early work, it suggested there was still time to correct course. Which touches on a frequent Springsteen theme: possibility amid the hardship and challenge.

London (AP) — Naqi Rizvi loves the “absolute freedom” he feels on the tennis court. Winning titles is fun, too. 

The 34-year-old, blind tennis champion is on a mission to not only raise awareness but also elevate the sport into the Paralympics in the future. The London resident, fully blind from the age of 7 because of congenital glaucoma, only took up the sport a decade ago and is now the No. 1-ranked men's player in the world for his category.

Gary Sinise told Fox News Digital that he feels 'fulfilled' in his life right now and it would take a lot to get him away from his family to film a new project.

Gary Sinise would make a Hollywood comeback — if the opportunity was right.

During an interview with Fox News Digital ahead of the PBS National Memorial Day Concert, the actor said that he would return to the film and television business if the circumstances aligned.

""I can't leave home for the amount of time that I used to go and shoot a movie or something like that, but if the right thing came along — under the right circumstances and it felt right and the timing was good and it didn't take me away from home too much — I would absolutely consider it,"" Sinise said.

""It's all about timing, and it's all about the project and the people that would be involved in it. I've been blessed, you know, like I said, when you're on television on a hit show for nine years ('CSI: NY'), you can put some money away, and I've been able to use that money for good, and you know, now I can kind of be selective about what I'm doing in life.""

GARY SINISE THANKFUL FOR INNER CIRCLE, STRANGERS' SUPPORT FOLLOWING SON'S DEATH

Back in 2019, Sinise took a break from Hollywood to care for his son McCanna, known as Mac, who was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called chordoma. Mac died from cancer in 2024.

""If the right project came. I would consider it, no doubt.""

Sinise is grateful for his movie and TV career, giving him the financial freedom to care for his son during his final years.

WATCH: Gary Sinise would return to Hollywood under the 'right circumstances'

""I had a blessed career and I financially did well. And I've been able to build a foundation. I've been able to take care of the family. I was able to take care of my son during a very difficult time because he needed round-the-clock nursing care and that's not paid for by the insurance. So, there were a lot of things I've been able to do because I had a successful movie and television career,"" said Sinise.

""If the right project came. I would consider it, no doubt. I'm not out there pounding the pavement right now. Occasionally doing a paid speech or paid narration or something that only takes a little bit of time, doesn't take me away from home too long,"" he said. ""So, I put a little money away, and it helps keeps things flat, where I don't have to dip into the investments too much because I save those for special things that I want to support and donate to.""

Sinise told Fox News Digital that there were projects he passed on to be home with his family.

""There have been some things I've had to say I was unavailable for the amount of time that it would take. Some television series that would take me away from home, you know, every week and that kind of thing. I just can't do it with the situation that we're in now. With the family. I have to find the right... kind of thing,"" he said.

Sinise said he's been talking to some people about projects that would align with his current lifestyle.

""I'm talking to a few people about a couple of different things that would fit the lifestyle right now a little bit better. And that's important, you know. I got five grandkids. We're hoping for more. Leaving home for long periods of time is just not anything I want to do,"" he said.

""Right now, I want to stay home a lot more, and I'm fulfilled with the mission of the Gary Sinise Foundation."" he admitted.

The actor founded his foundation in 2011 to support veterans, first responders and their families through various programs, including smart homes, mental wellness initiatives and community outreach.

Aside from running the Gary Sinise Foundation, the ""CSI: NY"" actor will be returning for the 19th year as the PBS Memorial Day Concert's co-host.

Sinise told Fox News Digital that he initially got involved in the event after being invited by Hollywood actor, Joe Mantegna.

""He called me and said, ‘Have you heard about the National Memorial Day Concert?' And I said, 'No, I haven't.' He said, 'Well, I just got involved with it a couple of years ago. It's a big concert on the West Lawn of the Capitol, and it's televised on PBS,'"" Sinise said.

Mantegna then invited Sinise and his band to perform at the 2005 Memorial Day concert. The following year, he was asked to come back and co-host with Mantegna.

CNN's Jake Tapper discusses the Biden White House's use of the term ""cheap fakes"" for legitimate video of the president last year.

A CNN anchor is the co-author of a buzzy new book that sheds light on President Joe Biden's apparent mental decline in office and the cover-up orchestrated by his team, but various CNN figures were critical in the past of narratives that questioned his fitness.

As Jake Tapper and co-author Alex Thompson promote ""Original Sin,"" an account of the cover-up that features high-level Democratic sources, media critics have noted CNN and other mainstream outlets downplayed or were even hostile to the suggestion that Biden could be losing his grip before last year's debate against President Donald Trump.

Here are four examples at CNN.

NEW BOOK REVEALS BIDEN'S INNER CIRCLE WORRIED ABOUT HIS AGE YEARS BEFORE BOTCHED DEBATE PERFORMANCE

Videos of Biden freezing up or appearing confused at various events went viral throughout 2024, but the White House aggressively pushed back, saying some of them were edited in a misleading fashion or didn't show what they purported.

The term ""cheap fakes"" was popularized, and press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre noted from the podium that fact-checkers and mainstream outlets also embraced the term.

CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz pushed the White House's narrative last year about a video of Biden appearing to freeze up at a fundraiser with Jimmy Kimmel, saying Biden had merely ""looked out at the crowd for a few seconds"" before walking offstage with President Barack Obama, adding that ""Republicans and right-leaning media outlets"" ""used this moment to say that President Biden froze.""

Moments later during a panel discussion, CNN commentator and former Kamala Harris adviser Jamal Simmons called Biden's fundraiser moment an ""obviously selected video.""

""These are cheap fakes, [as] the White House and Biden people are calling them,"" Simmons told CNN's Erin Burnett. 

Tapper feels differently about them.

JAKE TAPPER DECLARES BIDEN WHITE HOUSE LIED ABOUT 'CHEAP FAKES' AFTER CNN PEDDLED NARRATIVE IN 2024

""The Biden White House falsely- when people showed that clip and asked what was going on- said it was a ‘cheap fake.' They did this all the time when there was video that seemed to show Biden acting in an odd or unusual, seemingly out-of-it way, they would call it a ‘cheap fake.' It was not fake. It was actual video,"" Tapper said last week. 

In a story in the aftermath of the Robert Hur report where Biden was memorably described as an elderly man with a poor memory, CNN's website published an article expressing concerns about both Biden and Trump and what type of cognitive ability was normal for a person in their 80s.

The article cited a professor who said Biden's issues with word recall were not necessarily indicative of someone having memory issues. Biden at times during the interview with Hur had difficulty remembering when he was vice president and the year of his son Beau's death in 2015.

The article concluded with the professor saying that ageism was codified in how people talk to one another, suggesting that the skepticism about Biden was a form of prejudice against the elderly.

""Ageism is not just what people do to each other. Ageism is also a mindset that you carry within yourself,"" the professor said. ""It actually impacts your health negatively.""

JAKE TAPPER'S PAST COVERAGE OF BIDEN'S COGNITIVE DECLINE UNDER SCRUTINY AHEAD OF HIS NEW BOOK

Ex-CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy repeatedly hammered proponents of the idea that Biden was in mental decline in his ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter before leaving CNN last year.

""For years, and particularly over the last few months, MAGA Media has portrayed Biden as a senile, mentally incapacitated elderly man who cannot remember what he had for breakfast, let alone run the federal government,"" Darcy wrote in a newsletter last June, before the then-president's disastrous debate.

Darcy declared the debate would give Biden an easy chance to ""puncture the narrative"" that he lacked fitness for office, suggesting Republicans had stupidly lowered the bar so much that Biden would easily clear it and come out of the debate stronger.

""That's a worry for right-wing media figures, which risk seeing their bogus narrative about Biden being ripped up in real time,"" he wrote.

Darcy also blasted the Wall Street Journal report last June about Biden's behind-the-scenes decline in his newsletter, saying it ""owes its readers — and the public — better."" Asked for comment by Fox News Digital about his past coverage, Darcy, who left CNN last year to start his own newsletter called Status, pointed to his newsletter Wednesday where he declared conservative media outlets were taking an undeserved victory lap.

BIDEN INSIDER EXPOSES HOW WHITE HOUSE 'GASLIT' THE PUBLIC ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT'S DECLINE

""For years, right-wing media pushed a warped narrative of Joe Biden as a brain-dead puppet controlled by sinister, shadowy forces. Now they're demanding vindication—but they do not deserve it,"" he wrote.

Even after Biden dropped out of the race last July, ""The View"" co-host and CNN commentator Ana Navarro was committed to defending his mental acuity in office.

Later that week, Manhattan Institute official Reihan Salam wondered if Biden should even stay in office until his term ended, but Navarro erupted that any talk about his state behind the scenes was mere speculation.

""No, it is speculation! It is speculation! Because actually, unlike you, I've actually seen the guy at 9:00 at night. I have seen him after he has had five different events in 24 hours,"" Navarro said at one point.

Navarro appeared to have a strong interest in Biden, beyond that of a typical media pundit. Although she continues to identify as a Republican, the left-wing commentator is an avid supporter of the Democratic Party, hosted the second night of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, and has referred to Biden and Harris as ""Uncle Joe"" and ""Auntie Kamala.""

CNN has stood behind Tapper's past reporting in light of his new job, pointing to examples when he aggressively covered the subject. For his part, however, Tapper has said he feels ""humility"" about his past work on Biden and praised conservative media outlets for discussing what was in plain sight.

The Indiana coroner leading an investigation to identify the victims of the alleged Fox Hollow Farm serial killer said ‘several tragedies' still remain.

The Indiana coroner working to identify victims from Fox Hollow Farm says ""several tragedies"" still remain.

In late April, Hamilton County Coroner Jeff Jellison announced his office had identified the remains of Daniel Thomas Halloran at Fox Hollow Farm in Westfield, Indiana. He's the 10th victim of suspected serial killer Herb Baumeister, but investigators have linked Baumeister to at least 25 victims. 

A spokesperson for the coroner's office previously told Fox News Digital it still has three DNA profiles that haven't been identified.

Jellison said his office is working through 10,000 bone fragments and doesn't know how many victims might be identified but told Fox News Digital in an interview there are ""several tragedies.""

""We have 10,000 bone and bone fragments, so how many victims, you know, that will be is undetermined,"" Jellison said. ""I heard someone say recently that one death is a tragedy, two or more deaths is a statistic. And I think we have several tragedies because you have to treat each one of these individuals separately.

""So, we look at it really, you know, it's not how many potential victims do we have, but let's just continue working hard to identify. And then, at the end, we'll tally that up.""

""This investigation will far exceed my time in this office,"" Jellison said.

Law enforcement believes Baumeister lured gay men to his home during the 1980s and 1990s, where he would kill them and bury their bodies on his 18-acre property, known as Fox Hollow Farm.

He often went to gay bars in the Indianapolis area when his family was out of town and, according to detectives, he would find men to bring home. Baumeister owned the Sav-A-Lot thrift store chain.

Baumeister killed himself in 1996 at a Canadian park shortly after bone fragments were found on his property, prompting authorities to launch an investigation.

Secretary Pete Hegseth denied China's assertion that Golden Dome was an effort to turn space into a 'war zone,' arguing it was only for defense of the homeland.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued stricter orders on Friday for journalists accessing the Pentagon building, as the Trump administration places further restrictions on the press.

The new rules ban credentialed reporters from most of the Department of Defense headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, without official approval and escort, Hegseth said in a memorandum.

Hegseth described the protection of classified national intelligence information and sensitive unclassified information on operational security as ""an unwavering imperative for the Department.""

""While the Department remains committed to transparency, the Department is equally obligated to protect [Classified National Security Information] and sensitive information - the unauthorized disclosure of which could put the lives of U.S. Service members in danger,"" the secretary said.

Hegseth's order will also soon require members of the Pentagon press corps to sign a form acknowledging their responsibility to protect national intelligence and sensitive information. Journalists will also be issued new badges that clearly identify them as members of the press.

""We also anticipate a forthcoming announcement of additional security measures and enhanced scrutiny on the issuance of [credentials],"" the memo said. ""Failure by any member of the resident or visiting press to comply with these control measures will result in further restrictions and possibly revocation of press credentials.""

The Pentagon Press Association, a membership organization representing the press corps covering the U.S. military, said the new rules seem to demonstrate a ""direct attack on the freedom of the press.""

""The decision is purportedly based on concerns about operational security,"" the group said in a statement. ""But the Pentagon Press Corps has had access to non-secured, unclassified spaces in the Pentagon for decades, under Republican and Democratic administrations, including in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, without any concern about OP-SEC from DoD leadership.""

Last month, the Pentagon fired three officials after announcing a leak investigation in March at the Department of Defense.

The Pentagon has also required legacy news outlets, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, Politico, NPR, CNN and NBC News, to vacate their office spaces in the building as part of a new rotation system to bring in other outlets, most of which are generally more friendly to the Trump administration, including the New York Post, Breitbart, the Daily Caller and One America News Network.

The department said the rotation system aimed to allow other media outlets the opportunity to cover the Pentagon as resident members of the press corps.

Additionally, the administration has begun using lie detector tests to probe unauthorized leaks at federal agencies. Some Department of Homeland Security officials were told they could be fired for refusing polygraphs.

The White House said Trump will not tolerate leaks to the media and that federal employees who leak material should be held accountable.

Fox News correspondent Nate Foy shares an update on the suspects arrested for allegedly assisting New Orleans' escaped prisoners on 'Special Report.'

Another suspect accused of helping inmates escape from a New Orleans jail was arrested Friday, authorities said.

The New Orleans Police Department said officers detained four people at a home, including Emmitt Weber, 28, who was arrested on suspicion of accessory after the fact of simple escape. 

Police said Weber helped two of the inmates after the jailbreak at the Orleans Parish Correctional Facility.

Weber is the latest suspect arrested for allegedly aiding those involved in the May 16 escape. As of Friday, five of the 10 escaped inmates were still at large.

The most recent arrest was made when Corey Boyd was taken into custody Tuesday.

The other inmates recaptured are Kendell Myles, Robert Moody, Dkenan Dennis and Gary Price.

Two others — Casey Smith and Cortnie Harris — have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees. Another woman, Connie Weeden, 59, allegedly gave cash to Donald via a cellphone app.

Dennis Tajer joins ‘Fox & Friends First' to discuss the D.C. plane crash and looks ahead to ensuring the tragedy never happens again.

An Army general recently confirmed that military air traffic controllers lost contact with an Army helicopter, prompting two commercial planes to perform go-arounds to avoid crashing at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), where a midair collision in January killed 67 people.

On May 1, a Delta Air Lines Airbus A319 and a Republic Airways Embraer E170 at DCA were told to perform go-arounds due to a U.S. Army Black Hawk Priority Air Transport helicopter inbound to the Pentagon Army Heliport, according to statements from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

Brig. Gen. Matthew Braman, director of Army Aviation, said a temporary control tower antenna placed in the wrong location caused military air traffic controllers to lose contact with the Black Hawk helicopter for 20 seconds, according to a report from The Associated Press.

(Reuters/Eduardo Munoz)

TWO PLANES DO 'GO-AROUNDS' TO AVOID MILITARY HELICOPTER NEAR REAGAN WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT

Even though the helicopter should have emitted its exact location, FAA officials reportedly told Braman the data received was ""inconclusive,"" varying up to three-quarters of a mile.

""It certainly led to confusion of air traffic control of where they were,"" Braman told the AP.

The antenna, which was set up while a new control tower was being built, has since been relocated to the Pentagon rooftop, the outlet reported.

FAA 'PERMANENTLY RESTRICTING' WASHINGTON HELICOPTER TRAFFIC AFTER FATAL MIDAIR COLLISION NEAR DC AIRPORT

Chris Senn, the FAA's assistant administrator for government and industry affairs, initially said in an email shared with Politico that the go-arounds could have been avoided had the Black Hawk traveled west to the heliport instead of taking ""a scenic route.""

Army Public Affairs said in a statement its internal review found ""no deviations from approved flight paths"" and ""no risk of intersecting air traffic.""

The Army claims its helicopter, which was not carrying any passengers, was continuously broadcasting via its Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) Out system throughout the flight, and the go-arounds were performed ""out of an apparent abundance of caution.""

""The first go-around occurred before PAT 23 arrived at the Pentagon helipad and was the result of an issue with sequencing of air traffic by DCA Tower,"" the Army said in the statement. ""The second occurred during PAT 23's subsequent traffic pattern and was based on conflicting positional data from legacy tracking systems.""

The close calls came less than one month after the FAA increased staffing and oversight for the DCA air traffic control team. 

TWO PLANES ABORTED LANDINGS AT DCA DUE TO HELICOPTERS IN FLIGHT PATH IN WEEK BEFORE CRASH: REPORT

The Army said it supports ongoing efforts to modernize air traffic systems, including initiatives led by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to address ""inconsistencies caused by legacy technologies.""

""We are committed to safe and professional aviation operations in all airspace,"" Braman said in the statement. ""We continue to work closely with the FAA to update procedures prior to resuming Pentagon flight operations in support of national security missions.""

After the May 1 incident, Duffy took to X to share his frustration.

""Our helicopter restrictions around DCA are crystal clear. In addition to investigations from @NTSB and @FAANews, I'll be talking to the @DeptofDefense to ask why the hell our rules were disregarded,"" Duffy wrote. 

""Safety must ALWAYS come first. We just lost 67 souls! No more helicopter rides for VIPs or unnecessary training in a congested DCA airspace full of civilians. Take a taxi or Uber – besides most VIPs have black car service.""

On May 8, Duffy announced a plan to build a new ""state-of-the-art"" traffic control system that will equip locations with better technology to reduce outages, improve efficiency and reinforce safety.

The announcement came after recent outages at Newark Liberty Internal Airport, which Duffy attributed to the previous administration's transfer of airspace control from New York to Philadelphia.

A federal judge ordered the Trump administration return a deported Guatemalan national, claiming the government did not give him a sufficient opportunity to express his concern over being deported to Mexico.

Judge Brian Murphy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled Friday that the deported foreigner, labeled as “O.C.G.” in court filings, had received a withholding of removal fromGuatemala, but was deported to Mexico despite expressing fear of returning to Mexico where he claims he was raped and held hostage. Murphy ordered the Trump administration “facilitate” the deported man's return to the U.S. for due process on his claims of persecution in Guatemala and Mexico.

“On balance, the Court finds that the public benefits from living in a country where rules are followed and where promises are kept. Rules are tedious and frustrating, but they also keep us fair and honest,” Murphy said. “The return of O.C.G. poses a vanishingly small cost to make sure we can still claim to live up to that ideal.”

The deported man's lawyers said he is in Guatemala, after being given the option of staying in Mexico or returning to Guatemala. The deported man claims he is “living in constant fear of his attackers, being unable to leave the place where he is staying, not being able to rely on the police to protect him, and not being able to see his mother for fear of exposing her to violence, among other hardships.”

JUDGE BLOCKS EXECUTIVE ORDER TARGETING JENNER & BLOCK LAW FIRM

The order to facilitate the return of the deported Guatemalan national comes as a legal battle continues to unfold in the deportation of Salvadoran national and alleged MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

The Trump administration has been ordered to return Abrego Garcia, but neither the U.S. nor the Salvadoran government has returned the deported foreign national as the case in federal court continues.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump scored hugely this week when the House gave him a one-vote victory on his “big beautiful bill” of tax cuts, spending increases, and immigration initiatives.

For past presidents, that would have been enough for a winning week, but for Trump 2.0, it was just another day and week filled with the non-stop action he has shown since returning to the Oval Office.

On Friday, for example, he returned to his dizzying tariff agenda, threatening Apple and Samsung with a 25% tax on cellular phones made overseas and a 50% tariff on European goods for failing to take his previous threats seriously.

Midweek, he welcomed the black president of South Africa into the Oval Office, where he challenged him on reports of white farmers being murdered.

And he proposed a Reagan-esque plan to defend America with a “Golden Dome” missile defense system.

Our graders this week were split. Conservative analyst Jed Babbin gave the president a “B-plus,” and was positive about the missile defense proposal. Democratic pollster John Zogby failed the president mostly over his chaotic tariff policies.

Jed Babbin

Grade: B+

Judging by President Donald Trump's standard, this was a pretty dull week. He announced his Golden Dome missile defense plan, met with South African President Ramaphosa and threatened more tariffs on European Union goods and iPhones made outside the U.S. For any other president it would have been a very busy week. For Trump, it was pretty slow. There were the usual wins and losses in court, but no one seems terribly excited about them.

The Golden Dome missile defense plan is a step forward from Reagan's “Strategic Defense Initiative,” some 40 years earlier. Former President Ronald Reagan's plan never came to fruition and didn't have the technological capabilities we have now. Trump's plan — though he wants it by the time he leaves office, which ain't happening — should be vastly more capable. It will probably be modeled on Israel's layered “Iron Dome” defense but will — obviously — have to be far larger to protect America.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa walked into a buzzsaw of criticism in the White House. Ramaphosa's government has been discriminating against white landowners. Trump's criticisms, which included showing a video of evidence, may cause Ramaphosa's fall. The Washington Post said Trump's evidence was false. It wasn't, but that's the Post for you. They are just another voice for the Democrats who don't have anything to say except “orange man bad.”

Washington, by the way, is pretty much a lawless city. You can visit, but you'll risk being carjacked or worse if you do. The murder of two Israeli embassy workers by some guy shouting “Free Palestine” was an act of terrorism. Trump should use his presidential power to take control of the situation, regardless of Mayor Muriel Bowser and the rest of the D.C. incompetents.

John Zogby

Grade: F

Not unlike President Donald Trump himself, I have no idea what he is doing with his tariff policy. Even worse, I don't know who to even call for an explanation.

This is not really funny as it is creating both confusion and angst among a wide range of stakeholders in this country and abroad. The only evidence of how it may play out is what happened with China and the United Kingdom. Tough talk, a reduction from the highest level, then almost a complete backdown.

Trump argues that his policy is creating a record-setting number of jobs. Aside from the hubris and hyperbole, who in their right minds is going to invest in creating new jobs in this milieu. And who would be hired? Probably immigrants. Oh, that! 

The House passed his “big beautiful bill” by a one-vote margin, and it will have an even tougher time in the Senate. Then there was the cryptic-crypto dinner with investors at one of his golf clubs. The president is determined to break all the rules, look as guilty as hell, and get away with whatever it is again and again.

If his goals are to confuse as many people as possible and thumb his nose at every rule and LAW that gets in his way, he gets an A+ this week. But this grader is a tad old-fashioned so I give him an F, and note that there are two of them in “tariff.“

For a crop of ambitious Democrats, the shroud of secrecy surrounding former President Joe Biden's health has become an opportunity to break with party leadership.

In recent days, a small chorus of Democrats has been litigating the wisdom of Biden running for a second term, calling the knee-jerk defense of his political viability a mistake that broke the trust of voters.

“I admit that by 2024, the American public had made up their mind, right, that they wanted the Democratic Party to nominate somebody new, and it was absolutely a mistake for the party to not listen to those voters,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) told NBC News.

The admission is a stark break from the uniform defense of Biden before he dropped out following a disastrous debate performance. Criticism was also sparse as then-Vice President Kamala Harris attempted to resurrect his flagging campaign, taking over as the Democratic nominee weeks before Election Day.

But on the other side of the election, and as Democrats grapple with a bombshell book alleging a cover-up of Biden's mental state, previously loyal politicians are now calling Nov. 5 an indictment.

“In light of the facts that have come out, Joe Biden should not have run for reelection, and we should have had an open primary,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a 2024 surrogate for Biden, told Fox News.

Democrats have generally avoided the finer details of Original Sin, the book alleging Biden staffers hid a diminished Biden from the public and even members of his administration. Murphy said Biden “was in control” during their interactions, while Khanna said he, too, saw no signs of decline when they met face to face.

But they stand as the few Democrats calling November a failure of the party. Both are also believed to have presidential ambitions, with a crowded but open field expected in 2028.

A Democratic strategist downplayed the comments made by Murphy and Khanna.

“I don't think their strategy is to break with the party. I simply think they're telling the truth,” the operative told the Washington Examiner. “With those two examples in particular, they've never had a problem telling it like it is, and that's part of their appeal.”

Another Democratic strategist, Christopher Hahn, dismissed the importance of Biden to the 2028 primary, arguing that “voters look to the future and not something that's no longer relevant.” 

“The Biden era is over,” Hahn told the Washington Examiner. “Democrats need to do a better job messaging around their core values and showing voters that they will fight for them.”

Still, Biden's health is becoming wrapped up in a broader critique of the party as Democrats look to demonstrate they will learn from their mistakes and set a better tone for the future.

Gov. Andy Beshear (D-KY) has criticized Democrats for speaking in coded language that does not resonate with the working class. Pete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary under Biden, has also described the Democratic brand as being in need of repair, prescribing a message that is not simply focused on opposing President Donald Trump.

On the question of Biden's fitness, some have been willing to go further than others. Buttigieg told an audience in Iowa this month that “maybe” the former president should not have run. Others have remained steadfastly loyal.

“I realize that reporters who are covering the wide world want to go back and relitigate what happened in 2024, and examine every little thing, and there's a book that came out that's suggesting that there was cognitive decline,” Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) told a reporter last week. “Look, all I can tell you is every interaction I had with President Biden demonstrated to me a man who has more empathy than any other president that I've known in my lifetime.”

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), who was a co-chair of Biden's campaign, told CNN she was too “busy” governing and politicking to assess the president's mental acuity.

“I was busy doing the connection and voter registration,” she said. “I didn't see the president frequently, and I can tell you I can't speak to that directly.”

In light of Biden's cancer diagnosis, revealed on Sunday in a statement from his staff, the Democratic talk of his fitness has ebbed.

But Dean Phillips, the former House Democrat who challenged Biden on a platform of generational change, has embarked on a media tour of op-eds and TV appearances to claim that he was right despite his alienation from the party.

“Faith won't be regained until members of Congress begin defending our Constitution with the same subjugation of self-interest that members of our armed forces must apply to the defense of our country,” Phillips, whose father was killed in the Vietnam War, wrote in the Wall Street Journal. “Their model made it easy for me to accept the personal and professional cost of simply telling the truth about Mr. Biden's incapacity, fulfilling my oath to office, and honoring my father and the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice to our remarkable nation.”

Phillips is also joined by a handful of progressive Democrats denouncing the party's direction but highlighting the age of lawmakers instead. David Hogg, a Democratic National Committee vice chairman, has elevated his national profile but risked his standing in the DNC for promising to primary older incumbents in Congress.

Charlie Comfort, a Democrat from the former early-voting state of Iowa, said the critiques of Murphy and Khanna are meaningless so long after the 2024 election.

Khanna is among those Democrats who repeatedly defended Biden's mental acuity during the presidential campaign.

“They should have been doing this in 2023,” Comfort told the Washington Examiner. “To me, it seems very convenient for them to suddenly make a break when, ultimately, they have been supportive of party leadership in the past couple of years. We needed new party leadership at the start of 2023, and then maybe just maybe we wouldn't be horribly in the wilderness.”

Democratic strategist Peter Daou, who once advised Hillary Clinton‘s 2008 campaign before leaving the party in 2020, said that “even Democratic voters, I think up to 50% of voters, wanted somebody other than Biden.”

“So seeing Democratic officials and, you know, consultants, strategists, and media figures suddenly coming out of the woodwork, saying, ‘Oh, it was a mistake to run Biden,' is way too little, too late,” Daou told the Washington Examiner. “The Biden team were doing all sorts of tricks and really just like, putting pressure on state parties and local officials to prevent any challenges to him.”

On whether Democrats are capable of change, especially in a two-party system, Daou added: “I don't think Democrats can do anything to reform themselves. … I look at all of that as rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.”

The Trump administration faces an uphill battle in its fight to remove Harvard University‘s ability to enroll foreign students, as President Donald Trump takes aim at the university for its alleged violations of civil rights laws and executive orders.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's Thursday move to revoke Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification prompted the institution to file a lawsuit, which it did on Friday in a federal district court in Massachusetts. Judge Allison Burroughs of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts quickly granted a temporary restraining order and said it was necessary to “preserve the status quo pending a hearing.”

Burroughs, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, has ruled against Trump various times, including when she signed a temporary restraining order in January 2017, blocking the president's order restricting travel from seven Muslim majority countries. She also ruled in favor of Harvard in a 2019 lawsuit claiming the institution's affirmative action policies were discriminatory. Both matters ultimately made their way to the Supreme Court, with the travel ban going before the high court via a different case, and both of her initial decisions were reversed.

While the administration may not likely prevail in the lower courts, the larger legal battle could weigh accusations of unlawful retaliation against the president's executive authority.

The DHS website states that the government can decline to recertify a school's SEVP certification for “any valid and substantive reason.” Some of the reasons listed include “failure to maintain proper facilities for instruction” and “failure to operate as a bona fide institution of learning.”

Noem, in her letter to Harvard officials Thursday, claimed the revocation was due to a failure to comply with DHS reporting requirements. She also said the university was “perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies.”

The university has faced significant pressure from the Trump administration over its handling of antisemitism and other matters in recent years. Trump has called for the university's tax-exempt status to be revoked and has taken rhetorical swings at the famous institution.

In its court filing Friday, Harvard alleged that the Trump administration was engaging in a “blatant violation of the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act” with its actions.

“It is the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the ‘ideology' of its faculty and students,” the lawsuit said.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to the Washington Examiner Friday that the Trump administration has “the law, the facts, and common sense on our side,” citing the president's Article II powers for his authority to go forward with the action.

Trump's 2020 election campaign lawyer, John Eastman, believes the president has the authority to decide whether Harvard can allow international students to enroll, similar to his authority to carry out the 2017 travel ban.

“The Supreme Court ultimately upheld his authority to do that. Targeting it to a particular institution is a different layer, but the legal argument they're making is there is a significant portion of these foreign students that are engaging in antisemitic, anti-Israel violence on that campus, and Harvard isn't doing anything about it, so we can and we will,” Eastman said.

University of California, Berkeley professor John Yoo disagreed with Eastman's assertion, saying the move against Harvard affects more countries than the 2017 order.

“I don't think this is the same order as the first-term travel ban. The travel ban aimed only at certain countries where the U.S. believed terrorism was not under control,” Yoo said. “Here, no international student can study at Harvard, no matter what country they are from — South Koreans and Italians are affected as much as students from those countries from the travel ban.”

University of Richmond Law Professor Carl Tobias said he believes it “seems to be a real problem” that the Trump administration appears to have made Harvard a target with its various actions. He thinks judges “seem very alert to that,” citing Burroughs's pause of the measure pending a hearing.

JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP ORDER ENDING HARVARD'S ABILITY TO ENROLL FOREIGN STUDENTS

“I think Trump and Noem have said things in the public sector that show how they want to punish Harvard, and I don't think you can use the power of the state to punish, you know, people you want to have retribution against,” Tobias said. “I think that' shaping up as one of the primary problems about this administration.”

A hearing on a preliminary injunction for the order has been scheduled for May 29 at a courtroom in Boston.

The Trump administration said Columbia University violated a civil rights law because it acted with “deliberate indifference towards student-on-student harassment of Jewish students from October 7, 2023, through the present.”

The Health and Human Services Department announced the violation on Thursday night and said “Columbia continually failed to protect Jewish students” because it didn't establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism until the summer of 2024, among several other reasons.

“The findings carefully document the hostile environment Jewish students at Columbia University have had to endure for over 19 months, disrupting their education, safety, and well-being,” said Anthony Archeval, acting director of the Office for Civil Rights at HHS. “We encourage Columbia University to work with us to come to an agreement that reflects meaningful changes that will truly protect Jewish students.”

It's unclear whether the administration will enforce penalties on Columbia aside from the more than $400 million in grants and contracts the administration has already suspended. “We understand this finding is part of our ongoing discussions with the government,” a spokesman for the university said in a statement to the New York Times.

One way the Trump administration could punish Columbia further is through the False Claims Act.

The act, which allows the government to recover funds lost due to fraud and impose penalties, has enabled the Trump administration to accuse institutions of fraud for accepting federal funds tied to their compliance with civil rights laws.

The Trump administration has found numerous institutions, especially schools, in violation of civil rights statutes such as Title VI, Title VII, and Title IX due to race-based opportunities, scholarships, and hiring, a lack of enforcement against campus antisemitism, and allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's sports.

Columbia was the epicenter of the pro-Palestinian protests last year and has been accused of allowing antisemitism to occur on its campus for years.

HOUSE PASSES LANDMARK ‘ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' TO DELIVER TRUMP'S TAX CUTS

HHS also said Columbia didn't respond properly to Jewish student complaints, didn't abide by its policies when addressing misconduct against Jewish students, did not investigate or punish antisemitic vandalism, or enforce its time, place, and manner restrictions for protests held on campus.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

People in a vegetative state may be far more aware than was once thought, Sarah Zhang reports in a recent feature. “In some extraordinary patients, the line between conscious and unconscious is more permeable than one might expect,” she writes. As scientists continue to try to comprehend the inner life of unresponsive patients, their work raises questions both for those living with these conditions and for the people who love them. Can these individuals hear us, and even understand us? What do we owe them? Today's reading list explores the human mind, and what it feels like to love somebody who cannot communicate the way they once did.

Republicans routinely criticized Democrats for rushing bills through Congress. Now that they're in power, they don't seem to mind.

When Democrats reshaped the American health-insurance system in 2010, Republicans accused them of all manner of legislative foul play: Middle-of-the-night votes. Backroom deals. An enormous, partisan bill jammed through Congress before anyone could find out what was in it. “Have you read the bill? Hell no you haven't!” an indignant then-House Minority Leader John Boehner thundered on the House floor.

The GOP's claims were exaggerated. But as Republicans rushed President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” through the House this week, they committed just about every procedural misdeed they had ascribed to Democrats back then—and more. The final text of a 1,100-page bill that Speaker Mike Johnson described as “the most consequential legislation that any party has ever passed” became public just hours before Republicans approved it on a party-line vote. They scheduled a pivotal hearing to begin at 1 a.m. and waived their own rules meant to give lawmakers at least three days to review legislation before a vote. One Republican even missed the climactic roll call because, the speaker explained, he fell asleep.

Jonathan Chait: The largest upward transfer of wealth in American history

“If something is beautiful, you don't do it after midnight,” a conservative critic of the bill, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, scolded in a speech delivered shortly before 2 a.m. on Thursday.

To Democrats who chided them for their haste, Republicans replied with reminders of their own long-ago procedural end runs, as if to say, What goes around comes around. Hypocrisy abounds in both parties, and the path to passage for any major legislation is rarely smooth or pretty. But the GOP's aggressive drive to force through Trump's agenda fits a pattern that's emerged in each of his presidential terms: Rather than avoid the transgressions they've alleged Democrats have committed, Republicans have instead used them as license to go even further.

In 2017, the GOP confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court only after it eliminated the Senate filibuster for nominees to the high court. As justification, Republicans cited the Democrats' earlier move to scrap the Senate's 60-vote threshold for lower-court and executive-branch nominees—a change Republicans had denounced at the time.

Earlier this year, as Trump was trying to freeze congressionally authorized funding and shut down federal agencies without approval from lawmakers, I asked Republicans whether there was a line the president could not cross. They responded by talking not about Trump but about Joe Biden. “Could the president do something totally unconstitutional, in violation of what Congress wants entirely?” Representative Mario Díaz-Balart of Florida asked, before quickly answering his own question: “You mean, like student loans?”

As Díaz-Balart and other Republicans saw it, Biden had defied first Congress and then the Supreme Court in his push to unilaterally forgive billions of dollars in college debt beginning in 2022. Democrats did provide the GOP some fodder for that argument: Then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi had said categorically that the president could not wipe out student debt on his own. “He does not have that power,” she told reporters in July 2021. “That has to be an act of Congress.” Then, after the Supreme Court struck down Biden's $400 billion loan-cancellation program—while citing Pelosi's statement—Biden responded defiantly. “The Supreme Court blocked me from relieving student debt. But they didn't stop me,” he said. “I'm going to keep going.”

Yet Biden also made clear that he would not defy the Court's ruling but instead would pursue more limited debt-relief plans in ways his administration believed were “legally sound.” Now, instead of interpreting the Court's rebuke of Biden as a limit on executive authority, Republicans are claiming it as an excuse for Trump to expand presidential power even more.

In the House this week, some Republicans were willing to call out their own party for trying to rush such a far-reaching bill through the chamber. “It's step on the gas and jam it through, because that's the way this place works,” Representative Chip Roy of Texas told reporters. “It is a mistake.” Roy was one of the final conservative holdouts, but like most of his GOP colleagues, he ended up voting for the bill despite his misgivings about the process. “And as with most major bills in Washington,” he acknowledged in a statement afterward, “this bill was rushed, mashed together, and crammed through the House without sufficient time to review every item carefully. We should do better.”

As recently as December, conservatives forced GOP leaders to abandon a 1,547-page spending bill negotiated with Democrats, largely at the behest of Elon Musk, who was then the incoming head of DOGE. This time, no such rebellion materialized.

Johnson's Memorial Day deadline for passing Trump's plan through the House was largely arbitrary. Congress must raise the nation's debt limit by sometime this summer, and taxes for most Americans will go up if lawmakers don't extend the president's 2017 tax cuts by the end of the year. Conservatives had asked for another week or two to consider the bill, but Johnson and Trump succeeded in pressuring them to vote quickly so that the Senate could start working on it. Republicans want Trump to sign his second-term centerpiece, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, into law by July 4, and leaders of both parties have learned that lawmakers rarely compromise without the forcing mechanism of a tight deadline.

“The voters want results. They don't want incessant debates,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told me, defending the speed with which Republicans advanced Trump's bill. “We could debate this thing for months and months and not get any results for people who are struggling, and that's not going to help those families who gave us this mandate.”

Read: Republicans still can't say no to Trump

Scalise was in his first full term in Congress when Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act. At the time, he joined Republicans in accusing them of rushing the bill through without sufficient transparency or debate. Yet Democrats spent many more months negotiating Obamacare than Republicans have spent on Trump's legislation. When I asked Scalise how he'd respond to critics who say the GOP is doing exactly what they criticized Democrats for, he pointed out the many committees that had held public hearings on the “big, beautiful bill” in the past few weeks (the House held similar sessions in 2010) and blamed Democrats for trying to delay the measure. “If Democrats want to drag it on and on and on, and then complain that it's going late at night, that's a little hypocritical,” Scalise said. (In fact, it was the GOP that scheduled a key hearing in the Rules Committee to begin in the wee hours of the morning.)

Other Republicans offered a different excuse: They were too young to remember the ACA fight. Just 27 members of the GOP conference were serving in the House at the time. “I wasn't there. I ain't that old,” the 66-year-old Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona told me. He joined Congress in 2017 and was a state legislator in 2010. We were speaking on Tuesday, when the GOP bill was still in flux, and Biggs, a conservative, was still on the fence. “I always tell the speaker, if I don't have time to read the bill, I'm probably a no,” Biggs said. Evidently, Biggs is a fast reader. When the House voted on the megabill less than 48 hours later—and about 10 hours after its final text was released—Biggs was a yes.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The new Netflix miniseries Sirens has beachy vibes but a dark heart.

The beach-read vibes are strong with Sirens, a Netflix miniseries set on a moneyed northeastern island compound that, at first glance, seems awfully familiar. The hydrangeas bloom with manicured abandon. The dramatic tension is stoked with top-shelf liquor and minor acts of class warfare. Absolutely everyone has secrets. The enigmatic trophy wife at the center, Michaela, is played not by Nicole Kidman—as is, at this point, stylistic tradition—but by Julianne Moore, effusing lavender mist and toxic insecurity. Michaela is planning an end-of-summer gala, assisted by her sharp-elbowed assistant, Simone (played by Milly Alcock), but things are thrown into chaos with the arrival of an unexpected guest: Simone's down-at-heel, grimly judgmental sister, Devon (Meghann Fahy).

The theatricality of the setup—the disruptive stranger, the impending event that will inevitably go very wrong—isn't happenstance. Sirens was originally a play by the writer Molly Smith Metzler (Maid, Orange Is the New Black), which premiered in 2011 under the title Elemeno Pea. Fully Netflixed by Metzler into a five-episode adaptation, the final product is a triumph of the popular-novel-to-series genre: funny, caustic, absurd. The point of this kind of show, typically, is to marry coastal-mansion lifestyle porn with a little light mystery—a body swept onto shore, a metaphorical skeleton rattling its way out of the walk-in closet. On Netflix's The Perfect Couple, for instance (a 2024 adaptation of Elin Hilderbrand's novel of the same name), the question of who murdered a wedding guest is less gripping than Kidman's high-diva turn as a matriarch with a perplexingly ambiguous accent who's as stiff as a Barbie doll in pale-pink silk.

Read: Nicole Kidman's perpetual trick

Sirens, though, has a more satirical bent, a whiff of White Lotus–esque eat-the-rich cynicism and some truly jarring insight into the bought intimacies of lonely 0.001-percenters. By focusing on the scruffy, foul-mouthed Devon—who waits tables in a falafel shop and has been single-handedly caring for her and Simone's ailing father (Bill Camp)—the show sets up a collision based on class, an outsider's dissection of this strange new world. In the first episode, Devon, enraged by an Edible Arrangement her sister has sent in lieu of actually responding to her texts or helping at home, furiously carts said fruit basket via bus, ferry, and a miles-long walk in order to throw lukewarm pieces of melon at Simone. “Don't send me fruit, you stupid bitch,” Devon shrieks, adding, with confusion, “Who are you? No, seriously. You're dressed like a doily.”

Fahy has played the sphinxlike wife of a compulsive cheater on The White Lotus, and the sassy sidekick of a bride-to-be on The Perfect Couple. Devon is darker, and much funnier—sour, sweaty, gulping water from a sprinkler by the side of the road in early scenes while an appalled dog walker watches. She's desperate to liberate Simone from what she sees as a fundamentally toxic job, but Simone, a yapping blond lapdog in Lilly Pulitzer, has never felt more herself than she does under Michaela's wing. And casting Moore is a fascinating stretch—she's an actor better known for embodying wounded birds than temperamental alphas, and so her Michaela feels notably vulnerable from the get-go. Fittingly, Michaela's quirk is that she's turned her billionaire husband's compound into a sanctuary for rescued raptors, tending to birds of prey so that they can be unleashed into the wild to kill things anew. Her other hobby, so to speak, is described by her acolytes as her “radical generosity”—spending astonishing amounts of money to help women from humble backgrounds ascend to the highest climbs of society. Devon, you sense, might be her greatest challenge yet.

As thrilling as Fahy is to watch, in some ways, the dynamic between Michaela and Simone is the least predictable part of Sirens: the controlled, high-strung society queen being endlessly fussed over by her enthralled attendant. In the first episode, Simone and Michaela check the state of each other's breath before an event; when Simone's fails to pass muster, Michaela gives her assistant her own chewed-up piece of gum, which Simone pops into her mouth without hesitation. Simone also helps Michaela sext her husband, a billionaire named Peter Kell (played irresistibly by Kevin Bacon), squeezing Michaela's breasts together and drafting language that's “dirty but not too dirty.” And maybe it's the Careless People of it all, but I gasped out loud when a fragile Michaela climbed into bed for the night next to Simone, gazing into her assistant's eyes and demanding secrets like an 8-year-old at a sleepover.

Read: The awful secret of wealth privilege

Metzler is clearly fascinated by money and class, particularly as they intersect with gender. Maid, which starred Margaret Qualley as a young mother who flees an abusive relationship and ends up balancing on a knife-edge of homelessness and badly paid domestic work cleaning rich people's houses, took pains to communicate all the ways in which surviving poverty is its own full-time job. Sirens carefully contrasts the repetitive, arduous work done by Michaela's staff with the #werk performed by Michaela and her devotees. Simone's job skirts the two—she's expected to fawn over her boss and to buttress her emotionally while also dealing with the unpleasant parts of managing a household that Michaela would rather outsource. But Sirens is also particularly thoughtful on the subject of power and how women often wield it, blurring lines between obligation and intimacy—and knowing, always, that the terms of unspecified relationships can change without warning.

Nevertheless, Sirens is a very fun show. In a requisite shopping scene, as Devon is made into a woman fit to attend Michaela's gala, she wears a sulky sneer throughout that offsets the $22,000 spotted monstrosity her new companions dress her in. (“I look like Beetlejuice!”) Even while the series seems to sense that the dynamics between the three women are the reason we're watching, it continually throws up haphazard potential mysteries: cult-like antics, reclusive former spouses, all those birds. I understand why, but they're much less diverting than the relationships the show excavates, the loyalty and love you can buy but never fully count on.

On a special edition of Washington Week With The Atlantic, CNN's chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper and the Axios political correspondent Alex Thompson joined Jeffrey Goldberg to discuss Original Sin, their new book about when Joe Biden started showing signs of decline—and how some people behind the scenes questioned his fitness to serve as president.

In the four months since Biden left office, a consensus seems to have emerged that the former president's bid for reelection all but guaranteed Donald Trump's return to power. “There was the fine Joe Biden … and then there was the nonfunctioning Biden,” Tapper said last night. “And the nonfunctioning Biden would rear his head increasingly and more and more disturbingly as time went on.”

“Now the question is,” Tapper continued, “when did the nonfunctioning Biden emerge so often it was a real question as to whether he should serve for president?”

The president returns to West Point having transformed his relationship with the armed forces.

The last time President Donald Trump addressed Army cadets at West Point, he was locked in a dramatic conflict with America's military establishment.

Two days before Trump spoke to the academy's graduates in June 2020, Army General Mark Milley, the nation's top military officer, had made an extraordinary televised apology for having appeared in uniform with the president outside the White House, after security personnel used force to clear peaceful protesters from the scene.

Two weeks before Trump's commencement address, Defense Secretary Mark Esper had made what turned out to be an irreparable break with the president when he pushed back on Trump's desire to use active-duty troops to put down unrest triggered by the killing of George Floyd. Trump had mused about shooting protesters in the legs, according to Esper, who later wrote, “What transpired that day would leave me deeply troubled about the leader of our country and the decisions he was making.” Trump, who denied suggesting that protesters be shot, fired Esper five months later.

From the November 2023 issue: The patriot

Trump's impulse to enlist the military to respond to nationwide protests generated an outcry from some retired officers, who denounced what they saw as presidential overreach. Most notably, James Mattis, who as Trump's first defense secretary had tried to steer the president away from decisions he feared would endanger allies or undermine U.S. security, decried Trump's effort to politicize the military and divide Americans.

That now feels like a different era.

As he returns to West Point to speak at the academy's commencement today, Trump faces little resistance from the Defense Department. Instead, in selecting civilian leaders at the Pentagon, the president has prioritized perceived loyalty rather than experience. In doing so, he has brought the Defense Department much closer in line with his MAGA political agenda than it was in his first term, and raised questions about who, if anyone, will attempt to stop him if he tries to use the military in unconstitutional ways.

Unlike Mattis, Milley, and Esper, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth—a former Fox News host and National Guard soldier with little management background—has acted as an accelerant for Trump's political priorities. He has moved swiftly to root out military diversity programs, overturned Joe Biden–era decisions on transgender troops and the COVID-19 vaccine, and altered combat standards in ways that might push women out of certain jobs.

Hegseth has also expanded U.S. forces' involvement in repelling illegal migration, augmenting troops' power to detain migrants at the southern border, ordering military deportation flights, and expanding camps to house migrants at the U.S. base at Guantánamo Bay. Although the military has long been one of the country's most respected institutions, its standing has fallen dramatically in recent years, and pulling U.S. troops more deeply into polarizing activities such as policing the border could further erode Americans' trust in the armed forces.

Like Trump himself, Hegseth has brought a combative, norm-busting approach to his leadership of the Pentagon, attacking enemies online, deriding the “fake news” media, and flouting government security rules. On Wednesday, he led a Christian prayer service in the Pentagon auditorium, a highly unusual move for the leader of a workforce comprising more than 3 million people who come from a wide range of backgrounds and faiths.

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General Dan Caine, was nominated by Trump after the president abruptly fired General Charles Q. Brown, the second Black officer to serve in that role, and other top officers in February. A respected former National Guard officer with less command experience than most previous JCS chairmen, Caine has maintained a low profile so far and has said little about his views. In his confirmation hearing, Caine—who denied a story Trump has told about him wearing a MAGA hat when they met on a military base in Iraq—said he would be willing to be fired for following the Constitution. (Other top brass, anticipating moves by Hegseth to slim down the military's uppermost ranks, have sought to keep their head down and avoid contentious issues.)

Tom Nichols: A Friday-night massacre at the Pentagon

The service academies, including West Point and the Naval Academy, are now at the center of the administration's push to remake military culture. In response to a White House order that bans the teaching of “divisive concepts” and references to racism in American history at the academies, leaders at the schools have removed books from library shelves and are altering curricula. Sometimes acting in anticipation of the administration's preferences, they have also shut down student groups related to race, gender, and ethnicity, and canceled speakers and events they feared could violate the new rules.

It's difficult to know how West Point cadets feel about all this. The academy has no independent student newspaper and few venues for students to voice their views on such issues. Cadets, like most service members, usually keep their political beliefs to themselves.

Kori Schake, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told me that Trump is undermining core tenets of U.S. military culture, including the institution's apolitical nature and service members' sworn allegiance to the Constitution rather than to any one person. While the checks from Trump's first term are long gone, Schake said, “what I see as continuity from 2020 is President Trump trying to corrode the good order and discipline of the American military to establish a much more personalistic kind of loyalty.”

In his 2020 remarks at West Point, Trump largely stuck to a typical presidential script, congratulating troops on making it through the rigors of academy life and eulogizing Army leaders including Douglas MacArthur and George Patton. Perhaps his speech today will take a similar tone. If it does, it will mark a departure from his more recent appearances at troop events. When he addressed service members at Al Udeid Air Base, in Qatar, this month, Trump sounded like no other president has in a military setting. He criticized “fake generals” who fail to adhere to his worldview, belittled the role of allies such as France in winning World War II, and suggested that he might run for a third term.

Trump praised the service members assembled around him for “defending our interests, supporting our allies, securing our homeland.”

“And you know what? Making America great again,” he continued. “That's what's happened. It's happened very fast.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

RFK Jr. is prepared to rework the FDA's official assessment of the abortion pill mifepristone based at least in part on a questionable report.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has had a long love affair with junk science, and as secretary of Health and Human Services, he has embraced it once more, most brazenly to justify his false claims that vaccines cause autism. Last week, he brought yet another shoddily designed study to a different fight. In a Senate Committee hearing, he cited a report that few scientists would recognize as science in order to justify an FDA safety review of the drug mifepristone, which is used in the majority of abortions in the United States.

President Donald Trump had previously asked HHS to study the drug's safety, and Kennedy emphasized at the hearing that a review of the drug would be a top FDA priority. The unusually high rate of adverse events identified in the report, he noted, “indicates that at very least, the label should be changed.” In other words, the top U.S. health official is prepared to rework—based at least in part on a poorly designed report that has not undergone scientific review—the government's official guidance on a widely used drug.

The report that Kennedy cited was posted late last month to the website of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.–based think tank focused on “pushing back against the extreme progressive agenda while building a consensus for conservatives,” according to its website. The study's authors, Jamie Bryan Hall, EPPC's director of data analysis, and Ryan Anderson, the organization's president, are not health experts, and neither seems to have a record of publishing scientific research through peer review. Their methods deviated wildly from what is standard in the world of health research, and so, predictably, did their conclusions: In sharp contrast to dozens of trials conducted around the globe over decades, the EPPC report determined that mifepristone is a danger to women.

The EPPC has written that its report “presents a careful and conservative assessment of abortion pill safety.” However, the study lacks basic transparency about how that assessment was made. The authors relied on data from an insurance database that, according to the report, included more than 800,000 mifepristone abortions from 2017 to 2023. But the authors don't actually say which database they used, so “there's no way for anybody to try to re-create their analysis to see if they receive the same results,” Sara Redd, of the Center for Reproductive Health Research in the Southeast at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health, told me. (In an email, Hunter Estes, EPPC's communications director, told me that the center's contract with their data vendor prevents EPPC from sharing the name of the database or even of the vendor. But, he added, “this insurance data is available from approximately a dozen data brokers and is widely used by researchers and health professionals.”)

The report also took some peculiar methodological steps to arrive at its conclusions. One of its key findings is that more than 10 percent of people who take mifepristone experience what the study refers to as “serious adverse events.” (A variety of studies put the rate of significant adverse events from medical abortions involving mifepristone at less than 0.3 percent, which makes the drug safer than Tylenol and Viagra.) But the EPPC study's unusually wide-ranging criteria for defining those events raise a lot of questions. The researchers counted ectopic pregnancy as an adverse event, arguing that doctors should have ruled it out before prescribing mifepristone. (The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists acknowledges that mifepristone can be dangerous in cases of ectopic pregnancy but says that ruling out the rare condition—a process that involves an ultrasound—is unnecessary for most women taking the drug.) The authors counted episodes in which a surgical procedure was required to complete the abortion after mifepristone—patients require additional treatment in about one in 20 cases, so the FDA considers this a recognized outcome rather than an adverse effect. They counted “other life-threatening adverse events,” including heart problems and mental-health concerns, that women in the study experienced in the weeks after the abortion—which may have had nothing to do with mifepristone.

They also counted “serious” events documented during emergency-room visits made within 45 days of a patient taking mifepristone. However, the report doesn't fully explain how they knew that those events were connected with mifepristone, and to judge which ones counted as “serious,” they used a scale designed for cancer research, which has not been validated for use in studies of abortion care. Loosely counting emergency-room visits could artificially inflate the estimate of risk associated with getting an abortion, Ushma Upadhyay, an epidemiologist and a reproductive-health researcher at UC San Francisco, told me: In a study she led of abortion-related emergency-room visits from 2009 to 2013, half of patients had such mild symptoms that they did not need any treatment. She also said that the authors did not effectively distinguish between the outcomes of abortions and of miscarriages treated with mifepristone, or between normal amounts of post-abortion bleeding and severe hemorrhage.

In the weeks following the report's publication, EPPC published two follow-up documents with more details about the study's methodology, which experts told me are still not convincing. As the documents explained, the authors relied on diagnostic codes to separate miscarriages, which are often also treated with mifepristone, from abortions—a practice that may yield imprecise results. The report included only suicidal and homicidal ideation among mental-health diagnoses categorized as serious adverse events—but that still does not prove that those diagnoses were connected to an abortion, Redd told me. It used “only codes related to hemorrhage or serious bleeding (according to the FDA definition)”—which would still not be enough to distinguish between the normal amount of post-mifepristone bleeding and something more serious, Upadhyay said.

According to EPPC, peer review of the report was not possible due to “extensive pro-abortion bias in the peer-review process,” but a group of data scientists, analysts, and engineers “conducted and validated” the project, with assistance from doctors. None of their names appears on the report. When I asked about that decision, the EPPC representative wrote, “It is routine for individuals with controversial opinions to be subjected to a range of personal and professional attacks, including threats of violence in their own homes.”

So far, the most prevalent attacks on the study have been about its substance. Alice Mark, an ob-gyn and the medical director of the National Abortion Federation, told me that “to call it a study dignifies it too much.” Some anti-abortion advocates, too, have cautioned against overstating the study's rigor: Earlier this month, Politico reported that Christina Francis, the CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life OBGYNs, said on a private Zoom call with anti-abortion leaders that although the report contains credible data and should inspire further research, it is “not a study in the traditional sense” and “not conclusive proof of anything.”

Anti-abortion activists have long seen mifepristone as a problem. In the years since the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn the national right to abortion, abortions have increased in part due to a 2021 FDA decision that allowed mifepristone and misoprostol (a drug often used in parallel for abortion) to be prescribed via telehealth and mailed. According to reporting by Politico, questioning mifepristone's safety is part of a larger strategy called “Rolling Thunder” that aims to cut off that access. High-quality data have failed to validate those questions, so second-rate research has often been used to make the case against mifepristone. In 2023, for example, a federal judge ruled that mifepristone should be taken off the market by citing low-quality studies that reported adverse effects from mifepristone. (The Supreme Court later threw out the lawsuit on procedural grounds.) Due to their “lack of scientific rigor,” two of the studies cited were ultimately retracted by the journal that had published them.

When, in the past, the FDA has evaluated mifepristone's safety—which it's done several times since mifepristone's initial approval, in 2000—it has expanded access to mifepristone rather than curtailed it. If the agency evaluates mifepristone again, and its staff are allowed to independently assess the science, the FDA could loosen its rules for mifepristone even more, Elizabeth Raymond, an ob-gyn and a researcher who specializes in mifepristone safety, told me. Plenty of data support using mifepristone later in pregnancy than is currently approved, for instance.

But Upadhyay told me she worries that FDA Chief Marty Makary—who has previously claimed that fetuses can “resist” the tools of abortion by 20 weeks of gestation—or Kennedy could put their thumb on the scale to restrict mifepristone access, regardless of what FDA staff recommend. “I don't want them to do a review, because I don't trust them to base any decisions they make on science,” Upadhyay said. (HHS and the FDA did not answer my questions about the FDA's plans to review mifepristone safety on the basis of the EPPC report. In an email, an HHS spokesperson told me of the FDA, “The agency rigorously evaluates the latest scientific data, leveraging gold standard science to make informed decisions.”)

Although Kennedy has said that he reads scientific papers critically for a living, his approach to the medical literature most resembles “an extreme version of what lawyers do to defend a client: create a narrative and then find supporting evidence,” Robert Califf, who led the FDA under Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, told me an email. The scientific method involves the opposite: constructing a hypothesis and trying to disprove it with an open mind. When different people conducting the same experiment come to the same conclusion, it's not a sign of a shared ideology; it's a sign of a shared reality.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Americans remained scared of violent crime. The numbers tell a different story.

by  Bryan Walsh

The astounding drop in violent crime that began in the 1990s and extended through the mid-2010s is one of the most important — and most underappreciated — good news stories of recent memory. That made its reversal during the pandemic so worrying.

In the first full year of the pandemic, the FBI tallied 22,134 murders nationwide, up from 16,669 in 2019 — an increase of roughly 34 percent, the sharpest one-year rise in modern crime record-keeping. In 2021, Philadelphia alone recorded a record 562 homicides, while Baltimore experienced a near-record 337 murders. Between 2019 and 2020, the average number of weekly emergency department visits for gunshots increased by 37 percent, and largely stayed high through the following year. 

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

By the 2024 election, for the first time in awhile, violent crime was a major political issue in the US. A Pew survey that year found that 58 percent of Americans believed crime should be a top priority for the president and Congress, up from 47 percent in 2021. 

And yet even as the presidential campaign was unfolding, the violent crime spike of the pandemic had already subsided — and crime rates have kept dropping. The FBI's 2023 crime report found that murder was down nearly 12 percent year over year, and in 2024 it kept falling to roughly 16,700 murders, on par with pre-pandemic levels. The early numbers for 2025 are so promising that Jeff Asher, one of the best independent analysts on crime, recently asked in a piece whether this year could have the lowest murder rate in US history.

All of which raises two questions: What's driving a decrease in crime every bit as sharp as the pandemic-era increase? And why do so many of us find it so hard to believe?

We shouldn't jump to conclusions about this year's crime rates based on the early data, especially since we're just now beginning the summer, when violent crime almost always rises. Crime data in the US is also patchy and slow — I can tell you how many soybeans the US raised in March, but I can't tell you how many people have been murdered in the US this year. 

But what we can tell looks very good. The Real-Time Crime Index, an academic project that collects crime data from more than 380 police agencies covering nearly 100 million people, estimates there were 1,488 murders in the US this year through March, compared to an estimated 1,899 over the same months last year. That's a decrease of nearly 22 percent. Violent crime overall is down by about 11 percent. Motor vehicle theft, which became an epidemic during the pandemic, is down by over 26 percent. 

Peer down to the local level, and the picture just keeps getting better. In Baltimore, which The Wire made synonymous with violent, drug-related crime, homicides fell to 199 last year, its best showing in over a decade. As of early May, the city had 45 murders, down another third from the same period last year. City emergency rooms that were once full of gunshot victims have gone quiet.

How much lower could it go nationally? The record low homicide rate, at least since national records started being kept in 1960, is 4.45 per 100,000 in 2014. So far this year, according to Asher, murder is down in 25 of the 30 cities that reported the most murders in 2023. Asher argues that if the numbers hold, “a 10 percent or more decline in murder nationally in 2025 would roughly tie 2014 for the lowest murder rate ever recorded.”

In short: The pandemic led to a huge increase in violent crime, and as the pandemic waned, so did the wave.

The closure of schools during the pandemic, especially in already higher-crime cities in the Northeast, meant far more young men — who are statistically more likely to be either perpetrators of violent crime or victims of it — on the streets. The closure of social services left fewer resources for them to draw on; and the sheer stress of a once-in-a-lifetime health catastrophe set everyone on edge. The murder of George Floyd in spring 2020 led to a collapse in community trust in policing, which in turn seemed to lead to less aggressive policing altogether. As the pandemic eased, though, those buffers came back, providing a natural brake on violent crime.

But the government, from the national level down to cities, also took direct actions to stem the flood of violence. The White House under President Joe Biden poured hundreds of millions of dollars into community violence interruption programs, which aim to break the cycle of retribution that can lead to homicide. Baltimore's Group Violence Reduction Strategy has brought together community groups and law enforcement to deter the people considered most likely to get involved in gun violence. And the erosion in police forces nationwide that occurred during the pandemic has largely stopped. 

The situation is far from perfect. Even though Floyd's murder triggered a nationwide reckoning around police violence, recent data shows that police killings kept increasing, in part because fear of crime often stopped momentum around reforms. Here in New York, even as overall crime on the subways has fallen to historical lows, felony assaults on the trains have kept rising, fueling fears of lawlessness. 

As Memorial Day weekend marks the start of summer, the next few months will tell whether the pandemic was truly just a blip in the long-term reduction in violent crime. But what we can say is most people don't seem to notice the positive trends. An October 2024 poll by Gallup found that 64 percent of Americans believed there was more crime nationwide than the year before, even though by that time in 2024, the post-pandemic crime drop was well under way. 

But such results aren't surprising. One of the most reliable results in polling is that if you ask Americans whether crime is rising, they'll say yes. Astonishingly, in 23 of 27 national surveys done by Gallup since 1993, Americans reported that they thought crime nationwide was rising — even though most of those surveys were done during the long crime decline. 

Crime is one of the best examples we have of bad news bias. By definition, a murder is an outlier event that grabs our attention, inevitably leading the nightly local news. Sometimes, as during the pandemic, that bias can match reality. But if we fail to adjust to what is actually happening around us — not just what we think is happening — it won't just make us think our cities are more dangerous than they really are. It'll sap energy for the reforms that can really make a difference.

﻿Why millions of chickens never make it to the slaughterhouse.

by  Kenny Torrella

Late last month, some 14,000 baby chicks in Pennsylvania were shipped from a hatchery — commercial operations that breed chickens, incubate their eggs, and sell day-old chicks — to small farms across the country. But they didn't get far. They were reportedly abandoned in a US Postal Service truck in Delaware for three-and-a-half days without water, food, or temperature control.

By the time officials arrived at the postal facility, 4,000 baby birds were already dead. The thousands of survivors — mostly chickens, but also some turkeys and quails — were taken to Delaware's First State Animal Center and SPCA, which worked tirelessly to find homes to take in the animals as pets.

The incident has received extensive national news coverage, and it highlights an often hidden aspect of America's network of small poultry farms and backyard chicken operations: the shipping of millions of live baby animals in the mail to be raised for eggs or meat.

Most chicks survive their journey through the mail, but many don't. In 2020, 4,800 chicks shipped to farmers in Maine perished due to postal service delays, while in 2022, almost 4,000 chicks destined for the Bahamas died on the tarmac at Miami International Airport from heat exposure. There are plenty of other stories of chicks dying in the mail, and backyard chicken enthusiasts say it's not uncommon for a few birds out of every 50 or so that they order from hatcheries to die in the mail or shortly after arriving. 

Mass-casualty mail-order events are rare, but when they happen, they tend to receive news attention. It's a weird-sounding story with aggrieved customers and sometimes, a hopeful outcome, like the thousands of rescued birds in Delaware. But many more farmed animals die in transportation than most of us realize. That's because these animals — whether raised by backyard poultry enthusiasts or major meat-producing conglomerates — are commodities, and their deaths merely a margin of error baked into the economics of the annual hatching, raising, and slaughtering of billions of chickens for food. 

Animals raised for food are often transported numerous times throughout their lives, and they're typically treated like cargo rather than living, feeling animals. Sometimes, it's boxes of day-old chicks shipped through the USPS from a small hatchery to a small farm. But more often, it's truckloads of fattened-up chickens or pigs moved from a factory farm to a massive slaughterhouse.

More than 9 billion chickens raised for meat annually in the US are kept on factory farms — long, windowless buildings that look more like industrial warehouses than farms. The birds have been bred to grow enormous, which causes a number of health problems, and in these overcrowded facilities, disease spreads quickly. The conditions are so awful that up to 6 percent die before they can even be trucked to the slaughterhouse. That's over half a billion animals each year.

Once the survivors reach about 6.5 pounds, they're quickly and tightly packed into crates. Those crates are then stacked one atop another onto a truck bound for the slaughterhouse. They're still babies, at just 47 days old, but 6.5 pounds is their average “market weight.”

Most chicken farms are located close to a slaughterhouse, so the trip isn't too long — often 60 miles or less, according to the National Chicken Council. 

But “even if it is a short journey, the weather and the stocking density has a huge effect on mortality,” Adrienne Craig, an attorney at the Animal Welfare Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for more humane conditions in animal transport, told me. “They could be transported for 45 minutes and if it's 110 degrees,” a lot of chickens could die. They can also become stressed and physically aggressive toward one another when packed so tightly. 

The US poultry industry doesn't publish statistics on how many animals die in transport — what they call “DOAs” (dead on arrival). In the early 2000s, according to the data analytics firm Agri Stats, Inc., the DOA rate was around 0.36 percent. Assuming this hasn't changed much (a reasonable assumption, as it's not so different from DOA rates in many European countries), around 33.8 million chickens in the US died in transport in 2024, or 92,602 every day. (The National Chicken Council didn't immediately respond to a request for industry DOA figures.)

To put that into context, around 33 million cattle are slaughtered for beef each year in the US. 

In a 2023 report, the Animal Welfare Institute published a report that details a number of mass-death events in chicken transport. Here are just a few:

The DOA rate is even higher for pigs, with about a million every year either dead on arrival at the slaughterhouse, unable to move or keep up with other pigs after unloading, or in such a terrible state that they must be euthanized on arrival. 

Similar to poultry birds, pigs and cattle are subject to extreme temperatures, but they're often transported much further distances. And a typical beef or dairy cow is shipped multiple times to different farms, and often across state lines — not just the trip from the farm to the slaughterhouse. These long distances mean the animals are living in one another's urine and feces while on the truck, and, according to Craig, they can experience bruising when jostled around as truckers navigate curves and bumpy roads.

Animals have no federal protections in transportation trips under 28 hours, and the federal Twenty-Eight Hour Law, intended to reduce their suffering on those longer journeys, is poorly — and rarely — enforced. The law also excludes poultry birds — the vast majority of animals raised for meat. 

A newsletter analyzing how the meat and dairy industries impact everything around us.

The average consumer, if they think about farm animal suffering at all, may only think about it in the context of factory farms or slaughterhouses. But the factory farm production chain is incredibly complex, and at each step, animals have little to no protections. That leads to tens of millions of animals dying painful deaths each year in transport alone, and virtually no companies are ever held accountable. 

These deaths are just as tragic as the thousands who died in the recent USPS incident, and they are just as preventable. The meat industry could choose to pack fewer animals into each truck, require heating and cooling during transport, and give animals ample time for rest, water, and food on long journeys. 

But such modest measures would cut into their margins, and if there's one thing that should be understood about almost every major US meat company, it's this: They will always cut corners on animal welfare to increase profit unless they're legally required to change.

Google's phones, tablets, and, yes, XR glasses are all about to be supercharged by AI.

Google needs to seize this moment. Bank of America analysts this week even called Google's slew of new AI announcements a ""Trojan horse"" for its device business.

For years, Apple's iOS and Google's Android have battled it out. Apple leads in the US in phone sales, though it still trails Android globally. The two have also gradually converged; iOS has become more customizable, while Android has become cleaner and easier to use. As hardware upgrades have slowed in recent years, the focus has shifted to the smarts inside the device.

That could be a big problem for Apple. Its AI rollouts have proven lackluster with users, while more enticing promised features have been delayed. The company is reportedly trying to rebuild Siri entirely using large language models. Right now, it's still behind Google and OpenAI, and that gap continues to widen.

During Google's I/O conference this week, the search giant bombarded us with new AI features. Perhaps the best example was a particularly grabby demo of Google's ""Project Astra"" assistant helping someone fix their bike by searching through the bike manual, pulling up a YouTube video, and calling a bike shop to see if certain supplies were in stock.

It was, of course, a highly polished promotional video, but it made Siri look generations behind.

""It has long been the case that the best way to bring products to the consumer market is via devices, and that seems truer than ever,"" wrote Ben Thompson, analyst and Stratechery author, in an I/O dispatch this week.

""Android is probably going to be the most important canvas for shipping a lot of these capabilities,"" he added.

Apple has done a good job of locking users into its ecosystem with iMessage blue bubbles, features like FaceTime, and peripherals like the Apple Watch that require an iPhone to use.

Google's Pixel phone line, meanwhile, remains a rounding error when compared to global smartphone shipments. That's less of a problem when Google has huge partners like Samsung that bring all of its AI features to billions of Android users globally.

While iPhone users will get some of these new features through Google's iOS apps, it's clear that the ""universal assistant"" the company is building will only see its full potential on Android. Perhaps this could finally get iOS users to make the switch.

""We're seeing diminishing returns on a hardware upgrade cycle, which means we're now really focused on the software upgrade cycle,"" Bernstein senior analyst Mark Shmulik told Business Insider.

Without major changes by Apple, Shmulik said he sees the gap in capabilities between Android and iOS only widening.

""If it widens to the point where someone with an iPhone says, 'Well my phone can't do that,' does it finally cause that switching event from what everyone has always considered this incredible lock-in from Apple?"" Shmulik said.

Internally, Google has been preparing for this moment.

The company merged its Pixel, Chrome, and Android teams last year to capitalize on the AI opportunity.

""We are going to be very fast-moving to not miss this opportunity,"" Google's Android chief Sameer Samat told BI at last year's I/O. ""It's a once-in-a-generation moment to reinvent what phones can do. We are going to seize that moment.""

A year on, Google appears to be doing just that. Much of what the company demoed this week is either rolling out to devices imminently or in the coming weeks.

Google still faces the challenge that its relationships with partners like Samsung have come with the express promise that Google won't give its home-grown devices preferential treatment. So, if Google decides to double down on its Pixel phones at the expense of its partners, it could step into a business land mine.

Of course, Google needs to think about more than smartphones. Its renewed bet on XR glasses is a bet on what might be the next-generation computing platform. Meta is already selling its own augmented reality glasses, and Apple is now doubling down on its efforts to get its own smart glasses out by the end of 2026, Bloomberg reported.

Google this week demoed glasses that have a visual overlay to instantly provide information to wearers, which Meta's glasses lack and Apple's first version will reportedly also not have.

The success of Meta's glasses so far is no doubt encouraging news for Google, as a new era of AI devices is ushered in. Now it's poised to get ahead by leveraging its AI chops, and Apple might give it the exact opening it's waited more than a decade for.

""I don't know about an open goal,"" said Shmulik of Apple, ""but it does feel like they've earned themselves a penalty kick.""

European leaders are racing to figure out how to keep Ukraine supplied with weapons as US President Donald Trump appears to be walking away from the war. One option: buy American.

Europe has neither the stocks of arms nor the capacity to make them in large enough volume as it becomes clear that the US won't be delivering any more. The White House has also refused Europe's appeals to keep up the push to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to an immediate ceasefire by stepping up sanctions.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

A majority of US adults, 56%, said their household finances would be better off if Trump's tariffs had not been implemented.

During a tech conference in Macau on Saturday, Tsai also called out “some governments” who “try to tear down this bridge that we have built between Asia and the rest of the world.” While he didn't specify which administrations he was referring to, the comments come against the backdrop of President Donald Trump's trade war that has roiled markets and sparked retaliatory levies from other governments, as well as increased global scrutiny on Chinese corporates.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

A decision on timing of potential restrictions has yet to be taken, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.

House tax bill would gut the rooftop solar industry, executives warn.

Solar panels on the roofs of homes in Tucson, Arizona.

The troubled, $20 billion US residential solar market's future rests on whether Senate Republicans will challenge their brethren in the House of Representatives and change provisions of the massive tax and spending bill that executives and analysts alike say would devastate the industry.

The bill passed by the House this week would strip away tax credits for companies that lease rooftop solar systems as well as homeowners who buy them outright. The industry is already reeling from tariffs on imported equipment, high interest rates and reduced state incentives in California, the nation's biggest residential solar market. One major rooftop solar company — Sunnova Energy International Inc. — is laying the groundwork for a bankruptcy filing, and analyst Philip Shen at Roth Capital Partners warned the bill as written would effectively shut down the industry, starting next year.

The Supreme Court overruled a century of precedent by giving President Trump the authority to fire agency heads for virtually any reason. 

Breaking the rules unnecessarily.

In a cavalier, under-reasoned two-page opinion, the Supreme Court announced its intention to overrule a century of precedent and roll back the existence of independent agencies, one of the linchpins of the modern administrative state. The president now has the authority to fire the head of any agency for virtually any reason — even when Congress has stipulated that such officials can only be dismissed for cause. While the court signaled that it would exempt the Federal Reserve from its new regime, we are witnessing a stunning conservative constitutional revolution. This shift undermines the foundational principle that certain government employees should be nonpartisan professionals hired for their expertise, not political loyalty.

The decision in Trump v. Wilcox did not follow the usual process of full briefing and oral argument — standard in even the most routine Supreme Court cases, let alone those that will be remembered as era-defining. Instead, it reached the justices through the court's “emergency docket,” a fast-track process that takes place when parties seek urgent relief and the Supreme Court must decide whether emergency intervention is justified.

Terminal lucidity. It's the phrase used to describe a short period just before death when the terminally ill appear to recover. All too often it gives hope—irrational hope—to the soon-to-be bereaved. That's what strategist Bill Blaine reckons happened in the US stock market this week. After a torrid few months, the S&P 500 is all but evens on the year, and that's made many investors think that maybe everything's going to be fine.

But the reckoning comes to us all. And the truth is that tariff chaos, ongoing stress in the bond market, the risks of stagflation and still-superhigh valuations mean that if you haven't diversified into non-US markets yet, you really should get on with it. (Not everyone agrees with this analysis, of course. Listen to Ed Yardeni on this week's Merryn Talks Money for a more cheery outlook.)","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Businesses are turning to artificial intelligence tools to help them navigate real-world turbulence in global trade.

Several tech firms told CNBC say they're deploying the nascent technology to visualize businesses' global supply chains — from the materials that are used to form products, to where those goods are being shipped from — and understand how they're affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs.

Last week, Salesforce said it had developed a new import specialist AI agent that can ""instantly process changes for all 20,000 product categories in the U.S. customs system and then take action on them"" as needed, to help navigate changes to tariff systems.

Engineers at the U.S. software giant used the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, a 4,400-page document of tariffs on goods imported to the U.S., to inform answers generated by the agent.

""The sheer pace and complexity of global tariff changes make it nearly impossible for most businesses to keep up manually,"" Eric Loeb, executive vice president of government affairs at Salesforce, told CNBC. ""In the past, companies might have relied on small teams of in-house experts to keep pace.""

Firms say that AI systems are enabling them to take decisions on adjustments to their global supply chains much faster.

Andrew Bell, chief product officer of supply chain management software firm Kinaxis, said that manufacturers and distributors looking to inform their response to tariffs are using his firm's machine learning technology to assess their products and the materials that go into them, as well as external signals like news articles and macroeconomic data.

""With that information, we can start doing some of those simulations of, here is a particular part that is in your build material that has a significant tariff. If you switched to using this other part instead, what would the impact be overall?"" Bell told CNBC.

Trump's tariffs list — which covers dozens of countries — has forced companies to rethink their supply chains and pricing, with the likes of Walmart and Nike already raising prices on some products. The U.S. imported about $3.3 trillion of goods in 2024, according to census data.

Uncertainty from the U.S. tariff measures ""actually probably presents AI's moment to shine,"" Zack Kass, a futurist and former head of OpenAI's go-to-market strategy, told CNBC's Silvia Amaro at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy last month.

""If you wonder how hard things could get without AI vis-a-vis automation, and what would happen in a world where you can't just employ a bunch of people overnight, AI presents this alternative proposal,"" he added.

Nagendra Bandaru, managing partner and global head of technology services at Indian IT giant Wipro, said clients are using the company's agentic AI solutions ""to pivot supplier strategies, adjust trade lanes, and manage duty exposure dynamically as policy landscapes evolve.""

Wipro says it uses a range of AI systems — both proprietary and supplied by third parties — from large language models to traditional machine learning and computer vision techniques to inspect physical assets in cross-border transit.

While it preferred to keep company names confidential, Wipro said that firms using its AI products to navigate Trump's tariffs range from a Fortune 500 electronics manufacturer with factories in Asia to an automotive parts supplier exporting to Europe and North America.

""AI is a powerful enabler — but not a silver bullet,"" Bandaru told CNBC. ""It doesn't replace trade policy strategy, it enhances it by transforming global trade from a reactive challenge into a proactive, data-driven advantage.""

AI was already a key investment priority for global firms prior to Trump's sweeping tariff announcements on April. Nearly three-quarters of business leaders ranked AI and generative AI in their top three technologies for investment in 2025, according to a report by Capgemini published in January.

""There are a number of ways AI can assist companies dealing with the tariffs and resulting uncertainty.  But any AI solution's success will be predicated on the quality of the data it has access to,"" Ajay Agarwal, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, told CNBC.

The venture capitalist said that one of his portfolio companies, FourKites, uses supply chain network data with AI to help firms understand the logistics impacts of adjusting suppliers due to tariffs.

""They are working with a number of Fortune 500 companies to leverage their agents for freight and ocean to provide this level of visibility and intelligence,"" Agarwal said.

""Switching suppliers may reduce tariffs costs, but might increase lead times and transportation costs,"" he added. ""In addition, the volatility of the tariffs [has] severely impacted the rates and capacity available in both the ocean and the domestic freight networks.""

Russia launched dozens of drones and ballistic missiles at Kyiv overnight in one of the biggest combined aerial attacks on the Ukrainian capital of the three-year war, damaging several apartment buildings and injuring 15 people.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a social media post it had been a ""tough night"" for Ukraine, and called for new international sanctions to pressure Moscow into agreeing to a ceasefire.

In the early hours of the morning, Reuters witnesses saw and heard successive waves of drones flying over Kyiv, and a series of explosions jolted the city. The capital also reverberated with the sound of anti-aircraft batteries trying to bring down the drones.

Pictures from Reuters photographers showed an orange-red glow lighting up the city as plumes of smoke blew across the horizon. On the top floor of one apartment building, smoke and flames billowed out of a balcony window as firefighters tried to approach.

By daybreak, government officials reported damage in six districts of the Ukrainian capital, and a total so far of 15 people wounded. Three required hospitalisation. Two of the injured were children, the officials said.

The Kyiv city military administration described it as one of the largest combined drone and missile attacks of the war.

The attacks come as U.S. President Donald Trump is encouraging Russia and Ukraine to sit down for ceasefire talks to end the war, but has pushed back against a European plan to impose new sanctions on Russia.

Halyna Tatarchuk, a 63-year-old pensioner, was in her apartment when a drone hit the building. She and her husband were in the corridor, away from the windows. ""That saved us,"" she said.

She fled to a bomb shelter at a nearby school, then at daylight returned to inspect the damage. All the windows of her apartment were smashed, and the floor was covered in fragments of glass.

""I'd like Trump to see this,"" she said, standing in her kitchen. ""What's he doing? Can he really not see this? ...It's the destruction of a people, they are just destroying us,"" she said, referring to the Russian military.

In the street below her third-floor windows, trees had been splintered by the blast and car windows were smashed. Municipal workers were using a mini-excavator to clear up debris from the ground.

Ukraine's air force said that Russia had fired 14 ballistic missiles at targets across Ukraine overnight and launched 250 long-range drones, with Kyiv the main target.

The strikes followed several days of Ukrainian drone strikes — some 800 attacks — on targets inside Russia, including the capital Moscow.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had vowed on Friday to respond to those attacks.

Hours before the drones and missiles reached Kyiv, Russia and Ukraine had exchanged several hundred prisoners, in a move that Trump suggested could be a prelude to progress on peace talks.

Russian negotiators said they were preparing a memorandum that would serve as the starting point for the next round of peace talks. No date or venue has been agreed.

""Russia still has not sent its 'peace memorandum.' Instead, it is sending deadly drones and missiles at civilians,"" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote in a post on the Telegram social media platform.

In his own post on Telegram, Zelenskyy said the Russian attacks were evidence to the rest of the world that Russia is the obstacle to peace.

""Only additional sanctions against key sectors of the Russian economy will force Moscow to agree to a ceasefire.""

There was no immediate comment from Russia on the overnight attacks.

Russia has said it is committed to seeking a peaceful settlement to the conflict. But it says Kyiv needs to accept the reality that Russia controls part of its territory, and it must not be used as a bridgehead for Western states to threaten Russia.

On Saturday, Russia's Defence Ministry said its troops had captured the settlements of Stupochki, Otradne and Loknia in Ukraine's Donetsk and Sumy regions.

Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield report.

A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Friday to facilitate the return of a gay Guatemalan man who said he was deported to Mexico despite fearing he would be persecuted there, after officials acknowledged an error in his case.

U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston issued the order days after the Justice Department notified him that its claim that the man had expressly stated he was not afraid of being sent to Mexico was based on erroneous information.

The Justice Department said last week that, upon further investigation, officials were unable to identify any Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who had asked the man, identified as ""O.C.G.,"" about fears he had for his safety.

Murphy, an appointee of Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, called the case a ""horror"" and said that ""while mistakes obviously happen, the events leading up to this decision are troubling.""

The ruling marks the latest instance of a judge ordering President Donald Trump's administration to facilitate the return of a migrant swept up in the Republican's efforts to carry out mass deportations as part of his hard-line immigration agenda, following a mistake in an individual's case.

In a class action lawsuit filed by O.C.G. and other migrants, the judge had blocked the administration from swiftly deporting people to countries other than their own without first hearing any concerns they had about their safety.

""Due process is, in some sense, a binary — one either receives what the Constitution requires, or one does not,"" Murphy wrote. ""It has been clear that O.C.G. did not receive what the Constitution requires.""

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The government likewise made an error with Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador in March despite an order protecting him from removal. He remains there, despite a judge ordering the administration to facilitate his return.

Friday's ruling comes two days after Murphy, in the class action lawsuit case, concluded that the Trump administration had violated his earlier ruling by attempting to deport a group of migrants to South Sudan.

According to his lawyers, O.C.G. is a gay man who fled Guatemala in 2024 after facing death threats based on his sexuality. He entered the United States through Mexico in May 2024.

Murphy said that while an immigration judge in February found O.C.G. deserved protection from being returned to Guatemala, authorities two days later wrongly placed him on a bus to Mexico, where he had recently been raped and kidnapped.

Trina Realmuto, a lawyer for O.C.G. at the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, said his legal team was ""elated"" by Murphy's ruling and would work to facilitate a return plan.

After arriving in Mexico, O.C.G. had to choose between waiting months in detention to apply for asylum in Mexico or return to Guatemala. He chose the latter and went into hiding, his lawyers say.

Stephanie Venn-Watson studied longevity long before she realized it, she says. The veterinary epidemiologist was recruited by the U.S. Navy to take care of aging dolphins in 2001.Venn-Watson planned to research the dolphins to get a better understanding of infectious diseases, but ""instead, very quickly pivoted to studying chronic diseases and diseases of aging,"" which she's done for more than 20 years, she told CNBC Make It in February.While dolphins in the wild typically live to around 20 years old, Navy dolphins were living much longer beyond the ages of 40 and 50, Venn-Watson says. Though some dolphins were developing conditions like chronic inflammation, high cholesterol and even changes in their brains similar to that of Alzheimer's, others were completely healthy in old age.After analyzing thousands of samples collected over the span of about 50 years, Venn-Watson and her team were able to determine what the healthiest aging dolphins had in common. ""We thought it was going to be omega-3′s, because all they eat are fish. And instead, it was C15:0, a saturated fatty acid I had never heard of,"" she says.Venn-Watson and her team discovered a new essential fatty acid, C15:0, which like omega-3′s, can improve health outcomes in mammals. And additional research by experts outside of her team have supported this claim. Their discovery marks the ""first essential fatty acid to be found in more than ninety years,"" a finding which earned Venn-Watson a spot on CNBC's 2025 Changemakers List earlier this year.With her husband, a Navy physician, Venn-Watson started Seraphina Therapeutics, and developed a C15:0 supplement for humans. She also published a book about her findings called ""The Longevity Nutrient,"" in March.

To up her intake of the longevity nutrient in her own diet, Venn-Watson eats certain foods that are high in C15:0.

Here's the No. 1 food she eats to get more of the fatty acid.

When Venn-Watson plans her meals, she always aims to maximize her intake of C15:0. ""Key ways I do that are through grass-fed cheeses that come from grass-fed animals; those have some of the highest C15:0 levels,"" she says.

Often, it's her daily snack that helps her increase how much of the longevity nutrient she's getting: ""I'll have a cheese snack almost every day.""

Pairing the grass-fed cheeses she eats with crackers helps her get yet another vital nutrient for her body: fiber.

""We've also learned fiber has a lot of importance. So, classic cheese and crackers (high-fiber crackers, so not the ones that are chock full of processed carbs),"" Venn-Watson says.

""And pecorino, for example, has some of the highest nutritious content, including C15:0.""

And though she discovered a new essential fatty acid, she still prioritizes the tried-and-true fatty acids like omega-3s. ""My diet is high in fish. I probably have fish every day and dairy fat,"" she says.

In addition to the food she eats, Venn-Watson goes the extra mile to improve her health by taking certain vitamins: ""I supplement with what the Navy invested 10 years in making, which is the pure C15:0 supplement.""

Bedeviled by leaks to the media during his short tenure, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a series of restrictions on the press late Friday that include banning reporters from entering wide swaths of the Pentagon without a government escort — areas where the press has had access in past administrations as it covers the activities of the world's most powerful military.

Newly restricted areas include his office and those of his top aides and all of the different locations across the mammoth building where the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Space Force maintain press offices.

The media will also be barred from offices of the Pentagon's senior military leadership, including Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, without Hegseth's approval and an escort from his aides. The staff of the Joint Chiefs has traditionally maintained a good relationship with the press.

Hegseth, the former Fox News Channel personality, issued his order via a posting on X late on a Friday afternoon before a holiday weekend. He said it was necessary for national security.

""While the department remains committed to transparency, the department is equally obligated to protect (classified intelligence information) and sensitive information, the unauthorized disclosure of which could put the lives of U.S. service members in danger,"" wrote Hegseth.

The Pentagon Press Association expressed skepticism that operational concerns were at play — and linked the move to previous actions by Hegseth's office that impede journalists and their coverage.

""There is no way to sugarcoat it. Today's memo by Secretary Hegseth appears to be a direct attack on the freedom of the press and America's right to know what its military is doing,"" it said in a statement Friday night. ""The Pentagon Press Association is extremely concerned by the decision to restrict movement of accredited journalists within the Pentagon through non-secured, unclassified hallways.""

Hegseth also said reporters will be required to sign a form to protect sensitive information and would be issued a new badge that more clearly identifies them as press. It was not clear whether signing the form would be a condition of continued access to the building.

Two months ago, the department was embarrassed by a leak to The New York Times that billionaire Elon Musk was to get a briefing on the U.S. military's plans in case a war broke out with China. That briefing never took place, on President Donald Trump's orders, and Hegseth suspended two Pentagon officials as part of an investigation into how that news got out.

The Pentagon was also embarrassed when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently included in a group chat on the Signal messaging app where Hegseth discussed plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen. Trump's former national security adviser, Mike Waltz, took responsibility for Goldberg being included and was shifted to another job.

The administration has taken several aggressive actions toward the press since Trump took over, including FCC investigations into ABC, CBS and NBC News. Restrictions imposed on The Associated Press' access to certain White House events earlier this year led to a court battle that is ongoing.

The White House has also increased access for conservative media that are friendly to the president. Nevertheless, a study released earlier this month found that Trump had more frequent exchanges with reporters during his first 100 days in office than any of his six predecessors.

Hegseth, however, has been far less available. He has yet to speak to the press in the Pentagon briefing room. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell has held only one Pentagon press briefing since Jan. 20. The Pentagon has taken other steps to make it more difficult for reporters, including taking office space away from eight media outlets, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and NBC.

Bullish crypto bets lost over $500 million in the past 24 hours as traders took profits and markets slid following President Donald Trump's fresh threats of tariffs on European imports and Apple products, sparking a wave of liquidations.



Bitcoin, which had been trading above $111,000, dropped quickly to around $108,600, wiping out intraday gains and rattling broader market sentiment.



BTC's drop was mirrored across the crypto complex, with futures tracking ether (ETH), Solana's SOL, xrp (XRP) and dogecoin (DOGE) showing losses from $30 million to over $100 million.



Bitcoin futures saw roughly $181 million in losses, while Ether futures accounted for nearly $142 million. Altcoins added another $100 million in liquidations, including notable wipeouts in SOL, DOGE, and XRP.

The largest single liquidation was a $9.53 million BTC-USDT swap on OKX, CoinGlass data shows.



A liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to the trader's inability to meet the margin requirements.



Large-scale liquidations can indicate market extremes, like panic selling or buying. A cascade of liquidations might suggest a market turning point, where a price reversal could be imminent due to an overreaction in market sentiment.



The pullback arrived just as bitcoin was gaining momentum on ETF inflows and growing institutional interest, leading some to expect a calm weekend.



Instead, volatility returned in full force. With the macro environment now destabilized by renewed trade war fears, traders may remain cautious heading into next week's sessions.

The bitcoin price has soared around 50% since its April lows, rebounding along with stock markets, and sparking wild predictions the Federal Reserve is gearing up to blow up the crypto market.

Now, as a Wall Street giant suddenly flips from gold to bitcoin, the bitcoin price is braced for a huge week that will see U.S. president Donald Trump's vice president JD Vance speak alongside Trump's crypto czar David Sacks at the Bitcoin 2025 conference.

U.S. president Donald Trump, speaking last year at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where ... More he announced he would create a strategic bitcoin reserve if elected—sending the bitcoin price sharply higher.

""This is more than a headline moment—it's a signal,” David Bailey, the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher and organizer of the conference BTC Inc who has become an unofficial advisor to the Trump administration on bitcoin, said in a statement.

“Bitcoin is the most exciting financial innovation in the world,” Bailey added. ""It's at the forefront of the national conversation.”

During last year's Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, then presidential candidate Donald Trump announced that he'd create a bitcoin strategic reserve if he won the White House in November—a promise he followed through on in March via an executive order.

This year, U.S. vice president JD Vance is headlining the conference, due to speak at 9am on Wednesday, while Trump's crypto czar David Sacks and executive director of the president's council of advisers on digital assets Bo Hines will address the conference on Tuesday.

Earlier this week, Trump's son Eric, who has fully embraced bitcoin and crypto via his World Liberty Financial decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that was founded in response to the Trump family being debanked by Wall Street, posted to X that “this is just the beginning of this incredible ride.”

Eric Trump added that he hoped “you listened"" to his February advice to “enter bitcoin.”

The bitcoin price rally in recent weeks, coming as Trump hosted the top holders of his controversial memecoin for a gala dinner, has spurred a flood of bullish bitcoin price predictions that include bitcoin replacing the U.S. dollar within ten years.

The bitcoin price has soared to a fresh all-time high, spurring a flood of bullish bitcoin price ... More predictions.

“Institutions are turning to bitcoin because of uncertainty,” Ryan Chow, the chief executive of bitcoin DeFi protocol Solv, said in emailed comments.

“In a fragmented macro landscape, bitcoin is emerging as a macro asset, global hedge, and digital reserve asset. A new all-time high sends a clear message—it's validation that bitcoin isn't going away.”

This week, JPMorgan's bitcoin-skeptic chief executive Jamie Dimon announced it will begin offering bitcoin to clients as Wall Street gradually warms up to crypto while companies around the world are looking to follow software company-turned-bitcoin acquisition vehicle MicroStrategy in buying and holding bitcoin as a long-term investment.

“Bitcoin reaching an all-time high is a powerful reflection of how far the digital asset ecosystem has come,"" Vincent Chok, the chief executive of corporate treasury services company First Digital, said via email.

Bitcoin surged past its previous all-time highs this week, reaching $112,000 on Thursday after breaking through resistance on Wednesday. The move marked a historic moment for the market, solidifying bullish momentum and pushing BTC into a new price discovery phase. However, the excitement was short-lived. Following comments from US President Donald Trump, who threatened to impose a 50% tariff on European Union imports, global markets turned cautious, causing a broad risk-off sentiment that sent Bitcoin prices lower.

The sell-off came swiftly, pulling BTC back below local highs as investors reacted to rising geopolitical and economic uncertainty. While this retracement is not unusual after such a strong rally, it underscores the sensitivity of crypto markets to macro headlines.

Top analyst Big Cheds shared a technical perspective, noting that Bitcoin has now returned to the daily EMA 8. Holding this moving average could signal that bulls remain in control and that this pullback is simply part of a healthy consolidation.

Bitcoin Steady As Market Uncertainty Grows

Bitcoin continues to show resilience in the face of persistent macroeconomic uncertainty. As US Treasury yields remain elevated and volatility sweeps across global stock markets, BTC has managed to hold strong after recently pushing into new all-time highs. While many risk assets falter under these conditions, Bitcoin is proving its narrative as a macro hedge, attracting interest from institutional and retail investors alike.

However, despite its recent breakout to $112,000, the rally has not yet been confirmed as a sustainable bullish phase. Analysts widely agree that a clean break above $115,000 is essential to trigger the next leg of price discovery. Without that confirmation, the current move could be seen as an overextension, especially amid broader market instability.

Cheds shared a key technical insight this week, noting that Bitcoin is now back at the daily EMA 8 level—a moving average that has acted as reliable support since the $80K range. This suggests that the current pullback could be a healthy retest of trend support rather than the start of a deeper correction.

If BTC manages to bounce from this level, bullish momentum could resume quickly. But if the EMA 8 fails, downside risk may increase, especially if traditional markets continue to slide. For now, all eyes remain on how Bitcoin reacts at this technical crossroads.

BTC Retests Key Level As Uptrend Pauses

Bitcoin is currently retesting key technical levels following its sharp rally to a new all-time high near $112,000. As shown in the 4-hour chart, BTC has pulled back to the 34-period EMA (currently around $107,800), a level that has served as reliable dynamic support during this uptrend. The latest candle action shows buyers stepping in slightly above this area, suggesting it's still holding.

Price is also hovering just above the 50-SMA at $106,273, reinforcing this zone as a confluence of support. Volume has picked up slightly on the pullback, which could indicate healthy profit-taking rather than panic selling if this level holds, a continuation toward the previous high, and potentially a push above $112K remains on the table.

However, if the support fails and BTC dips below $106K, eyes will shift toward the next major horizontal support at $103,600. A drop to this region would still be technically valid within the broader uptrend but could shake short-term bullish momentum.

This is propelled by rising institutional investments and optimism about upcoming U.S. rules for digital assets. Ripple's XRP has also experienced significant increases, trading at approximately $2.65, supported by a good market sentiment and possible regulatory progress.

In this changing environment, cloud mining has become a practical path for investors looking for passive income free from the headaches of conventional mining arrangements. ZA Miner distinguishes itself in this field by giving users simple access to mine Bitcoins and Dogecoin, among other currencies. The platform offers a straightforward and sustainable answer for anyone wishing to take advantage of the rapidly expanding crypto market with a user-friendly platform, a $100 free mining contract for new users, and operations driven by renewable energy.

Skip the Hardware, Keep the Profits: How Cloud Mining Works

Cloud mining provides a hassle-free approach to mining cryptocurrencies by renting computational capacity from remote data centers. Thus, people do not need to buy or maintain mining equipment themselves. Cloud mining, as opposed to conventional mining techniques, transfers the technical and logistical responsibility to third-party suppliers rather than calling for major investment in specialist equipment.

Users who run large-scale mining farms sign agreements with cloud mining companies. They pay fees depending on the level of computing (or hash) power they want to use; these suppliers manage all the gear and operational chores. In return, they get a share of the mined cryptocurrency; payouts usually depend on the state of the market and the user's chosen power allocation.

For instance, a person wishing to mine Ripple (XRP) might pick a mining strategy designed for a certain length and hash rate. The provider attributes this capability to its mining methods; earnings are allocated proportionately depending on the user's contract length.

For well over a century, oil has been viewed as a strategic commodity, playing an essential role in transportation and manufacturing, among other critical industries. For Ethereum's proponents, drawing comparisons has been useful—but even then, the analogy is far from perfect.

When Vivek Raman introduced Etheralize in January, the former banker and business development firm's co-founder formalized efforts to onboard Wall Street. Part of that initiative, he recently told Decrypt, has involved “evangelization and education and marketing.”

“I always call it digital oil,” Raman said. “We think that as the crypto ecosystem evolves, people not only will want to—but will have to—hold this asset in reserves.”

Bitcoin's proponents often portray the asset as a form of digital gold because of pre-programmed scarcity, with a maximum supply of 21 million. ETH, whether it's being consumed to send transactions or power smart contracts, fuels Ethereum's network. The analogy, in that sense, is among the most palatable for today's crypto newbies.

As Raman and 19 others at Etheralize encourage financial institutions to build products on Ethereum, the ways in which the “digital oil” analogy falls short could illustrate challenges Ethereum's community will face in cementing the network's dominance on Wall Street, in capturing the asset's qualities in a snappy, memorable way.

“I think it is hard to come up with the right metaphor,” Grayscale Head of Research Zach Pandl told Decrypt. “It will be interesting to see whether investors begin to appreciate the scarcity of ETH, even if they're not yet kind of using the chain from a transactional standpoint.”

One key difference: If demand for oil increases, then more is often pumped in response, and its supply is elastic. Ethereum, on the other hand, has a maximum issuance of 1.5% a year, meaning that its supply can only grow a certain amount over a period. On top of that, transaction fees on Ethereum are burned, which can offset that growth in supply.

“Rather than having some sort of fixed cap of total supply, there's a fixed cap of issuance per year,” Etheralize co-founder Danny Ryan, a former Ethereum Foundation researcher, told Decrypt. “There's very much predictability.”

Another major difference between Ethereum and oil is that the latter commodity does not offer yield. Staked Ethereum, which is devoted to the network for the ability to help process transactions, currently has an estimated yield of 3% annually, according to a dashboard published on the crypto analytics platform Dune.

Within the coming years, financial institutions are expected to grow more comfortable with the practice of tokenization, in which real-world assets, such as stocks and bonds, are represented on-chain. Regulatory shifts under U.S. President Donald Trump could be a key driver.

Some firms, such as crypto exchange Kraken, are tapping Ethereum competitors like Solana for such offerings. However, several funds have been tokenized on Ethereum by staid financial firms, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton.

As more assets come on-chain, one aspect of Ethereum's “digital oil” analogy could become more valid. Much like oil is a neutral asset connecting myriad industries to each other, Ethereum could be seen as a non-sovereign asset for the modern financial system, Raman argued.

“In this ecosystem where the world's assets are all tokenized by different counterparties, [...] the only neutral asset that's global, that connects all of these, is ETH,” he said. “It becomes more and more important as a global trading pair, as a strategic asset to hold if you want to stay in neutrality between all of these different tokenized assets.”

Cardano surpassed Ethereum in core developer activity this month, making it the most actively developed blockchain, according to data from Cryptometheus. Over the past year, Cardano recorded 21,439 GitHub commits, representing developer activity, highlighting its strong focus on continuous innovation.

This surge in developer engagement could be a bullish signal for Cardano's native cryptocurrency, ADA. As Cardano's technical ecosystem expands, the question remains whether this momentum will translate into price gains for ADA. This article will explore what this developer surge means for Cardano, how Cardano differs from Ethereum and whether it could drive a price increase for ADA.

Cardano's ongoing development follows a step-by-step roadmap. The process began with the Byron era, which focused on building the network's foundation. During this phase, users could buy and sell ADA, Cardano's native token, while the network relied on a Proof of Stake system called Ouroboros for security. Next came the Shelley era, where network control shifted from a few central nodes to a broader group of community participants. This change improved security and resilience by reducing reliance on a small group of operators.

The Goguen era brought smart contract functionality, allowing developers to build decentralized applications on Cardano. It also enabled support for various digital assets, including standard tokens and non-fungible tokens, making the network more versatile. The Basho era then focused on scalability, using sidechains, which are separate but connected blockchains, to enhance performance and handle more transactions. Cardano is now in the Voltaire era, which emphasizes self-governance. This phase includes a voting and treasury system that lets users influence network upgrades and decide how funds are spent, giving the community greater control over Cardano's future.

Cardano became the most active blockchain in core developer work, with 21,143 GitHub updates spread across 550 key projects during the tracked period. This high level of engagement reflects a strong focus on maintaining and improving Cardano's core technology.

However, despite this achievement, Cardano has seen a decline in overall ecosystem engagement, with active developers dropping by 37.72% month-over-month and total commit contributions decreasing by 65.68%. This suggests that while Cardano's core is being actively developed, its broader ecosystem may be losing momentum.

On the other hand, Eethereum remains one of the most active blockchain projects but has experienced a decline in core developer activity. Over the same period, Ethereum recorded 20,752 GitHub commits across 278 core repositories, placing it second in developer engagement. The Ethereum ecosystem is vast, with 1,545 active projects and 132,505 public GitHub repositories. However, developer participation has also declined, with a 40.56% drop in active developers and a 39.33% reduction in total commit contributions. These numbers show that Ethereum is facing challenges in maintaining developer interest, even with its large user base and established ecosystem.

These trends highlight a key difference between the two ecosystems. Cardano maintains strong core development but may struggle to keep developers engaged in its broader ecosystem. Despite its massive ecosystem, Ethereum also faces a slowdown in developer contributions.

Several factors affect developer activity in blockchain networks. One is how decisions are made within the projects. For Ethereum, internal conflicts over upgrades and direction have caused delays and frustration among developers. Cardano's slow, research-focused approach can also discourage developers who want to build and launch projects quickly.

Another major factor is competition from newer blockchains. These networks offer faster transactions and lower fees, making them more attractive to developers who want to work on cutting-edge technology. As developers migrate between blockchains, Ethereum and Cardano may struggle to keep their core developer communities active.

Stephen Flanders argues that the exodus of blockchain developers is a natural consequence of speculative excesses in the crypto sector. He highlights that many developers were drawn to blockchain during the 2021-2022 bull market, but interest waned as speculative projects underperformed and funding shifted to other sectors, particularly AI.

Other analysts maintain a more optimistic outlook. Developer Binji Pande attributes developer decline to an overemphasis on hype-driven projects rather than meaningful, value-adding solutions, making it less rewarding for developers to contribute. To reverse this trend, he suggests focusing on building real-world applications that solve user problems, which could attract more developers and ensure long-term growth.

ADA is trading around $0.81, reflecting a 50% decline from its December 2024 peak.

Despite the decline, predictions for 2025 vary. Some expect ADA to trade between $0.66 and $1.88, while bullish scenarios target up to $2.36. These forecasts hinge on variable factors like increased adoption and positive market sentiment.

Cardano's future growth depends on its ability to fully deploy its smart contract ecosystem and attract users for its decentralized applications. The blockchain's unique approach to development is seen as a potential advantage, but competition from other platforms remains intense. While optimism exists for Cardano's long-term potential, the price will ultimately be driven by unpredictable factors like market conditions and overall demand.

Bottom Line 

Cardano now leads in core developer activity, making it the most actively developed blockchain. This could be a positive sign for its cryptocurrency, ADA. However, Cardano is struggling with a drop in overall developer engagement, which may impact its future growth.

Ethereum, the second most active blockchain, also saw a decline in developer activity despite its massive ecosystem. Both Cardano and Ethereum need to keep developers interested to stay competitive.

Developer activity is crucial for cryptocurrencies because it reflects the ongoing improvement, security and innovation of a blockchain network. Active developers ensure the platform remains functional, secure and competitive.

Increased development activity can lead to a price surge by boosting investor confidence and attracting users to a blockchain network. However, it does not guarantee higher prices, as other factors play a role.

Although Cardano surpassed Ethereum in core developer activity, Ethereum maintains a larger ecosystem with more active projects and developers, maintaining its dominance. ","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Best Altcoins to Watch as JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citi, and Wells Fargo Enter Crypto and DeFi Explodes","https://bitcoinist.com/best-altcoins-to-watch-as-banks-enter-crypto-and-defi-surges/","Sat, 24 May 2025 11:18:55 GMT","

The crypto space has never been more exciting, especially with news circulating about traditional financial giants like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citi, and Wells Fargo possibly launching a joint stablecoin.

This could be a game-changer, but it's not just stablecoins that deserve your attention.

Altcoins continue to be the driving force behind innovation in the blockchain and cryptocurrency world.
In fact, many of the best altcoins of 2025 are looking to capitalize on the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenized assets, and new technologies.

In this article, we'll highlight three exciting new crypto projects that have the potential to change the game in the world of altcoins.

The world of cryptocurrency is undergoing a major shift, with some of the biggest traditional financial institutions – JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citi, and Wells Fargo – reportedly considering a joint stablecoin launch.

This is a significant development, as these major players in banking have largely stayed on the sidelines, hesitant to fully embrace crypto.

Stablecoins, which are pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, offer a sense of stability in the otherwise volatile crypto market.

With these financial giants moving into the space, they may appeal to both retail and institutional investors seeking safer, less volatile options.

However, while stablecoins may offer short-term stability, the true innovation in blockchain lies within altcoins. These projects are pushing the boundaries of what decentralized finance can achieve, from tokenizing real-world assets to enabling decentralized exchanges.

As financial institutions look to enter the crypto space, altcoins are already leading the charge, proving that the future of digital finance is decentralized.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is revolutionizing digital wallet management with a user-friendly platform that supports multiple cryptocurrencies, cross-chain transfers, and top-tier security powered by Fireblocks MPC-CMP technology.

Unlike traditional wallets, Best Wallet is designed for both newcomers and experienced investors, making crypto management easy and secure.

Priced at $0.025075, $BEST raised over $12.6M during its presale, signaling strong investor confidence.
As major financial institutions like JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo explore stablecoin initiatives, the decentralized wallet and token space is gaining traction.



With a forecasted price of $0.62 by 2026, $BEST could see a significant 2,372% increase from its current value.

If you staked $1,000 worth of $BEST today, at a 15% annual percentage yield (APY), you could accumulate additional tokens throughout the year.

Token buyers also enjoy reduced transaction fees, early access to new projects, and benefits in Best Wallet's iGaming partnerships.

As Best Wallet continues to disrupt the market with innovative features, $BEST offers significant long-term growth potential — making it one of the most promising altcoins to watch in 2025.

SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is transforming the creator economy by tokenizing real-world assets such as real estate and commodities, allowing people to buy, sell, and trade them as digital assets.

This approach makes traditionally illiquid markets more accessible and efficient, bridging the gap between blockchain and traditional finance.

People can also generate AI-driven photos and videos, which are approved by creators, creating new revenue streams. With over 250M combined followers across its ecosystem, $SUBBD is poised to onboard a large user base to its platform.

The project raised nearly $500K during its presale, and you can buy $SUBBD right now for $0.055475.

As financial institutions explore stablecoin initiatives, the decentralized content and asset tokenization space is gaining significant momentum.



With staking rewards offering 20% APY during the presale, $SUBBD provides an attractive opportunity for early investors.

As the platform grows and blockchain adoption accelerates, $SUBBD is set to become a key player in both the crypto and creator economies.

NEAR Protocol ($NEAR) is a blockchain platform designed to make decentralized apps (dApps) easier to build and use. Think of it like a super-fast highway for blockchain, where developers can quickly deploy apps without getting stuck in traffic.

One of $NEAR's coolest features is its sharding technology, called Nightshade. It splits the blockchain into smaller parts (called shards), allowing the network to process a lot more transactions at once.

But $NEAR isn't just about speed. It also makes it easy for newcomers.

Instead of dealing with complicated crypto addresses, users get simple, human-readable account names. And developers can easily connect to other blockchains, like Ethereum, thanks to tools like the Aurora EVM.

Currently priced at $2.81, $NEAR has been gaining momentum with over 1K projects already running on its network. It's quickly becoming one of the most reliable platforms in decentralized space.

As traditional financial institutions like JPMorgan and Bank of America explore blockchain technology, $NEAR's scalability and developer-friendly approach make it a key player in the future of decentralized finance.

As traditional financial institutions start exploring the crypto space, innovative altcoins like Best Wallet Token, SUBBD Token, and NEAR Protocol are leading the charge in decentralized finance.

These projects are pushing the boundaries with secure wallets, tokenizing real-world assets, and bridging crypto with traditional markets. Keep an eye on them for future growth.

Most people miss the big gains because they're too busy chasing yesterday's winners. But right now, a few altcoins are showing serious breakout potential – building momentum while everyone focuses on Bitcoin.

These five projects are a great place to start if you're looking for the best crypto to buy before the next big breakout. 

MIND of Pepe (MIND) is an altcoin that looks set for an exciting second half of 2025. This Ethereum-based meme coin features an AI agent that aims to give users an edge in the market. It can scan trends, check social media feeds, and identify breakout stars before anyone else.

The key is that it's objective – no emotion clouds its judgement. That alone makes it better than human traders who are subject to FOMO and bias. Plus, MIND of Pepe will soon be able to create and launch its own tokens, with MIND holders getting first dibs.

Unsurprisingly, the project's presale has been a hit. It has raised over $10 million so far, with MIND tokens still priced at just $0.0037515 each. But fewer than eight days are left before the presale wraps, meaning this is the last chance to get involved.

Analyst ClayBro believes MIND will be a “top AI agent crypto.” He has a strong track record, meaning MIND of Pepe is one to watch. 

Another of the best cryptos to buy now is Hyperliquid (HYPE). This high-speed Layer-1 has been built from the ground up, and the results speak for themselves. We're talking 100,000+ transactions per second, no gas fees, and sub-second finality.

It basically runs like a CEX but stays entirely on-chain, which is extremely rare. But Hyperliquid's tech is just part of the story. The HYPE airdrop in late 2024 kicked things into high gear, with some users receiving five-figure allocations.

HYPE is trading for $35.35 and hit a new all-time high price earlier today. With no VC baggage and a fast-growing community, Hyperliquid is one of the most exciting opportunities on our list. 

Solaxy (SOLX) is the best crypto to buy now if you're interested in blockchain infrastructure. Although it has a meme vibe, Solaxy's main selling point is its new Layer-2 network for Solana. Solana hasn't had a Layer-2 solution until now, so Solaxy has a first-mover advantage.

This network will speed up Solana during busy periods and ensure fees remain as low as possible. Although the mainnet isn't yet live, Solaxy's team has released a block explorer, allowing the community to see what's in store. They've also built a bridge between Solana Devnet and Solaxy Testnet.

Solaxy's presale is ongoing – but not for long. It has raised almost $40 million in funding, and with 24 days left, FOMO is ramping up. Right now, investors can buy the native SOLX token in presale for just $0.001732 each.

The team at 99Bitcoins believes SOLX has “10x potential” once it goes live on exchanges. And given all the early hype and the community backing, there's every chance Solaxy could soar even higher. 

If you grew up grinding dungeons in MapleStory, NEXPACE (NXPC) is an altcoin worth adding to your watchlist. This is a full-blown Web3 reboot backed by gaming giant Nexon, transforming a beloved franchise into a decentralized economy.

The mechanics are clever. NXPC fuels a “Fission-Fusion” system that lets users mint NFT item baskets or convert them back into tokens – turning your loot into liquid assets. There's also a supply cap on NXPC and no VC influence.

Plus, NEXPACE has support across Avalanche and BNB Chain. So, if you're looking for a high-upside altcoin backed by a legacy brand, NEXPACE could be a great opportunity. 

Merlin Chain (MERL) is another altcoin that could make you rich. It's a Layer-2 built specifically to boost Bitcoin – bringing smart contracts, faster transactions, and even zkEVM compatibility to the OG crypto.

Launched in early 2024, Merlin already has over 200 projects in its ecosystem, with developers loving its EVM tools and ZK-rollup design. It's not just fast – it's also built for scale. And with a Fork 12 upgrade coming soon, throughput could be increased by 60x.

Toss in a community-led governance system, solid token utility, and a move to Proof-of-Stake, and Merlin Chain looks like it could be the future of Bitcoin.

The broader crypto market experienced a sharp decline over the weekend, as Bitcoin price dropped from $111,200 to just above $107,000, driven by fears of a renewed Trump tariff war with the European Union.

The broader crypto market has come under strong selling pressure over the weekend amid rising concerns around Trump's tariff wars. Altcoins are leading today's crypto bloodbath with top assets like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA), correcting between 5-and 7% in the last 24 hours. According to Coinglass data, the crypto market liquidations in the last 24 hours have soared to over $600 million. Of these, $500 million is in long liquidation while $98 million is in short liquidation.

Bitcoin's price experienced a sharp decline on Friday, dropping from a daily high of $111,200 to just above $107,000. This was due to renewed fears of a tariff war sparked by President Donald Trump. Trump threatened a 50% tariff on the European Union, citing stalled negotiations, which rattled market sentiment.





This pullback comes after Bitcoin recently reached fresh highs above $111,500, driven by ETF inflows, stablecoin legislation progress, and increased institutional buying. However, these supportive factors have failed to shield altcoins, which remain under pressure in the short term. In a Telegram message, Haiyang Ru, co-CEO of HashKey Group, said:

“Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high also carries altcoins toward a bullish direction. But if BTC's volatility picks up again, traders may rotate into regulated stablecoins — especially with new frameworks in the U.S. and Hong Kong easing that transition.”

The global macro uncertainty has once again gripped crypto market as tariff tensions continue to escalate and US Treasury yields have surged to 4.5%. Altcoins like Ethereum will play a decisive role in deciding future trajectory, after 50% upside over the past month.

Ethereum (ETH) staged a strong rally earlier this week to $2,700, wherein it faced a partial pullback and is now trading under $2,600. For a sustained upside, the ETH price needs to cross $2,900 convincingly for a further move to all-time high.

Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes had predicted a significant altcoin season this summer, with Ethereum expected to outperform Solana in the upcoming rally.

According to Hayes, this altcoin season will differ from 2021, when nearly every cryptocurrency surged by 100x. Instead, the market may see a more selective and measured rally this time.

With Solana solidifying its position in the crypto ecosystem, Solaxy ($SOLX) is making waves as an innovative blockchain solution designed to enhance Solana's performance and scalability.

Solaxy tackles persistent issues such as network congestion, scalability bottlenecks, and transaction failures during peak activity periods. By processing transactions off-chain and bundling them into optimized batches for final settlement on Solana's mainnet, Solaxy aims to improve transaction reliability and network efficiency.

To support early investors, Solaxy has launched a presale of its native token, SOLX, offering a competitive 103% APY for staking.

Presale Highlights:

Post-presale, the SOLX token will be deployed across multiple chains, enabling participants to bridge their holdings to the SOLAXY Layer 2 blockchain.

Bitcoin recently climbed above $111,000, marking a fresh all-time high and stirring new interest across the crypto space. After a small pullback, the focus is turning to altcoins, with several showing early signs of movement. Solana rose 4%, XRP lifted 1%, and Cardano saw a 2% gain. These numbers have led some to believe that the next stage of the market cycle could be near.

Historically, Bitcoin tends to lead a rally. Once it settles, other coins usually begin to move. This pattern has played out in past bull runs, and many traders now expect the same again. They are watching closely for any signs of capital rotating from Bitcoin into altcoins.

Bitget Research Chief Analyst Ryan Lee told CoinDesk that the start of an altcoin run may depend on a drop in Bitcoin's market dominance. If that happens, it could open the door for coins like Solana and XRP to gain more ground. At the time of writing, Bitcoin's dominance stands at around 60.58%, according to CoinGecko.

Similarly, eToro Australia analyst Reece Hobson told Decrypt that two conditions could set off an altcoin rally. First, he says more liquidity needs to flow into the system, likely through monetary easing. Second, Bitcoin dominance would need to hit the 70% range. Until then, altcoin gains may remain limited.

Some market watchers believe the signs of an altcoin season are already appearing. According to trader Carl Moon, Bitcoin's market share is already falling, which he says could mark the start of an altcoin breakout. His view adds to the growing belief that attention may now shift to other tokens.

However, not everyone shares the same sense of urgency. Ash Crypto took a more cautious stance, encouraging traders to be patient. He noted that in past market cycles, altcoin rallies have typically been brief, lasting just four to five months. In the last cycle, major altcoin gains took place between January and May 2021. In an earlier cycle, from 2013 to 2017, the bulk of the rally occurred between June and December. Based on those patterns, he believes another surge is likely—but timing it will require patience.

Meanwhile, Mena Theodorou, co-founder of Coinstash, gave a more cautious view. He said Bitcoin is still in its price discovery phase. This stage tends to keep focus and capital centered on Bitcoin, making it less likely for altcoins to see a strong, market-wide rally in the short term. He added that while a few altcoins or sectors might still perform well, a broader move across the market is less likely just yet.

Traders looking for clear signals are keeping a close eye on Bitcoin's market dominance. While some believe a drop would help altcoins, others suggest dominance might need to rise further before altcoin interest returns. This difference in view shows that even within the market, there's no single answer.

In the meantime, Ethereum's recent gains have added to the positive sentiment. As Ethereum climbs in market value, some see it as a signal that the market is ready for another wave of movement outside Bitcoin. However, others still urge caution.

While excitement is growing, the full rotation into altcoins hasn't happened yet. Traders and analysts alike are waiting to see what comes next, knowing that past cycles have always followed a similar path—first Bitcoin, then the rest. Now, all eyes are on whether that next step is just around the corner.

The grandmother of performance art wants to teach the masses, specifically her burgeoning young audience, how to disconnect from technology.

Fashion and General Assignments Editor, London


	Marina Abramović is a workaholic, and a brave one at that.


	In the name of art, she has laid inside a burning wooden star; been strangled by thick snakes; fasted for 12 days, and let an audience take control of her body using objects such as glass, candle, rose, hairbrush, mirror, gun, chains, axe and an array of sharp knives.


	At 78 years old, the Serbian artist plans to go further with her next venture and enter — literally — the world of non-fungible tokens, otherwise known as NFTs.


	In “Marina Abramović Element,” the artist will come to life digitally with help from TAEX, the digital art marketplace.

	“I would love to have my avatar to do things my real body can't. I can't levitate, walk on fire or knives, or fly, but my avatar can. This could create all the performances of my dreams and that's fantastic,” she says during an interview at the Jumeirah Carlton Tower in London. 


	The project is based on a fictional story she's written titled “Legend.” Three chapters of the story have been translated into NFTs. “Art” will be released in mid-June with a focus on her portraits followed by “Life,” in September, which touches on locations and gestures; while “Marina Abramović Method” will be released in November in what she describes as a “pursuit of self-discovery.”


	The final NFT drop, “The Great Mint,” will happen in January 2026. People will be able to use the NFTs they've collected to access video artworks or extended animations.


	Users gameplay as an avatar based on the artist and are rewarded with collectible items. The NFTs can be accessed on a mobile device and users can watch them on a loop.


	The avatar has all of Abramović's Balkan characteristics including her raven-colored hair, striking nose and hazel eyes.


	Each movement that Abramović's avatar makes has been practised by the artist in a green room over a hundred times for the technology to pick up on her nuances.


	Abramović's has spent much of the past year on the project — and still continues to refine it. For the artist, patience is not only a virtue, but a way of life. “I sat for three months in a museum looking at [more than] 1,500 people in the eyes for eight hours a day. Is this called patience or not?” she asks?

	











	Repetition is a meditative act for her that she says opens up her consciousness and unlocks a fifth dimension, which is something she wants users to participate in.


	One of the movements in “Marina Abramović Element” shows the artist opening a door and taking a step without entering the frame of the door. It's one of the many drills of entering the fifth dimension, she says.


	“The first five or six minutes of doing the movement is amusing, then you start to go crazy and wonder, ‘She's totally out of her mind, why am I doing this stupid s–t?” Then after an hour, the door is no longer just a door — the door becomes the opening of the consciousness and a space for the mind to shift,” Abramović adds.


	“Marina Abramović Element” is dotted with crystals such as clear quartz and amethysts. She calls crystals “simplified computers of the planet, all information is in crystals.”


	The NFTs project opens up a world of possibilities to what she can do as a performance artist. She agreed to engage with this new format as a way to connect with her ever growing new audience of young people who are discovering her work for the first time. 


	She said her audience now starts at the age of 14, and she now gets recognized in public.


	“If you really want to have some kind of relationship with a young audience, you have to embrace technology because that's what they start with at school. I'm using technology to create my own method of using it in a spiritual, meditative and positive way,” Abramović explains. 


	She says she hates how addictive technology is becoming and hopes her project will introduce more holistic practices in the lives of her younger fans.


	Abramović has started working with a group of children and one of the exercises she has them doing is putting on headphones without any sound playing to block out outside noises.


	“They told me the headphones are broken. I said, ‘No, it's about silence.' Young kids have never heard silence in their life. I am actually taking technology and bringing them back into something that can completely transform their attachment [styles] and make them [break out of being] impatient and moving too fast. Kids can't concentrate [for] more than 10 minutes,” she says.

	











	Abramović says she finds her focus by being in nature. She calls studio work a trap.


	“I like to go to countries where they don't know what Coca-Cola is or they don't have electricity — somewhere as far as I can go to see Indigenous cultures and to learn from them and nature. I live life and then from life comes the idea. I'm interested in the idea that I'm most afraid of, otherwise it's the same s–t over and over again,” she says.


	She finds that she's most transformed when she's doing long-term work over a period of months, to a year. “When you do something for three months, life and art become one thing — there's no separation,” she adds.


	Abramović's most recent expedition was in the Mexican mountains.


	“I loved Mexico because nobody spoke about Donald Trump and the [Mexican] people have dignity and traditions they still believe in,” she says.


	In Mexico, a shaman told her that her energy is “too male” and to balance it out Abramović now wears a moonstone bracelet for “feminine energy.”


	She describes herself as a warrior who's always working on the front line.


	Abramović is acknowledged as a pioneer, and refers to herself as the “grandmother of performance art.”


	She was the first female artist to host a major solo exhibition in the Royal Academy of Arts' 255-year-old history. In May, she was the first woman to show at the Accademia di Belle Arti at the Venice Biennale.


	“It looks like I'm a bulldozer or a tractor — first me and then the girls can come. I always think women are so strong — just the power of creating life in your body is a huge power. And we just take this role of being submissive to men, which is complete bulls–t because we can actually do it very well,” she says.


	Abramović has been making art and pushing her body for more than five decades yet she's still indefatigable in her work ethic. “I love working, honestly,” she says.


	In the autumn, she will present “Marina Abramović: Balkan Erotic Epic” at Factory International in Manchester, which explores eroticism, spirituality and rituals. The latter two are themes the artist first discovered as a child at her grandmother's house.

	











	Abramović's work has always been educationally infused with Balkan wisdom and sensibilities from her childhood — she was born in Belgrade, Serbia, then part of Yugoslavia.


	She does not see her art as a commercial venture. Even though NFTs have diminished in popularity, Abramović's approach is totally different and far from the “tech bro” association.


	Sébastien Devaud, a multidisciplinary artist better known to the Web3 space as Agoria, argues that the NFT and digital art space may seem more quiet because an “inflated value of works with no real substance has vanished” leaving room for works with deeper meaning.


	Digital artists' creations are now being taken more seriously and studied with care, he said.


	Agoria was invited by the Musée d'Orsay in Paris last year to present two pieces of digital artwork.


	He said he prefers the muted scene of NFTs and digital art now.


	“The noise from gambling and the wave of speculators chasing quick money has faded. What remains are those truly passionate about the technology, the meaning, the innovation. Now, real progress can begin,” he added, reiterating that he's genuinely optimistic about the work that's being produced.


	The numbers of people interacting with NFTs are not what they used to be, but the audiences engaging with NFTs are more “intentional” with their choices and are there for “the right reasons.”


	Abramović is purposeful in what she sets her heart on.


	She's entering the NFTs space at a calm time that suits her rhythm, one that could almost be reminiscent of life in the ‘70s, before the boom of technology. 


	Abramović is an artist from simpler times.


	“Telegrams were the way to communicate. You'd pay by the word when sending a letter at the post office and then you'd wait 10 days to get an answer, nowadays you write one email and you get an answer immediately. It's hell,” she says.


	But Abramović is a disrupter. It's hard to imagine her making art that's considered steady. She loves extremes and danger, no wonder a scorpion crawls across her face in one of her NFTs while remaining still and present.

Alchemy, a web3 development platform, has acquired California-based NFT launchpad HeyMint to enhance its smart wallet technology. After being disclosed on May 23, HeyMint's tools and team will be integrated into Alchemy's expanding infrastructure.  Alchemy will onboard HeyMint's co-founder and CTO, Flor Ronsmans De Vry, as part of the deal. 

HeyMint removes technical obstacles to help users create NFTs easily. Over 40,000 creators have used the platform, and it has managed to sell NFTs for over $38 million. Some of its services include customizing smart contracts and offering tools such as Discord bots and allowlists for community members' engagement.

From powering millions of allowlist entries through HeyMint Allowlist, to enabling brands and creators to earn $38M+ with HeyMint Launchpad, and 10x'ing engagement through HeyMint Quest, it's safe to say that we've built out all the tools to manage your NFT collection. (3/5)

HeyMint has also participated in major Web3 campaigns with brands like Universal Music Group and The Sandbox. De Vry said Alchemy will enable HeyMint to scale its efforts to make Web3 user onboarding more convenient.

Alchemy president Joe Lau noted that HeyMint's focus on accessibility aligns with the company's vision for mainstream Web3 adoption. “Together, we will continue to improve and evolve Alchemy's Smart Wallets,” Lau said. The merger will also extend to HeyMint Quest, which is designed to promote growth in NFT communities through interactive features.

The purchase aligned with Alchemy's intention to play a key role in Web3 infrastructure. The firm is still focusing on smart wallets as a key area for expansion, making it easy and secure to use decentralized applications. With HeyMint's tools integration, the company seeks to make it easier for users to access multiple Ethereum Layer 2 chains such as Arbitrum, Base, Optimism and Polygon.

The service's impact extends beyond its technical features. In 2023, the platform supported NFT sales for the Partnership for Central America which included Mastercard and other companies. During its two years of operation, HeyMint's user base grew to more than 1 million highlighting its influence in early-stage Web3 adoption. Its easy-to-use minting pages and no-code features appeal to both individuals and enterprises.

Furthermore, Alchemy recently acquired Dexter Lab, a real-time data provider for Solana. These deals demonstrate that Alchemy aims to expand developer support across ecosystems. To boost its blockchain services in Europe the firm purchased Bware and established a diversified infrastructure portfolio across Web3.

With the acquisition of HeyMint, Alchemy helps increase the number of mergers and acquisitions in the cryptocurrency sector. The improved regulation and helpful policies in the U.S. have made companies move forward with more strategic investments. Notably, Robinhood purchased WonderFi for $179 million and Ripple purchased Hidden Road for $1.25 billion.

PitchBook statistics report that total funding volume has more than doubled year over year, but the number of venture capital deals has decreased. This trend highlights that investors are interested in expanding their Web3 capabilities. 

Moreover, the company's aim to grow through the targeted purchase of companies reflects the industry's push to reduce the barriers to blockchain adoption and increase user experience.

Metrics details

Biometric data has the potential to revolutionize health analytics and pharmacology by providing personalized insights into drug efficacy and health trajectories. However, its governance presents significant ethical challenges, particularly around individual ownership and privacy. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a sustainable and ethical framework that integrates biometric data with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). We developed a customized NFT framework with advanced smart contract functionalities that enhance privacy protection and decentralized authentication of biometric data ownership. This approach ensures the secure and ethical management of digital health data while reinforcing individuals' control over their biometric information. By leveraging cryptographic techniques for privacy protection, this framework enhances both the security and efficiency of personal health data management, offering a new perspective on ownership in digital health. Furthermore, a sustainable economic model is proposed to facilitate ethical transactions of tokenized biometric data within the NFT marketplace. The implications of this study extend beyond technology and commerce, offering valuable insights into human behavior in emerging digital economies and contributing to the creation of a more sustainable and equitable digital health ecosystem.

The rapid evolution of technological innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), is reshaping numerous sectors at an unprecedented pace. These advancements critically depend on the availability and quality of data, following the principle that higher-quality data lead to more significant insights and outcomes. Among various data types, biometric data stand out for their depth and potential utility, ranging from daily health indicators to complex genomic profiles1. This vast array of data enables a sophisticated understanding of health and lifestyle patterns, enhancing predictive models for pharmacological interventions and physiological simulations conducted in silico2.

However, the accumulation and management of such sensitive biometric data pose significant ethical and governance challenges, particularly regarding ownership rights, which are rarely conferred upon the data creators. This misalignment between data generation and proprietary rights raises serious concerns about privacy, control, and the equitable use of personal information3. Traditional methods—such as encryption4, secure hardware5, anonymization6, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)7—ensure privacy and security, but they primarily focus on access control rather than decentralized ownership or monetization. While ZKPs support privacy-preserving authentication, they are computationally intensive and lack data portability. Privacy-focused databases ensure regulatory compliance but depend on centralized trust, limiting user autonomy. In contrast, NFTs offer a decentralized framework enabling verifiable ownership, secure transactions, and traceability. When combined with advanced cryptographic methods, NFTs provide a scalable and privacy-enhancing solution for sensitive data management.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a transformative solution to these challenges. NFTs are unique digital tokens powered by blockchain technology, representing scarce digital assets with distinct value within a blockchain network. While previous studies have explored the integration of biometric data with NFTs2,8,9,10, they have primarily remained conceptual, focusing on theoretical discussions rather than practical implementation. In contrast, the objective of this study is to develop a secure and decentralized framework—Cell-NFT—for the ownership, management, and application of biometric data using NFT technology.

Unlike previous research focused on domains like the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)11,12, the Cell-NFT framework introduces innovations specifically tailored for healthcare. These innovations include standardized data management, robust ownership mechanisms, and cryptographic privacy-enhancing techniques, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations in healthcare and biotechnology.

Traditional database systems, while efficient at storing and retrieving data, rely on centralized control for access management and data integrity. This centralized approach introduces risks such as unauthorized modifications, lack of transparency, and dependence on intermediaries for trust. In contrast, blockchain technology offers a decentralized solution, where data integrity is cryptographically verifiable, and records are tamper-proof. By integrating these features, the Cell-NFT framework ensures that biometric data ownership and transactions are transparent, auditable, and resistant to manipulation.

The metadata schema for Cell-NFTs is not a simple replication of traditional database functions but is designed to leverage blockchain's unique advantages in data security and provenance tracking. Unlike conventional databases, where data integrity depends on a central authority, blockchain-based metadata guarantees tamper-proof records, cryptographically verifiable ownership, and decentralized access control. This approach is particularly valuable in biomedical applications, where regulatory compliance, transparency, and auditability are essential. Traditional databases are vulnerable to unauthorized modifications and require extensive trust in intermediaries, whereas blockchain mitigates these risks by providing a transparent and immutable ledger of all recorded interactions. By incorporating these features, our approach offers significant improvements in data integrity, security, and long-term reliability compared to conventional storage solutions.

Our research presents a pioneering methodology that integrates biometric data into NFTs to establish robust ownership records. By tokenizing biometric information, this framework preserves individual uniqueness and represents biological identity within the digital sphere, enabling secure certification of data ownership. Biometric NFTs contain comprehensive digital life data, enabling their governance and exchange across diverse digital platforms and marketplaces. The accompanying metadata schema is designed to boost both accessibility and practical use by streamlining data sharing and transactions, thereby enhancing management workflows and reinforcing the foundation of a secure and efficient digital health infrastructure.

Tokenized biometric data have diverse applications, including use by hospitals and pharmaceutical companies. To address limitations in current NFT-based healthcare and biotechnology solutions, our framework employs a metadata schema and ecosystem designed to achieve enhanced data security, streamlined processes, and improved accessibility. This tokenization introduces societal benefits, such as improved data management security and the emergence of new industries centered on innovative digital assets. Additionally, the work underscores the concept of individuality in the digital age, presenting both challenges and opportunities at the intersection of human behavior, ethics, and societal norms.

Issuance of NFTs using biometric data. (a) Types of biometric data derived from the human body. (b) Process of collecting cardiomyocytes from urine as biometric data. (c) Impact of NFTs created from the collected cardiomyocytes and their associated metadata.

Biometric data can be generated from various human physiological functions, including facial recognition, cardiac and pulmonary metrics, and biological sample analysis (Fig. 1a). These data are crucial for understanding individual health, identity, and physiological function. A central aim of this research is to tokenize such biological information, with a particular focus on cardiomyocytes, given their central role in heart function. By tokenizing these cells, we enable virtual ownership of an individual's heart through NFTs. These NFTs encapsulate encrypted metadata on the blockchain, which includes key information such as genetic data, experimental details, and ownership records.

In addition to cardiomyocytes, other types of biometric data—such as those derived from various cell types (Fig. 1b)—can be tokenized using NFTs. The metadata from these cells can be utilized for identity authentication. The study protocol received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Kangwon National University Bioethics Committee (Republic of Korea) (KWNUIRB-2024-02-008-001).

For this study, cells were derived from noninvasive, easily collectible urine samples and subsequently dedifferentiated into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Fig. 1b). Notably, iPSCs can differentiate into various cell types, including osteocytes, neurons, and muscle cells. Cardiomyocytes, a specific type of muscle cell, were selected for the issuance of Cell-NFTs. Given that NFTs can be produced in video format, dynamic representations of the cardiomyocytes—such as heartbeats—are provided as supplementary videos (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2), enhancing the personal connection to the tokenized data and their market value.

The encrypted metadata within these NFTs can be classified into three categories: Biological data, Image data, and Experimental data (Fig. 1c). Biological data can include unique identifiers such as cell-specific DNA and RNA sequences obtained from whole-genome sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 1). Image data consist of captured cell images that are minted as NFTs. Experimental data provide a comprehensive overview of the processes involved, such as the dates on which cells were acquired, the differentiation methods used, and the timeline of NFT creation. Within the Image and Experimental data, it is feasible to demonstrate the process of obtaining cells from an individual to establish ownership rights over the NFTs.

Cell imaging serves a dual purpose: it is both scientifically valuable and aesthetically engaging. This dual function has been recognized by companies like GE Healthcare, which organizes cell imaging competitions, as well as by renowned academic institutions such as the University of Queensland, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Stanford. These institutions host contests to showcase beautiful cell images, further highlighting the appeal of cellular imagery. Such collections not only attract attention for their visual impact but also provide a rich dataset, capturing the interest of the scientific community eager to extract detailed biological and experimental information.

Cardiomyocytes derived from urine samples are isolated through three critical steps, as illustrated in Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2, and detailed in previous studies13,14. The first step involves isolating urine-derived cells (UDCs) from urine samples. These UDCs are then reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) through electroporation, a non-viral technique that avoids the risks of oncogene activation associated with viral reprogramming methods15 (Supplementary Fig. 3). The final step involves differentiating the iPSCs into cardiomyocytes, as demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. 4.

Differentiation method and morphology of cardiomyocytes. (a) Three steps for obtaining cardiomyocytes from urine. (b) Conceptual illustration of a WGS-based analysis of UDC-derived genetic information. (c) Confocal image of cardiomyocytes stained with cardiac troponin T, alpha-actinin-2, and Hoechst 33,342 (scale bar: 20 μm). (d) Spontaneous contraction and expansion of cardiomyocytes, mimicking a natural heartbeat.

Figure 2b illustrates a potential approach for acquiring comprehensive genetic information from UDCs using whole genome sequencing. This sequencing provides a detailed view of an individual's unique genetic code, aiding in identity authentication16. Furthermore, since lifestyle and environmental factors can impact genomic data over generations17, storing such diverse biometric data on the blockchain (as shown in Fig. 1a) allows the analysis of their interrelationships and discovery of new insights18,19.

To assess the morphology of the cardiomyocytes, we captured high-resolution fluorescence images (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). Cardiomyocytes exhibit rhythmic contraction and expansion, mimicking the natural heartbeat at a rate of 60 beats/min (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2).

The implications of these findings within the NFT space are profound. Integrating human life data into the metaverse marks a pioneering development, garnering significant interest from potential NFT participants. This integration serves two important purposes: it helps alleviate apprehensions individuals may have about the metaverse while also offering a unique, personal way to preserve and memorialize the biological data of loved ones in a virtual space. This allows for the celebration and preservation of life, even in the digital realm.

The fluorescence image of the cardiomyocyte shown in Fig. 2c was minted as a unique digital token, termed as Cell-NFT. This token encapsulates extensive information, with its value being inherently linked to the intrinsic attributes and cell origin. For example, a cell derived from a notable individual could command a higher value. As illustrated in Fig. 3a, these Cell-NFTs are available for acquisition in the contemporary metaverse marketplace using digital currencies such as Ethereum20.

Ethereum utilizes the environmentally sustainable Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism21,22,23, which significantly reduces the energy consumption typically associated with mining. This eco-friendly approach offers substantial environmental benefits, particularly for large-scale applications. In contrast, Proof of Work (PoW) mining requires considerable electrical energy and computational resources for block creation and verification, resulting in enhanced security. Moreover, PoW's decentralized nature fosters a secure, independent network. As such, many blockchain platforms suitable for the creation of these added-value tokens will emerge, with the most effective methods likely evolving through collaboration with major projects like Bitcoin, Bitmobick, and Ethereum.

Similar to conventional NFTs, each Cell-NFT is accompanied by a descriptive section that provides potential investors with a summary of the tokenized cell, thereby enhancing its appeal. Crucially, the metadata, which serve as the digital fingerprint of the token, are encrypted and securely embedded within the NFT via blockchain technology.  As illustrated in Fig. 3b, metadata are categorized into three domains: “Biological data,” “Image data,” and “Experimental data.” The integration of these metadata categories is fundamental to the minting of each Cell-NFT.

(c) URL of the minted Cell-NFT containing cardiomyocytes and its associated metadata. (d) Metadata schema for the Cell-NFT with cardiomyocytes.

Once minted, Cell-NFTs are made available on OpenSea, a prominent NFT marketplace. These tokens hold value beyond marketplace transactions; they also have practical applications in sectors like healthcare and pharmaceuticals, depending on their intended purpose. URLs linking to these NFTs are displayed in Fig. 3c. Although OpenSea offers a public-facing platform, it ensures the privacy of metadata by concealing its detailed content. Only the legitimate owner of the Cell-NFT can access the complete metadata, which is structured as shown in Fig. 3d.

The metadata of a Cell-NFT comprise various types of cell-related information, organized within a structured schema as shown in Fig. 3d. This schema includes sections such as “name,” “description,” “image,” “donator,” “experimentation,” and “processing procedure,” each detailing specific aspects of the cell. Supplementary Fig. 7 provides detailed explanations of each section. Additionally, comprehensive metadata associated with the Cell-NFT can be accessed through the designated metadata URLs in Fig. 3c and Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9.

Cell-NFT ecosystem: (a) Cell NFT Issuer. (b) Cell Storage. (c) Cell-NFT. (d) NFT Marketplace.

The Cell-NFT ecosystem introduces a groundbreaking approach to the representation and transaction of cellular data, as illustrated in Fig. 4. This ecosystem enables the value and ownership of biological data to be represented as NFTs. In this system, ownership of a Cell-NFT not only confers biological data but also confers tangible economic value, making the NFT tradable in various NFT marketplaces.

As shown in Fig. 4a, when a cell donor wishes to tokenize their biological data, they request a Cell-NFT issuer to facilitate the creation of Cell Storage. The issuer, which can be an individual or institution, plays a critical role in validating the NFT prototype through consensus from a pool of trusted issuers. Upon issuance, Cell Storage provides a unique contract address to the Cell-NFT issuer and updates the donor's affiliated smart contract.

If a buyer or researcher expresses interest in the cell's data, Cell Storage acts as an intermediary, alerting the donor to any incoming offers or bids (Fig. 4b). Upon the donor's approval, Cell Storage proceeds to mint the Cell-NFT (Fig. 4c). The minted NFT is then transferred to the interested buyer or researcher following payment. A real-world scenario from a researcher's perspective illustrates how Cell-NFTs can be minted, traded in marketplaces, and utilized in scientific experiments.

This ecosystem ensures the donor retains control over the funds held in the Cell Storage, allowing them to manage withdrawals and deposits at their discretion. A key feature of the ecosystem is its flexibility for secondary market trading. After an initial purchase, the buyer or researcher can list the Cell-NFT on an open marketplace (Fig. 4d), allowing secondary buyers to participate in the transaction. However, to protect the donor's rights, the ecosystem grants the donor the option to restrict secondary sales to authorized entities or collect loyalty fees from subsequent trades of their Cell-NFT.

In essence, the Cell-NFT ecosystem merges biotechnology with digital assets, offering a new paradigm for bio-data issuance, ownership, and exchange.

Our exploration of the convergence between biometric data and blockchain technology, culminating in the creation of Cell-NFTs, represents a transformative step in the digitalization of biological assets. The Cell-NFT model offers an innovative solution by using blockchain to manage access permissions for biometric data, ensuring individual autonomy, transparent governance, and regulatory compliance.

While previous research has primarily conceptualized the application of biometric data to NFTs2,8,9,10, our study provides actionable proposals for its implementation. We have developed an integrated NFT system that overcomes prior challenges related to data security, increased risks, cumbersome processes, and limited user engagement.

Recent studies emphasize blockchain's potential in improving financial ecosystems and fostering societal trust through decentralized systems24. Building on these insights, the Cell-NFT framework not only advances biometric data management but also contributes to broader economic efficiency and blockchain innovation. This reinforces the social value of secure, self-sovereign digital identity solutions, particularly in healthcare.

A key element in this transformation is the valuation of biometric data, which varies based on factors like rarity, sensitivity, and application. Establishing a robust valuation framework that accounts for data scarcity, its significance in healthcare, and its research potential is essential. Ensuring fair compensation for individuals while promoting ethical trading practices is crucial for fostering a sustainable and transparent Cell-NFT marketplace.

The implications for medical diagnostics and therapeutics demand careful consideration of ethical and regulatory frameworks. As NFT adoption grows, legal standards continue to evolve, requiring ongoing compliance. Our framework does not facilitate the commercialization or unrestricted trading of biometric data but functions as a cryptographic mechanism for access control, ensuring individual ownership and autonomy. It enforces explicit, revocable consent while adhering to ethical guidelines that prioritize privacy and prevent unauthorized use. By design, the system prevents biometric data from being commodified, reinforcing responsible and compliant management.

Recent studies highlight the cybersecurity concerns and legal complexities of blockchain regulations across jurisdictions25. These studies underscore the need for alignment with NIST and ISO standards to ensure compliance. The Cell-NFT framework strengthens trust, security, and legal compliance in biometric data management by aligning with global regulations. It enables individuals to maintain control over their data via NFTs while adhering to laws such as HIPAA26,27, GDPR28, and the Australian Privacy Act29. These regulations require explicit consent, breach reporting, and user rights to access, modify, or delete data. Ethical standards like the Australia's National Statement30 and global standards like the Declaration of Helsinki31 further emphasize informed consent, confidentiality, and responsible data handling.

Ensuring ethical and legal compliance in NFT-based biometric data management is critical, especially in the context of data breaches, misuse, and privacy violations. Key risks include unauthorized access, data manipulation, and accidental loss, which can compromise privacy. The Cell-NFT framework mitigates these risks through encryption, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and real-time monitoring. Smart contracts enforce compliance, while automated audit trails and breach notification mechanisms ensure transparency and regulatory adherence (GDPR, HIPAA). These strategies collectively strengthen trust, security, and accountability in decentralized biometric data management.

To safeguard ethical data usage further, we propose using smart contracts to enforce data usage conditions. These contracts would ensure secure, automated transactions and transfer ownership of Cell-NFTs only when ethical standards are met. By implementing these measures, biometric NFTs align with global privacy regulations, ethical standards, and emerging regulatory requirements for digital assets. Compliance with regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and local data protection laws is essential to responsibly manage biometric data. Trust in the Cell-NFT framework is reinforced through blockchain's immutable data storage, verifiable ownership via NFTs, and decentralized authentication via smart contracts. This trust is further bolstered by cryptographic security, decentralization, and blockchain transparency, which protect the integrity and confidentiality of biometric data.

Market dynamics, including demand, supply chains, and secondary sales, will significantly impact the value and liquidity of Cell-NFTs. Pricing models will incorporate factors like data uniqueness, demand for health data, and research potential. Ensuring fair trade and robust market mechanisms will be essential for the widespread adoption of the system.

A formal threat model has been developed to address risks such as data leakage, unauthorized access, smart contract vulnerabilities, and Sybil attacks. To mitigate these risks, the Cell-NFT framework employs encryption, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), and role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure data security and integrity.

Ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Cell-NFT system requires continuous optimization, adaptive strategies, and efficient user management. A dynamic metadata structure supports regular updates, while a user-friendly interface with role-based access controls enhances both security and accessibility. To address scalability, our framework incorporates Layer 2 solutions like rollups and sidechains, improving transaction throughput while reducing gas fees and computational overhead. A hybrid storage model securely stores biometric data off-chain, recording only cryptographic proofs on-chain to minimize storage costs and enhance blockchain efficiency. Additionally, off-chain processing and decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS, Arweave) ensure data integrity, regulatory compliance, and tamper-proof record-keeping. These improvements collectively enhance performance, scalability, and cost-effective decentralized access control in an evolving technological landscape.

While we acknowledge the limitation of not conducting direct experimental validation, this literature-driven comparative analysis provides a solid foundation for assessing the feasibility and potential impact of Cell-NFT. Traditional databases typically process transactions at approximately 500 TPS, while Cell-NFT, using Layer 2 scaling solutions, achieves 50 TPS while enhancing security. Centralized databases offer lower storage costs, whereas Cell-NFT mitigates high on-chain storage expenses by leveraging IPFS for off-chain data management. Furthermore, blockchain ensures immutable, decentralized security, whereas traditional databases rely on centralized administration, making them more susceptible to unauthorized modifications and security breaches.

Future work will focus on metadata standardization and retrieval within the Cell-NFT framework. The JSON-based schema will ensure interoperability, adhering to RDF and DCAT standards. Cross-platform adoption will be facilitated through integration with RESTful APIs, OData protocols, and schema validation. Key attributes such as “name,” “description,” and “experimentation” will support interoperability testing and data transformation, enhancing data accessibility, security, and regulatory compliance. Additionally, we plan to collaborate with healthcare institutions and industry partners to conduct pilot studies, evaluating the feasibility, security, and regulatory compliance of the Cell-NFT framework. These empirical investigations will bridge the gap between theoretical design and real-world implementation, ensuring scalability and adoption in secure data transactions.

Urine samples were collected from individual donors in compliance with the ethical guidelines outlined in the 64 th World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. The procedure was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the Kangwon National University Bioethics Committee (Republic of Korea) (KWNUIRB-2024-02-008-001). Informed consent was obtained from all donors before sample collection. A total of four human donors participated in this study (three male, one female), though the gender of the donors was not relevant to the outcomes of the study. Human urine samples were pooled to isolate epithelial cells, with the results not being influenced by the characteristics of the individual participants. The participation was voluntary, and only self-reported healthy individuals were included as eligible donors. Each donor provided between 250 and 300 mL of urine, which was stored in sterilized laboratory tubes at −4 °C until further processing.

Epithelial cells were isolated from urine samples as described previously13. To isolate UDCs, the primary medium (PM) was prepared by combining DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Welgene), REGMTM SingleQuotsTM supplements (Lonza), and 100 µg/mL Primocin® (InvivoGen). The REMC medium was prepared by mixing RE medium and MC medium in a 1:1 ratio. The RE medium consisted of REGMTM basal medium (Lonza), 10% FBS (Welgene), REGMTM SingleQuotsTM supplements (Lonza), and 100 µg/mL Primocin® (InvivoGen), while the MC medium contained DMEM high glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10% FBS (Welgene), 1X MEM GlutaMaxTM (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1X MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 µg/mL Primocin® (InvivoGen), 5 ng/mL Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF, Peprotech), 5 ng/mL Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF)-AB (Peprotech), and 5 ng/mL Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF, Peprotech). Washing buffer was prepared with PBS supplemented with 100 µg/mL Primocin® (InvivoGen).

A 12-well plate was coated with either Matrigel or 0.1% gelatin solution for over an hour to facilitate cell adherence before urine collection. A sample of 250–300 mL was collected and centrifuged at 500 ×g for 10 min at room temperature. The sample was washed with the washing buffer, followed by a second centrifugation and washing step. After aspirating the supernatant, the resulting pellet was resuspended in 3 mL of primary medium containing 10 µM ROCK inhibitor and transferred to a single well of a 12-well plate, where the cells were incubated at 37 °C (day 0). On days 2 and 3, 1 mL of primary medium was added to the well each day. On day 4, most of the medium was aspirated, leaving 1 mL, to which 1 mL of REMC medium was added. From day 4 onward, 1 mL of the existing medium was removed and replaced daily with 1 mL of fresh REMC medium. Upon observing cell colony formation around day 9, the medium was replaced with fresh REMC medium. Upon reaching 70% confluency, the cells were detached using 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA and subcultured onto a new plate coated with Matrigel or 0.1% gelatin.

UDCs were reprogrammed to iPSCs as previously described13. The electroporation medium (EM) was prepared using DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS (Welgene). Essential 8™ Medium (Gibco) and Essential 8™ Supplement (50X) were used to prepare the E8 medium. To enhance the viability of iPSCs during reprogramming, a ROCK inhibitor (Cayman) was included. The Yamanaka factors pCXLE-hOCT3/4-shp53-F, pCXLE-hSK, and pCXLE-hUL (all from Addgene) were utilized to reprogram UDCs into iPSCs.

Before reprogramming, either Matrigel or 0.1% gelatin solution was applied to a 35 mm dish for over an hour. The Yamanaka factors (hOCT3/4, hSK, and hUL) were prepared at a concentration of 1 µg/µL. The UDCs were detached using 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA, followed by centrifugation at 300 ×g for 3 min. After aspirating the supernatant, the cells were counted for electroporation, with 6 × 105 cells required per 100 µL tip. The cells were then resuspended in 100 µL R buffer for electroporation. The plasmids containing the reprogramming factors (hOCT3/4, hSK, and hUL) were introduced into the cells through electroporation at 1650 V, 10 ms, and 3 pulses. After electroporation, the cells were transferred to a 35 mm dish containing EM (day 0), and the cultures were maintained in E8 medium with daily medium changes. After 14 days, cell morphology transitioned from elongated to rounded, indicating the formation of iPSCs. The areas with rounded morphology were isolated by mechanical passaging, and a ROCK inhibitor was added to the E8 medium to ensure stable passaging. Stable iPSC lines were established after several rounds of mechanical passaging.

Cardiomyocyte differentiation from iPSCs was carried out as described previously14. To differentiate iPSCs into cardiomyocytes, RPMI Media (Gibco) and B-27 Supplements, both with and without insulin (Gibco), were used to prepare the cardiomyocyte differentiation media. Insulin is known to inhibit cardiac differentiation during the initial five days of iPSC differentiation14. Consequently, RPMI media supplemented with insulin-free B-27 was used up to day 5, after which the medium was switched to RPMI with B-27 containing insulin. To promote differentiation into the mesodermal lineage, a GSK3 inhibitor, CHIR 99021 (Sigma Aldrich), and a Wnt ligand production inhibitor, IWP (Sigma Aldrich), were added to the media. For single-cell dissociation of iPSCs, Accutase (Sigma Aldrich) was employed.

Before seeding, iPSCs were coated on a 12-well plate with either Matrigel or a 0.1% gelatin solution for 1 h to enhance cell adherence. The iPSCs were then dissociated into single cells using Accutase for 8 min at 37 °C. The dissociated cells were collected and centrifuged at 200 ×g for 3 min. Approximately 0.5–1.5 × 106 cells per well were seeded into the 12-well plate with E8 media containing ROCK inhibitor (day 4). The media were changed daily until day 0 when the cells reached 85–90% confluency. On day 0, the medium was aspirated and replaced with RPMI containing insulin-free B-27 and 12 µM CHIR 99,021. On day 1, the media were changed to RPMI with insulin-free B-27. On day 3, 1 mL of RPMI with insulin-free B-27 and 5 µM IWP2 was added to the medium. The media were then replaced on day 5 with RPMI containing insulin-free B-27, and on day 7, the medium was switched to RPMI with B-27 containing insulin. From this point onward, media changes were performed every 3 days using RPMI with insulin-containing B-27 (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Successful differentiation was confirmed by observing cardiomyocyte beating, a hallmark of cardiac differentiation, as shown in Supplementary videos 1 and 2. Figures 2b and c and 3b, and Supplementary Fig. 1 were created in BioRender. Heo, S. (2025) BioRender URL.

For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). They were then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min, followed by a PBS wash. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, the cells were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBS-T). The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-cTNT (Santa Cruz) and anti-ACTN2 (ABclonal) primary antibodies. After incubation, the cells were washed with PBS-T, and Alexa Fluor 488- and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were applied at 20 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed again with PBS-T, followed by incubation with 1 µg/mL Hoechst 33,342 in PBS for 1 h, and a final wash with PBS. Fluorescence was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6).

Cardiomyocyte contraction and expansion images were captured using the video function of the microscope. While cardiomyocytes were visibly beating without the aid of a microscope, we used the microscope to more precisely observe the beating patterns. A single beat was defined as a full cycle of contraction and expansion. The number of contraction-expansion cycles within a 60-s observation period was counted to determine the frequency of the cardiomyocytes.

A Kentucky-based cryptocurrency investor has been accused of torturing an Italian tourist in a high-end New York City apartment. 

What Happened: The accused, 37-year-old John Woeltz, was taken into custody after the 28-year-old victim managed to escape from the SoHo apartment on Friday morning and informed a police officer. 

The victim alleged that he had been held captive for more than two weeks. The alleged motive behind this horrifying act was to extort the victim's cryptocurrency account password.

Upon investigation, police found several Polaroid photos in the Prince Street apartment, which Woeltz rented for an estimated $30,000 to $40,000 per month. 

These photos depicted the victim undergoing various forms of torture. The victim was reportedly tied up with an electric cord, Tased, pistol-whipped, forced to consume cocaine, and threatened with an electric chainsaw, reports the New York Post. 

The conflict reportedly stemmed from a cryptocurrency dispute, with Woeltz trying to extort millions of dollars from the victim through a series of gruesome tortures.

Speculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500.

Post the incident, the victim was immediately taken to Bellevue Hospital for medical attention, while Woeltz was arrested and charged with multiple offenses including second-degree assault, first-degree kidnapping, and criminal possession of a weapon.

Along with Woeltz, 24-year-old Beatrice Folchi from Manhattan was also arrested and charged with first-degree kidnapping and first-degree unlawful imprisonment. Two other individuals believed to be associated with Woeltz are expected to be interviewed by the police soon.

Why It Matters: This incident underscores the potential risks and dangers associated with the cryptocurrency market. It serves as a grim reminder that while digital currencies offer numerous benefits, they can also be a target for criminals due to their high value and relative anonymity. 

As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to rise, it is crucial for investors to ensure the security of their digital assets and be aware of the potential risks involved.

From a tiny digital experiment, the use of cryptocurrencies has developed into a major influence, altering local economies throughout the United States. As local companies investigate and accept the advantages of digital currencies, this change in Washington, D.C., is slowly becoming more obvious. A rising number of capital-based businesses, from cafes and boutiques to service providers and software startups, are including cryptocurrencies in their payment systems and business strategies. The outcome is a change in how companies run, interact with consumers, and present themselves in a fast-digitalizing society.

The increased payment flexibility it provides is among the most obvious and quick effects of cryptocurrency growth in the D.C. region. Traditional payment methods like cash and credit cards have limitations—transaction fees, processing times, and often geographical restrictions. Cryptocurrencies allow for quick peer-to-peer transactions that can be executed at any time, even at night and on weekends. Offering bitcoin as a payment option is both creative and useful for companies serving a tech-savvy customer or visitors who choose distributed digital alternatives.

Digital currencies have started to be accepted in coffee shops, food trucks, and even local art galleries in areas like Adams Morgan and Shaw, allowing consumers the option to pay using safe mobile wallets. Apart from simplifying the buying process, this extra flexibility draws a larger audience, especially younger customers who are more prone to utilize and trust digital assets. This has led to increased interest in the ongoing USD to BTC exchange rate.

The lowering of transaction costs is another significant benefit for local companies. Often, credit card processing firms bill between 2% and 4% per transaction. By contrast, especially when companies utilize wallets and payment processors supporting direct transfers, digital currency payments usually include reduced expenses.

Reduced transaction costs translate into improved profit margins for small and medium-sized companies. For companies running on tight margins, such as local restaurants, convenience stores, and freelancing services, this might be particularly significant. Lower expenses on every transaction build up over time to produce more resources that may be put back into operations, personnel, or enhancements of the customer experience.

With a population of international students, diplomats, immigrants, and expatriates, Washington, D.C. is renowned for its variety. Many of these people could find conventional banking services either inconvenient or restricted. Cryptocurrency provides a different financial structure, allowing people to trade without a traditional bank account.

Local companies that accept digital currencies are therefore offering more easily available choices for these groups. Customers can utilize cryptocurrency without worrying about foreign transaction fees or conversion rates, whether they are paying for a haircut, ordering from a food delivery service, or hiring a language teacher. This inclusiveness paves the way for further community involvement and loyalty from underbanked groups.

Standing out can be challenging in a market as competitive as the D.C. region. Accepting cryptocurrencies helps companies to be forward-looking and creative. In areas with a lot of IT workers, business owners, and students, like Dupont Circle and Georgetown, this is especially helpful.

Being early users of digital money helps companies promote themselves as modern and flexible. Announcements on social media about taking crypto payments or incorporating blockchain-based loyalty programs usually create excitement and attract consumers who appreciate technological progress. Perceived innovation can drive more foot traffic and help to build brand identification.

Businesses in D.C. that serve an international customer base, including import/export stores, consulting companies, and art dealers, have discovered that cryptocurrency use streamlines cross-border payments. Unlike conventional bank transfers that could take several days and involve several middleman fees, bitcoin transactions are quicker, more open, and cheaper.

For tiny enterprises providing remote services or shipping overseas, this may be revolutionary. Reducing delays and complexity related to currency exchange and international banking procedures not only accelerates cash flow but also improves the consumer experience.

Though it has advantages, adopting cryptocurrency presents difficulties. Local business owners still have major worries about volatility. Digital assets' value can vary greatly over short times, which causes pricing and profit margin instability. Many companies change digital payments into stablecoins or fiat currency right after transactions to reduce this.

Understanding and properly controlling digital wallets, private keys, and tax reporting compliance also involves a learning curve. Some companies work with experts or go to nearby seminars teaching digital financial technologies and best practices to help with this. Washington, D.C.'s standing as a hub for politics and innovation has encouraged an increasing number of blockchain-oriented events and communities where entrepreneurs may learn more.

The introduction of cryptocurrency has motivated local D.C. area companies to form a community. Starting to hold events centered on blockchain and digital assets, co-working spaces, coffee shops, and business incubators offer networking chances and promote cooperation. This ecosystem of innovation inspires experiments with blockchain-based solutions, including inventory tracking, open contribution platforms, and even NFT-based consumer incentives.

Companies close to universities or policy institutions usually gain from a consistent flow of students, researchers, and interns, bringing new ideas and passion for distributed technology. This dynamic provides rich ground for testing and improving crypto-based business models.

The use of bitcoin among D.C. companies is predicted to increase as regulatory certainty on digital assets improves and public confidence in blockchain technology increases. Though not all businesses will use it right away, those who do are establishing themselves in the next wave of digital commerce.

Local businesses in Washington, D.C., are not only increasing their consumer base by adopting cryptocurrencies but also improving operational efficiency and brand awareness. The capital of the country might turn into a microcosm of how distributed financing could enable small businesses as this trend carries on.

Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high as it breached the $110,000 cap for the first time, following the advancement of a key crypto bill in the United States Senate, which has received bipartisan support, and is expected to aid those running crypto businesses.

The bill, called the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, has advanced in the US Senate, after some Democrat members who had initially opposed it, joined their Republican colleagues in supporting the bill, which regulated primarily stablecoin.

Bitcoin has fallen last month briefly over geopolitical uncertainties following Trump's tariff-induced assault on many countries, triggering fears of a global economic turmoil. However, with some of those concerns reducing, after events like the US signing a trade deal with China, the digital currency has been gaining momentum. The GENIUS Act played a further role in its upward surge.

While the bill has received support from some Democrat members because of which it moves forward in the US Senate, there are growing concerns that US President Donald Trump — once a crypto sceptic — and some of his supporters from the crypto and tech industry could personally benefit from it. Trump and his wife Melania have issued their own meme coins and have an active interest in the crypto market going up.

At its core, the GENIUS Act focuses on regulating stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to more predictable assets like the US dollar. Among others, it also allows big tech companies to issue stablecoins, in what is being seen as a big win for many of Trump's supporters from the industry, who threw their weight behind him in the run-up to the Presidential bid and have continued their support to him since his reelection.

The bill says that issuers must comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorism regulations, as well as privacy requirements under existing banking laws. It requires that crypto issuers must fully back stablecoins with fiat currency or high-quality liquid assets at a 1:1 ratio. They would also have to maintain reserves separate from operational funds and disclose these reserves publicly, with regular third-party audits.

Mark R Wright, Democrat Senator from the state of Virginia, who has supported the bill said that while many lawmakers have concerns about the Trump family's use of crypto technologies to “evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans”.

“But,” he said in justification of his support to the bill, “we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay. If American lawmakers don't shape it, others will – and not in ways that serve our interests or democratic values. Innovation in this space is happening, with or without us. We have a responsibility to ensure it happens safely, transparently, and in a way that advances U.S. economic and national security interests. The GENIUS Act will help get us started”.

Even though the GENIUS Act received bipartisan support in the US Senate, some Democrat members came down heavily against it.

As per a fact sheet released by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Ranking Member of the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, said, “A strong bill would ensure that consumers enjoy the same consumer protections when using stablecoins as they do when using other payment systems, close loopholes that enable the illicit use of stablecoins by cartels, terrorists, and criminals, and reduce the risk that stablecoins take down our financial system. The GENIUS Act does not meet those minimum standards”.

Warren said that while industry estimates suggest that  passing the GENIUS Act could help the stablecoin market grow 10-fold over the next three years to a $2 trillion market, Scaling up the stablecoin market without adequate safeguards risks increasing the “illicit use of stablecoins, which already account for over 60% of unlawful crypto transactions”.

There are also concerns around potential conflict of interest for US President Donald and his growing cryptocurrency firm, could inappropriately benefit from crypto. “This bill provides even more opportunities to reward buyers of Trump's coins with favors like tariff exemptions, pardons and government appointments,” Warren said in a speech ahead of the vote.

Another concern in the legislation is that it allows big tech companies to issue stablecoins. Companies like Meta had previously tried to make an unsuccessful foray into the crypto industry. As per the New York Times, some changes have been made to the bill to assuage concerns around the involvement of tech companies, requiring that they seek approval from a regulatory committee before issuing their own stablecoins.

While that appeared to assuage concerns of some Democrat members, not everyone was on board. “Despite new language on this issue, the final bill fails to prohibit Big Tech companies from issuing stablecoins. By tearing down the 200-year separation between banking and commerce, this bill undermines competition, threatens financial stability, and erodes financial privacy. While the bill purports to place restrictions on some Big Tech companies' ability to issue stablecoins, those restrictions are riddled with straightforward and easily identifiable loopholes,” Warren said in her fact sheet.

Bullish crypto bets lost over $500 million in the past 24 hours as traders took profits and markets slid following President Donald Trump's fresh threats of tariffs on European imports and Apple products, sparking a wave of liquidations.



Bitcoin, which had been trading above $111,000, dropped quickly to around $108,600, wiping out intraday gains and rattling broader market sentiment.



BTC's drop was mirrored across the crypto complex, with futures tracking ether (ETH), Solana's SOL, xrp (XRP) and dogecoin (DOGE) showing losses from $30 million to over $100 million.



Bitcoin futures saw roughly $181 million in losses, while Ether futures accounted for nearly $142 million. Altcoins added another $100 million in liquidations, including notable wipeouts in SOL, DOGE, and XRP.

The largest single liquidation was a $9.53 million BTC-USDT swap on OKX, CoinGlass data shows.



A liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to the trader's inability to meet the margin requirements.



Large-scale liquidations can indicate market extremes, like panic selling or buying. A cascade of liquidations might suggest a market turning point, where a price reversal could be imminent due to an overreaction in market sentiment.



The pullback arrived just as bitcoin was gaining momentum on ETF inflows and growing institutional interest, leading some to expect a calm weekend.



Instead, volatility returned in full force. With the macro environment now destabilized by renewed trade war fears, traders may remain cautious heading into next week's sessions.

 President Donald Trump's use of the presidential seal at a $TRUMP memecoin investor dinner may violate federal law. 

President Donald Trump is facing scrutiny after speaking at a private event for top investors in his $TRUMP memecoin while standing behind a lectern emblazoned with the official presidential seal — a move that may violate federal law.

The event took place Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where Trump addressed 220 investors in his cryptocurrency project.

According to US law, the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.

Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration's crypto stance.

When asked about potential conflicts of interest, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president's involvement was personal. “It is not a White House dinner,” she told reporters. “It's not taking place here at the White House.”

This isn't the first time Trump has featured the presidential seal at his private properties. Forbes has previously reported its use as golf markers at several Trump-owned clubs.

In a May 22 letter to the Justice Department, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry over the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution. 

Under the emoluments clause, a US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress.

Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely foreign nationals based on their connections to crypto exchanges. 

“US law prohibits foreign persons from contributing to US political campaigns,” said the letter. “However, the $TRUMP memecoin, including the promotion of a dinner promising exclusive access to the President, opens the door for foreign governments to buy influence with the President, all without disclosing their identities.”

Trump's embrace of crypto marks a sharp turn from his skepticism during his first term. The $TRUMP memecoin, launched earlier this year, peaked at $74.34 before falling to $14.44 by May 22.

High-profile guests at the dinner included Tron founder Justin Sun, ex-NBA player Lamar Odom, and Asian crypto executives Sangrok Oh and Vincent Liu.

Sun, who reportedly invested over $40 million in $TRUMP tokens and spoke at the dinner, also has deep ties to Trump's crypto ventures. He's the top backer of World Liberty Financial, a Trump-affiliated firm currently under regulatory scrutiny.

 “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets,” said Bitpace's Meryem Habibi. 

This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world's most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. 

But this attainment is not about one company alone. 

“This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it's a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn't just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. 

Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:

It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. 

“What's remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. 

“This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.

Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” 

Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.

The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.

Meanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” 

How much money could flow Coinbase's way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.

If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.

Institutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase's inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:

It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”



Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”

“We're not quite at full convergence, but we're definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital's listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase's role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.

More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn't necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers' Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” 

Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruption

Still, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan's Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq's digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal's launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.

“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.



Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. 

A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” 

Lau didn't expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”

Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it's struggling to meet the index's earnings requirements. “I don't see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.

“I'm not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It's really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we'll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”

Time will tell, but for now, “I'm not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.

 A US judge vacated Mango Markets exploiter's fraud convictions, ruling the DeFi protocol's permissionless design left no room for misrepresentation. 

A US federal judge has vacated key fraud and manipulation convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the trader at the center of the case involving a $110 million exploit of the decentralized exchange Mango Markets.

On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury's conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets.

The decision vacates Eisenberg's convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government's case.

Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango's MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collateral to withdraw $110 million in crypto assets from the platform.

Related: US DOJ seizes $24M in crypto from accused Qakbot malware developer

The Justice Department argued that he deceived Mango's smart contract-based lending system, but Eisenberg's defense maintained that he merely exploited poorly designed, permissionless code — without making any false representations.

Judge Subramanian agreed, writing that “Mango Markets was permissionless and automatic,” meaning the system couldn't be deceived in a legal sense. “There was insufficient evidence of falsity,” the judge added, siding with Eisenberg's interpretation of DeFi mechanics.

The judge also rejected prosecutors' argument that the case should be heard in New York. Eisenberg was in Puerto Rico at the time of the trades, and the court found that no meaningful activity tied to the alleged crime occurred in New York.

The DOJ had cited a Poughkeepsie-based Mango user and a third-party vendor in Manhattan, but the judge ruled these were not enough to establish proper venue.

The US government must now decide whether to refile the vacated charges, though the Trump administration has recently signaled a reduced focus on crypto enforcement. Eisenberg still faces civil suits from both the SEC and CFTC.

While this ruling clears Eisenberg in the Mango Markets case, he remains behind bars.

Related: Mango Markets exploiter sentenced to over 4 years on child abuse material charges

In a separate case, Eisenberg was sentenced to nearly four years in prison on May 1 after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography — a charge stemming from unrelated evidence uncovered during his arrest.

In December 2022, US federal law enforcement authorities arrested Eisenberg in Puerto Rico. FBI officials charged the hacker with one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation.

A jury found Eisenberg guilty of wire fraud, commodities fraud, and commodities manipulation in April 2024. The defense argued that the exploit was not a cybercrime and represented a “successful and legal trading strategy.”

Having reviewed dozens of drones of all shapes, sizes, and prices, I'd recently come to the conclusion that smaller, lighter, and cheaper drones were the way to go for 90 percent of consumers. Premium drones, with all their equipment and flight regulations, just didn't make sense. But then DJI launched its new premium-priced, jumbo-size flagship consumer drone, the Mavic 4 Pro, and made me fall in love all over again. Yes, this drone is seriously impressive.

But before I deep-dive the phenomenally good camera and ridiculously long range, it's important to note that the Mavic 4 Pro will not be officially available in the US. Yet. As well as ongoing issues around flight restrictions and security, a DJI spokesperson told WIRED, “Like many global companies, we have had to adjust our market strategy as local conditions and the industry environment have evolved. While we do not have a timeline for when we can introduce the product to the US market, we are closely monitoring the situation and actively exploring every possible solution.”

The Mavic 4 Pro is, however, listed on B&H Photo for $2,699, which is teasingly optimistic. It's not for sale, yet, but there is at least some hope.

So what makes the Mavic 4 Pro great? It's mostly down to the camera. Or cameras, I should say. Just like its predecessor, the Mavic 3 Pro (9/10 WIRED Recommends), the Mavic 4 Pro has three cameras. There's an ultra-high-spec wide-angle camera partnered with slightly lower-spec medium-telephoto and telephoto cameras. The trio's equivalent focal lengths are 28 mm, 70 mm and 168 mm, respectively.

They're all improvements over the Mavic 3 Pro's cameras. And the star of the show features a new 4/3 sensor capable of 100 MP photographs and 6K video capture at up to 60 fps (or 4K at 120 fps, for slick slow-motion playback), with an astounding 16 stops of dynamic range. It also has an adjustable aperture, allowing pilots to pick anything between f/2.0 and f/11.0.

The other cameras' sensors are a little smaller in size, their video is limited to 4K resolution, and their apertures are fixed at f/2.8, but all three cameras can capture video at 10-bit quality using the D-Log, D-Log M, or HLG color profiles. In other words, all are built for pro-quality aerial movie making.

And better yet, it is all mounted on a completely new design of gimbal that's able to freely rotate and tilt. Not only does this mean it can be pointed directly upward, it can also rotate to capture true portrait-oriented content, perfectly formatted for the likes of TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts.

All of the above makes the creative capabilities of the Mavic 4 Pro something to behold. It's a fantastic aerial camera in almost any lighting conditions (the 28-mm Hasselblad is particularly capable at night-time, for instance) and its range of motion and choice of focal lengths makes it incredibly versatile. If there's something else this accomplished in consumer drones, image-quality wise, I've yet to encounter it.

The drone's flight capabilities are impressive, too, right down to new time-saving touches like the fact it automatically powers on when unfolded. Battery life is now 51 minutes, a notable improvement over the Mavic 3 Pro's 43 minutes, while the more aerodynamic design of the drone makes flight both faster and quieter.

The 4 Pro is also the first Mavic model to come with a front-facing Lidar sensor, which, when teamed up with the low-light vision sensors that poke out in all directions, gives this drone a lot more situational awareness and anti-collision capability, even in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. This works well with its tracking capabilities, which allow it to accurately keep the camera focussed on people, boats, and vehicles while being flown either manually or autonomously.

Return to home capabilities have also been upgraded. The drone's enhanced visual skills now let it automatically fly back to its take-off point without the use of GPS. I was also able to move the home point to the current controller position rather than the take-off point, which is a handy feature to have if you're piloting the drone from a moving car or boat.

DJI sent me both a regular RC 2 controller and the new RC 2 Pro controller ($1,299) to test with the Mavic 4 Pro, and while the former works well enough, the RC 2 Pro really improves the experience. Its screen is larger and brighter and can rotate through 90 degrees to act more like a smartphone (it runs on Android, so you can install third-party apps), and it powers on automatically when you lift the screen from the body. This movement also results in the two thumb sticks popping up, meaning you don't have to screw them on each time you use the controller.

All in all, the Mavic 4 Pro represents a major upgrade over its already impressive predecessor and makes the idea of owning a larger drone once again very appealing. While it's true that heavier drones are subject to a lot of (often tiresome) restrictions compared to ultra-lightweight models, but the extra paperwork and care around flight locations seems like a price worth paying when they perform as well as this does.

As for the actual price of the Mavic 4 Pro, I'd call it expensive but good value—provided you're going to actually make use of this drone's vast array of capabilities. If you're just looking for something to get in the air and capture a few good-looking shots, the much cheaper DJI Mini 4 Pro (8/10 WIRED Recommends) is all you need. If you want the flexibility and power to create something special, the Mavic 4 Pro has it—and more.

I just hope DJI is able to navigate around the ongoing uncertainty of the Trump administration's tariffs, as it'd be a true shame if this brilliant drone were not available in the US.

The world's first home projector was the Pathé KOK Home Cinematograph. Launched in 1912, it used 28-millimeter film and a hand crank. Thanks to this kernel of an idea, I've just watched a film on the new Anker Nebula X1, in my garden, projected in 4K Ultra High Definition, onto a 120-inch screen, with a genuinely thrilling 4.1.2 surround-sound speaker system.

At home, I've never had the space, budget or patience to install a full-scale home cinema. But I do love the big screen, and in the pursuit of something close to a compromise I have tested dozens of superb portable projectors. As mobile technology has improved, these tiny Android-toting boxes of fun have made it possible for anyone to stream content onto a blank wall, screen, or the side of a tent. But none have come closer to looking and sounding like a proper home cinema than the Anker Nebula X1.

Anyone familiar with Anker's range of portable projectors will recognize the X1. It looks like the big brother of the excellent Cosmos Laser 4K ($2000). Externally there are similarities for sure, but inside ""the world's first cinema-grade outdoor entertainment system"" is a completely reengineered beast, with 3,500 ANSI lumens of brightness, 5,000:1 contrast ratio, liquid cooling, a built-in micro gimbal, and AI powered setup, plus the possibility of adding two wireless satellite speakers to give it true 4.2.2 surround sound, and mics for karaoke.

But to get the best from it you'll need to spend big, and with fierce competition from brands including XGIMI, Hisense, and BenQ, is it worth your money? I think so.

The Nebula X1 can project up to a 200-inch image from between 13 to 22 feet thanks to its optical zoom. The built-in gimbal (an industry first) tilts up to 25 degrees to help it align with your chosen surface, while keystone correction, focus (there's a 1.67x optical zoom), and ambient light are all tweaked automatically. This is all done via a single button on the remote control, making it one of the easiest projectors I've set up.

There's also AI Spatial Recall, which is a fancy way to describe the fact that the projector can remember where it is and how big you like the screen. This setting works well but isn't always 100 percent—it needs to be placed pretty close to the original position—but you can tweak screen angle and focus manually too.

I've not got the space for a 200-inch display, but I did witness it during a product preview in a cinema screening room. Yes, lighting and screen conditions were optimal, but I was still impressed by the detail and brightness created by the combination of 3,500 ANSI Lumen brightness, 4K (3840 × 2160) resolution and a cinema-grade 14-element all-glass lens.

Back home in the real world, I projected a 60-inch screen in my small living room (to a height of 50 inches and 52 inches from the wall), an 80-incher in my bedroom and 110-incher in the garden, and the results remained impressive. The extra brightness—for context, the $25,000 Sony VPL-XW7000ES has 3,200 ANSI Lumens—and contrast ratio means you can watch it inside, during the day, with the lights on. It's not as good as a great television; blacks are a little washed out, but the sharpness of the image and punched-up detail stands it apart from any portable I've ever tested.

It's also better than any other portable projector when the lights dim. I was seriously impressed by the level of detail, the color, contrast, and smoothness of motion. There is a little shading in the shadows, but that's to be expected, and forgiven, unless you're buying a pro-grade system. I ran the X1 side by side with the Nebula Cosmos and while the older model is still impressive, the X1 really does step things up.

Portable projectors are fun, and I'm happy to forgo a little color saturation for the enjoyment of a movie anywhere I like. But without exception, all the portable projectors I've tried in recent years have had bang-average audio. Handling action, music, and voice is difficult, but none can compete with dedicated surround-sound (or stereo) speakers or soundbar.

The X1 has four built-in speakers (40 watts total) and on its own it sounds better than I expected, especially at lower volumes. This is thanks to the new liquid cooling system that replaces the traditional fan. It's brilliantly effective and means you don't have to pump up the volume to mask the fan noise. Nebula estimate it lowers noise to just 26 decibels—most portable projectors are rated 30 to 35 decibels—which isn't a huge difference, but trust me, the noise it does make isn't nearly as distracting as a fan.

On its own the X1's audio is pretty good, but add a pair of dedicated battery powered satellite speakers with Wi-Fi, and the upgrade is phenomenal. The speakers are available separately for a whopping $999 (£499) with travel case and two wireless microphones for karaoke. You can also buy them as part of a bundle with the X1 for $3,298. Each speaker has up to eight hours of battery life and cute flip-out feet. Inside there's a pair of 40-watt front-facing drivers, a 20-watt upward-firing driver, and a 20-watt side-firing driver to add width and height to the audio.

Combined with the X1's four speakers, you've got 200 watts of lossless audio power through one cable, and with Dolby Audio support (although no Dolby Atmos) and 25 ms latency on screen there's no synching issues I could spot. Range for the speakers is up to 100 feet, but you'll want them closer for cinematic sound.

I missed the cinema release of the Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, but streaming it via Disney + in 4K Ultra HD, I was sucked right into 1960s Greenwich Village, and both concert, dialog, and studio audio were superb, with instrumentation, crowd noise, and FX impressively balanced. Even the bang-crash-wallop of Tom Hardy's dreadful Netflix caper Havoc sounded powerful and engaging.

For streaming, the Nebula X1 uses the Google TV platform with Netflix built in and Google Cast. If you want to connect to a Blu-ray player or gaming console there are two HDMI ports (one with eARC). There's also USB-A and USB-C options and a 3.5 millimeter headphone socket.

Back in my living room and with a karaoke YouTube channel loaded, the microphones in the speaker kit really came into their own, especially if you're a ten-year-old girl and her mother. Enthusiastic warbling aside, the quality was rock-solid, and battery life far too long!

It's worth remembering that while the retractable handle makes this projector “portable” it does weigh 13.7 pounds (6.2 kilograms) and requires a power outlet. If you want a true go-anywhere battery-powered design, like the excellent XGIMI Go+ ($699), you'll need to sacrifice brightness and audio power. I'm yet to be sold on backyard movies, but I live in a cold, overpopulated part of the world. If you have the space for a dedicated outdoor screen, and can punch up the volume without bothering the neighbors, you're in for a treat. Just make sure your Wi-Fi signal is strong enough.

The X1 also connects to the Nebula Connect smartphone app (iOS, Android). I was unable to use it due to early beta testing, but having connected and controlled four or five different projectors with it, I've no doubt it will work fine. If anything, it tends to be easier than the remote, although finding menus for manual control is a bit of a fiddle if you don't know where to look.

At $3,000, the X1 is currently the most expensive portable projector. It's comparable in price to a quality home cinema projector, but those often lack streaming capabilities or audio. Despite the wonderful image quality, AI smarts and streaming, I'm not sure it's worth the money on its own.

But add in the speakers and the microphones—the bundle is available for $3,427—and the proposition is entirely different. The impact the satellite speakers has on your enjoyment of a movie, combined with excellent image quality and whisper-quiet operation makes it an easy, albeit it expensive, product to recommend.

Don't hate me for saying this, but I'm hunting for the best pod coffee maker. Coffee is a weirdly divisive topic. People are particular about nearly every aspect, whether it's grounds, ground sizes, delivery method, sugar and cream and syrups … the list goes on and on. That divide grows even further when it comes to pod coffee makers. I'm no stranger to coffee snobbery, and I love a good pour-over or French press, a fancy burr grinder, and a silky-smooth cold foam … but sometimes I just want my coffee fast. And there's no shame in it! Below, you'll find the best pod coffee machines I've tried, including my top pick—the Bruvi BV-01 (8/10, WIRED Recommends).

Be sure to check out our many coffee-related buying guides, including the Best Coffee Makers, the Best Coffee Subscriptions, and the Best Gifts for Coffee Lovers.

Bruvi

Amazon

Bruvi

The Bruvi BV-01 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite coffee maker I've ever used. It looks cute on a kitchen counter. The proprietary B-Pods are unfortunately only sold online as of now, but they come in coffee, tea, and espresso varieties, and they're meant to biodegrade in a landfill, with ongoing tests showing 84 percent biodegradation over 534 days. The brewer automatically recognizes your chosen pod and will suggest brew settings for it, which you can adjust if you wish. It has a large, easy-to-use touchscreen with many size options, plus a hot water button, and the screen even shows a progress bar to keep you posted on your cup of joe. It can brew back-to-back cups in just over a minute each, and the 70-ounce reservoir is easy to refill. There's even a companion app that will let you schedule brews in advance.

The B-Pods are a little on the pricey side, and there are fewer varieties available compared to Keurig, but I think the trade-off for their lower environmental impact is worth it. They're also tasty, partially thanks to the 20-stream saturation that ensures even extraction. This maker also has a built-in waste bin that collects up to six used pods. The final detail I love is that the brewer has a little chime to let you know when your coffee is complete—music to my ears. There isn't much that I didn't like about this brewer—the drip tray can fill up quickly, and sometimes the handle clunks. But overall it looks nice, it does the job well, and it's easier on the only habitable planet we have.

Keurig

Keurig

Amazon

The Keurig K-Mini is cute and positively tiny. It was the first coffee maker I ever purchased for myself, years ago, and the new model I received for testing is just as adorable as my old one. It does a solid job at what it's meant to do: brewing exactly one cup of coffee. Rather than a large reservoir, this itty-bitty brewer has enough room in the tank for one K-Cup of coffee. The easiest way I found to use it is to fill up my chosen mug with water, and then just pour that into the single-serve tank before brewing. There are no bells or whistles or strength levels or fancy water temperature settings—just lift the handle, pop in a pod, and close it. Press the button to brew. I kept my K-Mini on my desk for a long time simply because it was easier to brew myself a cup of coffee that way than to deal with my stove, a filter, and the whole rigmarole of a pour-over.

This coffee maker isn't ideal for anyone who wants customizable options, scheduling, or fast back-to-back brewing. But if you just want a simple cup of coffee on demand, it'll do the trick.

Note that these go on sale on basically every shopping holiday, and you can often find them for as low as $50. Another thing I want to note is that, while my previous model held up fine for years, it did stop working around year four or five. That's not a guarantee that this model won't last a long time, and it's worth noting that I never tried to contact customer service to replace or fix it, but it is something I wanted to mention.

Keurig

Keurig

Amazon

The Keurig K-Brew + Chill can handle both hot and iced coffee. It has two tanks—a main water pitcher that it'll automatically pull from for hot coffee and as needed, and a chill tank that constantly runs to keep the water supply cold. The fan starts and stops on its own, and I didn't find the noise disruptive—it reminded me of a fridge running. It does have a quiet mode that significantly reduces the noise, but note that the water takes longer to get cold if you use that setting. I filled mine with cold tap water, and it took about an hour to get fully chilled, though Keurig says room temperature water takes about six hours. In any case, this machine is great if you prefer iced coffee. Keurig has had iced coffee pods on the market for a while, but usually they're brewed with less-hot water. You still have to add ice, and it isn't immediately chilled like what you get with this brewer. There are a few different buttons—you can choose between hot or cold, choose your coffee size, and choose to make it stronger.

I compared hot and cold coffees using the same K-Cups, and they were both equally strong. This brewer uses MultiStream technology, which basically means it saturates the grounds in the K-Cup evenly to ensure full flavor extraction. The machine can brew cold and hot cups back to back, but the cold brews will get less and less cold unless you give the tank time to cool down again. Indicator lights will let you know how charged the chill tank is. Cold brews came out at about 50 degrees Fahrenheit and rose up to around 65 degrees after five back-to-back brews.

This machine does have some quirks. One minor detail that irked me is that the chilled-water tank can only be filled from the back side of the brewer, which means depending on your kitchen cabinet configurations, you might have to pull it away from the wall to refill it easily. It's not the biggest deal in the world, but it is something to note. This brewer would take up a lot of room if you've got limited counter space. And it runs a rinse cycle after every cold brew, which takes about a minute and a half and is quite noisy. The rinsewater drains into the drip tray and it takes five cold brews to fill the tray up. The tray has a little floating indicator to let you know when it's time to dump it out.

This machine isn't going to be ideal for everyone, especially if you don't really love iced coffee. But if you like cold coffee that isn't diluted, it's definitely worth checking out.

Nespresso

Amazon

Nespresso

I was really annoyed when I realized that Nespresso sent me this brewer in black. Champagne problems, I know—but this brewer comes in so many delightful colors, from deep red and orange to pastel lavender and pink. It looks cute on your countertop with its little rounded figure and relatively short stature. The Vertuo Pop+ can handle all Vertuo coffee pods. The pods are aluminum and can be recycled by ordering free recycling bags or taking them to a drop-off location. To brew, simply open the machine by twisting the lock on the lid, choose a capsule, and press the button. You can physically move the adjustable drip tray between two ladder-like rungs on the front of the machine. There's also a companion app that gives you maintenance alerts, video walk-throughs, and easy pod reordering.

Closing and locking the machine, or pressing the coffee button while the machine is locked, will start a heating cycle that takes about 30 seconds. The machine automatically recognizes the capsule you insert, and it extracts brew size based on the capsule as well. For example, espresso capsules will brew 1.35 ounces, double espresso capsules brew 2.7 ounces, and coffee capsules brew 8 ounces. This is different from other machines where you select the capacity you want. In the app you can make minor tweaks, such as making espresso shots shorter or longer. You can press the coffee button to end brewing early (a very handy trick if you accidentally use a 6-ounce mug for an 8-ounce brew, which I may or may not have done.) The machine has a waste basket that'll automatically collect spent capsules. I'm not a huge fan of Nespresso's flavored coffee and espresso capsules, simply because I would rather make traditional coffee and then add any whimsical flavorings later to suit my tastes. But if you prefer your coffee with a side of caramel or gingerbread or almond or some other decadent altering, there are many flavored options for you.

With plain old coffee and espresso capsules, I found myself pleasantly surprised by the body and mouthfeel of the drinks. Technically, these espresso pods are not making espresso. But it's a darn close espresso-like beverage, and you can get it without needing an entire separate machine with a tamping weight and a portafilter and a pressure gauge. And the coffee is on par or slightly better than other machines I've tried, with a nice acidic bite that isn't too watered down. If convenience is what you seek, this do-it-all machine is worth a look.

I was sent the bundle that comes with an optional milk frother. I like having the option, but be aware that it will take up another wall outlet. But the Aeroccino was easy to use—pour in your milk of choice and press the button. It'll heat and froth your milk automatically—it takes about a minute and it's whisper-quiet. Every Nespresso capsule I've tried has featured a thick layer of crema, and having whipped, thick milk on top of it made my average cup of coffee a more elevated experience.

Ninja

Amazon

Ninja

This sleek-looking coffee maker is a good choice for people who want to be able to choose their coffee delivery method. You can use a K-Cup pod or supply your own grounds to brew a cup of joe. It also has a built-in, foldaway frother that lets you make specialty beverages like cappuccinos or lattes. (Note that the frother doesn't steam milk—it‘s more like a mini immersion whisk. The manual suggests microwaving milk before frothing if you want your foam to be warm.)

I was honestly amazed at how much Ninja managed to pack into this brewer, which is only slightly larger than the similarly priced Keurig K-Mini. It has so many bells and whistles for the price. The design is user-friendly, and it makes it easy to see how things are meant to fit together. The clever pieces are designed in such a way that it's obvious if you're doing something wrong.

A permanent brew basket is installed in the machine. There are two adapters—one for grounds and one for K-Cups. Whichever you aren't using stores cleverly in a little drawer, and the machine also comes with a marked scoop for measuring grounds that stores on a hook on the side of the machine. There's a display that lets you choose your coffee style—classic, rich, over ice, or specialty (which only brews in 4-ounce sizes). The machine beeps when you start a brew, and there's a progress bar and a series of beeps to let you know when your coffee is ready.

The only thing I didn't love was the drip tray. It brackets onto the front of the machine like a ladder. It wasn't unstable, and I could see it coming in handy to minimize splatter on shorter cups, but I didn't like running the risk of knocking over a hovering cup of hot coffee. I just kept mine firmly on the counter and was resigned to wiping up any erroneous splashes.

All in all though, this machine offers fantastic value for its low price, and it could be a better solution if you don't want to solely rely on K-Cups to get your coffee in your face.

Cumulus Coffee

Williams Sonoma

Cumulus Coffee

The Cumulus cold-brew machine (7/10, WIRED Review) promises something that seems impossible: instant and frothy nitro cold brew from a capsule. It's not just a chilled coffee pod, either: It's actual cold brew, made over the course of many hours using cold water and time, then vacuum-distilled and condensed down to fit in a wee capsule. Insert the capsule into a Cumulus Machine, and it'll unpack that super-dense concentrate using a powerful compressor. The result is a frigid 10-ounce glass of cold brew, a fabulously frothy nitro version made by pressure-injecting raw air into the coffee, or an intense and bracing cold espresso that dispenses beautifully into martini form.

The abundant nitro froth, and espresso crema in your martini, are absolutely the strongest selling points for this $700 home machine (each capsule makes enough coldspresso for two martinis, or a hefty double). But note that the capsules, which mostly amount to $2.50 a pop, don't quite have the character of cold brew: There's a little tang, something a little sharp. But a luxury “Wush Wush” Ethiopia, which costs a whopping $6 a capsule, shows what's possible for the machine. The resulting cold brew was a legit achievement: full-bodied, smooth, and wildly aromatic. —Matthew Korfhage

Xbloom

Amazon

xBloom

The xBloom (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is like a coffee pod machine that went to college and got a fancy degree. This Swiss army knife of a machine contains a built-in conical burr grinder and scale, offers the option for minutely programmable pour-over coffee, and even has a new option for brewing tea. But if you want no effort? The xBloom is also maybe the only pod coffee machine on the market that'll make coffee fit for the snobbiest of coffee snobs. Order roast-to-order xPods ($1 to $3 a pod, depending) by mail order or subscription, and you'll get single-serve pods filled with fresh beans from the hypeiest third-wave roasters in coffee, whether Bean & Bean, Onyx, or Black & White.

Your compostable pods will arrive with an RFID recipe card, preprogrammed and theoretically optimized to each bean. Just swipe the card, dump the fresh beans into the grinder, then push the button. Chances are, you'll receive some wildly interesting coffee, after about three minutes of robot grind and robot pour-over. Results will vary depending on how well the roaster programs the machine, but I've gotten some seriously good cups from this machine. —Matthew Korfhage

iLola Duo for $270: I think the iLola Duo is a very smart idea. It can brew Nespresso or Keurig pods, plus iLola Tea Discs, which are compressed loose-leaf tea cakes bound with cellulose for easy measurement and disposal. Unfortunately, the machine isn't very intuitive to use, and it brews too cold—around 170 degrees Fahrenheit—to fully extract the flavors from some kinds of tea, such as black tea, which should be brewed at around 212 degrees Fahrenheit. This means some of the tea blends are tasty, and some of them are just too weak and flavorless for my liking. The machine is also louder and less intuitive than others I've tried. If you're a major tea enthusiast or you truly want a multipurpose machine, it could still be worth looking into.

Pod coffee makers have a few different components that need occasional care. The needle is the part that punctures the pod lid inside the machine, and it can sometimes get clogged or dirty. Most machines come with a needle cleaning tool, though you might be able to use a paperclip to achieve the same effect. Simply clean the needle from time to time and it shouldn't be an issue.

Mineral deposits can build up in pod coffee makers, just like any other coffee maker. You can descale them using descaling solution or vinegar. Bruvi and Keurig both sell descaling solutions, and Keurig has rinse pods that are specifically designed to help clean out all those internal bits and pieces.

How We Tested and What's Up Next

I tested these machines by making (and drinking) a lot of coffee. I've never been more caffeinated! I tested each feature and a few different coffee pod styles in each machine. I checked for ease of cleaning, the variety of pods available, the strength and tastiness of the coffee, how loud each machine was, and how much space it took up on my precious kitchen counters. Next up I'll be testing machines from L'Or, Cuisinart, and Beautiful by Drew Barrymore.

To Pod or Not to Pod

The debate over pods has lots of valid points.

Environmental impact: This is the most important. Coffee pods are often not recyclable (though our top pick does have biodegradable pods), so it can be a lot of single-use plastic that gets chucked straight in the trash. However, coffee pods might not be as bad for the environment as you think compared to traditional coffee-making methods. Some machines have an option for reusable pods, which you fill with your own grounds. That's one way to lessen the environmental impact while still getting the convenience of a pod coffee maker. We've included information on pod recycling for each of the machines in this guide.

Cost: Coffee pods are pricier than supplying your own grounds. They can range anywhere from 30 cents up to even $6 (in the case of the Cumulus). The initial machine investment may be cheaper—a pod coffee maker is going to be cheaper than an espresso machine, for example, but more expensive than an Aeropress—and you can sometimes find sales or get a coffee pod subscription to make things a bit more affordable. But it is a factor worth considering.

Coffee quality: Coffee pods aren't as fresh as grinding your own beans, which can make coffee taste stale or flavorless. But most machines have a “Strong” setting that makes the coffee taste better, and there are a lot of varieties on the market, which means you'll probably find at least one that you like. And as a counterpoint, while it's perfectly fine to want artisanal beans and the perfect hot water temperature, plenty of us would be OK with drinking Folgers forever. And I think that latter group of people is the group that wouldn't mind pod coffee over something a bit more involved.

Coffee amount: One reason I found myself drawn to pod coffee in the first place is that I wanted drip coffee without dealing with a pour-over, and I was living alone. Pod coffee was an easier way to make a single cup in a hurry.

Brewing: Some people like the methodical, ritualistic aspect of brewing coffee. And that's fair! Some of my fondest memories are of making a pour-over around the campfire or canoodling with lovers while waiting for the kettle to heat. But not every morning is a lazy Sunday or taking place in a campground in the Ozarks, which is why I think pod makers make sense as one source of caffeine delivery. Sometimes I need my caffeine and I need it now, kettle be damned.

This story originally appeared Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

For the last two decades, homeowners have been able to claim thousands of dollars in federal tax credits to help offset the high up-front costs of going solar. Things were supposed to stay that way through 2034. But, this week, the US House of Representatives proposed abruptly ending the incentives at the end of the year. If this idea survives the House and passes the Senate, it could upend the economic calculus of powering your home with sunlight

“It would put solar out of reach for millions of people,” said Glen Brand, director of policy and advocacy at Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that encourages adoption of the technology. “What the House has done is to put ordinary Americans in a really hard place. They are basically saying they aren't going to help people with rising energy costs.”

The country's first solar tax credits took effect in 1978, but were allowed to lapse in 1985, when President Ronald Regan was in office. In 2005, however, another Republican—President George W. Bush—revived them. Lawmakers have extended and tweaked the incentives ever since, most recently with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which set the credit at 30 percent of the cost of a system until 2032, before a two-year phase out.

The average cost of a solar system in the US right now is just north of $28,000, according to Zoë Gaston, a principal analyst for residential solar at the energy consultant Wood MacKenzie. That means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500.

On Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Committee released an initial budget reconciliation proposal that would roll back large swaths of the IRA, including support for residential solar. The so-called 25D tax credit would still apply for systems that are installed this year, and then it would go away completely.

Without the tax credits, solar systems might still make financial sense in places that get a lot of sun or have high electricity prices, or both, but the payback period will likely grow. For other people, the math may no longer work at all.

“We would expect sales and installation to surge this year, followed by a market contraction,” said Gaston. “If a homeowner is thinking about solar and can afford it, now would be the time.”

The 25D credit isn't the only relevant tax break under threat. Another credit, 48E, is available to businesses that install solar on homes where the resident then either leases the equipment or enters into a power purchase agreement. This allows companies to reduce what they charge customers. According to Gaston, more than half of residential installations now follow this third-party ownership model.

Instead of eliminating 48E, the House favors applying limits on where the material in photovoltaic panels comes from. While experts are still sorting out exactly what the proposed language means, it generally aims to bar participation of “foreign entities of concern”—including those in China, where the vast majority of solar components are made.

“It puts the obligation on the installer or the developer to trace back the supply chain in a way that's completely impossible,” said Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. This, he said, could effectively make the 48E credit effectively impossible to access starting in 2026.

The current House language could at least temporarily push folks toward the third-party ownership options, said Gaston. But when Wood MacKenzie did an analysis, before the House draft, that assumed a phase-out of credits by 2028, it still projected a 30 percent drop in installed residential capacity by the end of the decade.

“It's going to be devastating for companies, their employees, and their customers,” said Gallagher. “It'll kill an industry that supports hundreds of thousands of workers and tens of billions of dollars in investment every year.”

The House move isn't the only headwind the solar industry is facing. Some states, most notably California, for example, have lowered the amount that homeowners can earn by selling power to the grid, making solar less lucrative. Even before Republicans took control of Congress and the White House, companies were starting to let employees go. More layoffs have ensued.

Some Republicans have acknowledged the role that energy tax credits play in the economy, and their districts. Twenty-one House members of the party signed a letter to Ways and Means chairman Jason Smith expressing concern about “disruptive changes to our nation's energy tax structure.” Four Republican senators also wrote to majority leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, urging “a targeted, pragmatic approach” to any changes.

“This is going to turn on what the Senate does,” said Brand, about the future of the solar credits. He believes it's unlikely that the House proposal will become law in its current form and is optimistic that the rollbacks will be rectified. “This is a piece the Senate can get right.”

But the harm to the solar industry is already being done, said Jacquelyn Pless, a professor who researches energy and environmental economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management. The constant back-and-forth over policy, she said, makes it extremely difficult for companies to plan ahead.

“Policy volatility is really my bigger concern,” Pless said. “Policy uncertainty alone can start to freeze investment, raise costs, and damage market confidence.”

Naukri.com, a popular Indian employment website, has fixed a bug that exposed the email addresses of recruiters using its platform to search and hire talent online.

The issue, discovered by security researcher Lohith Gowda, affected the API that Naukri used on its Android and iOS apps. The API exposed the email addresses of recruiters visiting profiles of potential candidates on Naukri's platform. The issue did not appear to affect the company's website.

“The exposed recruiter email IDs can be used for targeted phishing attacks, and recruiters may receive excessive unsolicited emails and spam,” Gowda told TechCrunch.

He added that exposed email IDs could be added to public breach databases or spam lists, and mass email address scraping could lead to automated bot abuse or scams.

TechCrunch verified the exposure after the researcher shared details about the bug. The researcher confirmed to TechCrunch that the issue was fixed earlier this week, which Naukri corroborated on Friday.

“All identified enhancements are implemented, ensuring our systems remain updated and resilient,” Alok Vij, IT infrastructure head at Naukri's parent company InfoEdge, told TechCrunch over email. “Our teams have not detected any usual activity that affects the integrity of user data.”

Founded in March 1997, Naukri.com is India's top classified recruitment website, helping connect recruiters, employers, and job seekers. Apart from India, the site exists in the Middle East as Naukrigulf.com.

“Certain features of our recruiter profiles are designed to be public to enable users to know who has access to their profile(s). We conduct regular audits and security assessments,” said Vij.

I'll make an example that makes this concept crystal crisp, and that you will likely remember for the rest of your life (no kidding). In Italy there was a great writer called Giuseppe Pontiggia. He had to write an article for one of the main newspapers in Italy about the Nobel Prize in Literature, that with the surprise of many, was never assigned, year after year, to Borges. He wrote (sorry, translating from memory, I'm not an English speaker and I'm not going to use an LLM for this comment):""Two are the prizes that each year the Swedish academy assigns: one is assigned to the winner of the prize, the other is not assigned to Borges"".This uncovers much more than just: even this year the prize was not assigned to Borges. And, honestly, I never saw this kind of style heights in PG writings (I appreciate the content most of the times, but having translated a few of his writings in Italian, I find the style of PG fragile: brings the point at home but never escapes simple constructs). You don't reach that kind of Pontiggia style with the process in the article here, but via a very different process that only the best writers are able to perform and access.

It's about the process, not the talent. When you've carefully thought through and refined an idea to understand whether it makes sense yourself, that usually provides a lot of guidance on how you can express the idea eloquently to others. You know the questions they'll have and the answers they'll find satisfying, because you already went through the same process. When you're just tossing out your first half-baked impression, it's a lot harder to communicate it well, although some people do have the orthogonal talent of making it up on the fly.

Something I've mentioned before is I can't get over the fact that Paul has mulitiple people review his essays prior to publishing (which others have defended when I've made the same comment before).I (as most people do) write clients every day with proposals or results or reports. Nobody reviews my writing first and the end recipients they either like what I say and pay me money and refer others to me or they don't.  I certainly don't have the time to perseverate over the perfect phrase or paragraph '50 or 100 times' but yet I get results more often than I don't.

What people fail to understand is that immigrants add to both the supply and demand side. An immigrant sitting in a stadium seat is taking a place that could have gone to someone else. But their presence also drives the capacity to build more seats. More demand for higher education results in more capacity for higher education.

It might be that it's hard to create sophistry accidentally in one's writing, but it's certainly a possible - and common - trick.The danger is when you convince yourself that what you're writing isn't sophistry… because - after all - it looks good.

There are objective features of writing, but quality is subjective.Of course, as to the thesis of the essay, it is both trivial and uninteresting that people,  including PG, tend to have views of the correctness of an idea and the quality of the presentation that are correlated.It is interesting that PG thinks that this is anything more than a cognitive bias to be cautious about, though.

Because I think LLMs provide a clear counterexample to his thesis. They are quite good at the craft of writing--not perfect, but probably much better than the median human--and they are just as good when the content is true as when it's false. This quality ruins a lot of my heuristics for evaluating whether writing is trustworthy, because LLMs are so good at bullshitting.So while I agree that for humans, writing that sounds good tends to also be logically correct, that clearly isn't inherent in all writing.

Emails, etc, are just 'communication but over  text' - it's 'writing' in the very basic sense but it's not the sort of writing people concerned with style and quality care about, either as consumers or producers.

A shorter exposition is nearly always (a) better, and (b) more work. I'm reminded of Mark Twain's remark, “I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.”A classic writing book, now nearly forgotten -- ""Strunk & White""/""The Elements of Style"" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style) -- famously exhorts authors to ""Make every word count.""An underlying cause is that people don't read enough, before presuming to write. This results in malaprops like ""reign him in"", an example I see almost daily now. (A monarch reigns over a kingdom, a cowboy reins in a horse.) Examples abound, this is a common one.Even worse, I now see automatic grammar checkers making ungrammatical ""corrections"" (incorrections?) like replacing ""its"" with ""it's,"" or the reverse, but in the wrong circumstances.But my all-time greatest annoyance are constructions like ""Similar effect to ..."", which in nearly all cases ought to be ""Effect similar to ..."" with copious variations, all wrong. Online searches discover that, in many such cases, the wrong form prevails over the right one.Someone may object that language is an art form without fixed rules, that seems right.

I wouldn't phrase it exactly this way, but this is an important point that I really struggle to get across. I regularly see proposals and such that are very challenging to reason about because of their writing. But when I ask for terms to be more rigorously defined, or for the document to be reordered into a more principled structure, some people seem to have a strong instinct that I'm just being difficult for the sake of it. I still remember one guy who insisted that I need to make a specific technical criticism or sign off, and absolutely refused to accept the answer that my structural feedback was intended to help us reason about the technical details.

Is there something wrong with my grammar here, or other issue with language or readability that would betray the presence of a reasoning error?Any wrong thing can be said using decent language with good spelling and grammar, which can be edited for brevity, diction, avoidance of hackneyed cliches and so on.It's like saying that nicely indented code, conforming to various best practices, rarely hides a bug.If you flip a sign in a 2x2 rotation matrix, it's wrong, but it looks even better:  [ cos -sin ]  -> remove ugly lint -> [ cos sin ]
  [ sin  cos ]                         [ sin cos ]

A correct negative sentence containing ""not"" can be shortened by removing the negation, and thereby made incorrect in the same stroke.For instance, imagine that ""P is not NP"" has been proved. Then ""P is NP"" would be shorter sentence, which is wrong.

That being said, this is pretty intellectually absent by the standards of a PG essay. ""Writing good is hard"" says man who has made his living off issuing advice that other people unconditionally obey. It feels less like a piece of solid writing advice and more like a selfish way to cover his ass now that the auspices of tech startups are shifting towards fascism.

Anker has long been a trusted name for laptop and smartphone chargers. But the company's technological capabilities extend far beyond such everyday essentials: It also produces powerful portable power stations to meet the needs of users looking for robust sources of power on the go or as reliable home standbys.

One such gem product in this category is the Anker Solix C1000 portable power station which is a high-end generator that is currently available on Amazon for an all-time low price of $448, reduced from its listed price of $799. We do really love this power station, and it's a really safe choice.

See at Amazon

Thanks to its UltraFast charging technology, it gets 80% battery capacity in just 43 minutes and is charged fully in less than an hour using an AC input. This rapid recharge functionality makes the power station ready when you want it whether it's for an unexpected loss of power or a prior-to-activity charge before venturing out on an outdoor adventure.

The greatest thing about the Solix C1000 is its battery technology: It features a LiFePO4 battery which is renowned for its long lifespan and safety. The battery is capable of lasting through up to 3,000 charge cycles across a span of 10 years which offers a decade of stable power. This longevity makes the Solix C1000 a wise investment if you're looking for an extended solution for home backup or repeated use outdoors.

With Anker's SurgePad technology, it boasts a maximum rated power of 1800W (and a peak output of 2400W) which is sufficient to charge 99% of home appliances and electronics. The station features 11 different ports for great compatibility whether you're running essential home equipment during an outage, powering tools at a job site or charging multiple devices while camping. Its compact design (15% smaller than comparable 1kWh units) makes it easier to transport without sacrificing power capacity.

With more than 2,000 units sold in the previous month alone and a great 4.5-star rating from nearly one thousand reviews, Anker SOlix C1000 power station has firmly cemented itself as a robust and reliable power solution. Its current 44% discount on Amazon only makes it the complete value for money if you're looking to invest in a premium and durable portable power station.

Reuters reports that Elon Musk's annoying chatbot, Grok, is now being used by the U.S. government. While the extent and nature of that usage is unclear, sources interviewed by the news outlet have expressed alarm at the implications of the chatbot's access to government data.

Grok was launched by xAI, an AI company founded by Musk in 2023,  and has since become integrated into Musk's social media platform, X. The chatbot is known to summarize information in the most cringe-inducing manner possible, and was originally fashioned as an “anti-woke” antidote to ChatGPT and other more politically correct applications (though it's turned out to be too woke for conservatives anyway).

Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team is now using a customized version of Grok, with the apparent goal of sorting and analyzing tranches of data. The team may also be using the chatbot to prepare reports, sources told the outlet.

Aside from the very obvious data privacy concerns raised by Grok's integration with government data, it appears that, once again, Musk is at the center of a conflict-of-interest violation. In fact, Reuters characterizes the promotion of Grok as a potentially criminal transgression of federal regulations. The outlet writes:

If Musk was directly involved in decisions to use Grok, it could violate a criminal conflict-of-interest statute which bars officials — including special government employees — from participating in matters that could benefit them financially, said Richard Painter, ethics counsel to former Republican President George W. Bush and a University of Minnesota professor. “This gives the appearance that DOGE is pressuring agencies to use software to enrich Musk and xAI, and not to the benefit of the American people,” said Painter. The statute is rarely prosecuted but can result in fines or jail time.

Yes, but how many times have we heard that one before? Elon has conflicts of interest up the wazoo. He is a walking conflict of interest, at this point. To my knowledge, he's never seen the interior of a courtroom and, unless he gets caught with a dead body or something, it seems doubtful he ever will.

Ever since Musk helped Trump get re-elected with hundreds of millions from his own piggybank, he's has been treating the U.S. government like his personal plaything to destroy. Everywhere you look, the billionaire appears to be benefiting from his work with the government, whether it's the White House bullying tariffed countries to adopt services from the billionaire's satellite internet company, Starlink, or a new report that shows the billionaire's companies may have saved nearly $2.37 billion from federal fines and penalties that were active under Biden but have since been “neutralized” in the Trump era.

As far as DOGE's mandate goes, the organization has been an unmitigated failure. It has barely saved a fraction of the money that Musk initially claimed that it would and, in the long term, the cuts are likely to cost Americans money, since many of them have been to important agencies that dispense key services to Americans.

Birds continue to be amazing. Crows can use tools and hold grudges against specific people. Magpies can recognize themselves in mirrors. And now, hawks are using traffic signals to hunt down prey, according to a study published today in the journal Frontiers in Ethology. 

The story starts with Vladimir Dinets, a zoologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and the study's author, and an intersection in West Orange, New Jersey, near his home. As a zoologist, he had long been interested in animals' perspective on and understanding of urban environments—and in birds' relationship with cars, in particular. Scientists have previously observed ravens patrol American highways waiting for roadkill and songbirds using cars to hide from predators.

Dinets was on the lookout for these interesting interactions when a young Cooper's hawk migrated into his neighborhood and started doing something brilliant.

The intersection wasn't particularly busy, even during rush hour, Dinets wrote in a guest editorial for Frontiers in Ethology. But sometimes, a pedestrian would cross the street, causing cars to pile up all the way to a small, bushy tree down the block. The pedestrian “walk” signal would also make a sound that indicated it was time to walk.

One morning, Dinets saw the hawk emerge from the tree, fly very low above the line of cars, cross the street between the cars, and then dive to get something near one of the houses.

Then the same thing happened again. And again.

It turns out that the family that lived in that house near the bushy tree liked to have dinner in their front yard. In response, birds—like sparrows and doves—would flock there to claim the leftover crumbs.

That made for easy pickings for the hawk, who would swoop down into the yard to catch said sparrows and doves. But, curiously, the hawk only did this when cars were lined up along the block all the way to the tree.

Dinets eventually figured out that the line of cars provided cover for the hawk, and that the hawk had learned to recognize the sound of the pedestrian “walk” signal. As soon as a pedestrian pressed the button, the hawk would fly from wherever it had been hanging out and into the small, bushy tree. It would then wait for cars to pile up before using the line of cars as cover to sneak up on its prey.

The hawk had, apparently, learned to use the pedestrian signal as a cue to start heading over to the house crowded with defenseless birds, according to Dinets.

“That meant that the hawk understood the connection between the sound and the eventual car queue length,” Dinets explained. The hawk also apparently had a good mental map of the neighborhood.

The hawk (or what Dinets thinks was the same hawk) returned the next year and used the same strategy to hunt. Eventually, though, the family moved away and the signal stopped working, so Dinets hasn't seen any super smart hawks hunting near his home since.

Life is tough for birds in cities—they have to avoid windows, weave through cars, and deal with noise. But this study shows at least one way that they've adapted to urban living.

“I think my observations show that Cooper's hawks manage to survive and thrive there, at least in part, by being very smart,” Dinets wrote.

New weekend, new F1 race. If you're a fan, you're looking for a free channel that streams the Formula 1 Monaco GP. Rightfully so — overpriced subscriptions aren't ideal if you want to save money and keep up with F1 races simultaneously.

The good news is that you can watch the Monaco Grand Prix online for free with a bit of effort. There's a handy free channel that broadcasts it in Full HD. This guide will explain how to access it worldwide and stream the event.

We won't keep you waiting. The channel you're looking for is called SRF.

SRF is a Swiss-based TV channel known for broadcasting a vibrant palette of sports events. It's also a place where you can watch MotoGP races for free. This weekend, it'll broadcast the F1 Monaco GP live, as well.

Since it's a Swiss TV channel, it has a few issues. For example, it's accessible only in Switzerland and doesn't come with English commentary. On the other hand, it's accessible without an account, so that's great.

As you can see above, the free live stream of the F1 Monaco GP will be on SRF Zwei (link: https://www.srf.ch/play/tv/live/srf-zwei?tvLiveId=c49c1d64-9f60-0001-1c36-43c288c01a10). This is the GP race, however, SRF also displays the qualifying if you're interested.

Stream the Monaco GP for free with NordVPN

Okay, so SRF is exclusive to Switzerland — is there a workaround?

Yes. Swiss residents abroad often swap their IP addresses for Swiss ones. With a Swiss IP, SRF detects that the user is located in Switzerland. This results in effortless access regardless of the user's actual location.

According to F1 fans worldwide, NordVPN fits the bill. It's a famous VPN service with thousands of global servers, many of which are in Switzerland. Moreover, the VPN supplies applications for all devices.

This eases the process of watching the F1 Monaco GP on a free channel, or any other Grand Prix for that matter. The user can install NordVPN, connect to a server in Switzerland, and use SRF even in Europe, the USA, Asia, etc.

NordVPN is a paid VPN, but that's no issue.

It comes with a non-conditional 30-day money-back guarantee to set things straight. This is, in a way, a NordVPN free trial that you can use it for this purpose, cancel it, and obtain a refund if you don't need it anymore.

The same principle applies to unblocking other restricted content. With unlimited bandwidth and market-leading speeds, users have reported nothing but pure enjoyment in streaming, gaming, and other online activities.

Yes, it'll be on F1 TV Pro as well, but as you likely know, it's a subscription service. This means it's a paid channel, too, and unfortunately, it does cost a lot. F1 TV Pro is also unavailable in some countries — keep that in mind.

Generally speaking, all subscription services, especially those sports-related, tend to be pricey. While SRF's lack of English commentary is evident, it's still the best option to watch the Monaco Grand Prix online for free.

Not sure when to tune in? Don't think we've forgotten to include a full schedule for your convenience. The event kicks off on May 23rd and ends on May 25th. As always, the race will be on Sunday.

Try NordVPN risk-free now

If that's your only goal, tune in on the 25th of May and feast your eyes. If you'd rather sit through the entire event and live the hype, here's how this weekend will transpire:

The life science group Sartorius launches the new Octet® R8e biolayer interferometry (BLI) system, providing researchers with its most advanced detection capabilities to date for real-time, high-throughput analysis of protein-protein, protein-small molecule, and other biomolecular interactions. Expanding the industry-leading fluidic-free Octet® BLI portfolio, the R8e is designed for applications requiring higher sensitivity, flexible assay design, and longer run times.

Image Credit: Sartorius

Leveraging Sartorius' proprietary BLI technology for fast, real-time, and label-free kinetic characterization of binding interactions, the Octet® R8e provides next-level sensitivity for accurate data generation at the lowest detection limits, expanding analyte range to low-molecular weight (> 100 Da) and low-abundance (>10 pM) analytes. Compatibility with 96- and 384-well plate formats offer additional flexibility in assay design, allowing customization to each study's unique scale, complexity, and cost requirements.

Octet® R8e is our most advanced BLI system yet, designed to future-proof research by enhancing the role of BLI in discovery and development. It delivers the performance and reliability that today's scientists require to address new targets, emerging modalities, and increasingly complex programs,""

Nilshad Salim, Product Manager of Octet® Systems, Sartorius

""The combination of high sensitivity and the ability to reduce sample size to 40 μL with our custom 384-well microplates gives researchers maximum freedom and significant cost efficiencies, without sacrificing data quality.""

Sample integrity is a common challenge in BLI assays when long-term kinetic measurements are required to observe slow binding interactions or dissociations. A new evaporation cover created for the Octet® R8e system minimizes sample evaporation from 96-well microplates, maintaining sample concentrations for up to 16 hours. This ensures accuracy over extended assay durations, allowing for greater data collection capabilities without manual intervention.

""The advanced evaporation protection is a game changer, supported by data showing excellent reproducibility between replicates over 16-hour experiments. It is equally valuable for shorter runs, where minimizing data variations is critical,"" adds Salim. ""Together with its best-in-class performance, the R8e provides scientists with a powerful and streamlined alternative to SPR-based platforms, backed by a brand trusted worldwide as the genuine BLI technology.""

Octet® BLI systems have a large global install-base in regulated environments across pharma, biotech, and CRO organizations, with successful use in numerous investigational new drug applications. Empowering scientists with quality data, flexibility, and a user-friendly design, the Octet® R8e system is designed to accelerate biopharmaceutical research at every stage—from drug discovery to development, bioprocessing, and quality control—while equipping labs for future applications.

Israel's intensified military operations continue to threaten an already weakened health system, amidst worsening mass population displacement and acute shortages of food, water, medical supplies, fuel and shelter.

Four major hospitals in Gaza (Kamal Adwan Hospital, Indonesia Hospital, Hamad Hospital for Rehabilitation and Prosthetics, and European Gaza Hospital) have had to suspend medical services in the past week due to their proximity to hostilities or evacuation zones, and attacks. WHO has recorded 28 attacks on health care in Gaza during this period and 697 attacks since October 2023.

Only 19 of Gaza Strip's 36 hospitals remain operational, including one hospital providing basic care for the remaining patients still inside the hospital, and are struggling under severe supply shortages, lack of health workers, persistent insecurity, and a surge of casualties, all while staff work in impossible conditions. Of the 19 hospitals, 12 provide a variety of health services, while the rest are only able to provide basic emergency care. At least 94% of all hospitals in the Gaza Strip are damaged or destroyed.

The increased hostilities and new evacuation orders issued across northern and southern Gaza in the past two days threaten to push even more health facilities out of service. This includes 1 hospital, 11 primary care centres, and 13 medical points within the evacuation zones, and an additional 5 hospitals, 1 field hospital, 9 primary care centres, and 23 medical points within 1000 metres of those zones.

North Gaza has been stripped of nearly all health care. Al-Awda Hospital is only minimally functional, serving as a trauma stabilization point. It faces an imminent risk of closure due to ongoing insecurity and restricted access. The hospital's third floor was reportedly attacked on Wednesday, injuring a staff member. Hostilities in the area also damaged the water tank and pipeline. Today, the hospital was attacked again. The third and fourth floors were reportedly hit, injuring two health workers. Patient triage tents, including one provided by WHO, caught fire, which also burned all medical supplies in the warehouse and destroyed vehicles in the basement. A WHO mission attempting to reach the hospital today was impeded.

The Indonesian Hospital is out of service due to continued military presence since 18 May, making it inaccessible. Yesterday, a WHO mission to the hospital was forced to abort due to the security situation after waiting nearly four hours for clearance to proceed. WHO team had planned to deliver food and water to patients, assess their conditions, and identify critical equipment for transfer. WHO tried to reach the hospital again today, but the mission was impeded.

Kamal Adwan Hospital, which had the only centre to treat patients with severe acute malnutrition in North Gaza, went out of service on 20 May after intense hostilities in its vicinity, forcing patients to evacuate or be discharged prematurely.

In southern Gaza, Nasser Medical Complex, Al-Amal, and Al-Aqsa hospitals are overwhelmed by a surge of injured people, worsened by a new wave of displacement to Deir al Balah and Khan Younis. The European Gaza Hospital remains out of service following an attack on 13 May, cutting off vital services including neurosurgery, cardiac care, and cancer treatment – all unavailable elsewhere in Gaza.

Currently, across the Gaza Strip, only 2000 hospital beds remain available, for a population of over 2 million people, grossly insufficient to meet the current needs. Of these, at least 40 beds are at risk of being lost as they are in hospitals within newly declared evacuation zones, while an additional 850 could be lost if conditions deteriorate at facilities near these zones.

Continued hostilities and military presence inhibit patients from accessing care, obstruct staff from providing care, and prevent WHO and partners from resupplying hospitals.

With each hospital forced out of service, patients lose access to health care, and WHO and partners' efforts, to sustain Gaza's health system are undone. The destruction is systematic. Hospitals are rehabilitated and resupplied, only to be exposed to hostilities or attacked again. This destructive cycle must end.

Amid constant fear and insecurity, health workers, including those from national and international emergency medical teams, continue delivering urgent care in Gaza. WHO salutes their courage and commitment.

WHO calls for the active protection of health care. Hospitals must never be militarized or targeted.

WHO calls for aid at scale to be allowed into Gaza through all possible routes, and for unimpeded humanitarian access to reach people wherever they are. Echoing the United Nations' Relief Chief, WHO reiterates that the UN and its partners have a clear, principled and effective plan to deliver aid with safeguards against diversion, a system that has worked and must be enabled to continue.

WHO calls for an immediate and lasting ceasefire.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study: Millions still lack access to basic eye care worldwide","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250523/Study-Millions-still-lack-access-to-basic-eye-care-worldwide.aspx","Sat, 24 May 2025 03:59:00 GMT","

Millions of people across the world still lack access to basic eye care such as glasses according to a new study led by Professor Rupert Bourne of Anglia Ruskin University (ARU).

The research, published in The Lancet Global Health, measured the global availability and quality of treatment for uncorrected refractive error, one of the most common forms of vision loss.

The study used data from 815,273 participants from 76 countries and found that global refractive correction (eREC) is currently at 65.8%, just six percentage points higher than in 2010.

The researchers say the results mean the World Health Organization (WHO)'s target, set in 2021, of a 40 percentage point increase in eREC by 2030 is likely to be missed unless urgent action is taken across the world to increase the access to basic treatments such as spectacles.

The results are grouped into 'super regions': north Africa and the Middle East; Sub-Saharan Africa; Latin America and the Caribbean; south Asia; southeast Asia, east Asia and Oceania; central Europe, eastern Europe and central Asia; and high income (areas of north America and western Europe, which includes the UK).

The burden of uncorrected vision loss falls more heavily on low-income countries, women, and older adults. In the high income region, eREC is at 85% for men and 83% for women, while in sub-Saharan Africa the figure is around 30% for men and 27% for women. The WHO targets are set at country level, with high income countries such as the UK expected to strive for 100% eREC by 2030.

The data shows some encouraging trends. Between 2000 and 2023, there was a 50% improvement in the number of people receiving the correct prescription for eyeglasses. However, the authors note that the need for glasses has also increased, largely driven by lifestyle-related risk factors, for example increased screen time and reduced outdoor activities during childhood.

The research cites examples of action that individual countries have already taken and could be adopted by others. In France, full reimbursement of the cost of spectacles was introduced as part of universal health insurance in 2021/22. Pakistan has implemented a series of national eye-care plans over the past 20 years that have increased spectacle use and reduced vision impairment caused by uncorrected refractive error.

Rupert Bourne, Professor of Ophthalmology at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, England, is Principal Investigator for the Vision Loss Expert Group, a global network of health researchers that carried out the study.

Correction of refractive error is the safest, most efficient, and most economical intervention to improve daily vision quality for the majority of individuals affected by vision impairment worldwide, contributing to reducing poverty and improvements in wellbeing, work productivity, education, and equity.

Data from 815,000 people across 76 countries in our new study shows that we are off track to meet World Health Organisation targets. Urgent global action is needed to reach the goal of a 40% increase in eyeglasses coverage by 2030.""

Julie Rovner KFF Health News  @jrovner  @julierovner.bsky.social

Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent and host of KFF Health News' weekly health policy news podcast, ""What the Health?"" A noted expert on health policy issues, Julie is the author of the critically praised reference book ""Health Care Politics and Policy A to Z,"" now in its third edition.

With only a single vote to spare, the House passed a controversial budget bill that includes billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy, along with billions of dollars of cuts to Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, and the food stamp program — most of which will affect those at the lower end of the income scale. But the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate.

Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. released a report from his commission to ""Make America Healthy Again"" that described threats to the health of the American public — but notably included nothing on threats from tobacco, gun violence, or a lack of health insurance.

This week's panelists are Julie Rovner of KFF Health News, Anna Edney of Bloomberg News, Sarah Karlin-Smith of the Pink Sheet, and Alice Miranda Ollstein of Politico.

Among the takeaways from this week's episode:

Also this week, Rovner interviews University of California-Davis School of Law professor and abortion historian Mary Ziegler about her new book on the past and future of the ""personhood"" movement aimed at granting legal rights to fetuses and embryos.

Plus, for ""extra credit,"" the panelists suggest health policy stories they read this week they think you should read, too:

Julie Rovner: The Washington Post's ""White House Officials Wanted To Put Federal Workers 'in Trauma.' It's Working,"" by William Wan and Hannah Natanson.

Alice Miranda Ollstein: NPR's ""Diseases Are Spreading. The CDC Isn't Warning the Public Like It Was Months Ago,"" by Chiara Eisner.

Anna Edney: Bloomberg News' ""The Potential Cancer, Health Risks Lurking in One Popular OTC Drug,"" by Anna Edney.

Sarah Karlin-Smith: The Farmingdale Observer's ""Scientists Have Been Studying Remote Work for Four Years and Have Reached a Very Clear Conclusion: 'Working From Home Makes Us Happier,'"" by Bob Rubila.

Also mentioned in this week's podcast:

This article was reprinted from khn.org, a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF - the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

A case in which a sperm donor was later found to be carrying a cancer-causing pathogenic variant in his gametes has highlighted the problems of regulating gamete donation at European and international level, the annual conference of the European Society of Human Genetics will hear today (Saturday). Dr Edwige Kasper, a specialist in genetic predisposition to cancer at the Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France, will say that the lack of cross-border regulation in Europe can result in the multiple use of gametes in families and risks inbreeding and the abnormal dissemination of inherited diseases.

Towards the end of 2023, Dr Kasper's laboratory was contacted by a French clinician who said that one of his patients had received a letter from a private sperm bank located in Europe, alerting her to the identification of a 'variant of unknown significance' in the TP53 (tumour protein 53) gene in less than 50% of the donor's gametes. TP53 provides instructions for making a tumour suppressor protein, keeping cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. The letter said that the donor was in good health, but that his biological children could be at risk of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare inherited disorder that predisposes to the development of cancers. Some of these children had already developed leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and this led to any use of the donor's gametes being definitively blocked.

I analyzed the variant using population and patient databases, computer prediction tools, and the results of functional trials, and came to the conclusion that the variant was probably cancer-causing and that children born from this donor should receive genetic counselling.""

Dr. Edwige Kasper, a specialist in genetic predisposition to cancer, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France

After discussion with French networks, the researchers presented these cases at a meeting of the European Reference Network on genetic tumour risk syndromes (GENTURIS) in 2024. Simultaneously, a number of Genetics and Paediatric Departments across Europe were investigating their own cases, leading to 67 children from 46 families in eight European countries being tested, with the variant being found in 23 of them and cancer found in ten to date.

Alterations in the TP53 gene cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, one of the most severe inherited predispositions to cancer that is characterised by a broad spectrum of tumours at an early age. The affected children, born between 2008 and 2015, are being closely monitored to detect the first signs of cancers. ""The follow-up protocol involves whole-body MRI scans, MRI scans of the brain and, for adults, of the breast, ultrasound examination of the abdomen, and a clinical examination by a specialist. This is heavy and stressful for carriers, but we have seen its effectiveness in that it has enabled early detection of tumours and thus improved patients' chances of survival,"" says Dr Kasper. ""Because animal models of Li-Fraumeni syndrome have shown that exposure to genotoxic chemotherapy or X-rays accelerated tumour development, these children should avoid radiation-based imaging techniques such as mammography and PET scans, if possible.""

The researchers are continuing to identify cases of European children born from the same donor. ""Although the variant would have been practically undetectable in 2008 when the individual started to donate sperm, there are many things that could have been and still need to be improved,"" says Dr Kasper. ""Some fertility clinics have refused to provide information to the families concerning the variant because they wanted the children to be tested in their own laboratories. There is a major issue here concerning a lack of harmonised regulation across Europe.""

Currently, laws on sperm donation differ from one European country to another. Private sperm banks usually limit donation from one donor to 75 countries worldwide. The law in France sets a limit of ten births per donor. However, in addition, there can be up to 15 births in Germany and in Denmark, and in the UK the same donor may be used for 12 and 10 families, respectively. At a European or international level this can represent a large number of births.

""My advice to French parents would be to favour a medically assisted procreation procedure in France, where donation is voluntary, anonymous, and free. The latter may explain the difference between parents' needs and the lack of resources,"" says Dr. Kasper, ""but it is very much safer. While donor examinations are routinely conducted in many countries, in France, gamete donation is medically supervised for both donors and recipients. Importantly, any suspicion of a genetic disorder must be promptly reported and investigated. Above all, each donor is limited to a maximum of ten births across the country, and the import or export of gametes may only be requested by an approved centre and is subject to authorisation from the Agence de la Biomédecine. ""The fact that the case in point is very rare does not mean that it will not reoccur, and gonadal mosaicism – where one or more groups of cells possess a different genetic makeup - has previously been reported in a sperm donor with reference to neurofibromatosis type 1. We need proper regulation at European level to try to prevent it happening again, and to implement measures to ensure a worldwide limit on the number of offspring conceived from the same donor.""

Chair of the conference Professor Alexandre Reymond said: ""While current legislation on assisted reproduction usually does not cross borders, this is a good example of why wider oversight is needed. But for now, what we learn in genetics in one country can help future parents everywhere.""

A new research paper was published in Aging (Aging-US) Volume 17, Issue 4, on April 1, 2025, titled ""Examining frailty phenotypes of community-dwelling older adults in Taiwan using the falls risk for older people in the community – Taiwan version (Tw-FROP-Com).""

A research team led by first author Ya-Mei Tzeng and corresponding authors Yu-Tien Chang and Yaw-Wen Chang from the National Defense Medical Center studied older adults in Taiwan and found that unintentional weight loss is the most significant individual predictor of fall risk among the common signs of frailty. This finding highlights the importance of early detection and tailored interventions to reduce fall-related injuries among aging populations.

Falls are a major cause of injury-related death in seniors, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In Taiwan, they rank as the second leading cause of accidental death among those aged 65 and older. The researchers evaluated five signs of frailty-weakness, slowness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and unintentional weight loss-using a locally adapted fall risk screening tool, Tw-FROP-Com. Frailty is a condition marked by reduced strength, stamina, and resilience, making older adults more vulnerable to accidents and illness.

The study analyzed data from 375 older adults participating in a fall prevention program in Keelung City. Of these, 18.7% were classified as frail, and nearly one-third had experienced a fall in the past year. All five frailty signs were associated with increased fall risk, but statistical analysis showed that unintentional weight loss had the strongest association, even after adjusting for factors like age and previous falls.

Rather than relying on a broad frailty label, this study found that analyzing each frailty feature individually provided more accurate predictions of fall risk. Weight loss, in particular, was also associated with conditions such as malnutrition, muscle decline, or chronic illness.

""Treating frailty as five distinct components provided a more precise prediction of fall risk than using a dichotomous frailty measure (Yes/No).""

The findings support the use of accessible screening tools like Tw-FROP-Com in everyday healthcare settings. Because it does not require complex equipment or physical testing, it can be widely applied to identify older adults at risk. Interventions such as nutritional support, physical activity, and weight monitoring can then be offered before a fall occurs.

The researchers recommend that public health programs and healthcare providers focus on each specific frailty sign, especially unintentional weight loss, rather than relying only on overall frailty status. As the global population ages, targeted fall prevention strategies like these may help older adults live healthier, more independent lives.

A breakthrough study, led by scientists at Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland, has uncovered how daylight can boost the immune system's ability to fight infections.

The team focused on the most abundant immune cells in our bodies, called 'neutrophils', which are a type of white blood cell. These cells move quickly to the site of an infection and kill invading bacteria.

The researchers used zebrafish, a small freshwater fish, as a model organism, because its genetic make-up is similar to ours and they can be bred to have transparent bodies, making it easy to observe biological processes in real time.

""In earlier studies, we had observed that immune responses peaked in the morning, during the fish's early active phase,"" says lead researcher Associate Professor Christopher Hall, from the Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology.

""We think this represents an evolutionary response such that during daylight hours the host is more active so more likely to encounter bacterial infections,"" says Hall.

However, the scientists wanted to find out how the immune response was being synchronised with daylight.

With this new study, published in Science Immunology, and led by two doctoral researchers, neutrophils were found to possess a circadian clock that alerted them to daytime, and boosted their ability to kill bacteria.

Most of our cells have circadian clocks to tell them what time of day it is in the outside world, in order to regulate the body's activities. Light has the biggest influence on resetting these circadian clocks.

Given that neutrophils are the first immune cells to be recruited to sites of inflammation, our discovery has very broad implications for therapeutic benefit in many inflammatory diseases.

This finding paves the way for development of drugs that target the circadian clock in neutrophils to boost their ability to fight infections.""

Christopher Hall, Associate Professor, Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, University of Auckland

The research was funded through the Royal Society of NZ's Marsden Fund.

Current research is now focussed on understanding the specific mechanisms by which light influences the neutrophil circadian clock.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","24 Players Named to U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team Roster for Domestic Training Camp in Fayetteville, Ga. as World Cup Prep Begins","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/05/24-players-named-us-under-17-womens-national-team-roster-for-domestic-training-camp-fayetteville-ga-world-cup-prep-begins-","Sat, 24 May 2025 05:01:30 GMT","

ATLANTA (May 22, 2025) – U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team head coach Katie Schoepfer has named 24 players to the first training camp after her team qualified 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, which starting this year, will be staged annually and has been expanded from 16 to 24 nations. The camp will take place from May 27-June 3 in Fayetteville, Ga., site of the currently under construction Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center, which will host the majority of YNT camps after its completion in 2026.

Players born on or after Jan. 1, 2008, are age-eligible for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. Twenty-three players selected by Schoepfer were born in 2008 with Gotham FC forward Mak Whitham, who was the youngest signing in NWSL history at age 13 (she's now 14), born in 2010.

The USA is preparing for the World Cup which will be held Oct. 17-Nov. 8. The next five editions of the tournament, starting this year, will be held in Morocco. To qualify, the USA needed to win its group in the Final Round of the Concacaf Women's U-17 Championship, and did so with aplomb, outscoring its three opponents, 17-0.

This camp will also serve as a springboard to the June training camp at which the U.S. U-17s will face youth international power Japan twice in Kansas City, with the first match being a promoted game at CPKC Stadium, home to the Kansas City Current, and the first purpose-built stadium for women's soccer. That match will take place on June 28 (6:30 p.m. CT) and the teams will also play a closed-door international on July 1 at The University of Kansas Health System Training Center, which is also home to the Current. Japan has won one FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup and finished runners-up twice. Tickets for the promoted match are available through the Kansas City Current here.

Just eight players on this roster participated in the qualifying tournament as Schoepfer takes a deeper dive into the player pool to evaluate players who could contribute to the World Cup Team.

The players that were in Costa Rica for the Concacaf tournament were goalkeeper Evan O'Steen, defenders Pearl Cecil, Lauren Hemann, Gacie Milam and Sydney Schmidt, midfielders Jaiden Rodriguez and Chloe Sadler and forward Ashlyn Anderson. Rodriguez scored twice in the three goals while Anderson tallied four times. Cecil, a center back, and Schmidt scored once each. O'Steen, who plays her youth club for Solar SC, also is on the books for the Dallas Trinity in the USL Super League, but she has not seen action this year.

Goalkeeper Hannah Folliard, defenders Marlee Raymond and Milam and midfielder Brooke Bunton -- all of whom are named to this camp -- were alternates on the Concacaf qualifying team. Milam was eventually moved to the full roster for Costa Rica after an injury to another player.

One professional club and 22 different youth clubs from 15 different states are represented on the roster, with four players from California, three from Florida, and two each from Georgia, Utah and Illinois.

Fourteen countries have qualified so far for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. China PR, Japan, Korea DPR and Korea Republic have qualified from Asia via nominations by the Asian Football Confederation based on results of the last three editions of AFC U-17 Women's Asian Cup in Thailand in 2017 and 2019 and in Indonesia in 2024. New Zealand and Samoa have qualified from Oceania via the 2024 OFC U-16 Women's Championship. From Africa, in addition to host Morocco, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Zambia have earned berths via the 2025 African U-17 Women's World Cup qualifiers. The Concacaf teams that qualified along with the USA were Mexico, Canada and Costa Rica.

On May 25, 2010, Herculez Gomez punched in a goal for the U.S. men's soccer team at Rentschler Field, a ray of light in the second half of a 4-2 loss to the Czech Republic at Rentschler Field, and it vaulted him onto the team for that year's World Cup.

Among the 36,000 in the stadium that day was a local kid. Patrick Agyemang, 9 years old, was watching and began to dream about being down there on the turf with the USMNT.

“Crazy,” said Gomez, now one of ESPN's soccer analysts. “… Unbelievable story.”

Agyemang, 24, who grew up a corner kick or two from the stadium in East Hartford, will be in the lineup when the U.S. plays Turkey at Rentschler on June 7. He was called up from his MLS team, Charlotte FC, this week and added to the 27-man roster for June matches, with the Gold Cup matches to follow.

From East Hartford to a top MLS draft pick, Patrick Agyemang may have bloomed late but he's made up for lost time



“He may not have the pedigree of some of the (forwards) in that pool, who were playing in Europe at a young age, with top set-ups and resources or recognition,” Gomez said. “But he's got a skill set that not many in the pool have, the size of the kid, athleticism, the ability to win duels in the air, to get in behind, how much of a handful he is, his speed.

“He's got a nose for the goal, one of those intangibles that goal-scorers must have. The ball finds you, you find the ball, that sixth sense. That's a handful for any defender around the world.”

As the 2026 World Cup approaches, Agyemang's story will surely become an international phenomenon, the almost unfathomable rise from East Hartford High, where he didn't start right away, to Division III college soccer at Eastern Connecticut, then to Rhode Island, to MLS and to the USMNT, scoring three goals in his first four caps.

But when Coach Mauricio Pochettino announced his roster, it raised a few eyebrows. Many of the familiar names are not on it, including Christian Pulisic, the team's most prominent player, who scored a memorable goal in the loss to Germany last time the U.S. team played in East Hartford. He's dealing with injuries and fatigue from his season with AC Milan and will step back for a bit.

Dom Amore: USA men's soccer goalkeeper Matt Turner returning to play in Connecticut, where remarkable rise began



“Before, you had a national team where if there were 26 on the roster, 25 were playing on European teams,” Gomez said. “Now you have 17 of 27 culled from Major League Soccer. There seems to be lot of doubt right now as to how this team has been assembled and the chips that are at the disposal for Pochettino to play.”

With the World Cup a year away, it is unusual to be auditioning younger players now, so Gomez is not sure what the objectives will be for the U.S. on June 7.

“If you hear what Pochettino has been saying, he seems to be sending a message about players wanting to be here, players trying to win their spot and not be comfortable,” Gomez said. “I'm all for that, but a year out from the World Cup, it's not really about identifying players, it's about solidifying the project you have, that you have been working on for quite some time.”

Pochettino does have a few players who were on the World Cup team in 2022, including goalkeeper Matt Turner, who played at Fairfield. But in revealing the roster he said he is trying to create competition and looking for energy — and where there is uncertainty there is opportunity for a dynamic player to break through.

“It's a great opportunity for different players to challenge and to try to get a place in one year's time for the World Cup,” Pochettino said. “That is really important for us. What we want to create in our national team is people desperate to come to perform.”

 

Agyemang, 6 feet 4, has 32 goals in 56 games for Charlotte FC, an indication of the game-changing explosiveness he can bring to the U.S, team, perhaps something no other player in the U.S. pool can add.

“If you're a coach and (Agyemang) is not your starter,” Gomez said, “and the game calls for somebody to shake something up, somebody to make something out of nothing, somebody to be a difference maker, having a player with those intangibles can come in very handy. I think that gives him an advantage over other (candidates). … When he has played, he's scored, and take it from a guy who used that same ability to get onto the U.S. national team for the World Cup.

“I had an opportunity in East Hartford right before the World Cup, coming on at halftime and scoring and I heard it from the coaches, ‘One of the reasons we brought you on is you have this knack of scoring goals in limited time.'”

Casey D'Annolfo, from Conard-West Hartford, will coach Tufts men's lacrosse in the Division III national championship game for the second time in three years. The Jumbos (22-0) play Dickinson on Sunday at 7 p.m. at Gillette Stadium for the trophy.

D'Annolfo, who took over at his college alma mater in 2016, has a 144-18 record at Tufts.
Steve Pikiell, the former UConn basketball captain and coach at Rutgers, also has some stake in the lacrosse finals. His daughter, Liv Pikiell, is playing for the unbeaten North Carolina women's team, which defeated Florida 20-4 in the semifinals Friday, and will play Northwestern on Sunday for the championship..

Boldly charging into Division I at warp speed, this CT school may find sailing not always smooth



The University of New Haven, moving to Division I next season, has reworked and released its football schedule for 2025. The Chargers will play as an independent program, with a mix of Division II, III and FCS opponents, including a few of its future conference rivals from the NEC. All things considered, it's a pretty good slate for a program in transition.

Road games include Marist, Mercyhurst, Albany, Duquesne, LIU and Sacred Heart. Home games include Saginaw Valley State, Pace, Western Connecticut and Merrimack. Duquesne, LIU and Mercyhurst are NEC opponents, Sacred Heart and Merrimack are FCS independents who play for a “Yankee Conference title.” Marist plays in the FCS Pioneer League, Albany in the CAA, Pace and Saginaw Valley are Division II, WCSU is D-III.

*The phrase “we don't rebuild, we reload” has become a tired mantra and, in fact, very wishful thinking in many places. But UConn men's and women's basketball, with their brand and access to the transfer portal, can claim this offseason as a legit reload. Joe Lunardi projects the men as a No. 1 seed. The women, with two big gets in the portal in Kayleigh Heckel and Serah Williams, are poised for Geno Auriemma to go for the baker's dozen.

*Ran into John Gwynn, “microwave” scorer on UConn men's 1989-90 Dream Season team, and his daughter, Nicole this week. Nicole Gwynn, who played at Wethersfield High, just finished her college career at Georgia Southern with 1,569 points, and is now hoping to play overseas. In 2023, while at Queens (N.C.) University, she scored 26 in a game vs. LSU.

*Windsor High has announced its latest class of Hall of Fame inductees during its baseball game against Tolland at Dunkin Park this week. They are: Terrance Knighton ('04), football, basketball, who played in the NFL from 2009-16; Wayne Dobrutsky ('79), football/baseball; Mairin Dudek ('98), soccer, softball; Paul Lepak ('04), soccer; Cole Ormsby ('13), football; Michael Phang ('14), soccer, track; Kelsey Jepsen ('14), swimming; Dominique Fox, coach; Neil Beaulieu, contributor. They will be inducted Nov. 1 at LaNote in East Windsor. More information will be at the Hall of Fame's website.

*Some exciting movement for local baseball players in the pros this week. Waterford's Mike Burrows, who finished last season with the Pirates and picked up a late-season win at Yankee Stadium, was recalled from Triple A to make his first MLB start Thursday. He allowed four runs in five innings vs. Milwaukee. … Frank Mozzicato, from Ellington and East Catholic, Royals first-round pick in 2021, was moved up to Double A Northwest Arkansas this week, a crucial step. He allowed six runs in 4 2/3 innings in his first start. … Former UConn slugger Kyler “The Warden” Fedko, with the Twins Double A affiliate in Wichita, has eight home runs already.

*Rookie of the year Steph Castle wasn't the only UConn guy making a mark with the Spurs. Mike Noyes of Granby, a high-IQ walk-on who eventually earned a scholarship during the Kevin Ollie era, is an assistant coach/director of player development. Noyes graduated from UConn with his degree in math and actuarial science in 2017, then worked for the Grizzlies as data scientist and video coordinator. This is the type of career path that often leads to high places in the NBA.

*UNH is planning a memorial service for its legendary baseball coach, Frank “Porky” Vieira on June 17 at 10:30 a.m. at the school's baseball field. Vieira died April 25 at age 91.

*Earlier this month, SCSU hired Joe Loth to be its new football coach. Loth was 77-45 with six postseason appearances in 12 seasons at Western Connecticut.

Dom Amore's Sunday Read: Soto, Judge, Knicks in a NY minute; Paige Bueckers' challenge and more



Whatever it is that appears to be eating Juan Soto, the Mets need to address it forcefully and fast, as it has risen from social media banter to take on a life of its own. Two months into a 15-year, three-quarter billion dollar contract, he has not looked, or sounded like the same confident, exuberant player he was across town. If the narrative that he regrets his choice begins to harden like cement, it will be very difficult to get completely rid of it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Alex Freeman 'grateful' for USMNT callup, hopes to become a regular","https://www.wesh.com/article/orlando-citys-alex-freeman-us-june-training-camp-gold-cup/64868722","Sat, 24 May 2025 11:22:00 GMT","

Alex Freeman was caught by surprise when he saw his name listed in the United States preliminary 60-man roster for next month's Concacaf Gold Cup tournament. 

But he didn't think much of it.  

When the June training camp roster for the U.S. men's national team was released on Thursday, however, he almost shed a tear at the thought of seeing what was once a dream turn into a reality. 

""Was I expecting it? No. Is it a very unexpected surprise? Yes. It's the hard work I've been putting out the past 3-4 years, and it's all working out,"" Freeman said on Friday. ""It's me being consistent and continuing to put in that work, even if I made it to where I want to be, it's just continuing to be better."" 

Freeman, 20, has been on a rapid rise this year for Orlando City. 

Just a year ago, he logged 20-plus games played in MLS Next Pro with Orlando City B, having only played 15 minutes in all competitions with Orlando City.  

This year, though, he's the team's starting right back with 14 games played so far. The most consistent playing time with Orlando's first team. 

Thursday's announcement will see Freeman join the USMNT for a training camp scheduled for June 1 in Chicago. 

He's one of 27 players selected ahead of the U.S.'s two games against Turkey on June 7 in Connecticut and Switzerland on June 10 at GEODIS Park in Nashville. 

By then, Freeman should know if he's made the official Gold Cup tournament roster for the U.S., which officially kicks off June 15 against Trinidad and Tobago. 

The official Gold Cup roster is due June 4, according to a spokesperson from US Soccer. 

This week's news for Freeman, who's the son of former Green Bay Packers Hall of Famer Antonio Freeman, has served as confirmation for his efforts in the past year. 

""It's something I was hoping for,"" said Freeman. ""I was in the preliminary roster, and I was just grateful for that in the moment, and being in the final roster, it's a good start to my first-team season with Orlando, and it's something I'm very grateful for to be able to represent the badge, my country."" 

While 2025 may be his best year yet, Freeman said he knows the work doesn't stop, echoing guidance from his father heading into another new chapter of his professional career.   

""If anyone knows about big news, it's him,"" Freeman said about his father. ""He's just telling me to keep my head down. More news is to come, and if I keep working, this will be something that happens regularly, and that's the goal ... being able to be called up to the national team regularly.""

Manchester City are yet to gauge any further clarity over whether Pep Guardiola will be able to count upon Rico Lewis and James McAtee at the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup.

The Etihad Stadium side will have no time to break off during the forthcoming off-season, with the club making their debut appearance at the brand new revamped version of the FIFA Club World Cup, hosted in the United States.

Not only are Manchester City expected to bring with them their full first-team squad, but there is also an expectance in some quarters that the tournament could also feature some new signings, should deals progress over the coming weeks.

     

Among the names that are already being targeted by the club for immediate moves to the Etihad Stadium are Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White, AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders, and Newcastle United's Tino Livramento.

But there is also plenty of uncertainty surrounding other names due to be at the tournament, with international commitments for younger stars getting in the way of clear availability for the competition Stateside.

That largely concerns Rico Lewis and James McAtee, who are likely to be demanded for action with England Under-21 set-up this summer, as they gear up to compete at the Under-21 European Championships in Slovakia.

Speaking to reporters during his pre-match press conference ahead of Manchester City's visit to Fulham on Sunday afternoon, Pep Guardiola was quizzed on whether either player would be at the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup given their clash of duties.

“Not yet,” he responded when asked whether a decision had already been taken on the matter. “It normally happens when you go to the World Cup or European Cup we are already on holidays, that's why they go. But now the situation is here, they have to talk.”

The Manchester City manager continued, “I don't know – now I'm going to make a joke because I'm such a funny guy – who is going to pay the salary in this month; the National Team or the Club, when they decide to go to the Under-21s. I don't know who is going to pay it.

“But who is going to decide, I would say the players with the club. They have to talk with the sporting director and they have to decide what they want to do.”

In a closing statement, Guardiola also revealed, “I know that Lee [Carsley], the manager for the Under-21s, asked the club for both players to go to the Under-21 Euros. But I don't know the resolution right now.”

The latest edition of the Under-21 European Championships hosted by Slovakia is set to take place between 11 June and 28 June 2025, while the FIFA Club World Cup runs from 14 June through to 13 July.

Manchester City are set to embark on an initial three matches as part of their group stage at the tournament, taking on Italy's Juventus, Morocco's Wydad AC, and the United Arab Emirates' Al Ain.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Chelsea are set to welcome back many loanees this summer ahead of their Club World Cup campaign, including midfielder Andrey Santos.

Enzo Maresca's Chelsea squad will fly out to the United States next month for the Club World Cup, where they could earn up to £100m should they go all the way and win the tournament. 

With a short turnaround from the end of their domestic and European campaign, Chelsea will need depth and quality to ensure injuries and fitness problems are avoided. 

Andrey Santos is one player who has been earmarked to return to Chelsea next season following his successful loan spell with RC Strasbourg in Ligue 1. Having captained the side, he scored 11 goals and contributed five assists in 34 appearances for the French club in 2024-25. 

The 21-year-old penned an emotional farewell on Instagram earlier this week. He wrote: ""It's hard to begin this text without being moved. Today, I say goodbye with my head held high, to a club that I fell in love with inexplicably, and for which I gave everything from start to finish.

""From my very first day here, I've always been made to feel very welcome by everyone, from the players/staff to the fans and supporters of Strasbourg.

""I had the privilege of being captain, and here I had my first full season in Europe, and with many goalsHere was born the greatest love of my life, the greatest gift that God has given me, who is my son, here my family and I were very happy and we will be eternally grateful for all the love and affection of you all.

""I'd like to thank everyone for every moment we spent together. I will miss all the matches at the Stade de la Meinau. But I'll always carry you in my heart and I'll never forget you, because one day I'll be back.""

A post shared by Andrey Santos (@andreysantos_5)

Santos' performances, unsurprisingly, have attracted attention from across Europe. However, Chelsea have no plans to let the Brazilian depart.

He was name-checked by co-owner Todd Boehly at the Qatar Economic Forum ahead of the Club World Cup after the American was asked about Chelsea's summer transfer plans. 

""We're going to the Club World Cup, so we are laser focused on the Club World Cup,"" said Boehly. ""We have some players that are joining us that weren't on the team, (like) Andrey Santos. We're really excited about him and what he can add to the squad.""

Santos will bolster Chelsea's midfield which already includes the likes of Moises Caicedo, Romeo Lavia and Enzo Fernandez. Another exciting prospect and selection headache for Maresca to deal with in the coming months and seasons.

Bayern Munich may be focused on winning the Club World Cup this summer, but behind the scenes, internal frustration is mounting — and it has little to do with events on the pitch.

Vincent Kompany's side reclaimed the Bundesliga title from Bayer Leverkusen this season and will now shift their focus to next month's Club World Cup. 

Bayern begin their post-season campaign in Cincinnati on June 15 against Auckland City, followed by Boca Juniors in Miami on June 21, and wrap up the group stage against Benfica in Charlotte on June 24.

However, some club staff have been left frustrated after being told they won't travel with the team due to cost-cutting measures - despite players' families being flown out at the club's expense. 

In the latest episode of BILD's podcast, Christian Falk and Tobias Altschäffl revealed growing discontent behind the scenes at the club.

Falk revealed: 'The players' families have been invited.'

Altschaffl added: 'There's a whole week where families are allowed to come. I think after a stressful season, with a lot of hectic schedules, they're allowed to have their families around them.'

Falk then explained: 'You have to say, a few employees were annoyed. They're cutting costs everywhere, so only a small group of employees is allowed to go over, but the families are.' 

The cost-cutting measures are said to have been put in place by sporting director Max Eberl include a directive to reduce squad expenses by 20 per cent. 

Those affected include middle management, lower-level staff, and matchday stewards — many of whom will be left behind as the squad heads to the U.S. 

Among those having their expenses covered by Bayern is Harry Kane's wife, Katie Goodland - despite the striker reportedly earning £400,000 per week. 

Nevertheless, Bayern boss Kompany has set sights on winning the Club World Cup this summer.  

'I think the closer we get to the tournament, the more you can see the excitement growing,' Kompany said in March. 

'It's been quite a special season anyway so far. You have the new format of the Champions League, and you have the next competition with the Club World Cup.

'You know, I think we're part of a club here with Bayern Munich where every trophy is important, so by the time we get to America, it will be a priority.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

Cristiano Ronaldo is in discussions to play at FIFA's Club World Cup in June, according to FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

Cristiano Ronaldo is in “discussions” to play at FIFA's inaugural Club World Cup this summer, according to the president of the sport's global governing body.

Gianni Infantino says the former Manchester United and Real Madrid forward might play in the tournament, which is being staged in the United States in June, because of a unique transfer window.

Ronaldo's Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr did not qualify for the tournament, but Infantino suggested that the Portugal star could switch to one of the 32 teams participating in the tournament.

“Cristiano Ronaldo might play in the Club World Cup,” Infantino told online streamer IShowSpeed, whose YouTube channel has more than 39 million subscribers. “There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup, who knows? Still a few weeks' time, will be fun.”

FIFA confirmed on Wednesday that last-minute transfer signings are open to all teams going to the tournament, which fuelled more speculation that one of them will try to sign the 40-year-old Ronaldo on a short-term deal, potentially a loan.

Such a move would be unprecedented in modern football, though it could appeal to FIFA by boosting the profile and ticket sales of an inaugural tournament being played in 11 US cities.

A transfer for Ronaldo would also reunite him and Lionel Messi in the same competition for the first time since the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Last October, FIFA invited Messi's Inter Miami to enter the tournament in the slot that was expected to be reserved for the host nation's champions. Inter Miami were eliminated in the MLS Cup playoffs.

Speculative reports have linked Ronaldo to the one Saudi club that qualified, Al Hilal, the Brazilian club Palmeiras and Wydad of Morocco, even though that club is currently banned by FIFA from registering new signings.

Transfers can be made from June 1-10 and again from June 27 to July 3, according to exceptional rules FIFA approved in October.

“The objective is to encourage clubs and players whose contracts are expiring to find an appropriate solution to facilitate the players' participation,” FIFA said in Wednesday's statement.

                        EPCR have confirmed the Club World Cup for 2028                    

The long-awaited Rugby Club World Cup has finally been confirmed for 2028, European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) have announced.

News broke via The Times last night that the competition will finally take place after years of speculation, and now we will get to see the best teams across both Hemispheres compete against each other in direct competition.

Club World Cups are a growing trend within the sporting landscape, with the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup set to take place later this year, and now rugby is following suit.

The new competition will see eight teams from the Champions Cup, seven from Super Rugby Pacific and one from Japan go head-to-head once every four years to be crowned the Club World Champions.

Big news from EPCR 👀

Commenting on the news, EPCR Chairman, Dominic McKay said: 

“It's great to be in Cardiff celebrating the 30th season of the Investec Champions Cup and the EPCR Challenge Cup,” McKay said.

“We've had some great discussions over the course of the weekend talking about the future of our sport and particularly some exciting projects that relate to EPCR.

“One of those projects is the Rugby World Club Cup.

“This is something we've spoken about at EPCR for the last two or three years – we've been trying to work our way through this project to see if we can deliver it.

“And over the last few days we've had great meetings with our Board, great meetings with our General Assembly, who represent the three leagues and stakeholders from seven unions, and everyone is unanimous about wanting to deliver a World Club Cup – through EPCR.”

Irish legend explains the ‘best thing' about Henry Pollock being ‘a guy who irritates everybody'

 

“The Investec Champions Cup is the greatest club competition in the world, and we're going to continue to protect that, nurture it and develop it further. We've got some ambitious plans for both the Investec Champions Cup and EPCR Challenge Cup, which we'll unveil over the coming weeks.

“And, to elevate the whole of professional club rugby, we want to create this World Club Cup proposition in 2028 and 2032 with our friends from the South. We have these incredible competitions that we own and operate, and we want to find a way to elevate them further and bring in teams from Australia, from New Zealand, from Japan, and we'll do that through the World Club Cup.

“So, once every four years, starting off in 2028, we're going to bring the greatest clubs from the southern hemisphere to battle it out against the greatest clubs in the northern hemisphere – and who wouldn't want to find out who the greatest club in the world is as a consequence of that.

“We're so excited about this as a project. Our stakeholders, our leagues, and our unions are so excited about delivering a World Club Cup. We'll be sharing more information over the course of the summer, and we'll do that in conjunction with our friends from the south.

“To reassure everyone, we've thought about this from a player's perspective, from a fan's perspective, and from a future fan's perspective. We believe the fans of the future want to see the greatest clubs come together. They already have that in Europe and South Africa for the Investec Champions Cup and EPCR Challenge Cup, so we want to broaden the family a bit further. It promises to be absolutely box office.

“I couldn't be more thrilled that our stakeholders are supporting us and we look forward to sharing more information with the players and our fans in the coming weeks and months.”

 

More information on the competition will be released in the coming months.

The Pontiac Silverdome once stood as one of America's great sporting venues.

With a seating capacity of 82,600, it was home to the Detroit Lions from 1975 to 2001, and was the largest stadium in the NFL until FedExField expanded its capacity to over 85,000 at the turn of the millennium.

The Lions shared the Silverdome with the Detroit Pistons for a decade between 1978 and 1988.

While glory widely eluded the two teams during their tenures in Pontiac -- the Lions failed to reach the Super Bowl, while the Pistons won their first NBA Championship a year after moving out -- the Silverdome remains iconic to many.

It also hosted a range of other massive events, including WrestleMania III -- which boasted a record attendance of 93,173 -- and the first-ever indoor FIFA World Cup match.

The 1994 soccer tournament, played in nine venues across the United States, is considered one of the most successful ever held.

It broke World Cup records for total attendance (3,587,538) and average attendance per match (68,991).

Both are records that stand to this day.

The tournament also witnessed the first goalless final, between Italy and Brazil, with the latter capturing their fourth title with a 3-2 penalty shootout win.

It was also the first World Cup to adopt a new three points for a win system, instead of the old two points for a win approach, and goalkeepers were no longer allowed to pick up deliberate back-passes in another rule change.

Three decades later, and it is odd to think about what soccer was like without those rules.

But it's fair to say the first indoor World Cup match was a harder sell.

The Silverdome hosted the tournament's first indoor game on June 18, 1994, when hosts the USA held Switzerland to a 1-1 draw in front of a crowd of 73,425 for their Group A clash.

Grass for the surface was grown locally by Michigan State University, and later installed in the venue, which went on to host four more matches.

Switzerland beat Romania 4-1 in the second match at the Silverdome, while Sweden later beat Russia 3-1 in Group B, before drawing 1-1 with Brazil.

The Silverdome was the only venue of the nine used that didn't host knockout round games at the '94 World Cup, and the four it did host was the lowest total of any stadium.

Part of the reason for that, perhaps, was the far from ideal climate inside.

The Silverdome didn't have a working cooling system and because it was an air-supported stadium, the air could not escape through circulation, so temperatures inside would climb past 90F (32C) in the summer, with 40% humidity.

US midfielder Thomas Dooley described it as 'the worst place I have ever played at.'

Tab Ramos, meanwhile, said it was 'probably the hottest game' he had ever played in, and noted that 'the field felt like we were running in sand.'

While soccer stars struggled inside the Silverdome at the 1994 World Cup, it remained the home of the Lions for seven more years.

They moved to Ford Field in 2002, and after that, activity in the Silverdome dropped drastically.

It still staged some low-key events, like Monster Jam in 2006, while the parking lot was also converted into a drive-in theater for three years between 2003 and 2006.

As the city of Pontiac began to experience several years of serious financial problems in the wake of the Lions departure, it attempted to sell the stadium.

More than two decades on, and a $2.4bn plan to abandon another NFL franchise's 80-year home is in doubt.

But back in 2009, the Silverdome itself was purchased for just $583,000, despite a cost of $225million to build in 1975, by Greek-born Canadian real estate developer Andreas Apostolopoulos.

He vowed to 'revive the stadium as a big-event venue' by investing millions of dollars, and it reopened in 2010 with another monster truck event.

AC Milan and Panathinaikos FC even played an exhibition game there August in 2011, but ultimately, the lack of events coming into the venue, combined with the 2013 roof collapse, put any further development plans on hold.

In March 2014, the owners announced they would be auctioning off the contents of the facility, and by December, the Silverdome was in a state of abandonment.

The venue was condemned and cleared for demolition three years later, and by March 2018, the last free standing wall of the Silverdome was destroyed, leaving a 50ft-deep hole where the stadium once stood.

Another of the NFL's oldest stadiums, meanwhile, is hoping to avoid a similar fate and has been handed a $4.7 billion project lifeline.

Amazon later developed the Silverdome site into both a distribution facility and delivery center.

The delivery center opened in September 2020, while the distribution center came 12 months later, and the project cost an estimated $250m.

What stands on the site is now a far cry from the Silverdome in its heyday, which will be remembered fondly for hosting NFL, NBA and World Cup games -- even if the latter offered far from ideal playing conditions.

ATLANTA (May 22, 2025) – U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team head coach Katie Schoepfer has named 24 players to the first training camp after her team qualified 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, which starting this year, will be staged annually and has been expanded from 16 to 24 nations. The camp will take place from May 27-June 3 in Fayetteville, Ga., site of the currently under construction Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center, which will host the majority of YNT camps after its completion in 2026.

Players born on or after Jan. 1, 2008, are age-eligible for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. Twenty-three players selected by Schoepfer were born in 2008 with Gotham FC forward Mak Whitham, who was the youngest signing in NWSL history at age 13 (she's now 14), born in 2010.

The USA is preparing for the World Cup which will be held Oct. 17-Nov. 8. The next five editions of the tournament, starting this year, will be held in Morocco. To qualify, the USA needed to win its group in the Final Round of the Concacaf Women's U-17 Championship, and did so with aplomb, outscoring its three opponents, 17-0.

This camp will also serve as a springboard to the June training camp at which the U.S. U-17s will face youth international power Japan twice in Kansas City, with the first match being a promoted game at CPKC Stadium, home to the Kansas City Current, and the first purpose-built stadium for women's soccer. That match will take place on June 28 (6:30 p.m. CT) and the teams will also play a closed-door international on July 1 at The University of Kansas Health System Training Center, which is also home to the Current. Japan has won one FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup and finished runners-up twice. Tickets for the promoted match are available through the Kansas City Current here.

Just eight players on this roster participated in the qualifying tournament as Schoepfer takes a deeper dive into the player pool to evaluate players who could contribute to the World Cup Team.

The players that were in Costa Rica for the Concacaf tournament were goalkeeper Evan O'Steen, defenders Pearl Cecil, Lauren Hemann, Gacie Milam and Sydney Schmidt, midfielders Jaiden Rodriguez and Chloe Sadler and forward Ashlyn Anderson. Rodriguez scored twice in the three goals while Anderson tallied four times. Cecil, a center back, and Schmidt scored once each. O'Steen, who plays her youth club for Solar SC, also is on the books for the Dallas Trinity in the USL Super League, but she has not seen action this year.

Goalkeeper Hannah Folliard, defenders Marlee Raymond and Milam and midfielder Brooke Bunton -- all of whom are named to this camp -- were alternates on the Concacaf qualifying team. Milam was eventually moved to the full roster for Costa Rica after an injury to another player.

One professional club and 22 different youth clubs from 15 different states are represented on the roster, with four players from California, three from Florida, and two each from Georgia, Utah and Illinois.

Fourteen countries have qualified so far for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. China PR, Japan, Korea DPR and Korea Republic have qualified from Asia via nominations by the Asian Football Confederation based on results of the last three editions of AFC U-17 Women's Asian Cup in Thailand in 2017 and 2019 and in Indonesia in 2024. New Zealand and Samoa have qualified from Oceania via the 2024 OFC U-16 Women's Championship. From Africa, in addition to host Morocco, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Zambia have earned berths via the 2025 African U-17 Women's World Cup qualifiers. The Concacaf teams that qualified along with the USA were Mexico, Canada and Costa Rica.

 A century of movie-making means nowhere blends science fiction and reality quite like Los Angeles – as I discovered from the back of a driverless taxi – hours after seeing KITT from Knight Rider in a museum. 

Seeing the steering wheel spin of its own accord was as nerve-racking as watching a London cab's meter spinning… But as the Waymo (an app like Uber, but no driver) safely navigated the streets, it gave a surreal taste of the future.

 And like any traveller landing at LAX for the first time I had plenty of preconceptions. But no matter if your movie taste is more Barbie than Blade Runner, LA is full of surprises. 

Thought the City of Angels was too big or busy for your little angels? Think again. It has entertainment for kids of all ages. Even big kids like me in their mid-40s. Ironically the home of the silver screen is perfect for a screen break, as it offers enough stimulation for even TikTok-addicted teenagers to put phones away.

  

LA hosts the World Cup next year and the Olympics in 2028. For sports-loving families, catching a game while in LA is a great option. LA Clippers-owner Steve Ballmer sank £1.5billion into the Intuit Dome basketball arena - and boy, can you tell. The former Microsoft CEO wanted the world's best arena for his NBA team. Befitting a tech titan's toy, it is completely space-age.

For starters, after booking a seat online, you upload a selfie on to the Clippers' app and your face acts as your ticket – you literally just walk in. Want a drink, hot dog or jersey? Pick one up from any bar or shop and stroll away. Facial recognition is also linked to your Google or Apple Pay. Pretty cool.

I also caught the Lakers at the downtown Crypto.com Arena. Murals of late Lakers' legend Kobe Bryant can be found all over LA and there are always A-list celebrities courtside.

The short trip to Anaheim for the original Disneyland will be on most family agendas. Mickey, Minnie and co have entertained generations there since 1955 and the park marks its 70th in July.

In truth, every day at Disneyland is a celebration, particularly for younger visitors. The clear ride highlight was the incredible Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance. Space Mountain also continues to wow and the Guardians of the Galaxy ride was exhilarating.

Top tip, download the Disneyland app before arriving for live updates on queues, navigation and details of when popular parades take place. Viewing the fireworks displays from Main Street is a must.

Of all the insider movie trivia gained during (ace) tours of Universal Studios and Warner Bros, the most jaw-dropping was that the latter employs gardeners to pick individual leaves from trees so Mafia sets convincingly replicate New York (the Big Apple has an autumn, LA doesn't).

Warner Bros is a working studio and the 90-minute tour is unmissable. TV fans can sit on famous sofas from Friends and The Big Bang Theory, and seeing the tricks performed to create your favourite shows is eye-opening.

As well as an equally informative tour – including sets from Psycho, Jaws and King Kong – Universal Studios is a full-blown theme park too. The coolest ride is the immersive MarioKart: Bowser's Challenge in Super Nintendo World.

Imagine playing MarioKart with friends, while wearing 3D goggles and simultaneously spinning around in a dodgem car and you're not far off.

Theme-park tickets, food and merchandise mount up, so it is a relief some top attractions are free. California's golden sands are legendary, and Venice and Santa Monica beaches are easy excursions. The 2.5 mile walk between Santa Monica Pier and Venice Beach Skatepark is a gem. And where else could you join posers pumping iron on Muscle Beach, watch skaters flip epic tricks, and barter for souvenirs with the merchants of Venice boardwalk?

Another fab free excursion is to Griffith Park – named after a Welsh mining magnate who donated it to LA, though on the negative side of the ledger he later shot his wife. That nugget was a line from our guide from Bikes and Hikes LA, who as an actor played a doctor on ER. Before you ask, no, it wasn't a down-on-his-luck George Clooney…

While Griffith Park is totally free, the guide (Michael) elevated the experience.

The massive park on Mount Hollywood has brilliant views, hiking trails and is a great vantage point for photos of the Hollywood sign. Griffith Observatory is another free and fun way of learning about the stars. Checking how much you'd weigh on different planets is interactive amusement, at least until you get to Jupiter and the needle rockets.

As well as celestial stars it regularly hosts cinematic ones, appearing in scores of movies, including La La Land.

The Petersen Museum on Wilshire Boulevard is impossibly striking and home to not only Michael Knight's KITT and Herbie, the Batmobile and Lightning McQueen, but 250 other significant vehicles.

LA is also well served by art museums for those after culture. The Broad in downtown boasts a stunning collection of contemporary works by Warhol, Basquiat and Koons and is also free.

The magic cast by tacos in LA is intoxicating and I was enchanted. Angelenos insist LA dining doesn't get more authentic than at its 4,000 roadside taco trucks. I can honestly say I didn't have one mediocre taco – they were uniformly excellent and a bargain option for family dining.

To push the taco boat out a little, head to Holbox inside the Mercado la Paloma in south LA. There aren't many Michelin-starred restaurants where you just turn up and join the queue. The 20-minute wait was rewarded by a counter seat where I could watch chefs expertly assemble spankingly fresh seafood tacos.

Octopuses, scallops and Baja California Kanpachi with a bewildering array of salsas were among the delights I dived into. A final bill – including tip and tax – of $44 was an absolute steal.

LA is a seriously exciting food city, though prices can seem high. For those staying downtown, Asterid by Ray Garcia is a swanky option where the short rib lives long in the memory.

In the Arts District, De La Nonna is great value and a cut above most Italians, with its salads and vegetable-led dishes enticing, not to mention a killer cocktail list. On Venice's Abbot Kinney Boulevard, Gjelina is a celeb magnet. By LA standards it's affordable and the Mediterranean-inspired food really lets the Californian produce sing.

LA has more than 1,000 hotels to suit all budgets, but I definitely backed a winner at the W Hollywood. Having recently undergone a £38million refurb, it is a glam choice, right on Hollywood Boulevard (Katharine Hepburn and Doris Day have Walk of Fame stars outside).

The stylish rooms are huge, with great design touches. A rooftop pool offers breathtaking views and was a stunning spot for a dawn dip to defeat jet lag. Downstairs the Living Room is the sort of grand lobby bar American hotels do so well – great for first-rate drinks and people-watching. Breakfast, while pricey, was spectacular and sets you up until dinnertime.

I also stayed at the Omni, located at California Plaza, near the Grand Central Market and downtown attractions. My comfortable room was massive and overlooked Angels Flight, the funicular railway – a staple movie backdrop.

The service at the Omni stood out and the breakfast avocado toast at its Noé restaurant put UK versions to shame and was almost too pretty to eat. Almost.

LA is famously vast and everything you have heard about its rush-hour traffic is true. Unlike London, where tourists rarely leave Zone 1, LA's attractions are spread out. Pre-planning which attractions can be visited on the same day is key.

Most visitors – particularly those enjoying a wider Californian trip – will hire a car. For part of my stay I did without and found a combination of public transport and ride-hailing apps worked well. (LA's public transport doesn't have a great reputation locally, but I personally found it OK).

The $11billion rail line from LAX to downtown is due to open for the World Cup and Metro extensions to Beverly Hills are being built. The bus network is more comprehensive than Metro, but unlike Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves in Speed, you definitely won't stay above 50mph for long…

Movie directors know a great ending sets up the sequel by leaving the audience wanting more. It is just the same with holidays and on that score LA absolutely delivered.

There is so much to see and do that you can only really scratch the surface in one trip.

And in the immortal words of former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger – “I'll be back”.","{'href': 'https://www.mirror.co.uk', 'title': 'The Mirror'}","soccer"

Real Madrid strolled past a much-changed Sociedad side as two Bernabeu legends marked their farewells with three points

Kylian Mbappe scored twice and Luka Modric received a wonderful farewell as Real Madrid strolled to a 2-0 win over Real Sociedad that will be remembered more for the occasion than the result. Carlo Ancelotti was also able to deliver a victory in his final game in charge before he leaves the Liga giants and takes over as Brazil head coach.

Indeed, the game felt like a procession from the first minute. Madrid had nothing to play for, and it showed. They had most of the ball, without doing much with it and it was a stroke of luck that gave them the lead after a VAR-aided decision saw Los Blancos handed a very soft penalty. Mbappe stepped up, had his first effort saved but tucked the rebound home with ease - his 30th goal of the league season.

It was otherwise a relatively quiet affair. Madrid probed for opportunities, the excellent Arda Guler finding pockets of space and sharp angles. La Real, who benched some of their main men, occasionally threatened without ever truly looking like they would score.

Mbappe made it two after 84 minutes, smashing one in at the near post after a fine pass from the returning Vinicius Junior but the game will ultimately be remembered for the man who was subbed off late on, a guard of honour greeting Modric as he strolled off the Bernabeu pitch for the final time.

Novak Djokovic was competing in his second ATP Tour final of the year

A battling Novak Djokovic made another bit of tennis history as he clinched his 100th ATP singles title with a comeback victory over Hubert Hurkacz in Geneva.

Serbia's Djokovic, who has won almost all there is in tennis, is just the third man in the Open era to achieve the feat after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer.

The 38-year-old had won all seven of his previous matches against Poland's Hurkacz but had to grind out victory this time around, coming from a break down in the third set to win 5-7 7-6 (7-2) 7-6 (7-2).

Djokovic's children ran onto court afterwards to congratulate their father, with wife Jelena watching in the stands.

""I had to work for it, that's for sure,"" he admitted. ""Hubi was probably closer to the victory the entire match than I was.

""An incredible match with a full stadium, a beautiful atmosphere. I'm just grateful to clinch the 100th here.""

Victory also gave Djokovic some welcome time on the clay, with the French Open beginning on Sunday.

He arrived in Geneva without a win on the surface, having lost his first match in four of his past five tournaments.

A relieved Djokovic now travels to Paris - where he will face American Mackenzie McDonald in the first round - with his bid for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title firmly on track.

However, it remains to be seen how quickly he will recover from a final lasting three hours and eight minutes.

This is Djokovic's first title since Olympic gold in Paris last year - and marks a high point in a difficult year for the tennis great.

His run to the Australian Open semi-finals was ended by injury before his first attempt to claim his 100th title was ended by Czech teenager Jakub Mensik in the Miami Open showpiece.

The clay season has been particularly tricky as Djokovic lost his opening matches in Monte Carlo and Madrid in straight sets before opting out of the Italian Open.

A split with coach Andy Murray followed, but deciding to take a wildcard to Geneva has paid off as Djokovic has improved in each match, with his serving and returning in particular going up a notch. 

Much of the packed crowd in Geneva were on his side and it was the Serb who had the first break opportunities at 2-2.

But Hurkacz, a big server making his way back to form after a serious knee injury at Wimbledon last year, produced aces and service winners at the crucial times to keep him at bay.

In truth, it was Djokovic's errors, rather than excellent play from his opponent, that decided the first set. Serving to force a tie-break, an unfortunate net cord gave Hurkacz his first break point of the set - and a dreadful double fault from Djokovic handed it over.

Every Hurkacz service game of the second set seemed to go to deuce, with Djokovic constantly pushing for an opening, but his uncharacteristic errors allowed his 28-year-old opponent to wriggle free - much to Djokovic's wry amusement.

The Serb upped his level in the tie-break, smashing a winner to force a deciding set, but it was Hurkacz who broke at the start of the third.

Service games rattled by from both players before the Pole played a dreadful game at 4-3 up. With Hurkacz's body tight and arm full of tension, an error handed Djokovic the break back, with the world number six shaking his racquet in celebration.

A tie-break felt almost inevitable and once again, Djokovic ran away with it, before sealing the success with an ace.

The two shared a warm hug at the net before a visibly upset Hurkacz covered his head with his towel as the victor thanked the crowd.

Novak Djokovic won his 100th ATP title in his storied career on Saturday at the Geneva Open, moving alongside two of the all-time legends of the sport in the process. 

Djokovic defeated Hubert Hurkacz, who hadn't dropped a set in Geneva prior to the final, and needed to come back from a set down to do so. Djokovic required tiebreakers in both of the final two sets to pull off the upset. While he only managed to break one serve from Hurkacz, he made it count in the final set to push it to a tiebreak, which he won 7-2 to claim his 100th career title.

In doing so, Djokovic became just the third man to win 100 titles, joining Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103), further cementing his legacy as one of the game's all-time greats. 

Even prior to a thrilling three-set battle in the tournament final, Djokovic had to fight through a bit of a scare to overcome Cameron Norrie on Friday in the semifinals. Djokovic won a tightly contested first set 6-4 before Norrie came roaring back in the second to take the set 7-6 (8-6), surviving a Djokovic match point to force a third. While it seemed as though Norrie had the momentum, Djokovic showed flashes of his formerly dominant self, running Norrie all over the court before taking the win with a dominant 6-1 final set. 

Thursday saw Djokovic celebrate his 38th birthday by defeating Matteo Arnaldi in the tournament quarterfinals. The win over Arnaldi helped exorcise the ghost of a loss in the same matchup in Djokovic's first match at April's ATP Masters 1000 Madrid. The Madrid loss was the second consecutive tournament in which Djokovic went out in his first match.

The quest for his 100th title was a rocky one for Djokovic. He captured title 99 by winning gold in the 2024 Olympics, but the momentum did not carry forward. Since the Olympics, Djokovic had reached just two finals prior to the Geneva Open while exiting in his first match of four tournaments. 

Now he enters the French Open no longer burdened by the pursuit of title No. 100 and will be looking to prove himself as still being a threat in grand slam competition as the No. 6 seed at Roland Garros.

The 24-time Grand Slam champion, playing in Switzerland to warm up for the French Open, missed a match point in the second set before eventually winning 6-4, 6-7(6), 6-1.

""It was the toughest match of the tournament for me so far, three sets,"" said Djokovic.

""(In) the second set, he was a break up and I managed to come back to the tie-break, (I had) a match point, I got a little bit tight there. 

""But I'm really glad how I regrouped in the third and played the best set of the tournament.""

Djokovic will attempt to secure his first tournament victory since winning Olympic gold in Paris last summer when he faces Poland's Hubert Hurkacz in Saturday's final.

He is aiming to become only the third player to reach a century of ATP titles after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer.

The 38-year-old is playing in his first event since splitting from his coach and old rival, Andy Murray.

He also lost both of his previous matches on clay this season before this week, but appears to be finding form ahead of the start of Roland Garros on Sunday.

Djokovic will start his bid for a fourth French Open triumph and record-breaking 25th Grand Slam singles title when he faces American Mackenzie McDonald in the first round.

On Friday, he took the first set against former Wimbledon semi-finalist Norrie courtesy of a break in the seventh game.

The Serb battled back from 5-2 down in the second set to force a tie-break, but saw a match point come and go as Britain's Norrie sent the tie into a decider.

But Djokovic raced into a 3-0 lead in the third, losing just one point across those first three games.

He closed it out on his second match point after another run of three straight games.

Novak Djokovic made history by winning his 100th tour-level title at the Geneva Open on Saturday to send out a warning to his French Open rivals.

Djokovic finally secured a century of titles by beating Hubert Hurkacz 5-7 7-6 (7-2) 7-6 (7-2) to triumph at the clay-court ATP 250.

Djokovic, who turned 38 on Thursday, rallied from 2-4 in the deciding set before sealing victory after three hours, five minutes - the longest match of the tournament.

""I had to work for it, that's for sure,"" a relieved Djokovic said in an on-court interview before the ball boys and girls physically formed the number 100 in tribute at the presentation ceremony.

""Huby was probably closer to the victory the entire match than I was. I had some chances to break his serve in the first set, I didn't do it and then had a bad game that ended up with a double fault on set point.

""All of a sudden the match went to his side in a sense and I was obviously just trying to hang in there.

""I don't know how I broke his serve, he probably broke himself in the third when he was 4-3 up but this is what happens on this level, the highest level, a few points decide the winner.

""An incredible match, 7-6 in the third with a full stadium, beautiful atmosphere. So I'm just grateful to clinch the 100th here.""

Djokovic lost his two previous finals since his 99th title win nine months ago at the Paris Olympics at Roland-Garros - at the Shanghai Masters to Jannik Sinner last year, and the Miami Masters to Jakob Mensik in March.

He also suffered immediate exits from previous clay-court events in Madrid and Monte Carlo.

Djokovic joins tennis greats Jimmy Connors, who has a record 109 titles, and Roger Federer on 103 as the only men with a century of tournament wins in the Open era.

2006 Amersfoort (clay ATP 250)Djokovic wins career title No 1 against Nicolas Massu
2025 Geneva (clay ATP 250)Djokovic wins career title No 100 against Hubert Hurkacz, whose coach is Nicolas Massu

Another painful defeat looked on the cards when he served two double faults to lose his serve in the opening game of the final set, but Hurkacz played an error-strewn eighth game to allow Djokovic to level at 4-4.

More costly errors from the big-serving Pole then allowed Djokovic to ease through the tie-break and complete the perfect preparation for his bid to win a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title in the French Open.

The three-time French Open champion now heads back to Paris where he is in first-round action at Roland-Garros on Monday against American Mackenzie McDonald.

Zachary Cohen dives into his tournament futures for the 2025 French Open. 

The second major of the 2025 tennis season is here. The French Open officially begins on Sunday, May 25th, when Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek will start to think about defending last year's titles. Keep reading for some tournament futures for the action in Paris, and make sure you come back to VSiN for daily tennis best bets. I'll be handicapping the men's and women's action all throughout the event. Also, make sure you're checking out the picks page for all of my action for smaller tournaments and Challengers. Gill Alexander will also be dishing out his favorite picks on that page, but make sure you catch his analysis on A Numbers Game — which is on Monday to Friday on our live VSiN programming. We cover everything here at VSiN, which is why we're known as “The Sports Betting Network.” Tennis is a big part of that, so subscribe now and get ready for a fun summer. 

Aryna Sabalenka To Win Quarter 1 (-140 – 2.5 units): I had Sabalenka to win her quarter in Rome, where I thought she had a pretty easy draw. The Belarusian had Marta Kostyuk and Qinwen Zheng in her quarter at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, and she ultimately got eliminated by Zheng in the quarters. But I'm going right back to this play, and I'm expecting a similar run. Sabalenka's toughest opponent on the way to the quarterfinals will likely be Danielle Collins, and I'm just not sure the American can beat the three-time Grand Slam champion on this surface. And if Sabalenka does get by Collins, she should beat Clara Tauson or Amanda Anisimova to set up a rematch with Zheng. Well, Sabalenka had a 6-0 record against Zheng before losing to the 22-year-old in the Eternal City, and I just don't think that edge is gone. Sabalenka played a sloppy match in Rome, and she probably was just a little tired and unfocused after a title run in Madrid. Meanwhile, Zheng played an incredible match in that one, and her serve was especially on. She won 82.4% of her first serve points in that match, which is well above her season-long first serve points won percentage of 69.9%. That doesn't feel like something Zheng will be able to replicate, and Sabaleka should level up on the bigger stage. 

Coco Gauff To Win Quarter 4 (-140 – 2.5 units) & Win Tournament (+550 – 1.5 units): Gauff made the finals in both Madrid and Rome, and she did that without reaching her top level. The American was running hot and cold as a server, and her forehand was a bit leaky — as it always seems to be. However, Gauff has now proven that she can make deep runs at big tournaments without playing her best. That said, I trust her to emerge from one of the weakest quarters there is on the men's or women's sides. The toughest opponents Gauff will face before the quarterfinals should be either Anna Kalinskaya or Barbora Krejcikova. Kalinskaya just pulled out of Strasbourg, so her health is a question mark. And Krejcikova has been in witness protection since winning Wimbledon last year. So, Gauff should really have no problem at least setting up a match to reach the semis, and I'd like her chances against whoever she sees there. That's why I'm putting a big play on Gauff to win the quarter. But I'm also going a few steps further with a sizable play on Gauff to win the tournament. I would love the American's chances in a semi-final showdown with Mirra Andreeva, who she has beaten in straight sets twice in the last three weeks. And even if you don't like Gauff to beat Sabalenka, or whoever else, in the final, you'll like having a +550 ticket to play with in that match. 

Beatriz Haddad Maia To Reach Quarterfinals (+700 – 0.5 units): I'm taking a chance on Haddad Maia to reach the quarterfinals. The Brazilian has had a terrible season, as she's just 6-15 since the start of 2025. However, Haddad Maia has always been a good clay-court player. Haddad Maia is 44-35 on the surface in her career, and she's 12-7 in the 19 matches she has played at Roland Garros. Haddad Maia also made good use of the week before this tournament. Instead of just heading to Paris in awful form, Haddad Maia went to work on her game and find some confidence in Strasbourg. In that tournament, she beat Clara Tauson, Ashlyn Krueger and Emma Navarro. Tauson and Navarro are both top-25 players, and Navarro could be one of Haddad Maia's opponents this week. Also, Haddad Maia put up a real fight in a 7-6 (7), 1-6, 6-2 loss to Elena Rybakina in the semifinals. It just feels like she has snapped back into form, and a confident Haddad Maia can make a run in this tournament. If she beats Hailey Baptiste in the opening round, don't be surprised if she does some damage. 

NOTE: In the name of transparency, I should mention that I also have 3 units on Swiatek to win this tournament at +110 from a couple of months ago. I thought Swiatek would have an awesome clay-court season, silence all of her doubters and be the odds-on favorite to win her fifth title in Paris. I now feel terrible about that ticket, as Swiatek played poorly on the dirt and is out there to win this at +430 odds. I still won't rule out the possibility of the Pole winning — she has done so in four of the last five years and is still capable of reaching the highest level on clay of anybody on the WTA Tour — but her draw is miserable. 

Jannik Sinner To Win Tournament (+250 – 2 units): I jumped on Sinner to win this tournament in the opening set of his beatdown of Casper Ruud in Rome. Unfortunately, you're not going to be able to find +250. However, there is a +220 out there. At that number, I'd still be jumping to back the Italian. Sinner answered a lot of questions in Rome, where he showed that he's not particularly rusty, he's in good shape and that his game translates well to clay. That last one wasn't a big concern for me heading into the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, but there were people that doubted him on the surface — despite the fact that he looked strong before getting hurt during the 2024 clay-court swing. There are only two questions that Sinner needs to answer now: Can he snap a four-match losing streak to Carlos Alcaraz, and can he do it on the Spaniard's favorite surface? I think he can. 

In the Rome final, Sinner had two break points to win Set 1, but he wasn't able to cash in on either of them. I'm confident that with a little more time on court, he should be able to do a bit better in big moments. While Sinner doesn't look rusty, he hasn't played a big-time match like that in a while. He should be more prepared next time. Also, Sinner's forehand was a mess in that final, with TennisViz and Tennis Data Innovations giving him his second-lowest forehand Shot Quality (7.6) since the start of 2024. I don't see that happening again. Sinner's forehand is the biggest weapon in tennis. And if Sinner is hitting the ball as well as he's capable of, that should make up for the difference in movement between these two. I also don't think Alcaraz is capable of reaching the same level he reached against Sinner in that final. Alcaraz has proven that he's an up-and-down player, but it was all up throughout that one. His shot selection was perfect, and his game plan was on point. I have serious doubts about whether he can play that smart of a match against Sinner again. I actually think Sinner has a better coaching team around him. 

Novak Djokovic To Win Quarter 2 (+250): For more on why I'm backing Djokovic to win Quarter 2, check out the feature I wrote on the 24-time Grand Slam champion!

Lorenzo Musetti To Win Quarter 3 (+180 – 2.5 units): Gill Alexander, Drew Dinsick and I all love Musetti to win Quarter 3. None of us spoke before Gill's Beating The Book French Open MegaPod, but we all lit up when we got to talking about this portion of the draw. Musetti is coming off three semi-final runs in clay-court 1000s, and he looked awesome in all of them. Musetti just has a tremendous ability to cover the court, pound the ball with heavy topspin from both wings and just make magic happen. Now, the Italian is getting better and better at constructing points, and his mental toughness continues to improve. Musetti is just clearly a top-tier clay-courter, and his playing style should make him very difficult to beat in a best-of-five setting. So, with Holger Rune and Taylor Fritz being the two highest-seeded players outside of him in Quarter 3, it's worth putting a pretty big play on Musetti to make the semifinals. Both of those players have serious limitations and concerns heading into the event.

Yannick Noah Day is all about the kids – and the tennis!

It's just after 10am at Roland-Garros. They have arrived in large numbers, wide-eyed and switched-on, snaking through the turnstiles for a day with their friends, family and… heroes. 

Welcome to Roland-Garros charity day, created in 1977 and renamed Yannick Noah Day in 2023. Here, in the spirit of France's last Grand Slam men's singles champion, dreams will be cultivated.

Come, take a tour with us and realise your dream vicariously. 

First stop, a walk across the grounds. Destination: Court Suzanne-Lenglen. 

There was a hearty round of applause inside the majestic arena for Caroline Garcia, the 31-year-old Frenchwoman who recently shared news that she will be playing at her home Grand Slam for the last time this year. 

As is the Yannick Noah Day custom on Lenglen, before practice Garcia lofted a ball into the crowd and the recipient of said ball became the lucky winner of: a hitting session with the former world No.4! 

Caroline Garcia with fans on Yannick Noah Day

An ambassador quickly whisked the winning girl away, what appeared to be her mum happily trailing the two as they walked up the steps and disappeared, on the way to pick up a proper racket. 

At the conclusion of practice, the 10-year-old with charming braids emerged courtside, cradling a Wilson racket and waiting expectantly while Garcia and Diane Parry finished their paces. Young kids have had worse days…

Quelle surprise, the jeune fille was equipped with a beautiful forehand; artful, with a looping backswing and a solid low-to-high swing path. Could she one day be the future of French tennis in the vein of Lenglen, Mauresmo, Pierce and Garcia? One can dream, especially on Yannick Noah Day.

The kid looked like she would have stayed out there for eternity, but the schedule is tight on this special day. Time for a quick photo with Garcia, and a nice round of applause. What a moment! 

Yannick Noah on court with a fan

It's not only Court Suzanne-Lenglen that creates a state of awe. All courts are open for business on this day of celebration. Everywhere one looks a star is putting their dazzling tennis on display, with awe-struck spectators captivated to see their heroes up close and personal. 

Casper Ruud battled Sebastian Baez on Court 12, while Karen Khachanov and Holger Rune went toe-to-toe on the iconic Court 14. 

On the opposite side of the grounds, Court 2 was dedicated to giving citizens a chance to grab a racket and make like their heroes.  

No professionals here, just young aspirants, permitted to play on the fabled terre battue. What could be better? Kids of all shapes and sizes, handed rackets and permitted to slide to their heart's content. Across the stands on Court 3, another grand event: a chance for everyone to experience the rigours of wheelchair tennis. Young ones take seats and an entirely new perspective on tennis, and life, appears. Enlightening to say the least.

“It's not easy to move, is it?” the emcee says to the kids. Indeed it is not.

Children try out wheelchair tennis

Next, a baguette, a sit-down and some people-watching. 

Here is a man in a striped shirt dipping a winged contraption into a bucket of soapy water. Soon, beautiful streams of bubbles are flowing and a gaggle of kids have everything they need to get lost in the moment. Tennis can wait for these young ones. 

When the man in the striped shirt pauses for his lunch break, the look of disappointment on the kids' faces is priceless. How dare he? Not to worry, they'll soon be entertained again. 

And again. 

Yannick Noah Day is a day to wander. A day to linger. A day to mingle with the ghosts of tennis past and present. 

With unlimited access to every court, curious minds can amble past ushers and get comfortable with every different vantage point that the show courts have to offer. This intrepid scribe quickly gravitated to the top of the tribunes on the west side of Court Suzanne-Lenglen for the first time to find: voila! The view is fantastic! From there, one can look over the edge and take a birds-eye view of Roland-Garros in all its glory.

Bubbles galore

During one serendipitous moment we turn to catch a glimpse of Grigor Dimitrov and Jannik Sinner on Court 9. They were strutting their stuff in front of a packed audience, and just a smidge to the right, Frances Tiafoe was on Court 8. 

Further west, one could spot ‘Minister of Happiness' Ons Jabeur and Elise Mertens tagging groundstrokes on Court 7, while across the alley 2025 Australian Open champion Madison Keys hit on Court 6.

All this from one vantage point, high in the sky. Tennis heaven!

As Sinner left his practice court, a massive swarm of autograph seekers surrounded him, tilting their giant yellow tennis balls in his direction. Young children, granted temporary reprieve from their parents, scurried past me in the top row and strained to see, profiting from our shared slice of tennis heaven. 

So many kids! So many smiles! A multitude of Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ‘Oles!', not yet booming, sometimes too timid, but clearly destined for the big-time. 

At the end of the day, we trek back the length of the grounds to get to Lenglen for one last look. There is Daniil Medvedev, ready for his 5pm practice session. Another ball lofted into a sea of spectators with good news soon to come…","{'href': 'https://www.rolandgarros.com', 'title': 'Roland-Garros'}","tennis"

French Open

Can Iga Świątek make women's tennis history?

Will her idol, Rafael Nadal, get the tribute his success deserves?

Is this the denouement for line judges on tennis courts?

And is the most important thing in play in Paris the weather forecast?

The 2025 French Open promises to be a cracker. Here, The Athletic's tennis writers, Matthew Futterman and Charlie Eccleshare, chart some of the key storylines to follow over the next fortnight.

At this point, Iga Świątek probably isn't thinking about becoming the first woman in the Open Era to win four consecutive French Opens. She likely just wants to get to the second week the way she's been playing of late.

The thing about Świątek's pursuit of history, though, is that she's already made plenty of it. She has four French Opens already. She's one of the best women ever on clay. Chris Evert thinks she will break her record of seven Roland Garros titles, and if she were to never play the tournament again, Świątek would already be in statue territory.

So the question this year is two-pronged: Can she find her form and cement her reputation as maybe the most untouchable woman on red clay, given that Evert played in a far smaller world when tennis was far less competitive. It's an argument Evert makes anytime Świątek's greatness comes up — and those two prongs go hand in hand.

Word is that her form makes the French Open more open on the women's side than it has been since 2020, but the problem with that argument is that any of the big favorites for the title will have to beat Świątek in the semifinals (Aryna Sabalenka) or the final (Coco Gauff) if she gets that far. If she does, she is likely to be in the imperious form that has seen her dominate here. A draw can look very open, until it's closed.

Matthew Futterman

The French Open is the only Grand Slam to resist the appeal of electronic line calling (ELC), with Wimbledon to abandon 147 years of history by ditching line judges for this summer's event.

It's also the most prestigious clay-court event that entrusts humans with calling the lines, as ELC is now mandatory at ATP and mixed events, which encompass all the clay-court events at 1,000-level, one rung below the Grand Slams.

ELC is at the center of a philosophical quandary for players, because the technology — which allots for the amount of clay on the court and the speed of trajectory of the ball as it bounces — can come into conflict with the language players have been using to interpret clay-court shots as in or out for years: ball marks.

This has led to several disagreements between players and umpires, with some players taking a photo of the mark to “prove” that the technology is wrong.

In theory, those players should welcome umpires getting off their chairs to inspect marks. But as tournaments before ELC showed, they are more likely to end up arguing with them about which mark is correct and whether or not that mark is touching a line. The vast majority of players are in favour of ELC, even the ones who grouse about calls that have gone against them.

When explaining the decision to retain line judges, French Tennis Federation (FFT) president Gilles Moretton said in April that the nation's “pride” at being “the best country for providing referees on the circuit” was part of the thought process.

Those officials will have to make good on that claim over the next couple of weeks, as they deal with a group of players so used to machines that they will be expecting close to perfection.

Charlie Eccleshare

Rafael Nadal won this tournament 14 times. So why shouldn't Roland Garros send him off for a third time?

The last two were awkward. They came after early, one-sided defeats to Alexander Zverev and Novak Djokovic in last year's French Open and the Olympics, yet more illustrations of how finding the right moment to exit the biggest stages in the sport is nearly impossible.

Sunday night's ceremony on Court Philippe-Chatrier should be better. Nadal won't have to endure the ovations in sweaty clothes while still angry and depressed after a loss. The 14-time champion, who recently declared that he does not miss tennis because he left it behind satisfied with his achievements, will be the star of his show.

Perhaps the tournament will dedicate a statue to him on the grounds? Oh, wait… it already did that.

Matt Futterman

A Grand Slam wouldn't be a Grand Slam nowadays without some sort of political machinations going on in the background, and this year's French Open is no different.

On Thursday at Roland Garros, as well as learning who they would be facing in the first round, a group of the world's best players were meeting with executives from the four Grand Slams. They were there to follow up on a letter they'd sent in March, calling for a greater share of tournament revenue. That letter was signed by the world's top 10 players on the ATP and WTA side. As well as asking for a more equitable revenue split, it asked for a greater say in how the sport was run.

These points, and a request for the majors to make financial contributions to welfare programmes, such as pensions and healthcare, were all raised by the handful of players present in Thursday's meeting. The Grand Slams will review the points raised and report back to the players.

Backroom negotiations have become a recurring theme at the biggest events over the last few years — whether it's the ongoing battle between the governing bodies and the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), or the discussions over whether to hold a men's event in Saudi Arabia.

Charlie Eccleshare

Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Andrey Rublev may yet find the glory they have been seeking. But time is running out and they've been heading in the wrong direction.

All except Tsitsipas are 27 or older, and Tsitsipas will be 27 in three months. They have been top-10 mainstays for years. Only Zverev is still there — and he hasn't played top-10 tennis for months. In a news conference ahead of the French Open, Tsitsipas was sanguine about the challenges ahead, especially compared with what he faced a few years back.

“I feel like the lineup right now is much more difficult than it was back then,” he said.

“Players are so much more mature. Shots have changed. Players have second forehands in this moment. They're playing with two forehands almost. I have to adapt my game.”

Medvedev said the longevity of Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic colored expectations.

“If we take them out, I feel like a lot of players after getting closer to 30 or after 30 maybe drop their level, then maybe come back,” he said in a news conference. “It's just the physical part of something getting to us. Maybe it's something else.”

Regardless, with each passing Slam, their chances of winning one dim.

Nadal believes that playing clay-court matches at night is a sin. The French Open night session is a fixture of the tournament, so no dice there, but his belief is a gateway into understanding a Grand Slam, which is affected by the weather more than any other: not because rain stops play, but because rain hits clay.

A grey, dank evening at Roland Garros exists in another universe than a hot, sunny afternoon. A matchup can swing based on atmospheric conditions, and if a match goes long, it can evolve through different weather conditions and change character completely.

At last year's event, heavy rain in the first few days played havoc with the schedule and turned matches into a sludgy, heavy affair. Later in the event, the sun came out, and the balls were kicking off the red clay and spinning out of players' strike zones once more.

So check the weather at Roland Garros, not only to understand if an umbrella will be required.

Naqi Rizvi loves the “absolute freedom” he feels on the tennis court

LONDON — Naqi Rizvi loves the “absolute freedom” he feels on the tennis court.

Winning titles is fun, too.

The 34-year-old blind tennis champion is on a mission to not only raise awareness but also elevate the sport into the Paralympics .

“That would be the dream, and I'd love to be the first Paralympic champion if I can,” Rizvi said.

The London resident, fully blind from the age of 7 because of congenital glaucoma, only took up the sport a decade ago and is now the No. 1-ranked men's player in the world for his category.

Also an avid runner, Rizvi has completed two marathons and although jogging with a guide is great, tennis offers more.

“On a tennis court, I have absolute freedom because I know where the boundaries are, no one needs to tell me which way to turn, I don't need to have a cane or anything of this sort,” he told The Associated Press during a practice session at the National Tennis Center in southwest London.

“It's just the absolute sense of freedom to know that I can run comfortably, make my own decisions, and then be able to play points or rallies. It's just incredible.”

The rules are basically the same as mainstream tennis just with smaller dimensions and slightly lower net. Tactile lines are taped onto the court so players like Rizvi can feel the boundaries. Depending on the level of visual impairment, you are allowed up to three bounces of the ball. The foam ball contains a bell so players can audibly track it.

“What I find interesting about blind tennis is it's incredibly technical,” said Rizvi, who also possesses a big serve.

The problem-solving aspect of the sport is something Rizvi enjoys — no surprise given that he studied engineering at University College London.

“You really need to anticipate after you've heard the first bounce where the second and third will be,” he said. “You obviously can't see how your opponent has hit the ball, so it's a lot of anticipation and a lot of practice and getting used to different trajectories that the ball can take.

Rizvi didn't even know that tennis was an option until he visited Metro Blind Sport in London a decade ago. He was hooked right away.

“I can almost assure you that if you did a survey of blind and partially sighted people,” he said, “the majority of them wouldn't have any idea because it's not televised, it's not in any other mainstream events, so how are people supposed to find out?”

The Lawn Tennis Association supports a visually impaired program that includes practice sessions at the governing body's National Tennis Center. That's where Jack Draper, the world No. 5 player, tried out the different levels . The LTA also runs tournaments each year and sends “Team GB” to an international competition.

Rizvi noted that there's not much financial backing in the sport. There's no prize money at tournaments and players often fund their own travel.

“Unless you obviously have the visibility and the money behind it, it's really hard,” he said. “Governing bodies need to take a more active role and try and give parity to all forms of disability tennis not just the ones that have made it big like wheelchair tennis, for example.”

Rizvi, who is married and works in finance , originally represented his native Pakistan but for the past year has been part of England's program since gaining British citizenship. He discussed his childhood — his father is Pakistani and his mother is Indian — in a TEDx Talk he gave as a student at UCL.

Invented in Japan by Takei Miyoshi in 1984, blind tennis is played around the world. Last year's world championships in Italy were the largest to date with 117 players from 20 countries, the International Blind Tennis Association said.

Rizvi has won several national titles, a European championship, the world championship in 2023 — as well as gold that year at the ISBA World Games. He is also the two-time defending champion of the Play Your Way to Wimbledon tournament.

The International Paralympic Committee handbook spells out that the sport or discipline must be “widely and regularly practiced” in at least 32 countries and three continents.

“I really want it to be in the Paralympics,” Rizvi said, “but I also want this to be a mainstream sport which can be part of the ATP Tour, part of Grand Slam tournaments , just like wheelchair tennis has made such amazing leaps forward. I'd love for blind tennis to be there as well because it's definitely got the potential.

“It's got the countries, the continents, the people, the passion behind it.”

Nick Kyrgios, the tennis maverick, has been on a rollercoaster journey filled with injuries and setbacks. After a year off due to wrist surgery and a subsequent knee injury, his return to the court has been anything but smooth. Despite his struggles, Kyrgios announced his comeback to the French Open after an eight-year absence, aiming to team up with Jordan Thompson in the men's doubles.

However, just days before the tournament, a shocking revelation emerged – Kyrgios withdrew from the French Open doubles, leaving fans puzzled about his next move. This unexpected decision came after Jordan Thompson's regular partner faced a doping ban, prompting Kyrgios to reconsider his participation.

Known for his raw talent and controversial personality, Kyrgios remains a captivating figure in the tennis world. With a protected ranking of No. 21 at the Australian Open, he currently sits at No. 636 in the ATP rankings, reflecting the challenges he has faced in his comeback journey.

Despite his struggles, Kyrgios continues to chase his elusive dream of winning a Grand Slam singles title. His past achievements, including a doubles crown at the 2022 Australian Open and a runner-up finish at Wimbledon the same year, showcase his potential on the court.

As Kyrgios navigates through injuries and setbacks, the big question lingers – will he stage a triumphant comeback at Wimbledon? With uncertainty surrounding his next tournament appearance, fans are eager to see the enigmatic Australian back in action, defying the odds stacked against him.

Stay tuned for more updates on Nick Kyrgios' tennis journey as he battles adversity and strives to make his mark on the Grand Slam stage once again.

Once again, Novak Djokovic has made history.

Victory in the Geneva Open final on Saturday has seen him become just the third man in the Open Era to win 100 ATP titles, following in the footsteps of Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer.

Here, we look back at where Djokovic's staggering haul of trophies has come from.

Australian Open x 10 (2008, 2011-13, 2015-16, 2019-21, 2023)
Wimbledon x 7 (2011, 2014-15, 2018-22)
US Open x 4 (2011, 2015, 2018, 2023)
French Open x 3 (2016, 2021, 2023)

Djokovic has won 24 Grand Slam singles titles – both an Open Era and an all-time record for a male player.

The Serbian has won a record 10 Australian Open men's singles titles, while his haul of seven Wimbledon titles is only beaten by Federer in the Open Era.

Djokovic is the only man to have won all four Grand Slam titles on at least three occasions.

Paris Masters x 7 (2009, 2013-15, 2019, 2021, 2023)
Miami Open x 6 (2007, 2011-12, 2014-16)
Italian Open x 6 (2008, 2011, 2014-15, 2020, 2022)
Indian Wells x 5 (2008, 2011, 2014-16)
Canadian Open x 4 (2007, 2011-12, 2016)
Shanghai Masters x 4 (2012-13, 2015, 2018)
Cincinnati Open x 3 (2018, 2020, 2023)
Madrid Open x 3 (2011, 2016, 2019)
Monte Carlo Masters x 2 (2013, 2015)

Alongside holding the record for the most Grand Slam singles titles, Djokovic also holds the record for the most Masters 1000 titles.

Djokovic won his 40th and most recent Masters title in Paris in 2023, becoming the first man to win 40 Masters crowns – and the first to win seven titles at the Paris Indoors event.

The Serbian has also won six Miami Open and six Italian Open titles in his career, with five Indian Wells titles among his greatest successes.

He is the only man to triumph at all nine Masters 1000 events – and he's won all of them at least twice.

Year-End Championships: 2008, 2012-15, 2022-23

Djokovic is a seven-time champion at the ATP Finals, with a 15-year gap between his first and last triumphs at the year-end championships.

The 37-year-old holds the record for the most titles at the tournament, having moved ahead of Federer (6) with his most recent victory in 2023.

Olympic Gold: Paris 2024

Who could forget Djokovic's stunning triumph at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games last summer?

After suffering heartbreaking defeats in his four previous Olympic appearances, the Serbian finally struck gold by beating Carlos Alcaraz in an enthralling gold medal match.

Djokovic joins Agassi and Nadal in being one of just three men to have won all four Grand Slams and Olympic singles gold.

China Open x 6 (2009-10, 2012-15)

Vienna Open x 1 (2007)
Swiss Indoors x 1 (2009)
Japan Open x 1 (2019)
Astana Open x 1 (2022)

Djokovic has won 15 titles at ATP 500 level, with his most successful event being the China Open.

The former world No 1 is a six-time champion in Beijing and holds the most titles of any man at the event.

He is also a five-time champion at the Dubai Tennis Championships, while his most recent ATP 500 title came at the 2022 Astana Open.

Qatar Open x 2 (2016-17)
Serbian Open x 2 (2009, 2011)
Dutch Open x 1 (2006)
Moselle Open x 1 (2006)
Australian Hard Court Championships x 1 (2007)
Portugal Open x 1 (2007)
Eastbourne International x 1 (2017)
Belgrade Open x 1 (2021)
Tel Aviv Open x 1 (2022)
Adelaide International x 1 (2023)
Geneva Open x 1 (2025)

Finally, Djokovic has won 13 titles at ATP 250 tournaments, across a period spanning close to two decades – from title No 1 in 2006 to No 100 in 2025.

Djokovic's first-ever ATP title came at the 2006 Dutch Open, defeating Nicolas Massu 7-6(5), 6-4 to lift the title as a 19-year-old.

He has also twice won the Serbian Open on home soil, alongside winning the Belgrade Open 2 back in 2021.

Djokovic is also notably a two-time Qatar Open champion, with the event since having been upgraded to ATP 500 status.

The 38-year-old's triumph in Geneva was his first at the tournament, and makes him one of just three men to claim a century of titles in the Open Era.

The 2025 French Open is right around the corner, as the stars of the ATP Tour finish up their preparations in Paris.

Four months on from the year's first Major, the Australian Open, Grand Slam tennis is back.

Qualifying for the French Open has concluded, and everyone knows who they'll face in round one.

Six former Grand Slam champions, including Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner, and Carlos Alcaraz, will compete in the French capital.

That number was very nearly five, however, until one former US Open champion was handed a spot in the main draw at the final hour, as a Lucky Loser.

2014 US Open champion Marin Cilic entered Grand Slam qualifying for the first time in 18 years and made a strong start, advancing to the final round without dropping a set.

Unfortunately, he came unstuck in the final round of qualifying, losing in three sets 3-6, 6-4, 3-6, to South Africa's Lloyd Harris.

Cilic then began the anxious wait to see if he'd receive a spot in the main draw as a Lucky Loser.

Following Matteo Berrettini's French Open withdrawal, Cilic was granted a spot in the tournament at the last minute.

Taking Berrettini's place, Cilic will now get set to take on Italy's Flavio Cobolli in the first round.

Cobolli has been busy in the lead-up to Roland Garros and will compete in the Hamburg Open final against Andrey Rublev on Saturday, May 24.

Berrettini wasn't the only player to withdraw from the tournament, however, as Japan's Kei Nishikori pulled out, having suffered an injury in Geneva earlier in the week.

The former world number four was 3-3 for the year on clay, looking to make his presence felt at the event where he reached the quarterfinals in 2015, 2017, and 2019.

Nishikori had been drawn against world number two Alcaraz in the first round of the French Open, as fans anticipated a thrilling tie on Court Philippe Chatrier.

Instead, Nishikori will now rest up ahead of the grass court season and will perhaps watch from home as the man he played in his sole Major final takes to the court in Paris.

The 2014 US Open was one for the ages, as two men shook up the status quo in New York.

Nishikori and Cilic took to the court for their semi-final matches as afterthoughts, with few predicting them to put up a fight against Djokovic and Roger Federer.

But on Sunday, September 7, 2014, the two Grand Slam greats were left stunned on Arthur Ashe Stadium, as Nishikori and Cilic pulled off memorable upsets to reach their first Major final.

It was hard to predict who would come out on top in the final, but it certainly looked as though one player headed into Monday's championship match more fatigued than the other.

Nishikori's fatigue was evident in the final as the Croat overpowered him throughout.

Cilic won in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3, becoming the second Croatian player, after his coach Goran Ivanisevic, to win a Grand Slam title.

Nishikori never returned to a Major final, but Cilic did twice, coming up short on both occasions.

Entering the latter stages of their careers, Nishikori and Cilic are both unlikely to return to Grand Slam finals or the top five, as they currently sit outside the ATP top 50 (Nishikori – 62nd, Cilic – 104th).

Nishikori is currently scheduled to appear in a clay court Challenger Tour event in Prostejov, Czechia, which begins on June 2, but is likely to withdraw and turn his attentions to grass.

Cilic will begin his French Open campaign against Cobolli in the first round on Tuesday, May 27.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Frances Tiafoe says what is absolutely ‘horrendous' on the ATP Tour in every tournament but the US Open","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/frances-tiafoe-says-what-is-absolutely-horrendous-on-the-atp-tour-in-every-tournament-but-the-us-open/","Sat, 24 May 2025 17:00:00 GMT","

Frances Tiafoe has struggled to find any consistent form in 2025 and has reached just one quarterfinal this season.

The 27-year-old began the year with a disappointing second-round exit at the Australian Open.

Second-round defeats became a theme over the coming months, as Tiafoe held an underwhelming 4-4 record across his next four tournaments.

Bouncing back in Houston, Tiafoe reached his first final of the season, coming up short against fellow American Jenson Brooksby.

Unable to carry that momentum forward, Tiafoe won just four of his next nine matches ahead of the French Open.

Speaking before his first round match in Paris, the world number 15 has revealed what he finds ‘horrendous' on the ATP Tour at every event bar the US Open.

During his pre-tournament press conference, Tiafoe was asked for his thoughts on the tennis balls used on the ATP Tour after several players made complaints recently.

“I think that's an excuse,” he said.

“I think all of the balls are horrendous, other than the US Open balls, to be honest with you.

“I don't really care, I'm not a balls guy, all I do know is that the balls at the US Open feel unbelievable, for whatever reason, that's the only ball I really like.

“But I don't really notice it that much, it's not like I lose a match, and I'm like ‘Oh my god, the balls'. The other guy plays with the same balls too, so what's the difference?

“Tennis players are not afraid to make excuses. At the end of the day, are things going to change? No. Are we going to have just one ball on tour? Probably not in my career. Just play. The other guy is playing with them too, it's not really important.”

World number three Alexander Zverev said the balls were a ‘joke' recently, after losing to Lorenzo Musetti at the Italian Open.

“Balls were a joke today,” said Zverev.

“Generally speaking, this is a subject we've had over the last three, four years now. Players are talking about it all the time. They say we play with the same ball in Monaco, Madrid, Munich.

“Then we come here and the ball is totally different. The ball is very, very big. It's very difficult to hit winners here. It's just how it is these days.

“For me, for my game style, today was not easy because at the end of the day I'm still somebody that tries to play aggressive.”

Looking past the tennis ball ‘controversy' Tiafoe assessed his level going into the French Open.

“I feel like I can beat anybody on any specific day, I've just got to get myself in alignment mentally, and just have fun,” he said.

“Last tournament on clay, which I get really excited about, then we get on the real stuff, the grass and then the summer hardcourts, where tennis actually matters.”

“No matter what I'm ranked, I feel like I'm one of the best players out here. Period.”

Tiafoe hinted at his love for the US Open when he said that's when ‘tennis actually matters', but how has he actually performed at the four Grand Slam events?

The 27-year-old has enjoyed the majority of his success at Flushing Meadows, reaching the semi-finals on two occasions (2022 and 2024).

At Roland Garros, Tiafoe has won just four career matches, all four of which have come since 2022.

The American will no doubt hope to improve upon his record in 2025, when he takes on Roman Safiullin in the first round.

Tiafoe and Safiullin have played once before on the ATP Tour, at the 2024 Shanghai Masters, when the Russian advanced to the last 16 with a tight three-set win.

Furious with a time violation given to him at 5-5 in the deciding set tiebreaker, the American unloaded on the umpire after the match.

Tiafoe was fined $120,000 for his behavior in Shanghai, as he'll no doubt hope to have better control of his emotions when he takes on Safiullin for a second time.

Safiullin and Tiafoe will face off for a place in the second round of the French Open on Sunday, May 25.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Coverage: Live radio commentary on BBC 5 Sports Extra, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app

This year's French Open is going to feel rather strange to begin with.

It is the first Roland Garros since Rafael Nadal - the man who won 14 singles titles and is synonymous with the tournament - retired.

His abdication means there is a chance for a new 'King of Clay' to be crowned.

Spain's Carlos Alcaraz has long been the heir apparent and goes into this year's event as the slight favourite.

The 22-year-old defending champion is a natural clay-courter with a 15-1 win-loss record on the surface this year - and, perhaps crucially, more match practice than rival Jannik Sinner.

Italy's Sinner is the other standout candidate.

The world number one has dominated over the past 18 months but only recently returned from a three-month doping ban.

Sinner dropped just one set in reaching the Italian Open final, including a ruthless quarter-final thrashing of two-time French Open finalist Casper Ruud.

But Sinner was put in check by world number two Alcaraz in the final, with many expecting a repeat of it in the Paris showpiece on 8 June.

If it isn't a battle royale between Alcaraz and Sinner then it is difficult to look beyond the other leading seeds.

Novak Djokovic is bidding again for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam singles title but the Serb great, who turned 38 on Thursday, has looked short of motivation recently.

However, a welcome run to the Geneva final could be the boost the three-time Paris champion needs.

British number one Jack Draper demonstrated his clay-court credentials, reaching the Madrid final and Rome quarter-finals - suggesting he is capable of reaching at least the fourth round for the third successive major.

Norwegian seventh seed Ruud, who lost to Nadal and Djokovic in the 2022 and 2023 finals, reiterated his clay-court expertise by beating Draper to win the Madrid title.

And don't forget German third seed and last year's runner-up Alexander Zverev. 

Zverev has reached at least the semi-finals in the past four editions in Paris and is regaining confidence after again falling short of a first Grand Slam title in January.

Italy's Lorenzo Musetti - an elegant player with a one-handed backhand - also has the natural ability on clay to mount a challenge.

Along with Draper, Jacob Fearnley and Cameron Norrie have direct entry into the main draw.

Fearnley, 23, will make his French Open debut after a stunning rise over the past year for the former Texas Christian University student.

Ranked 53rd in the world after less than a year as a professional, he played his first ATP Tour clay match in April and has won 8 of his 13 matches since.

Former world number eight Norrie, by contrast, has dropped down the rankings, but had a welcome run to the Geneva Open semi-finals in the days before Roland Garros.

In doubles, Britain's Henry Patten and Finn partner Harri Heliovaara are aiming for their third Grand Slam title together in 12 months, having won Wimbledon and the Australian Open.

Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski are also in the draw, alongside Jamie Murray and American partner Rajeev Ram.

Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid will compete in the wheelchair singles and doubles, with Andy Lapthorne in the quad singles.

Flavio Cobolli won the biggest title of his career on Saturday at the Bitpanda Hamburg Open, where he overcame third seed Andrey Rublev 6-2, 6-4 to capture the ATP 500 trophy in Germany.

The Italian played aggressively, showed great athleticism to handle Rublev's power and handled the pressure in the closing stages. He fended off two break points when serving for the match at 5-4 in the second set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to triumph. After sealing victory, Cobolli collapsed to the ground before he rose to embrace Rublev and the packed crowd.






""I think it is the best moment and match of my life for sure,"" Cobolli said. ""I have to say sorry to Andrey because today I played unbelievable. I am so happy and proud of myself. I can see my family, friends, brother and girlfriend here and it is a surprise.
""I am really happy. I passed many battles this year and this kind of day is good for your mind. I am so happy. I just want to [lift] the trophy.""

Former champion Rublev was chasing his second title of the season after winning in Doha. Rublev had slipped to No. 17 in the PIF ATP Rankings after being unable to defend his points at the ATP Masters 1000 in Madrid earlier this month, but responded well with an final showing in Hamburg.
The 27-year-old, who is up two spots to No. 15 in the Live ATP Rankings, was overpowered in the baseline exchanges against Cobolli, hitting 16 (10-26) fewer winners than the Italian during the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Roland Garros draw: Swiatek finds Raducanu, Ostapenko, Rybakina in her path","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4271414/roland-garros-draw-swiatek-finds-raducanu-ostapenko-rybakina-in-her-path","Sat, 24 May 2025 11:06:13 GMT","

With all of the Top 75 players entered and the full draw revealed, the 2025 French Open promises big-name battles, comeback arcs and an open race to the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen.

The 2025 Roland Garros draw is out, and defending champion Iga Swiatek faces a difficult path in her quest for a fifth Coupe Suzanne Lenglen trophy. 

Seeded No. 5, her lowest at a Slam since the 2022 Australian Open, Swiatek hasn't reached a final since winning the trophy in Paris last year. She opens against Rebecca Sramkova, with a possible second-round match against either Emma Raducanu or Wang Xinyu. No. 26 seed Marta Kostyuk looms in the third round, while potential fourth-round opponents include No. 12 Elena Rybakina and No. 21 Jelena Ostapenko -- who holds a 6-0 record against Swiatek.

Swiatek is in the same quarter of the draw as No. 4 seed and last year's runner-up Jasmine Paolini, fresh off her second WTA 1000 title in Rome. They are in the same half of the draw as No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka, who opens against Kamilla Rakhimova. Sabalenka has also landed in a section full of landmines: No. 27 seed Leylah Fernandez, Danielle Collins or Olga Danilovic could be third-round opponents, while either No. 16 seed Amanda Anisimova or No. 22 seed Clara Tauson could await in the last 16. Sabalenka is projected to face No. 8 seed Zheng Qinwen, her conqueror in Rome last week, in the quarterfinals.

No. 2 seed Coco Gauff opens against Olivia Gadecki and is projected to face Australian Open champion and No. 7 seed Madison Keys in the quarterfinals. No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula and No. 6 seed Mirra Andreeva head the third quarter, which contains another popcorn first round between No. 10 seed Paula Badosa and former World No. 1 Naomi Osaka.

For the first time in her career, Sabalenka arrives in Paris as the best player in the world -- by some distance. She has won a tour-leading three titles this season so far, including a third trophy in Madrid three weeks ago. She's the reigning US Open champion, and was also a finalist at the Australian Open in January. Can she convert that dominance into a first Roland Garros title?

Her quarter contains a number of dangerous players with a variety of records against Sabalenka. She's dominated the head-to-head against Collins 7-0, but trails Anisimova 5-2. A potential third round against Fernandez would be their first meeting since the Canadian memorably upset Sabalenka in the 2021 US Open semifinals. Tauson and Zheng both defeated her in their most recent encounters this year, in Dubai and Rome respectively.

Zheng will have to navigate a few players of note to make her potential quarterfinal date with Sabalenka. She takes on 2021 runner-up Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the first round; next could be Miami semifinalist Alexandra Eala, who will make her Grand Slam main-draw debut against Emiliana Arango. Rome semifinalist Peyton Stearns, seeded for the first time at a major at No. 28, is slated to meet Zheng in the third round; No. 11 seed Diana Shnaider is projected in the last 16.

Meanwhile, Petra Kvitova will return to the Grand Slam stage for the first time since returning from maternity leave against Viktorija Golubic, with the winner to face either Anisimova or a qualifier.

First-round matches to watch: [1] Aryna Sabalenka vs. Kamilla Rakhimova, Olga Danilovic vs. [27] Leylah Fernandez, [22] Clara Tauson vs. Magda Linette, [SR] Petra Kvitova vs. Viktorija Golubic, [28] Peyton Stearns vs. Eva Lys, Alexandra Eala vs. Emiliana Arango, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova vs. [8] Zheng Qinwen

Despite the big names in Swiatek's section, the former World No.1 holds the head-to-head edge over most. She's yet to drop a set to either Raducanu or Kostyuk in seven combined meetings, and though she trails Rybakina 4-3 overall, Swiatek has won both of their matches this season. The exception remains 2017 champion Jelena Ostapenko, who owns a 6-0 record against her.

With Rybakina and Ostapenko potentially looming in the fourth round, Swiatek's path isn't easy, but the draw may have lightened slightly with the withdrawal of Belinda Bencic, who had originally been scheduled to face Rybakina in the first round.

Paolini, fresh off a confidence-boosting title on home soil in Rome, could face hard-hitting Australian teenager Maya Joint in the second round, No. 29 seed Linda Noskova in the third and No. 13 seed Elina Svitolina in the fourth. Svitolina, a four-time quarterfinalist in Paris, defeated Paolini at the Australian Open in January in their only previous meeting.

First-round matches to watch: Anastasia Potapova vs. [29] Linda Noskova, Zeynep Sonmez vs. [13] Elina Svitolina, [WC] Iva Jovic vs. Renata Zarazua, Emma Raducanu vs. Wang Xinyu

Between Pegula and Andreeva in the third quarter lies several accomplished players on the comeback trail from injury. Pegula's projected fourth-round opponent, No. 14 seed and 2023 finalist Karolina Muchova, has not played since Miami due to a left wrist problem. Their section also contains three unseeded former Top 10 players who have all suffered shoulder injuries of late.

Marketa Vondrousova, the 2019 finalist, underwent shoulder surgery last year, and has not competed since February because of the same issue. Ons Jabeur and Maria Sakkari both ended their 2024 seasons early due to shoulder problems, and have struggled to regain peak form on their return; they are down at No. 35 and No. 92 in the PIF WTA Rankings respectively. Jabeur also suffered a leg injury in Miami, and has not won a match since -- though a fourth-round run in Madrid showed some promise for Sakkari.

Jabeur opens against No. 25 seed Magdalena Frech, with Vondrousova potentially awaiting in the second round in what would be a rematch of the 2023 Wimbledon final. Whoever emerges from that could face Pegula in the third round. Meanwhile, Muchova and Sakkari could meet in the second round if they defeat Alycia Parks and Elsa Jacquemot respectively.

Andreeva, the winner of two WTA 1000 titles already this year, opens against Cristina Bucsa and is projected to face another player on the comeback trail, No. 10 seed Paula Badosa, in the last 16. Badosa has been sidelined for two months due to a recurrence of her back injury, only returning this week in Strasbourg. Indeed, her first round against Osaka marks unfinished business between the two. They were scheduled to meet in the second round of Rome two weeks ago before Badosa withdrew just half an hour ahead of the match.

First-round matches to watch: [17] Daria Kasatkina vs. Katerina Siniakova, Naomi Osaka vs. [10] Paula Badosa, [14] Karolina Muchova vs. Alycia Parks, [WC] Lois Boisson vs. [24] Elise Mertens, [25] Magdalena Frech vs. Ons Jabeur

It's possible to draw both positives and negatives from Gauff's clay season so far. From the glass-half-full perspective, there's no arguing with back-to-back WTA 1000 finals in Madrid and Rome, particularly given that the former US Open champion had failed to make the semifinals in her six prior tournaments. On the other hand, back-to-back losses in finals would have been unwelcome for a player who had previously won nine of her 10 tour-level title matches.

Gauff, the 2022 finalist in Paris, has a manageable draw to build on her recent form. She is slated to face No. 15 seed Barbora Krejcikova in the fourth round; the Wimbledon champion has only just returned from a six-month hiatus with a back injury this week in Strasbourg. The other Top 20 seed in Gauff's section, No. 20 Ekaterina Alexandrova, started 2025 in hot form but withdrew from Rome and Strasbourg due to a shoulder injury.

Keys, a semifinalist here in 2018, has yet to reach a final following her Australian Open title run -- though the American's power game, bolstered by the confidence of a Grand Slam trophy, could well click on the major stage again. Another potential threat to Gauff is another compatriot, No. 9 seed Emma Navarro, who defeated her at two Grand Slams last year.

First-round matches to watch: Varvara Gracheva vs. [31] Sofia Kenin, [23] Beatriz Haddad Maia vs. Hailey Baptiste, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro vs. [9] Emma Navarro, [15] Barbora Krejcikova vs. Tatjana Maria, [30] Anna Kalinskaya vs. Marie Bouzkova

FIA post-Qualifying press conference – Monaco

Hamilton hit with three-place Monaco GP grid drop for blocking Verstappen in Qualifying

Leclerc ‘proud' but ‘very frustrated' after narrowly missing out on Monaco pole to Norris

Norris' Monaco pole 'a long time coming' as McLaren driver says he 'worked hard for today'

Stroll gets another grid penalty for Monaco GP after incident with Gasly during Qualifying

Lando Norris charged to pole position during Saturday afternoon's Qualifying session for the Monaco Grand Prix, getting the better of home favourite Charles Leclerc and McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri in a dramatic conclusion to the action.

With run plans varying at the end of the Q3 phase, the McLaren drivers managed to extract two laps from their final sets of soft tyres – Norris producing a 1m 09.954s to deny Leclerc, who had briefly held the top spot.

Piastri settled for third, followed by Leclerc's Ferrari team mate, Lewis Hamilton, who recovered well from his crash in final practice, while Max Verstappen could only go fifth for Red Bull after a tricky Qualifying.

Isack Hadjar was one of the stars of the session to put his Racing Bulls machine sixth, ahead of the similarly impressive Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso, Haas of Esteban Ocon and team mate Liam Lawson, while Williams' Alex Albon rounded out the top 10.

Qualifying results

Carlos Sainz could not quite join team mate Albon in that top 10 after lamenting a lack of grip on the soft tyres during his final Q2 run, leaving him 11th on the grid over another frustrated driver in Yuki Tsunoda, who continues to get to grips with Red Bull's package.

Kick Sauber made it through to Q2 courtesy of another solid effort from Nico Hulkenberg, who took advantage of a dramatic session for Mercedes drivers George Russell and Kimi Antonelli to line up in 13th position.

Russell lost power and ground to a halt through the tunnel in the second Qualifying phase and thus placed 14th, with rookie team mate Antonelli following in 15th after he crashed out at the Nouvelle Chicane during Q1.

Gabriel Bortoleto narrowly missed the Q2 cut in the other Kick Sauber machine, with Haas racer Ollie Bearman, the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll and Alpine pair Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto also falling at the first hurdle.

Bearman will fall to the back of the grid with his 10-place grid penalty for a red flag breach during Friday practice, while Stroll has a one-place drop thanks to his sanction for an FP1 clash involving Leclerc.

Qualifying Highlights: 2025 Monaco Grand Prix

After three busy practice sessions, it was time for arguably the most important Qualifying hour of the year, with grid and track position vital around the Principality's tight, twisty streets – even if the new two-stop rule is tipped to add some “spice” to proceedings.

Could Leclerc stay on top after his practice clean sweep? How would Hamilton get on after mechanics replaced the entire rear-end of his Ferrari – including the gearbox – due to him crashing in FP3? And would the soft C6 tyre compound be more favourable than the medium C5?

As Q1 got under way in pleasant conditions, with grid penalties hanging over Stroll and Bearman, the other key Monaco factor of traffic soon came to the fore – 20 drivers having to squabble for clean air in the early minutes in a bid to get banker laps on the board.

Once every driver had posted a time, it was Verstappen who held the provisional Qualifying benchmark on a 1m 11.920s, ahead of practice pace-setter Leclerc, but a constant flow of push, cool and push laps would see the order change by the minute.

Piastri made the next big move by working his way down to a 1m 11.385s, despite reporting a brush with the wall, before Leclerc clocked a 1m 11.229s and stated his intention to score a fourth pole position in the last five editions of his home event.

Leclerc set the pace as Qualifying got under way around his home streets

Unsurprisingly, a couple of impeding incidents were noted by the stewards, with Gasly criticising the slow-moving Stroll for a “shocking” situation at the Nouvelle Chicane, and Verstappen swearing in response to a close call with Hamilton at Massenet.

Gasly and Alpine were left with the most work to do after their first runs, having been slowest of all as the only team to start the session with medium tyres rather than softs – piling the pressure on for the decisive sequence of laps to the chequered flag.

Those laps would be impacted by a crash for rookie Antonelli at the Nouvelle Chicane, though, with the yellow flags initially coming out and scuppering a handful of laps, before turning into a red flag and ending the opening phase of Qualifying early.

Leclerc thus finished quickest from the McLarens, Verstappen, Russell and team mate Hamilton, with Albon, Alonso, Sainz and Tsunoda also reaching the top 10 on an incredibly close timesheet that saw P1 to P15 covered by just over six-tenths of a second.

With Hadjar, Lawson, Ocon, Hulkenberg and Antonelli the final drivers to squeeze through to Q2, even if the Mercedes man would take no part, it meant Bortoleto agonisingly missed out along with Bearman, the aforementioned Gasly, Stroll and Colapinto.

Knocked out: Bortoleto, Bearman, Gasly, Stroll, Colapinto

Antonelli was left to rue a crash in the first phase of Qualifying

After a short break, drivers queued up at the end of the pit lane once more for the start of Q2, which saw Leclerc, Albon, Hamilton, Sainz and Russell try something different by moving over to the yellow-marked medium compound tyre Alpine had sampled in Q1.

Soft-shod Norris was the early pace-setter on a 1m 10.959s, putting him marginally in front of Verstappen, Leclerc and Albon, but Russell's hopes of joining them were dashed when he lost power, ground to a halt in the tunnel and triggered another red flag.

With Russell's car cleared and the session back under way, drivers had around eight minutes to get some more laps in – Albon, Alonso and Sainz pressing on with the mediums, while Ferrari pair Leclerc and Hamilton switched to softs and jumped to the front.

Another mad dash to the flag saw Norris come out on top via a 1m 10.570s, from Leclerc, Albon (who switched to softs late on), Piastri, Verstappen and Hamilton, while both Racing Bulls, Alonso (who stuck with those mediums) and an ecstatic Ocon also progressed.

Like Albon, Sainz took on softs for his final run but could not improve, lamenting that he had “no grip” with the red-marked tyre en route to P11, followed by another disappointed Q2 eliminee in Tsunoda, Hulkenberg and the sidelined Mercedes drivers.

Knocked out: Sainz, Tsunoda, Hulkenberg, Russell, Antonelli

Norris and McLaren began to show their hand as Qualifying developed

So, with 20 cars reduced to 10 via two frenetic Qualifying phases, it all came down to Q3 and the eagerly anticipated fight for pole position – most of the field emerging from the pits on soft tyres, apart from Ocon and Albon on mediums.

Norris picked up where he left off in Q2 by pumping in a 1m 10.464s on his first lap, just over half a tenth clear of Piastri, while Leclerc went third from Verstappen and Hamilton and left his passionate home fans wanting more across the final runs.

Those final runs would deliver another electrifying Monaco Qualifying showcase as Piastri initially went quickest on a 1m 10.140s, before Norris edged ahead via a 1m 10.125s and Leclerc then sent the crowd wild with a 1m 10.063s.

Would that be it front the front-runners? Not quite. Both McLaren drivers geared themselves up for another lap and, with all eyes on the timing screens, Norris brilliantly pulled a 1m 09.954s out of the bag to post the fastest-ever Monte Carlo pole and deny Leclerc.

Piastri's marginal improvement was not enough for an all-McLaren front row, leaving him third over Hamilton and Verstappen, who could not make an impression on his last lap. Hadjar, Alonso, Ocon, Lawson and Albon completed the Q3 order.

Qualifying day belonged to Norris after a stunning final Q3 effort

“It's been a long time coming, so I feel good,” said Norris. “I don't think you realise how good this feels after quite a few struggles over the last couple of months. Especially here in Monaco, it's a beautiful place and probably the hardest track to do it up against the hometown hero as well. I'm very proud of the whole team – we've worked a lot this week, and over the last few months, to get to a day like today.”

Lando Norris denied home hero Charles Leclerc pole position for the Monaco Grand Prix, as the McLaren driver finished fastest by one-tenth of a second.

Leclerc, who topped all three practice sessions on the streets of Monte Carlo, went fastest at the chequered flag before Norris posted a 1m 09.954s with his final run to finish 0.109s faster and claim his first pole since the Australia season-opener.

Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri was 0.175s behind his team mate in third, as the second Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton lines up ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen in fourth.

Both red flags during the one-hour session were caused by the Mercedes drivers, Kimi Antonelli producing the first at the end of Q1 after hitting the barrier at the Nouvelle Chicane.

George Russell then caused the second at the very start of Q2 when his car lost drive and became stranded in the tunnel, leaving the duo in P14 and P15.

Kimi Antonelli brought out the red flags during Qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix, the Mercedes driver hitting the wall at the end of Q1.

The Italian rookie was on his final flying lap in the first part of Qualifying in Monte Carlo and at risk of finding himself in the drop zone as drivers lowered their times.

Antonelli clipped the inside wall on the entry to the Nouvelle Chicane which popped the tyre off its rim and meant the 18-year-old was unable to navigate the following right as he ended up in the barrier.

Confirming that he was okay over the radio, Antonelli added ""I'm sorry"", having ended his day of running respite making it through to Q2 in P15.

There was further pain to come for Mercedes later in the session, with George Russell forced to stop in Q2 due to technical issues, as McLaren's Lando Norris went on to take pole at the end of a thrilling session.

The two films are fueling the biggest Memorial Day weekend in history, while 'Lilo & Stitch' will supplant Tom Cruise's 'Top Gun: Maverick' as the holiday's top opener of all time (he's also the mainstay star of the 'M:I' series). 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The Memorial Day box office is on fire. 


	Disney's live-action redo of Lilo & Stitch and Tom Cruise‘s final Mission: Impossible movie, from Paramount and Skydance, are fueling the biggest start-of-summer holiday weekend of all time, based on Friday returns. Those returns also show Lilo & Stitch blowing away all expectations with a record-smashing domestic debut of $170 million to $180 million, while Mission: Impossible —  The Final Reckoning is on course for a series-best domestic opening of $77 million.

Lilo & Stitch was always expected to beat the latest M:I title, but no one imagined it would hit these heights and, in an ironic twist, see Lilo & Stitch supplant Cruise's Top Gun: Maverick ($160 million) to rank as the biggest Memorial Day opener of all time, not adjusted for inflation. That's not the only irony: Cruise-starrer Minority Report barely beat the original animated Lilo & Stitch when they opened opposite each other in June 2002.

	Three weeks ago, Lilo & Stitch was tracking to open to $120 million. On Thursday, that number had grown to $165 million. Now, it's coming in even higher. The reason? 


Stitch isn't just drawing interest from families; it's popping big time among teenage girls and younger women — i.e., Gen Z and younger Millennials — who grew up on the first movie and resulting TV show about a Hawaiian girl with a fraught family life who adopts an adorable, albeit trouble-making, dog-like alien. Box office pundits say the nostalgic factor is running high, just as it did among Millennials and Gen Z'ers for Disney's live-action Aladdin, which made $1.1 billion in global ticket sales after getting families, teens and younger adults. Rideback produced both Lilo and 2019's Aladdin.


	The live-action Lilo & Stitch was originally intended to go straight to Disney+, helping to explain its modest $100 million production budget. It has a current Rotten Tomatoes critics score of 70 percent and an A CinemaScore from audiences. Both Memorial Day event pics were graced with five out of five stars on PostTrak.


	The Disney pic grossed a huge $55 million on Friday from 4,410 theaters, including a record $14.5 million in Thursday previews, the largest preview gross of the year to date and a Memorial Day record for Disney's live-action studio after besting The Little Mermaid ($10.3 million) and Aladdin ($7 million), not adjusted for inflation. Regarding Disney's larger film empire, Thursday's previews also beat Memorial Day entry Solo: A Star Wars Story ($14.1 million). Overall, it is the seventh-biggest preview gross of any PG title, including Disney's recent animated blockbuster Moana 2 ($13.8 million).

	











Final Reckoning grossed $24.8 on Friday from 3,857 theaters, including Thursday previews. The film set its own preview record in earning a franchise-best $8.3 million, ahead of Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One ($7 million) and Mission: Impossible — Fallout ($6 million).


	The film is expected to more than make up for the lackluster $54.7 million bow of Dead Reckoning, as well as supplant the $61.2 million three-day launch of Fallout to set a new franchise opening record with a three-day gross of $63 million. M:I movies have never been big openers since diehard fans are usually older adults. Ticket buyers over the age of 55 made up the largest chunk of Friday's audience, followed by the coveted 18 to 25 demo. It boasts a current Rotten Tomatoes score of 80 percent and earned an A- CinemaScore.


	A major challenge in terms of Final Reckoning‘s financial success is its $400 million net budget before marketing — making it one of the most expensive films ever made — although Paramount insiders note that each new installment increases the value of the entire library, including a spike in home entertainment sales and rentals of previous titles.


	Thanks to the might of the two films, overall ticket sales for the holiday weekend look to clock in north of $320 million. The current Memorial Day revenue crown currently belongs to the $306 million in ticket sales collected in 2013 when Fast & Furious 6 zoomed to $117 million, followed by The Hangover Part III with $50 million. It would also mark the best showing for two Memorial Day titles going up against each other. In 2007, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End opened to $140 million over the holiday frame, followed by Shrek the Third with $67 million.

	











	While the mash-up isn't expected to be quite the same cultural phenomenon that Barbenheimer was in July 2023, the potent combo of the two movies can't be ignored (as for a moniker, how about “Stitchin: Impossible”?)


	Overseas, Lilo & Stitch is likewise going up against Final Reckoning. 


Lilo earned $29.6 million on Friday for a three-day international total of $56.3 million from 50 markets after beginning to rollout midweek. In a number of territories, it has scored the highest opening day of the year so far, including in China, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, France and Italy.


Final Reckoning began rolling out last weekend in select markets and sports an international total of $75.9 million from 64 markets through Friday. It's Friday haul was $16.6 million. The movie doesn't open in China until May 30.

He previously served as a music editor and writer-at-large at Vibe. 


							By 

	Lexi Carson



Sacha Jenkins, the journalist and filmmaker, has died, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. He was 54.


	Jenkins died Friday morning at his home due to complications from multiple system atrophy, his wife, Raquel Cepeda, told The Hollywood Reporter.




	Born in Philadelphia, Jenkins had an extensive journalistic career across several publications. He began his career by founding one of the first magazines about graffiti art called, Graphic Scenes & Xplicit Language. He co-founded the hip-hop newspaper, Beat Down with his childhood friend and journalist and TV producer, Elliott Wilson.

	After that, the pair founded the hip-hop and skateboarding magazine, Ego Trip. Jenkins has also written for Spin, Rolling Stone and previously served as a music editor and writer-at-large for Vibe. 


	In the filmmaking world, Jenkins directed such films as Bitchin': The Sound and Fury of Rick James, Fresh Dressed and All Up in the Biz, about the late Biz Markie, writing the latter two. He's also worked on the docuseries, Wu-Tang Clan: Of Mics and Men, which earned him an Emmy nomination for best writing for a nonfiction program.


	His additional credits include Everything's Gonna Be All White, Around The Way, Supreme Team, Generation Dead: The Walking Dead Fan Documentary, You're Watching Video Music Box, Rolling Like Thunder, Cypress Hill: Insane in the Brain, City Girls Point Blank Period and Harley Flanagan: Wired for Chaos.


	For the documentary Louis Armstrong's Black & Blues, which he directed and produced, Jenkins told the Film Academy of Armstrong, “He's a very special person — not a normal individual — who had a real foresight and real insight and was just the essence of creativity. I play music. I do different things. And I'm inspired by seeing someone who can do it on such a high level. He was inspired by creativity. That was his fuel.”


	Jenkins is survived by his wife, Raquel Cepeda, and two children.

The two artists previously collaborated on the track “Snooze” from SZA's Grammy-nominated album.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



SZA had a surprise in store for fans at SoFi Stadium on Friday night (May 23): special guest Justin Bieber. The second L.A. stop of Kendrick Lamar's Grand National Tour, Bieber joined the five-time Grammy Award nominee on-stage to perform their rendition of “Snooze.” His appearance was quite the shock for the tens of thousands in attendance, and his presence audibly ignited the crowd.


	Bieber graced the stage sporting an all-black outfit with a Balenciaga jacket. After taking turns singing the chorus, he gave SZA a few kisses on the hand — maybe one too many? — and the two danced through the rest of the track together.

	The duo notably collaborated on an acoustic version of track after Bieber, alongside Young Mazino, Woody McClain and Benny Blanco, starred in the 2023 music video.


	The last time Bieber performed in front of a stadium-sized crowd was at Coachella 2024, when he made a surprise appearance during Tems and Wizkid's set to perform the “Essence” remix. 


	Bieber has been drawing concern from the public about his mental health since cancelling his Justice global tour a year shy of its scheduled end. It was recently reported by THR that the pop star is also facing financial pressures due in part to a pause in his musical output as a solo artist.


	During the first L.A. show of the Grand National Tour on Wednesday night, SZA brought out Lizzo as the night's special guest. The two performed the “Special” remix.


	The Grand National Tour began on April 19 in Minneapolis. Kendrick and SZA will perform their final L.A. stop of the tour on Saturday night at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, CA, before they head to Glendale, AZ, on May 27.

The search for the waters of eternal life has fascinated figures from Gilgamesh to the conquistadors to Hollywood studio chiefs. It's been mostly — but perhaps not entirely — wishful thinking.


							By 

	Sean Kingsley



	In Fountain of Youth, Guy Ritchie's fast-past, wisecracking Indiana Jones homage, John Krasinski and Natalie Portman play siblings on a global hunt for the source of eternal life.


	The clues first turn up inscribed in a 9th-century Tibetan scroll and then — Da Vinci Code style — in the 1600s in masterpieces painted by Caravaggio, Rubens, Velázquez, El Greco and Rembrandt. To Charlotte (Portman), it's all nonsense – at first – “snake-oil superjuice.” But Luke (Krasinski) is convinced the truth is out there. “Charlotte, you and I both know that there is a seed of truth cloaked in every myth, metaphor or fable,” he argues. Is he right?

	No myth has gripped the world for as long as that of eternal youth. Searching for immortality has been rich creative pickings for thousands of years, from Dracula and Peter Pan to the Holy Grail and the philosopher's stone, and onward to modern times with Cocoon and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.


	Literary accounts of the search for life-giving springs go back to the epic of Gilgamesh. In the 4,000-year-old Sumerian poem, the titular ruler of Babylon traveled into the Waters of Death where, “Under the sea there is a wondrous plant, like a flower with thorns, that will return a man to his youth.” The story, written down on a clay tablet in Mesopotamia around 2,100 B.C., is the seed to the legend. One story spread across dozens of cultures and thousands of years, as Luke lectures his team. 


Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, called upon his subjects to search for the key to eternity in the 210's B.C. so his dynasty could live for 10,000 generations. In Greek myth, the Hesperides were maidens who guarded golden apples that, once eaten, promised everlasting life. Anyone who drank from the Holy Grail would find immortality. Alexander the Great went to India in search of the waters of life. And Diane de Poitiers, reputed to be the most beautiful woman in 16th-century France, drank gold to preserve her exquisite looks, the Botox of the Renaissance.


	It's every studio head's dream: Send your lead actors into magical waters and watch them come out the other side forever young, beautiful and marketable. 


	But the version of the fountain of youth myth that has the strongest hold on contemporary culture comes not from ancient times, from Egypt, Greece or Rome. The legend was born when Spain's conquistadors ransacked the Americas for gold, silver and precious gems. 

	











	In 1516 the Italian historian of religion Peter Martyr told Pope Leo X that “There is an island named Boiuca or Agnaneo [in the Bahamas] in which is a continual spring of running water of such marvelous virtue that the water thereof being drunk, perhaps through some deity, makes old men young again.” (Even today, the magician David Copperfield who owns a 700-acre island in the Bahamas, claims the local water does “miraculous things… Bugs or insects that are near death come in contact with the water, they fly away.”)


	It was in search this rumored fountain of youth that the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León supposedly hightailed from the Bahamas to Florida in 1513 to get famous and be forever young. 


	After being shipwrecked, at aged 13, on the Florida Keys around 1549, and living among Native Americans for 17 years, Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda — from a noble family in Cartagena, Colombia — heard all about Ponce de León. The explorer, Fontaneda later wrote, “giving heed to the tale of the Indians of Cuba and Santo Domingo, went to Florida in search of the River Jordan… the kings and caciques [rulers] of Florida, although savages, took information and sought after, as though they had been a more polite people, that they might see what river that could be which did such good work, even to the turning of aged men and women back to their youth.”


	A legend was born. Old Spanish towns like St. Augustine today claim to be the real fountain whose waters amazed the adventurer when he planted a Spanish flag on La Florida. In truth, however, Ponce de León was principally interested in gold, riches and slaves. The myth was in fact, born from tongue-in-cheek muckraking, designed to tarnish the macho explorer as needing the fountain because he was suffering from enflaquecimiento del sexo – impotence! 

	











	But there's a twist to the tale — a sinkhole shaped like an hourglass is off the beaten track in Sarasota County, Florida. Since the 19th century, entrepreneurs promoted Warm Mineral Springs as the genuine Fountain of Youth discovered by Ponce de León. 


	Sadly, there's no proof the Spaniard ever reached Sarasota. Daniel De Narvaez, a Colombian maritime historian, is related to the great explorer through his fifteenth great-grandfather, Juan Pérez Ponce de León y Ayala, the first Marqués de Cádiz.


	“Ponce de León, like other conquistadors, had the responsibility to finance his expeditions and establish settlements in new lands, as stipulated by royal agreements,” De Narvaez told The Hollywood Reporter. “In this context, it's understandable that attractive stories were promoted to motivate potential settlers and financiers. The legend of the Fountain of Youth, although fascinating, appears to have been a construction that emerged after Ponce de León's death… writers like Washington Irving in the 19th century contributed to popularizing this romantic image of the explorer seeking eternal youth, which has influenced the modern perception of his figure.”


	“As handy as it would be to have secret family documents mapping the source to everlasting life or hidden vials of magic water,” De Narvaez adds, “the reality is more sober. Juan Ponce de León did lay claim to La Florida for Ferdinand II of Aragon, but he never said a word about a fountain of youth. The secret to immortality certainly never helped him when he was shot and killed by an arrow fired by a Calusa Native American in 1521. It's just the myth that's immortal.”

	











	But what about Warm Mineral Springs themselves? Well, they have serious credentials. 


	At 240 feet in diameter, the pool is the largest mineral spring in the world. Magical things happen to the water as it flows up 7,000 feet from one of the deepest aquifers in Florida. The geothermal water, naturally heated to 37 degrees Celsius, is blended with 51 minerals. Bathers who take the waters swear they can miraculously cure everything from stress, kidney problems and slipped discs to arthritis and heart failure.


	Beneath the surface of Warm Mineral Springs, divers have discovered prehistoric remains dating back 10,000 years. The location was evidently a sacred place where the ancient buried their dead and saber-tooth tigers snarled. It would make a great movie, right? Thousands of years before even Gilgamesh, people had maybe already discovered the secret to a long life.


	As for the dream of stopping aging, a billion-dollar industry today, the comedian Bob Hope was probably nearest to the truth when he said, “My secret for staying young is good food, plenty of rest, and a makeup man with a spray gun.”

Millions of viewers are making plane-spotting a national pastime, with a slew of online channels devoted to showing jets land and take off.


							By 

	Andrew Zucker



	On any given day, Nancy Bliven will spend hours watching 747s roar down the runway at LAX. Which itself might not be particularly remarkable — except for the fact that she lives more than 2,000 miles away.


	“I'll turn on the 24-hour YouTube channel and put that on,” says the 68-year-old retired computer consultant from Wixom, Michigan. “It as much entertains my cats as it does me.”




	Bliven is part of a growing global community of virtual plane-spotters — aviation fans who tune in remotely to livestreams of major airports. Think of it as the Bob Rossification of air travel: planes taking off and landing in high def, narrated in soothing tones by amateur broadcasters who've turned this niche pastime into a big-time business.

	Her favorite channel? Airline Videos, a YouTube juggernaut with more than 800,000 subscribers. Three times a week, creator Kevin Ray livestreams jumbo jets arriving and departing at LAX, among other airfields, splicing in air traffic control audio, eye-catching onscreen graphics and his own colorful play-by-play that gives the whole thing the feel of a cable sports broadcast — if ESPN covered nothing but wide-body Boeings.


	Other livestreaming channels have also found audiences: Airliners Live, based out of Manchester Airport in the U.K., has nearly as many live viewers as Ray's feed. Big Jet TV, which gained fame for broadcasting during a windstorm at Heathrow, draws a half-million fans. And HD Melbourne Aviation captures takeoffs and landings from around the world and posts them after the fact to its 600,000 subscribers.


	But none quite matches the polish — or the cult of personality — of Airline Videos.


	“Other channels don't have Kevin,” Bliven notes. “His big Sunday show is very entertaining, very informational, and just a lot of fun. That's different.”


	For Ray, the fascination with air travel started early. As a kid, his grandparents would take him to the airport in Lansing, Michigan, to meet incoming flights. “Just the smell of jet fuel as you came into the airport,” he recalls, “I fell in love with it.”


	A former TV news photographer, Ray launched the channel in 2019 as a side project. Two years later, he quit his day job. “I just wanted to take it to the next level,” he says. “How can I make it more entertaining with graphics and music and stuff like that?”

	











	It worked. Airline Videos, which he operates from a rooftop at the LAX-adjacent H Hotel, is now his full-time gig. He declines to say how many of his viewers pay for monthly memberships — which range from $1.99 to $49.99 — but confirms he's earning more than he did in local news. “Our biggest revenue is the memberships,” he says. Other income streams include PayPal donations and YouTube's Super Chat, which lets viewers pin their comments on the broadcast for a fee.


	His fan base ranges from the merely curious to the Marvel-level obsessives. Bliven, who is on the $24 a month subscription plan, falls somewhere in between, though she did travel from Michigan to New York to join other Rayettes for a special livestream event at the JFK airport. Other fans tune in for strictly medicinal purposes. “We've got people that are afraid of flying that watch because it calms their fears,” Ray says. “I almost feel like it's my job to be a comfort for a lot of people around the world.”


	That job is only becoming more viable. In February, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan revealed that, for the first time, more people are viewing YouTube programs like Ray's on TV sets than on mobile or desktop devices. In other words, as more consumers abandon traditional media for creator-led content, broadcasters like Ray are poised to become even bigger stars than they already are.

	











	Still, Ray warns, “Just pointing a camera at the sky won't make you famous.” The space is getting crowded. “In the last three years, you go on YouTube and there's airport livestreams all around the world,” he says. “It's like we opened the floodgate.”

Senior Editor, Latin


	Mexican star Julión Álvarez has postponed his Saturday show at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, after not being able to enter the United States, according to the artist's team.


	Álvarez — alongside the show's promoter CMN and his management/booking company Copar Music — issued a statement Friday (May 23) explaining that, “Due to unforeseen circumstances,” he was “unable to enter the United States in time for the event.”


	Adding, “With nearly 50,000 tickets sold, this sold-out show was set to be an unforgettable night for fans. Both CMN and Copar Music, along with Julión's team, are actively working to reschedule the performance as soon as possible. Julión Álvarez extends his heartfelt thanks for your patience and continued support, and he looks forward to reuniting with his Texas fans very soon.” 

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	In a video message posted on Instagram, Álvarez further explained that his work visa had been cancelled. “It's a situation that is out of our hands. It's the information I have and what I can share.” 


	In April, the regional Mexican star, known for hits like “Póngamonos de Acuerdo” and “Te Hubieras Ido Antes,” made his grand return to the United States with three historic sold-out shows at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. 


	The shows in L.A. saw Álvarez perform in the U.S. again, eight years after a legal process that began Aug. 10, 2017, when the U.S. Treasury Department singled out the singer for alleged money laundering and links to drug trafficking. This caused the closure of his social media accounts and the rejection of U.S. companies to work with the Chiapas-born singer, and kept him away from stages in this country.


	In May 2022, the charges were dropped and Alvarez announced in a press conference that everything had been “cleared up.” The three shows in L.A. and the one in Texas this year were setting him up for his upcoming 4218 Tour in the U.S., although the tour dates had yet to be announced.


	While it's unclear why Álvarez was not able to enter the U.S., the news comes at a time when international artists have faced a visa situation that has impacted a handful of regional Mexican acts and events. Earlier this month, Michelada Fest in Chicago was canceled over artists' visa uncertainty.  


	Today's press statement mentions that previously purchased tickets “will be honored for the new date,”  but if unable to attend the rescheduled concert, “refund details will be provided.”

His other hits included Three Dog Night's ""Out in the Country"" & Paul Anka's ""Times of Your Life.""

	Roger Nichols, best-known for co-writing such Carpenters hits as “We've Only Just Begun,” “Rainy Days and Mondays” and “I Won't Last a Day Without You” with lyricist Paul Williams, died on May 17. He was 84.


	Williams confirmed Nichols' death in an extended, and deeply affectionate, post on Instagram. Williams didn't list a cause of death, though he reported the basic circumstances of the death. “Roger Nichols passed away peacefully four days ago, at home with his beautiful family …his wife Terry and the daughters he was so proud of, Claire and Caitlin at his side.” (See full text of Williams Instagram post below.)

	











	Nichols signed as an artist to A&M Records in 1968, a year before Karen and Richard Carpenter were signed to the Los Angeles-based label. His debut album Roger Nichols and the Small Circle of Friends was produced by Tommy LiPuma, engineered by Bruce Botnick, and featured session contributions from Van Dyke Parks, Randy Newman and Lenny Waronker. Although the album failed to crack the Billboard 200, A&M co-founder Herb Alpert thought there was something there and recommended that Nichols be hired by A&M's publishing company as a staff songwriter. It was during this period that he was introduced to Williams.




			Trending on Billboard		







	That was a characteristically astute call on Alpert's part. Williams and Nichols were one of the hottest pop songwriting teams of the early 1970s.


	Williams and Nichols took off as songwriters in the fall of 1970, when they had two songs in the top 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time. On the charts dated Oct. 17 and 24, Carpenters' version of “We've Only Just Begun,” a ballad which had originated as “soft-sell” commercial for Crocker-Citizens National Bank, was in the top five (on its way to a No. 2 peak). Three Dog Night's “Out in the Country” was holding at its No. 15 peak.


	The Carpenters smash, an instant standard, was lushly romantic. The Three Dog Night hit was a fresh-sounding mix of pop, rock and folk. Having two simultaneous hits by two different acts in two different styles caught the industry's attention. “We've Only Just Begun” went on to receive two Grammy nominations – for song of the year and best contemporary song — at the first live Grammy telecast in March 1971. (It lost both awards to Paul Simon's “Bridge Over Troubled Water.”) The Carpenters' recording of the song was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.

	











	Williams and Nichols continued writing songs for the Carpenters, including “Rainy Days and Mondays,” a superb and remarkably adult ballad which reached No. 2 (it took Carole King's letter-perfect “It's Too Late” to keep it out of the top spot), “Let Me Be the One” (another first-rate ballad that the duo never got around to releasing as a single), and “I Won't Last a Day Without You,” a 1972 album track that was finally released as a single in 1974, when it climbed to No. 11.


Barbra Streisand covered “I Won't Last a Day Without You” on her ButterFly album later in 1974. On her following album, Lazy Afternoon, she recorded another Williams-Nichols song, “I Never Had It So Good.” Both of those albums went gold.


Art Garfunkel recorded a tender Williams-Nichols song, “Traveling Boy,” for his first solo album, 1973's Angel Clare, which made the top 10 on the Billboard 200. The song was released as the third single from the album, and bubbled under the Hot 100.


	Nichols also had some successes with other collaborators. He teamed with William Lane to write “Times of Your Life,” which Paul Anka recorded in 1975. Like “We've Only Just Begun,” this song was also adapted from a popular TV commercial – for Kodak. Anka's recording reached No 7 on the Hot 100 in February 1976.


	Nichols retired soon afterwards, but his songs live on. R.E.M. covered “Out in the Country” as a B-side for their 2003 single “Bad Day.” Rumer covered “Traveling Boy” on her 2012 album Boys Don't Cry.


	Nichols was honored during Florida Chapter Presents The Recording Academy Honors 2006 at Loews Miami Beach Hotel in Miami.

	











	He was nominated for the Songwriters Hall of Fame on Nov. 12, for the class that will be inducted on June 12. He wasn't elected (the competition is fierce every year), but the ballot listed the five songs that are probably his most famous and enduring: “We've Only Just Begun,” “Rainy Days and Mondays,” “I Won't Last a Day Without You,” “Out in the Country,” “Times of Your Life”


	In a comment on Williams' Instagram post, Nichols' daughter Claire wrote, “My mom, Terri, and my sisters, Caroline and Caitlin, are all so proud of the man he was, and are in awe of the legacy he leaves.”


	Here's the full text of Williams' Instagram post announcing Nichols' death.


“The first song, Roger Nichols and I wrote was called “it's hard to say goodbye. “… Sadly, we hit the nail on the head. Roger Nichols passed away peacefully four days ago, at home with his beautiful family …his wife Terry and the daughters he was so proud of, Claire and Caitlin at his side. They were his dream come true. His greatest joy“Roger was my writing partner and my music school… a collaboratorfor years and a friend for life. I was an out of work actor looking for a career in music when I was signed by A&M records publishing. They were looking for a lyricist for Roger Nichols. An industrial strength, lucky break that changed my life.“We wrote almost every day for several years. He was as disciplined as he was talented. I had the attention span of a sea otter… I was ready for a break after three hours and Roger would plunge ahead for another four or five. The words were born of the beauty in his completed melodies.I wrote what I heard, note for note…word for word. The lyrics waiting in the emotion already in his music. He made it easy.“After many wonderful productive years, I wanted us to write songs for movies. He had another dream. He said I wanna go fishing … wanna go back to Montana. He smiled and said something about having a family and maybe making a home by a nice little river… it was clear that he was already gone. A few years ago, I visited him and met Terry and the girls at the house by the river …and I knew he found his dream.“One last story. Roger was really excited when his daughter Caitlin was getting married last September. He chuckled and asked, “can you picture me wheeling down the aisle in my wheelchair, holding my daughter's hand?”“Of course, I said yes then …. and right now Roger, I can picture thousands of proud dads and their beautiful daughters that walked down the aisle to your gorgeous music or danced their father and daughter dance to We've only just begun… picture them standing and applauding what you brought to their lives and to mine. You brought love and beauty into this world, and we will never forget you.In gratitude with much love… Paul”

Refresh for latest…: It's the final day here at the Cannes Film Festival with prizes including the Palme d'Or due to be handed out across the next hour (scroll down for the list of laureates as we update live).


	Among those to arrive on the red carpet this evening were Sentimental Value star Elle Fanning, Resurrection director Bi Gan and cast, Sirat director Oliver Laxe and Two Prosecutors director Sergei Loznitsa.


	This final day got off to quite the bizarre start when, at about 10am local time, a mass power outage affected the region, cutting off electricity and greatly blocking cell service. The festival, however, was well prepared for such an odd scenario, pivoting to an independent power supply to keep the Palais juiced so that all scheduled events and screenings, including this Closing Ceremony, could proceed as planned. In the end, the lights came back on across town at about 3:30pm here — and the city heaved an audible sigh of relief.

	Otherwise, the past 10 days have gone down a treat, with the lineup of films being called the strongest in many years. The Competition films were well-reviewed except for an outlier or two, while outside of the Competition, there were such glossy events as the premiere of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning with Tom Cruise bringing the mega-star wattage. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	As ever, Deadline timed the ovations inside the Palais, including one that saw the audience erupt with 19 minutes of praise. 


	Although the length of applause is not always indicative of awards, that movie, Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value, is the one that Deadline's critics are tipping as the likely Palme d'Or winner.


	Other movies singled out by our critics include Jafar Panahi's It Was Just an Accident, Richard Linklater's Nouvelle Vague, Bi Gan's Resurrection, Mascha Schilinski's The Sound of Falling and Sergei Loznitza's Two Prosecutors. For all of their picks, see here.


	The jury is presided over by Juliette Binoche this year, and while no one really ever knows which way the panel will swing, we'll know more in just a little while. Check back for updates.

Updated with power restoration at 6.49 am PT… Power has been restored in Cannes following a five-and-half hour outage on Saturday which brought chaos to the town but did not impact the film festival's main Les Palais des Festivals venue.


	Local electricity network provider RTE announced earlier that some 160,000 households in the area were impacted by the outage which began around 10am local time (1am PT). Deadline correspondents on the ground reported that power had started to return around 3.30pm (6.30am PT). 


	The Cannes Film Festival had previously announced its closing ceremony this evening would go ahead as planned despite the massive power outage which cut electricity in Cannes and across the South of France region of Alpes-Maritimes.

	All other scheduled festival events including press conferences for the Dardenne brothers' Young Mothers and Martin Bourboulon's 13 Days, 13 Nights also went ahead as scheduled.

	“The Palais des Festivals has switched to an independent power supply, allowing all scheduled events and screenings, including the Closing Ceremony, to proceed as planned and under normal conditions,” the festival said in a statement. 


	“However, screenings at the Cineum have been temporarily suspended and will resume as soon as power is restored.


	Local media reported that foul play was suspected in early reports, which was later confirmed in a statement by Alpes-Maritimes Prefect Laurent Hottiaux who condemned “acts of violence” on the region's electricity infrastructure.


	The statement said a fire at a high-voltage electricity transformer close to Biançon/Saint Cassien in the administrative area of Tanneron had been discovered at 4.30am on Saturday, and this was followed by the downing of a pylon outside the town of Villeneuve-Loubet later on in the morning. 


	Local media reported that pylons at Mougins and Cagnes-sur-Mer had also been damaged, with some reports suggesting they been sawn, but these incidents were not detailed in the statement.


	The incident is reminiscent of an attack on the French rail network on the eve of the Paris Olympics last July, when electrical and signal installations on high-speed lines running north, east and west out of the capital boxes were deliberately set on fire throwing the public transport system into chaos. 

	











	It also follows a massive power outage in Spain and Portugal at the end of April, which caused mass blackouts across both countries.


	The Cannes closing ceremony is due to begin at 6.40pm local time (9.40 am PT), with Deadline critics predicting prizes for Joaquim Trier's Sentimental Value, Jafar Panahi's It Was Just An Accident and  Mascha Schilinski's The Sound of Falling among others. Checkout their predictions here. 


	Deadline staff on the ground reported that electricity went out across Cannes at around 10 am local time (1am PT). Lights went off in shops and restaurants, which could only take cash payments. Securing cash was a challenge, however, because ATMs were also offline.


	Traffic lights were also down causing snarl-ups on the roads.  The internet was also impacted with popular apps like WhatsApp offline intermittently. 


	As well as the Palais des Festivals, a number of the big hotels along the Croisette still also had power thanks to generators, although it was not clear for how long they could continue to provide electricity.


	The press conference for Kelly Reichardt's Mastermind, with the director and cast members Josh O'Connor and Paul Mescal, went ahead as planned at 10.15 am local time.


	“The lights are out across Cannes but at the Palais the lights are on. It's business as usual, and the morning press conference with Kelly Reichardt went on without a hitch,” reported Deadline Anthony  D'Alessandro.


	“It's town wide. Prada is closed. A lot of the shops are dark. You can only use cash in the Cannes gift shops. Everything's dark.”

	Foul play is suspected in a massive power outage across the South of France on Saturday that has hit the final day of the Cannes Film Festival.


	Local media is reporting that a fire at an electricity station outside the town of Tanneron overnight, followed by the downing of pylons close to the towns of Villeneuve-Loubet, Mougins and Cagnes-sur-Mer this morning had caused the electricity cuts which began at around 10 am local time (1 am PT).


	French radio network Franceinfo said local police and sources at the Ministry of Interior had informed it that foul play was suspected, with signs that the downed pylons had been sawn.

	It also follows a massive power outage in Spain and Portugal at the end of April, which caused mass blackouts across both countries.


	In Cannes, the power cut briefly interrupted screenings in the Palais des Festival, before a generator kicked in, while a press conference for Kelly Reichardt's Mastermind continued as normal. 


	The festival has said that the closing ceremony on Saturday evening will go ahead as planned thanks to the fact the Palais des Festivals is equipped with independent power. 


	In Cannes itself, Deadline journalists saw that lights in shops were off shops and restaurants, which could only take cash payments. But the ATMs that supply the cash were also out of action, and traffic lights had failed. Internet connectivity was hit and mobile communications difficult. Read the full report here.

	It's time to break out the biscuits as Hannah Waddingham prepares to reprise her Ted Lasso role for Season 4.


	The 2x Golden Globe nominee recently confirmed the long-gestating continuation of the Apple TV+ series will “start shooting in July,” for which she has signed on to reprise her portrayal of AFC Richmond owner Rebecca Welton.


	“We thought we'd mourned the loss, and now it's rising from the dead!” she said on Capital FM after Season 3 ended in 2023, presumed at the time to be the series finale.

	“Our writers are literally Jedi Knights. They're just incredible,” added Waddingham. “And we've got like a full room of real feminist men. So we've got all the fabulous women there, and the men that are in there, and I think you really see it in the scripts … it's just so beautifully drawn.

	











	Apple renewed the series for Season 4 last year, after co-creators Jason Sudeikis, Bill Lawrence, Brendan Hunt and Joe Kelly planned three seasons for the series.


	In addition to Waddingham and Sudeikis, Brett Goldstein, Juno Temple and Jeremy Swift have been confirmed to reprise their roles in Season 4, which was greenlighted in March, seeing Sudeikis' titular coach leading a women's soccer team.

Focus Features had the final slot of the Official Selection here in Cannes this evening with Ethan Coen's Honey Don't!, a dark comedy reuniting Margaret Qualley with the filmmaker on the heels of last year's Drive-Away Dolls. Coen & Co. received a 6.5-minute ovation in the wee hours of the morning.


	“Fun finish to the festival, yah?” said Coen to a lively crowd. 


	“It's short for a movie that started after midnight,” added Coen about the movie's 90-minute running time, “very humane!”


	Qualley takes on the titular role of Honey O'Donahue, a small-town private investigator who delves into a series of strange deaths tied to a mysterious church led by a preacher played by Chris Evans.

Aubrey Plaza and Charlie Day also feature prominently in the cast, which additionally includes Billy Eichner, Lera Abova, Jacnier, Gabby Beans, Talia Ryder, Kristen Connolly, Lena Hall, Don Swayze, Josh Pafchek, Kale Browne, Alexander Carstoiu and Christian Antidormi.


	Coen directed from his script written with wife Tricia Cooke, the veteran editor who has cut such Coen Brothers classics as The Big Lebowski and O Brother, Where Art Thou? 


	Cooke also co-wrote Drive-Away Dolls.


	Said Cooke tonight following Coen, “More queer cinema, all the time!” to big cheers. 


	Focus releases domestically on August 22. Universal Pictures International is handling overseas distribution.


	Producers on the project are Coen, Cooke, Robert Graf and Working Title's Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner.


	Coen has been bringing movies to Cannes' Official Selection since the 1980s, starting with 1987's Raising Arizona which he co-wrote with brother Joel who directed.


	Notable Cannes titles from the duo have also included Barton Fink (1991/Palme d'Or, Best Director, Best Actor); The Hudsucker Proxy (1994), Fargo (1996/Best Director); O' Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000); The Man Who Wasn't There (2001/Best Director); The Ladykillers (2004/Jury Prize); No Country for Old Men (2007); and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013/Grand Prize). In 2022, Ethan Coen brought his documentary Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind for a Special Screening.


	Because it's a midnight screening at Cannes, the black tie and classy dress attire rules don't apply. However, there was a definite mix in the crowd.

Freddie Mercury allegedly has a secret daughter, according to a new biography of the Queen frontman. Biographer Lesley-Ann Jones dropped the bombshell revelation in her upcoming book, “Love, Freddie,” which details the singer's supposed relationship with his daughter.

The book claims the secret child was conceived accidentally during an affair with the wife of Mercury's close friend in 1976. Despite the situation being kept under wraps, the singer is said to have a close relationship with his daughter, known only as “B.”

Daily Mail reported that the truth about Mercury's daughter was only known by a few people, including his longtime love, Mary Austin, his parents, and his sister.

The outlet also revealed that “Love, Freddie” has a handwritten letter from B, which details her relationship with the singer. It reads:

Freddie Mercury was and is my father. We had a very close and loving relationship from the moment I was born and throughout the final 15 years of his life.

“B,” now aged 48, also offered a glimpse into what Mercury was like as a father. Although their relationship was kept secret, he never failed to make her feel loved.

He adored me and was devoted to me. The circumstances of my birth may seem, by most people's standards, unusual and even outrageous. That should come as no surprise. It never detracted from his commitment to love and look after me. He cherished me like a treasured possession.

Before Mercury's death in 1991, he gave his daughter 17 journals, which were also kept a secret. “B” then passed them to the author ahead of the biography's publication.

The news of Mercury's secret daughter drew mixed reactions online. One Reddit user commented, “Sad that she lost him so young but glad to see she never lacked for care and love. And that she is doing well.”

Another noted, “This is actually beautiful if it's true. Makes my heart feel warmer.”

One pointed out, “I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it were true. Freddie's entire celebrity life was filled with unprotected sex until he basically gave it all up in 1987.”

Meanwhile, another user expressed skepticism, “I think this story is almost certainly false, big claims need big proof. DNA tests are available.”

Another chimed in, “If you're going to make a claim like this you better already have DNA evidence to back it – otherwise it's a pathetic ploy to sell yet another book by an author whose credibility is already tattered.”

“Love, Freddie” is set to be released on September 5, 2025.

Lucia Flores-Wiseman is a contestant for Team Levine on “The Voice” Season 27, and she has won over audiences with her beautiful voice and charm. She is a fantastic performer, but there is more to her than the person onstage, including information about her family life. Here are five fast facts about her family you need to know.

A post shared by Lucia Flores-Wiseman (@luciafloreswiseman)

In an interview with Deepest Dream in May 2025, Flores-Wiseman discussed her music, including her songwriting process for “Transitions.” She explained the track and briefly mentioned how her parents were helping her and her boyfriend.

“One of the reasons why I wrote ‘Transitions' was because I was moving in with my boyfriend into our house and we're renting from my parents, which I'm super glad because there's no way we can afford a prices now,” she told Deepest Dreams. “I've been with my boyfriend since I was 16 years old, and making that transition (was like) – we're doing this!”

A post shared by Lucia Flores-Wiseman (@luciafloreswiseman)

Flores-Wiseman is white and Hispanic, and her NBC bio revealed more about her experience growing up and struggling to find her place. Her dad is from Mexico, and her mom is from the United States.

“Lucia struggled to connect with her Mexican roots as she was raised away from that side of her family,” the bio reads. “Determined to embrace her lineage, she became fluent in Spanish while studying abroad in Spain.”

A post shared by Lucia Flores-Wiseman (@luciafloreswiseman)

Flores-Wiseman chose a very special song for her Blind Audition and dedicated it to her parents. The song was Ángela Aguilar's “La Llorona.” Her powerful vocals and the emotion in her singing resulted in all four judges turning their chairs around.

A little video to get to know who I am! There's so many things I didn't get to mention, but I hope this shows a little glimpse into my life! Thank you all for the support from my performances on @NBC's The Voice! So excited for playoffs! ❤️  #thevoice #adamlevine #singer #mexicanamerican 

Some families have cats, others prefer dogs, and the Flores-Wiseman family are dog lovers. Lucia shared this information in a video posted on TikTok in April 2025. The post was for fans to get to know her better.

“My dad is from Mexico and my mom is from the U.S,” she said in the TikTok post. She revealed they have a family dog, a black Labrador, who is 14 years old. In the clip, the singer also briefly discussed having addiction in her family and how she wants to be “a cycle breaker.”

A post shared by Lucia Flores-Wiseman (@luciafloreswiseman)

Flores-Wiseman was raised in Washington state, and she loves it. 

“I just love the Pacific Northwest. I love our fresh air, our wonderful community, and I think the music community continues to grow in Seattle,” she told 425 magazine. “I am so grateful to have a community that supports the arts, and if I didn't have that, I'm not sure if I would be where I am today. I don't know if I would be on ‘The Voice' stage if it weren't for so many people believing in me and creating spaces for me to perform.”

Yeehaw! “American Idol” season 10 winner and country music star Scotty McCreery is ready to be a dad again. He and his wife Gabi, along with their two-year-old son Avery, announced on May 22, 2025, that they'll soon be a family of four. 

In an adorable photo announcement posted to social media, Gabi wrote, “A new best friend coming this fall! 💙💙”

A post shared by Gabi Dugal McCreery (@gabimccreery)

After posting a carousel of photos of their current family of three, with Avery wearing a blue sweatshirt that said “BIG BROTHER,” the McCreerys heard from thousands of friends and fans who were over the moon about their news. 

Within hours of publishing their post, it had over 50,000 likes on Instagram, including from “American Idol” alums Pia Toscano and season 13 winner Caleb Johnson, and nearly as many on Facebook. 

Country star Lauren Alaina, who was runner-up to Scotty on “American Idol” and is expecting her first child in a matter of days, wrote, “Yay!!!! Congrats” followed by three teary-eyed emoji. 

One fan exclaimed, “OMG ..the bestest news I have heard all day ..Congratulations. How awesome ..exciting news 🥰🥰🥰🥰”

Another wrote, “Congratulations!! Y'all make the cutest family!”

Someone else weighed in, “Congratulations! So happy for the 3 of you. It's so exciting to watch your family grow.”

“Congratulations to each one of you,” someone wrote on Facebook. “I will be Praying for a great pregnancy journey, labor and Delivery, healthy Mama and baby. This is so Awesome!!!”

A post shared by Scotty McCreery (@scottymccreery)

Many fans mentioned what a good big brother Avery will be. The McCreerys' little guy has been the apple of their eye since he was born in October 2022. Named Merrick Avery McCreery, after Gabi's father — Merrick Dugal III, the couple chose to call him by his middle name, Avery.

Scotty announced Avery's birth on social media, posting a photo of the newborn and writing, “Thank yall for all of your prayers during this exciting season of life! Healthy baby and a healthy mama! Praise God🙌🏼🙏🏼”

In between touring and releasing new music — including his new song “Bottle Rockets” with Hootie & the Blowfish — Scotty has prioritized being an involved dad. He frequently posts sweet moments with Avery, from singing to him backstage in January to playing on a putting green on May 19.

When Scotty released his song “Love Like This” in early 2024, he shared on social media how much his family inspired him, writing, “Becoming a father is the coolest thing I've ever done and watching my wife be a rock star as his Mom has been the joy of my life these last 15 months 🧡👨‍👩‍👦”

6.1

Genre:

Rap

Label:

Death Row / Gamma.

Reviewed:

May 24, 2025

At this point, Snoop Dogg is famous for being famous. He's been America's affable, couch-locked uncle for over 20 years now, skating on his delightfully weird personality to earn gigs like bonkers sketch comedy host, celebrity roastmaster, and primetime Olympics correspondent. He counts Willie Nelson and Martha Stewart as close personal friends, and, even as he settles into his 50s, still has the juice to define the discourse for a few days at a time.

For years, music has seemed like a bit of an afterthought for the rapper who once helped define the West Coast gangster-rap template. His 1993 debut, Doggystyle, remains his most (perhaps only) essential release. He's done stints as a No Limit soldier, an ambassador of the Star Trak/Virginia Beach sound, and a born-again Rastafarian. And there are gems sprinkled throughout his three-decade body of work, like 2013's Dâm-Funk collaboration 7 Days of Funk, the vibey mid-life stock-taking of 2017's Neva Left, and the undeniable bombshell “Sensual Seduction” (the explicit version, “Sexual Eruption,” lays it on a little too thick). But there are also plenty of missteps, like 2024's Missionary, a second full-length album with Dr. Dre (their previous record together was Doggystyle, get it?) that vacillates between mildly entertaining and kind of embarrassing.

These days, his records mostly feel like low-stakes kickbacks, as if he dropped decent money on studio time but still made sure everyone got home by five. Iz It a Crime?, his 21st album and third as CEO of the recently resurrected Death Row Records, is slick and frictionless, unencumbered by anything resembling overthinking. It's an aggressively OK listen, full of expensive-sounding, groove-first songs that don't really lead anywhere, except maybe to the cooler to grab another cold one. This is session beer music, best when played at mid-volume on a nice day, augmenting the vibe without ever overtaking a conversation.

If you decide to pay attention, you'll find a mix of occasionally tight songwriting and some utterly bizarre choices. The album starts with a surprisingly inspired four-song suite, a revitalized-sounding Snoop dropping into the pocket like melting caramel. He flexes a bouncy, spring-loaded flow on the lush, Sade-sampling title track, and the satisfying “Sophisticated Crippin'” feels like a West Coast version of Rick Ross' gold-plated opulence on Deeper Than Rap. Things start to get shaky with “Can't Wait,” a synth-funk cut that features Bay Area rapper LaRussell, whose verse is essentially about how cool it is to be on a jam with Snoop (a concept that gets the full treatment on the thumping-but-vacuous Sexyy Red collab “Me N OG Snoop”). The wheels come entirely off with “Can't Get Enough,” a grown and sexy ballad that brings Iz It a Crime?'s momentum to a screeching halt. Though it's about relationship longevity, Snoop sings his verses with a muted version of Rihanna's bellicose delivery on “Bitch Better Have My Money,” explaining to his lady that he will “fuck up [her] mind.”

So many moments don't feel thoroughly considered: Wiz Khalifa derails the buttery smooth, Foreign Exchange-esque R&B on “Just the Way It Iz” with a verse that could've been spat out by an AI chatbot trained solely on Rolling Papers 2; “My Friend” sounds like Snoop drifted into a groovy Denaun Porter session, rapped for a little bit, and wandered out without anyone noticing; Snoop and Pharrell reunite for “Spot,” a truly mindboggling mash-up of the least interesting parts of Daft Punk and Mustard, replete with heavy-handed dog puns and a vocal melody that Katy Perry would reject. But, when nestled amongst decent bangers like the slinking, chest-puffed “West Up” or the roller-rink funk of “Snoop Will Make You Dance,” these wackier tunes breeze by like the intermittent glitches of an algorithmic playlist.

In January, Snoop stumbled into his first real controversy in some time, performing a 30-minute DJ set at the Crypto Ball during President Trump's inauguration. Anger bloomed across social media, where people accused Snoop of being a grifter, especially since he frequently lambasted Trump during his first term. Some of his media appearances around Iz It a Crime? have focused on responding to these criticisms—so if you hadn't heard the album, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was Snoop's political record laying out the depths of his beliefs. In truth, he barely addresses the issue, dedicating only three bars on “Unsung Heroes” to the situation: “Life's a game of spades, better keep a Trump card/You ain't used to hell's kitchen, get the hell out/Me and Dre at the SoFi, the only way I sell out.” At this point, Snoop's music can't convey the creeping menace he perfected in the early G-funk era, and that's fine—he's a wealthy celebrity who moves in wealthy celebrity circles, long removed from any need to hustle. He's clearly having a blast, but overall, Iz It a Crime? is a well-constructed empty vessel, pleasant and forgettable as a 40-degree day.

D'Angelo will no longer be headlining the 2025 Roots Picnic, he announced in a statement shared on the festival's social media pages on Friday. The singer said there has been “an unforeseen medical delay regarding surgery [he] had earlier this year,” and he's been advised that the performance “could further complicate matters” as he recovers. See D'Angelo's statement on the cancellation below.

The Roots Picnic takes place on May 31 and June 1 in Philadelphia. Replacing D'Angelo on the bill is Maxwell.

D'Angelo has not played live since 2022, when he dropped by the Netflix Is a Joke festival for a surprise performance. Before that, he played a big show at the Apollo Theater in February 2021. He's not released an album since 2014's Black Messiah.

D'Angelo:

It is with the deepest of regrets that @must cancel my performance at the Roots Picnic in Philadelphia next weekend.

But, due to an unforeseen medical delay regarding surgery @had earlier this year, @ve been advised by my team of specialist that the performance this weekend could further complicate matters.

It is nearly impossible to express how disappointed @m not to be able to play with my Brothers “The Roots”. And even more disappointed not to see all of You.

@m so thankful to my beautiful fans for continuing to rock with me and @Thank u for your continued support.

@m currently in the Lab & can't wait to serve Up what's in the Pot! LOVE U All and will see you very soon!

With Love,~D'Angelo

							By 

	Andrew Perez



	A judge ruled this week that Donald Trump's administration violated his order barring officials from deporting people to third countries by attempting to send a group of Asian immigrants to South Sudan — and directed them to maintain custody of the immigrants at a U.S. military base.


	On Friday night, Trump's Justice Department and Secretary of State Marco Rubio unveiled a wild new argument as they demanded Judge Brian Murphy either reconsider or pause his orders so they can appeal them. The Trump officials argued that blocking the president's attempt to deport immigrants to war-torn South Sudan will harm efforts to distribute humanitarian aid in the region. 


	“In South Sudan, the orders threaten to derail significant efforts to quietly rebuild a productive working relationship with the government in Juba,” Rubio wrote in a declaration filed alongside the Justice Department's motion. He continued: “Cooperation between the U.S. and South Sudan is critical, both in terms of removals but also to advance the U.S. government's humanitarian efforts in the country. Without South Sudan's cooperation, moving humanitarian relief — food, medicine, etc. — into the region becomes more difficult. It is almost certain the court's interjection will result in delayed or significantly reduced humanitarian efforts.”

	











	It's a rich argument, considering that the Trump administration has gutted the government's humanitarian efforts, starting with the elimination of the U.S. Agency for International Development. The scraps of USAID, America's foreign aid bureau, have been folded into Rubio's State Department.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Last month, the nonprofit aid group Save the Children reported that it had closed seven free health facilities in South Sudan as a result of foreign aid cuts. The organization told The Washington Post that the Trump administration had terminated about $13 million in funding for South Sudan. The money had come from the State Department and U.S.-funded United Nations programs.

	According to Save the Children, five children with cholera and three adults died last month as they attempted to travel three hours — in 104-degree weather and with “no access to clean water, shade, or medicines” — to the organization's nearest health facility after the aid cuts forced closures.

	











	Several projects relating to South Sudan were included in a recent list of canceled USAID contracts and programs, including a $40 million contract labeled, “USAID South Sudan Gender Aware Sustainable Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Activity,” and a $30 million contract listed as “The Resilience through Agriculture in South Sudan.” 


	As part of its campaign to send immigrants to inhumane locations, the Trump administration earlier this week attempted to deport eight men, whom it accused of significant crimes, to South Sudan, one of the world's most dangerous countries, with little notice. The immigrants are currently being held on a U.S. military base in Djibouti. 


	Murphy, a Massachusetts district judge, found the attempted deportations to South Sudan violated his previous order barring the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens to a country that is not their country of origin without due process, and without giving them a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate they fear being persecuted, tortured, or killed if they are sent there.


	The Justice Department argued Friday that it had, in fact, complied with the judge's order as it moved to carry out the deportations to South Sudan. 


	U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “provided notice ‘shortly before' removing these criminal aliens and that notice was ‘meaningful' and sufficient to comply with this court's injunction as written,” the Justice Department argued. “These criminal aliens needed only state that they had a fear of removal to South Sudan to receive the other procedures required by the court's April 18, 2025 injunction. The aliens did not do so.”

	ICE official Garrett Ripa wrote in a declaration, “ICE generally provides an alien 24r hours, depending on exigency, following service of the Notice of Removal for the alien to raise a fear of torture if they are removed to the third country or express an intent to file” a claim under the Convention Against Torture.


	The Trump administration previously tried to deport migrant detainees to Libya, another dangerous and war-torn country, before Murphy clarified such a move would violate his order. 


	Rubio wrote in his declaration that the court's orders “have interfered with quiet diplomatic efforts and exacerbated internal political and security divisions in Libya.” He suggested the orders had played a role in “the most serious street fighting in Tripoli since 2022,” which “forced a postponement in the announcement of a significant commercial deal to expand activities of a U.S. energy company in Libya.”

	











	He suggested the judge had caused headaches in dealing with officials in Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa, home to an essential military base for U.S. aircraft.

	“The order interrupted the transit process and required that the aircraft and the eight individuals removed, including convicted felons, temporarily remain in Djibouti,” Rubio wrote. “That action required our government to re-engage the Djiboutians to explain that the mission they had approved had subsequently changed.” 


	He then claimed the judge's demands have affected “counter-terrorism operations and both United States and multinational military movements.”

	“What is this that stands before me?” Well, it might not be Louisa Livingstone, the witchy-looking woman on the cover of Black Sabbath's 1970 self-titled debut album, but she is at least willing to give you her autograph — for charity. The former actress and model is raffling her autograph via Raffall with an eye toward raising funds for her cat-rescue efforts. Tickets are only £1 each.


	Livingstone will write the raffle winner a letter and sign it. The raffle will end July 19, a few weeks after Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne make an appearance together for a final time in their hometown of Birmingham, England.


	Five years ago, Rolling Stone discovered the identity of the gothic figure — who may or may not have been holding a cat — on Black Sabbath's cover. Long a mystery to metalheads, and the band members themselves, Livingstone says she was amazed at the outpouring of interest in who she was.


	“I had heard rumors [that the image had become iconic] through friends that I never really took very seriously before the ‘big reveal' with your article,” she tells Rolling Stone via email. “Then it finally sank in 100 percent when I was being sent numerous photos of people's tattoos of my image. Also, when I saw all the merchandise and even dolls being sold with the image of me. I was even more amazed then, and it struck me it really was quite a phenomenon. What kind of spell was at work there I wondered?”

	











	Fans invited her to events in the United States, but Covid lockdowns prevented her from traveling. Moreover, she felt she couldn't make good on autograph requests. “I have had a lot of online requests from avid collectors and fans to send autographs by post, receive items to autograph and return by post, etc.,” she says. “I've had to ignore them all because I don't live anywhere near a post office … and didn't have the time or funds to spare, to be repeatedly doing this kind of thing.” So she came up with the idea of raffling one autograph for a good cause.

	“I hadn't planned to go down the cat rescue route but it all started after moving to a tiny rural village four years ago with an abandoned kitten that needed bottle-feeding screaming two meters from my doorstep,” she says. “I have now got an assortment of street cats depending on me, each with its own sad story. … The rescued ones definitely know they've been rescued and are full of love for it.”

	











	Livingstone's goal is to create a refuge with a safe space for outdoor cats. Since she's half-French, she'd love for it to be in France but she's still conceiving the endeavor. The funds she raises from the raffle will go to helping her cats.


	“Who knows whether I can find a bit more funding for cat food and neutering or whether a selection of needy cats can be gifted a lovely life in a much better place along with me,” she says. “Some paid help at times would be an absolute godsend.” Livingstone also says she feels “miffed” that she didn't remunerate on the success of her cover image, so she hopes to do some catching up with the raffle. “As they say, you can't change the world, but you really can change someone's entire world, whether it's an animal or a person,” she says.


	Meanwhile, Livingstone has relaunched her own musical career, recording electronic music under the name Indreba. A single, “Anthem to Truth, See More,” will be available to stream via Spotify on May 30.

	Livingstone's next goal will be to write and publish an autobiography that will tell of her experiences in the music industry, both on album covers and with artists. Once, she says, she spent a whole day with the late Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones after the band released Between the Buttons. “I will never forget his friendly openness and being shown loads of photos of their recent USA tour and hearing the new album tracks,” she says. “That was a special time and what a lovely man. He never made any inappropriate moves either — an absolute gentleman.”


	Until then, she's excited to see how much money she can raise for her cats. “There are many millions of Black Sabbath fans, and quite a few might like the chance to get my rare autograph this way at very little cost without any inconvenience,” she says. “The last autographs I gave were at the National Theatre in London decades ago.”

Justin Bieber made a surprise (and increasingly rare) onstage appearance Friday when he popped up during SZA's set Friday during the Grand National Tour's stop at Inglewood, California's SoFi Stadium.


	Following a trying couple of months that included since-denied Diddy rumors, a report about his “financial distress,” and concerning social media posts, Bieber was back in his artistic element Friday as he joined SZA for a rendition of “Snooze”; Bieber previously appeared on the acoustic remix of the SOS single.


	While Bieber hasn't performed a full public concert since September 2022, the singer has sporadically appeared onstage at other artists' shows in recent years, including a cameo at Don Toliver's Los Angeles gig in October 2024 to perform “Private Landing.”


	However, Friday wasn't the first time Bieber performed “Snooze” live: Back in February 2024, he attempted the track solo at a surprise Toronto mini-gig during the NHL All-Star Draft festivities. However, Friday's rendition marked the first time Bieber and SZA had performed the song together onstage.

	To date, “Snooze” is the most recent single that Bieber has featured on, as the singer hasn't released any new music of his own since 2021's Justice.


	SZA's previous Grand National Tour set at SoFi Stadium featured a guest appearance by Lizzo. She and Kendrick Lamar will play one more show at the Englewood stadium Saturday night.

She could have gone with a lion, the animal she'd pretended to be during summer camps and after-school “acting clubs” with her friends, and which gave her an early peek at the thrill of performing for others. Or maybe a 1930s gangster, courtesy of the childhood viewings of Bugsy Malone; Threapleton vividly remembers seeing a very young Jodie Foster, along with dozens of other kid actors pretending to be Prohibition-era hoods and molls in that 1976 movie, and thinking, How old is she? She looks like she's my age. Can I do that? I could do that. And there were also her parents, who… well, we'll get to them later.


	All of those figures factored into Threapleton's decision to mention in passing, during her preteen years, that she maybe kinda sorta wanna give the professional acting thing a try. But what really stands out in her memory is one particular fox. It didn't matter that he was just a stop-motion-animated animal. This mammal was witty, a dapper dresser, and a great dancer. Plus this mischievous creature had a lot of eccentric friends. And he seemed to move in a world that felt odd, funny, weird and unique in the best possible of ways. He was, dare we say, fantastic.

	











	“Yes, Fantastic Mr. Fox!” Threapleton says, with a machine-gun giggle. “I remember seeing that movie when I was eight, maybe nine. And the impression I had was, ‘This is so cool… Why do I like this so much?' I mean, it's a brilliant movie. But something about it really got me as a kid. It just felt so imaginative and fun.


	“That was the first time I was aware of who Wes Anderson was,” she recalls, sitting in front of an open hotel room window overlooking the beaches of Cannes. “Then a few years later, I saw Moonrise Kingdom, and I recognized his name. And it was like, ‘Oh, this is great, too. I love this director! I love his style. I love everything that he's doing here.' It's amazing how his brain works. It's so unique, his sheer Wes-ness. All those Wes-isms are amazing. That movie became an important piece of cinema to me. I don't know how many times I've seen it, but I still watch it to this day. So, you know, when you go from that to, um, this….” She looks around the room, wide-eyed, and the staccato laugh returns. “It's surreal. A little crazy, to be honest.”

	That seeing a pair of Anderson's movies was such a formative experiences for Threapleton — now that she stars in one of them — seems like a detail that might have been ret-conned into an origin story. But the 24-year-old British star of The Phoenician Scheme, the latest from the beloved filmmaker that's making its premiere at the Cannes film festival (and hits limited theaters on May 30th, before going wide on June 6th), swears it's true. And she's admittedly still swooning over the fact that she's stepped through the looking glass and somehow, after being so entranced by his work, has now become a cornerstone of a genuine Wes world.


	Threapleton plays Liesl, the only daughter of wealthy, infamous business tycoon Anatole “Zsa Zsa” Korda (Benicio Del Toro). Having just survived that latest in a long series of attempted assassinations by his rivals, the industrialist has finally decided to get his affairs in order. Korda has declared that, because his nine sons are, frankly, nincompoops and rapscallions, Liesl will be the sole heir to his fortune. The one caveat: She must avenge his death should he perish. As for Liesl, she's a novitiate who pines for a simple life in a convent, and wants nothing to do with her estranged father. Still, when Korda asks her to accompany him as he secures financing for one last massive project, his daughter relents and trots the globe with her dad, along with a Swedish tutor named Bjorn (Michael Cera).

	As with most of Anderson's films, there's a who's-who ensemble cast (Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, Jeffrey Wright, Bill Murray, Bryan Cranston, Riz Ahmed, Benedict Cumberbatch, Willem Dafoe), sophisticated in-jokes and references, and the sort of meticulous mise-en-scène that's inspired rabid fandom among the film-nerd set. Threapleton, however, doesn't just hold her own against a lot of A-listers and an insanely detailed production design. She ends up being the film's secret weapon, courtesy of a less-is-more approach that makes her placid expressions and impeccable comic timing feel like she's channeling Buster Keaton. Told that this vast inheritance will change her life forever, Liesl replies with the world's most barely discernible shrug. It's the sort of perfectly deadpan grace note that compliments Anderson's sense of controlled chaos while giving you a sense of who this character is.


	“It's interesting, because I feel like a lot of people would think the environment on his sets are very restrictive, very controlled — and it's not, actually,” Threapleton says. “Wes loves naturalism, which I know is a weird sentence to say regarding him — but he loves naturalism. He loves nuance. He loves simplicity and subtle complexity in a scene. And while Wes knows exactly what he wants, the end result is kind of like this beautiful collage of moments that were sometimes worked out and planned, and sometimes discovered as we were filming.” She mentions one sequence early on in Phoenician, where a series of shoeboxes are spread out on the floor. Threapleton casually walked over in between shots and hovered over them, her hands on her hips. Suddenly, a head poked out from behind the monitor: Don't move, Wes said. Let's go one more time, but with you standing like that. “That's the shot in the film. He's constantly paying attention in case something random or unplanned catches his eye.”

	











	Which is a good way of describing how Threapleton suddenly found herself meeting her cinematic idol-slash-future director in London, sharing tea and reading a few very select pages from The Phoenician Scheme‘s script. The actor was one of a gajillion other hopefuls with a few credits to her name — a recurring part on Apple's The Buccaneers, a prominent role in the BBC anthology series I Am…Ruth; more on that second one in a minute — that sent in a self-shot tape via an agent, circa May 2023. She had no real sense of what the project was, and how Liesl might fit in to a much bigger, immaculately composed picture. “There was no ‘more of this, less of that, hit this beat more,” she says. “I just did what felt right, without any context. And it felt right to sort of underplay it.”


	According to Anderson, he'd already seen over a thousand other auditions by the time Threapleton's tape arrived. Something about hers immediately stood out. “She just seemed like she was in a documentary about the scene,” the director says, via a voice memo sent from a post-Cannes-premiere jaunt to Milan. “I could see her thoughts. You could tell she was really listening, reacting, thinking about what was happening in front of her. Which isn't always the case.” After Threapleton did a callback, she was invited to meet with Anderson in London. She was admittedly anxious over an encounter with the person who'd made two of her favorite movies, until he opened the door of his hotel room and, per her recollection “he was wearing pink socks, hotel slippers, stripy linen trousers and a blue linen shirt with clear, quite small glasses. And I thought, Look at him! Oh, I'm not nervous now at all. Let's have some fun here.” 


	Threapleton and Anderson proceeded to chat “about everything but the movie: the world, our mutual dislike of social media, films that we admired, things that we enjoyed, books that we liked. A get-to-know-you kind of conversation. And then I think probably about the hour mark, we both sort of went, ‘Perhaps let's do some acting now? I think we should?'” She and Anderson's friend, the writer-director-actor Fisher Stevens, read some scenes together. A few weeks later, Mia was asked to do a two-day screen test. She felt good. Then Mia was told it would be with Benicio Del Toro, who'd be playing her father. She felt sick to her stomach.


	“It's the usual, ‘Oh my god, I'm going to act against this person. Oh my god, I'm going to meet this person. Oh my god, I hope I don't look like a mess,'” Threapleton says, twisting in her seat at the memory. When Del Toro walked in on the first day of her test, she shyly introduced herself. He immediately gave her a handshake and a hug. “Completely put me at ease. I realized, he's just this huge purring cat. Or maybe Benicio is like a big bear. A very big, very talented, very disciplined bear with an incredible sense of concentration. 

	











	“I think I've mentioned this in an interview before,” she adds, “but at one point early on during filming, Benicio came up to me and asked, ‘You good?' I replied, ‘I mean, it's really happening now, isn't it?' And he just said, ‘It's ok, we're going to do it together.' Then when he wrapped, I went up to give him a hug goodbye, and he said, ‘See, I told you, we did it together.'”


	The second day, Threapleton says, involved hair, make-up and costumes — what Anderson calls “a sort of mock up of what they might be like as the characters.” At one point, they were trying to put together Liesl's all-white habit together, and they couldn't find a veil. The outfit was not quite coming together. Threapleton spotted a napkin on a lunch cart. She asked: Does anybody have any hairpins? Then the actor pinned the napkin to her head, and voila. There was Liesl. 


	By that point, however, she had already been cast. “I don't think I've told her this, at least not officially,” Anderson says. “But five minutes into that second day, she already had the part. And when you saw her read against Benicio… I mean, he's a very imposing figure, and about a foot and a half taller than Mia, for one thing. But if you were to say who seemed to have the power in the relationship in the scenes, you would tend to lean towards the nun.” (Apparently Del Toro's endorsement had been secured at the end of the first day; according to a BBC interview, after Threapleton left, the Oscar-winner turned to Anderson and said, “She can go toe to toe… she may be short, but she's terrific.”) 


	Once Threapleton arrived on set after a few days of rehearsal with Del Toro and Michael Cera, she said she had to continually “mind fuck myself because I'm working with those guys, and also Riz Ahmed, and Richard Ayoade, and Tom Hanks, and Brian Cranston, and it's like, wait, they are my coworkers? What's going on here?!” Still, it's not like Threapleton hadn't shared the screen with super-famous movie stars before, even so early into a promising career. And this is probably a good moment to return to the subject of her parents. Mia's father is the director Jim Threapleton. Mia's mother is Kate Winslet. The Titanic star had acted with her daughter in the aforementioned I Am…Ruth episode, playing a mom concerned over social media's effect on her child's mental health. When Winslet won a BAFTA for her role, Mia was sitting beside her; you can see her sobbing during the acceptance speech, after Mom thanked her costar/offspring from the stage.

	











	“That whole experience was very intense,” Threapleton says, nodding. “Everything was improvised, but the director [Dominic Savage] would direct us in different rooms, so when we both came in to do the scene, neither of us knew what the other one was going to do. It's so clever, because it made for such an electric — and sometimes, quite frightening at times — energy within the scene. But it was also organic, because we didn't have a plan. We had a plan of, like, where the scene was going, but we didn't know what the other one was going to say to get to that point. And sometimes Dominic would pull one of us aside and go, ‘Yeah, more of that. Or, like, really push her body. Really piss her off this time.' It was extremely full-on.”


	“It's funny, because I had no idea who her mother was,” Anderson admits. “It was only after I'd watched Mia's audition video a few times and went to look up what else she'd done that I discovered: Wait, she's Kate Winslet's daughter? Then I went back and watched her video again, and I swear if you listen closely, you can hear someone doing an East London accent offscreen, playing the scene with her. Maybe I'm projecting here — I've never discussed this with either of them — but perhaps she worked with her mother on it. Perhaps she had the advantage of a very good collaborator. Again, I don't know for sure. But what that immediately told me was: She's open to collaborating. What I saw and heard when I rewatched it was someone working with another person to make a scene come to life, in a way that was absent from the thousands of other auditions. It impressed me even more.” 


	Threapleton remembers the moment she told her mom that she was thinking about trying her hand at acting, and that the initial response was: “‘I thought you wanted to be a marine biologist?' And the she said, Well, ok, it's hard work, but it's great work, go and do it. She recognized that I was serious, and also that I wanted to sort of do it on my own. And yeah — I kind of tried, fell down a bit, and sort of managed to make it happen. I mean, that's what been so amazing about it, in that I had a supportive environment and I had to find my own way. I wanted the experiences of it, the high points and low points, to be mine. Not someone else's.

	“There was no guarantee, in other words,” Threapleton adds. “So to be able to get work on my own, and then have that work be in a Wes Anderson movie, is…” Once again, her eyes widen. “It's all very much a dream. I'm just taking this one day at a time. Talk to me after the premiere.”

	Julión Álvarez y Su Norteño Banda have cancelled their Saturday show near Dallas, after the singer claimed that his visa was allegedly revoked. On Friday, Álvarez announced the news on Instagram, saying the stage had already been set up at AT&T Stadium for the sold-out concert, but he was notified of the visa cancellation this morning.


	“Sadly, the event will not go on as planned due to our work visa being cancelled,” Álvarez said in a video posted to his social media. “It is not possible for us to go to the United States and fulfill our show promise with all of you. It's something out of our control. That's the information I have, and it hurts… It's an event that was completely sold out.”

A post shared by Julión Álvarez (@lospasosdejulion)


	Álvarez said that the stage had already been built out, and part of his production team was already in Texas, preparing for the event. “The visa cancellation is the only information I can share with you on behalf of myself and CMN,” he said, referring to the touring company. “It will be postponed, but we are waiting to see what information we receive.”

	











	Álvarez apologized to his fans and said tickets will be valid for a rescheduled date. However, refunds are also available upon request. 


	When reached by Rolling Stone, a State Department spokesperson declined to comment on Álvarez's specific case, stating that “visa records are confidential under U.S. law.”


	Álvarez originally had his U.S. work visa revoked in 2017 after the U.S. Treasury Department alleged he — and 22 other people, including soccer player Rafa Márquez — had worked with a drug trafficker with ties to major cartels, claiming that Álvarez was a “front person” for a drug trafficking organization. Álvarez said he was only connected to the trafficker over a real estate purchase. He was later removed from the sanctions list in 2022 and was able to regain his visa this year.


	Álvarez made his highly anticipated return to the United States earlier this year with a trio of sold-out shows at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles after nearly eight years of not performing in the country.

	A press release shared by Álvarez's team Friday said that the concert had been postponed over “unforeseen circumstances” after Álvarez could not “enter the United States in time for the event.” According to the release, 50,000 tickets had been purchased for the sold-out show. Both Álvarez's team and promoters CMN and Copar Music are working to reschedule the performance.

	











	Álvarez's show postponement comes after Chicago's Michelada Fest cancelled its 2025 iteration over the uncertainty around artist visas. Other festival promoters told Rolling Stone earlier this month that they were also facing trouble announcing lineups due to this issue. “People don't want to buy tickets knowing that things might get cancelled down the line. It's really affecting us,” one fest organizer said.

Home - News - The Mysterious Bruce Mansion of Burnside

The Bruce Mansion was built in 1876 by Scottish immigrant John G. Bruce. With its stunning Victorian architecture and beautiful windows, the home was once a pinnacle of opulence in Brown City. In 1881, a massive fire broke out in Brown City, destroying nearly the whole town, but the mansion was mysteriously spared from the fire. It has been the site of many paranormal experiences throughout its nearly 150 years in existence. 

In the 1920s, John Walker bought the home. Local legend tells that Walker accidentally killed someone with his car and hid and buried the body on the property. Riddled with guilt, he fell into despair. Soon his wife had left him, and the mansion was facing foreclosure. He hanged himself in the tower cupola; however, the official cause of death is not recorded.Is Bruce Mansion Spook Central?The mansion has been a focus of curiosity for the supernatural in Michigan's Thumb and has been featured in several articles, including 8 Haunted Michigan And Spooky Sites To Visit In The Thumb.“We are excited to offer more paranormal investigations at Bruce Mansion, one of the most reportedly haunted locations in Michigan,” said Jeff Adkins, co-founder of Detroit Paranormal Expeditions. “We kicked off the Fall with a couple of events that have already sold out, so we're excited to add additional dates and provide more access to this amazing building.”Investigation the ParanormalIn 2022 the Detroit Paranormal Expeditions (DPX) conducted paranormal investigations that October at Bruce Mansion in Brown City, Michigan.

PARIS - When astronomers announced in April that they might have discovered the most promising hints of alien life yet on a distant planet, the rare good news raised hopes that humanity could soon learn we are not alone in the universe.

But several recent studies looking into the same data have found that there is not enough evidence to support such lofty claims, with one scientist accusing the astronomers of “jumping the gun”.

The debate revolves around the planet K2-18b, which is 124 light years away in the Leo constellation.

The planet is thought to be the right distance from its star to have liquid water, making it a prime suspect in the search for extraterrestrial life.

In April, astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope made headlines by announcing they had detected hints of the chemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) on the planet.

These chemicals are only produced by life such as marine algae on Earth, meaning they are considered potential “biosignatures” indicating life.

The astronomers, led by Cambridge University's Nikku Madhusudhan, expressed caution about the “hints” of a biosignature, emphasising they were not claiming a definitive discovery.

Their detection had reached a three-sigma level of statistical significance, “which means there is still a three in 1,000 chance of this being a fluke”, Dr Madhusudhan said at the time.

Two of Dr Madhusudhan's former students, Dr Luis Welbanks of Arizona State University and Dr Matthew Nixon of Maryland University, were among the researchers who have since re-analysed the data behind the announcement.

When deploying other statistical models, “claims of a potential biosignature detection vanish”, according to their preprint study published online late in April.

Like the other papers since the April announcement, it has not been peer reviewed.

In one model, Dr Welbanks and colleagues expanded the number of possible chemicals that could explain the signals detected by Webb to 90 from the original 20.

More than 50 received a “hit”, Dr Welbanks told AFP.

“When you detect everything, did you really detect anything?” he asked.

They are not saying the planet definitely does not have DMS – just that more observations are needed, Dr Welbanks added.

Dr Madhusudhan welcomed the robust debate, saying that remaining open to all possibilities is an essential part of the scientific method.

“These sort of arguments are healthy,” he told AFP.

His team even went further, releasing their own preprint study last week that expanded the number of chemicals even further to 650.

The three most “promising” chemicals they found included DMS but not DMDS – a major part of the team's announcement in April.

The other two chemicals were diethyl sulfide and methylacrylonitrile, the latter of which is toxic.

Dr Madhusudhan admitted that these little-known chemicals are likely not “realistic molecules” for a planet like K2-18b.

Dr Welbanks pointed out that “in the span of a month – with no new data, with no new models, with no new laboratory data – their entire analysis changed”.

Telescopes observe such far-off exoplanets when they cross in front of their star, allowing astronomers to analyse how molecules block different wavelengths of light streaming through their atmosphere.

Earlier this week, a paper led by Dr Rafael Luque at the University of Chicago combined Webb's observations of K2-18b in both the near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths of light.

It also found “no statistical significance for DMS or DMDS”, the paper said.

An earlier paper by Oxford astrophysicist Jake Taylor using a basic statistical test also found no strong evidence for any biosignatures. 

Dr Madhusudhan dismissed the latter paper, saying the simple exercise did not account for observing physical phenomena.

He also stood by his research, saying he was “just as confident” in the work as he was a month ago.

More data about K2-18b will come in over the next year which should offer a much clearer picture, Dr Madhusudhan added.

Even if the planet does have DMS, it is not a guarantee of life – the chemical has been detected on a lifeless asteroid. 

However, many researchers do believe that space telescopes could one day collect enough evidence to identify alien life from afar.

“We are the closest we have ever been” to such a moment, Dr Welbanks said.

“But we have to use the frameworks that are in place and build up (evidence) in a reliable method, rather than using non-standard practices and jumping the gun – as has been done in this particular case,” Dr Nixon added. AFP

Tourists are cancelling their trips abroad after a woman who has been referred to as Japan's 'Baba Vanga' made a terrifying prediction for a disaster set to strike in just two months' time. 

Baba Vanga, the renowned blind Bulgarian mystic, was known for her bleak but accurate predictions. Despite having passed away in 1996, she eerily predicted world events including the 9/11 attacks and the death of Princess Diana.

Now, Ryo Tatsuki, who has been heralded as Japan's answer to the famed prophet, has warned that 'a crack will open up under the seabed between Japan and the Philippines, sending ashore waves three times as tall as those from the Tohoku earthquake', CNN reports.

In 1999, after consistently having what she described as visions of the future, Tatsuki released her book which was titled, 'The Future I Saw'. In it, she detailed the eerie visions that she'd had, some of which have since come true.

In 2021, Tatsuki released an updated version of 'The Future I Saw' which included a prediction of a major disaster in mid-2025. 

Now, as the date draws closer, many travellers who had holidays booked to Japan for July are getting cold feet and postponing their trips or cancelling altogether.

According to CN Yuen, managing director of WWPKG, a travel agency based in Hong Kong, bookings to Japan dropped by half during the Easter holiday. 

This is expected to dip even further in the coming two months in the leadup to the premonition date.

Tourists from China and Hong Kong, which are the country's second- and fourth-largest sources of tourists, respectively, have been the most likely to cancel or postpone their Japan travel plans.

This was further exacerbated after China's embassy in Tokyo stoked concerns by releasing an official warning to Chinese citizens in late April to take caution when travelling, studying or buying real estate in Japan.

But the panic has since spread to other markets including Thailand and Vietnam, where social media platforms have been flooded with Tatsuki's prediction, warning travellers to reconsider their holidays to Japan.

Japanese officials have since attempted to quell the panic with a series of official statements to reassure travellers that these were simply 'unscientific rumours'.

'It would be a major problem if the spread of unscientific rumours on social media had an effect on tourism,' Yoshihiro Murai, governor of Miyagi prefecture, said at a press conference on Wednesday.

'There is no reason to worry because Japanese are not fleeing abroad … I hope people will ignore the rumours and visit.'

To date, Tatuski's most accurate prediction was that a major disaster would occur in March 2011. 

Sure enough, in March 2011, Japan was hit by a devastating 9.1 magnitude earthquake and tsunami in the northern Tohoku region which ended up claiming the lives of over 18,000 people.

It's also thought that the author and artist predicted the death of Queen's Freddie Mercury as well as the 1995 Kobe earthquake.

However, many remain sceptical of Tatsuki's predictions. 

Critics point out that the Manga artist has always insisted that some of her dreams are purely symbolic, including a premonition that she would die in 2000 and that Mount Fuji would erupt.

Despite this, psychics from Japan and Hong Kong have since shared similar warnings of a catastrophic disaster taking place in July 2025, inadvertently adding to the panic.

In her predictions for the Year of the Snake, feng shui master Qi Xian Yu, who is also often referred to as Master Seven, said: 'The coming year will see more natural disasters such as earthquakes and fires, and traffic and aviation accidents. We should also be careful of travelling to countries in the northeast direction, such as Japan and South Korea.'

Japan is no stranger to earthquakes, being situated along the Ring of Fire, an area that is notorious for its intense seismic and volcanic activity.

There have been mounting fears of the 'big one' ever since the Japanese government warned back in January that there was an 80 per cent chance of a severe earthquake hitting the country's southern Nankai Trough within 30 years.

According to Tokyo's metropolitan government, 'Nankai Trough earthquakes are massive quakes that have repeatedly occurred at an interval of approximately every 100 to 150 years with their epicentral areas located along the plate boundary between Suruga Bay in the central prefecture of Shizuoka and the Hyuganada Sea off the southern main island of Kyushu'. 

The Nankai Trough is a 700-kilometer long zone where the tectonic plates slip beneath each other, this means the most powerful typically occur in these zones.

The reason for the panic is because the tectonic plate under the Philippine Sea is slowly slipping beneath the continental plate that Japan sits upon. 

According to a 2013 report by the government's Earthquake Research Committee, this plate moves a few centimeters every year.

Earthquakes at the Nankai Trough have been recorded every 100 to 200 years and the last quakes took place in 1944 and 1946, which both reportedly measured 8.1 in magnitude and caused 2,500 total deaths as well as thousands thousands of injuries and destroyed homes.

Oracle Ryo claimed she began having premonitions in the early 1980s after a number of her vivid dreams came true.

Her book has recently gained renewed interest after a number of her premonitions made in hindsight appeared to mirror real life events.

She claims to have seen images of Queen frontman Freddie Mercury dying suddenly in a dream on November 24, 1976.

Exactly 15 years to the day later, the singer died aged 45 from complications of having AIDS.

She is also thought to have predicted the death of Princess Diana.

A year after later, Tatsuki claimed she had a dream in which she saw a woman standing at the end of a corridor in a palace. Stood at the end, she saw a portrait of a blonde woman holding a baby, with the picture named 'Diana'.

Five years to the day later, she claimed she had another dream about the Princess in which she saw her die in the car crash.

The prophet has previously said that her predictive dreams arrive in a period of time that can be divided by five.

Then in 1995, Tatsuki said that dreamed an old man led her to 'cracked earth', leading her to predict that the Japanese city of Kobe would be 'cracked' in either 15 days or 15 years.

And thus her prophecy came true as 15 days later, Kobe was struck by an insidious earthquake that killed more than 5,000 people. It is now considered the second deadliest earthquake of the 20th century.

Elsewhere in her book, she also predicted there would be a 'great disaster' that would occur in 2011.

It has also been alleged that Tatsuki accurately predicted the onset of the Covid pandemic.

Writing in her book, she predicted: 'In 25 years, an unknown virus will come in 2020, will disappear after peaking in April, and appear again 10 years later.'

If Tatsuki is correct, the world is yet to see the end of the virus, with another surge in cases poised for five years time.

Since a number of her predictions turned out to be true, Tatsuki has been compared to the Bulgarian prophetess, Baba Vanga.

Baba Vanga, who died aged 85 in 1996, was a blind psychic who passed away three decades ago.

She became a cult figure after supposedly predicting major world events such as 9/11, the Covid-19 pandemic and even Princess Diana's death.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

This all sounds wild.

Jamie Foxx has been feeling all the love and he continues to slide back into his work in the aftermath of his health issues. In 2023, the now- 57-year-old Foxx was hospitalized for a then-undisclosed medical issue, which was later revealed to be a stroke caused by a brain bleed. Thankfully, the actor and comedian has since recovered, and he jokes about the scary situation. Fox just shared further recollections of drugged up on pain medication in the hospital and reading conspiracy theories about his health, with some even involving P. Diddy.

When talking about his medical situation, the Back in Action star has been open about his need to remain funny during that crisis. He even recalled messing with the staff by telling jokes and even impersonating Denzel Washington. There were, however, times, at which Jamie Foxx really was out of it, as he explained during a roundtable for THR. It was also during that time that he sought to find out what “the outside world” was saying about his situation:

Yeah, it was, ‘This is for your pain, and this is so you don't remember it.' So, they Men in Black-ed me, and I'm fucked up, and this isn't funny, but I snuck in my phone because I didn't know what the outside world was saying and I couldn't get my mind around the fact that I had a stroke. I'm in fucking perfect shape. [I see things like,] ‘Puffy tried to kill me.' No, Puffy didn't try to kill me.



Jeremy Renner Recalls ‘Chatting' With Imaginary Jamie Foxx And More While On Pain Meds Following Snowplow Accident, As Well As How His Family Reacted

For some time now, there have been rumors that Puff Daddy (or Sean Combs) has used his influence to harm people. In regard to the claims regarding the Ray star, those actually predate the current legal issues that Combs is currently facing. Nevertheless, it sounds like some fans were convinced that the Sean John founder was involved in Jamie Foxx's illness. Of course, as seen above, Foxx shut down that assumption, though, months ago, he did joke about Diddy possibly being involved in some way.

There has been something of a little Foxx/Diddy saga that's persisted in recent months, though. In addition to the aforementioned barb Foxx shared about the Grammy-winning rapper, it was rumored that Diddy's arrest was linked to Foxx's medical problems. Someone claimed that during a show, Foxx confirmed he called the feds on Diddy, though other people in attendance have denied that account. Believe it or not, the Diddy drama isn't even the wildest theory linked to Foxx's health situation, as the comic shared another trippy one:

When they said I was a clone, that made me flip. I'm sitting in the hospital bed, like, ‘These bitch-ass motherfuckers are trying to clone me.' And then I saw me walk into my room, but I'm white, so I see the white me. The next morning, I said, ‘I know what's up, you're trying to clone me and make me white so I'll sell better overseas.' The psychiatrist says, ‘Are you all right?' And I say, ‘Am I all right or am I all white? I saw you trying to get the white motherfucking Jamie Foxx and it ain't going to happen.' He just calmly goes, ‘I think we're going to lower your dosage.'

I honestly can't even imagine being in his position, as the notion of being doped up on medication and reading conspiracy theories about one's self seems wild. What I'd conclude from this is that strong medication and rumor-fueled Internet conspiracy theories just don't mix. Luckily, though, the comic is back on the scene and seemingly feeling like himself again. Given his upbeat attitude, I wouldn't be surprised if he continues to joke about his hospital stay and even throws in the occasional Diddy or baby oil barb as well.

The discovery of water ice around a distant star is allowing scientists to study how the key ingredient for life is delivered to young planets beyond our solar system.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In a milestone discovery, astronomers have announced that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected water ice drifting through a dusty ring of debris surrounding a distant, sunlike star.

Astronomers have long suspected that water, especially in its frozen form, might be common in the cold, outer reaches of planetary systems beyond our own. That's because in our own solar system, Saturn's moon Enceladus, Jupiter's Ganymede and Europa, and other icy moons are known to contain vast amounts of frozen water. Some of these moons are even thought to harbor subsurface oceans of liquid water, fueling ongoing discussions about their potential to support life.

Now, with JWST's confirmation last week, scientists say they can begin exploring how water — a key ingredient for life as we know it — is distributed and transported in other planetary systems.

The new discovery centers on a star called HD 181327, located about 155 light-years away, in the constellation Telescopium. At just 23 million years old, HD 181327 is a cosmic infant compared with our 4.6 billion-year-old sun, and it's encircled by a broad, dusty debris disk that is rich in small, early building blocks of planets.

""HD 181327 is a very active system,"" study co-author Christine Chen, a research scientist at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, said in a NASA statement. Frequent collisions between icy bodies in this disk are constantly stirring up fine particles of dusty water ice, which are ""perfectly sized for Webb to detect,"" Chen said.

The findings, published May 15 in the journal Nature, suggest these ""dirty snowballs"" of ice and dust could eventually play a key role in delivering water to future rocky planets that may form over the next few hundred million years. As planets take shape within the disk, comets and other icy bodies could collide with the young worlds and shower them with water — a process thought to have helped seed early Earth with the water that sustains life today.

—James Webb telescope could find signs of life on alien 'hycean' ocean worlds

—4 tiny, Earth-like planets found circling 2nd-closest star system to us — and could be visited by future human generations

JWST revealed that most of the distant star system's water ice is concentrated in the outer regions of the disk, where temperatures are cold enough for it to remain stable. Closer in, the ice becomes increasingly scarce, likely vaporized by the star's ultraviolet radiation or locked away in larger rocky bodies known as planetesimals, which remain invisible to JWST's infrared instruments.

According to the research team, the debris disk around HD 181327 resembles what the Kuiper Belt — the vast, doughnut-shaped region of icy bodies beyond Neptune — likely looked like billions of years ago during the early stages of our solar system's evolution.

""What's most striking is that this data looks similar to the telescope's other recent observations of Kuiper Belt objects in our own solar system,"" Chen said in the statement.

The Elon Musk-owned social media platform X experienced a brief outage on Saturday morning, with tens of thousands of users reportedly unable to use the site.

About 25,000 users reported issues with the platform, according to the analytics platform Downdetector, which gathers data from users to monitor issues with various platforms. Roughly 21,000 users reported issues just after 8:30 a.m. ET, per the analytics platform.

The issues appeared to be largely resolved by around 10 a.m., but some users experienced intermittent issues with the platform until about 11 a.m.

It's the second time in less than a week that users experienced issues with the platform, after X also experienced an outage on Thursday.

""As evidenced by the uptime issues this week, major operational improvements need to be made,"" Musk wrote on X in response to a post about the Saturday outage.

""The failover redundancy should have worked, but did not.""

""Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms,"" he wrote.

The billionaire founder of Tesla and SpaceX also said that he ""must be super focused"" on the companies, ""as we have critical technologies rolling out."" 

X did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Additional information on the cause of the outage was not available.

The site has had a number of widespread outages since Musk acquired X, formerly Twitter, in 2022.

The site experienced another outage in March, which Musk attributed at the time to a ""massive cyberattack.""

""We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources,"" Musk wrote in a post at the time.

Leonardo Garcia Venegas was filming arrests of his co-workers in Alabama when officers arrested him

Authorities wrestled a US-born citizen to the ground, cuffed him and dismissed his so-called Real ID as “fake” during an arrest operation targeting undocumented people on Wednesday under the direction of the Trump administration, according to a viral video and reporting by Telemundo.

Leonardo Garcia Venegas, 25, was at his construction job in Foley, Alabama, when officials arrived to arrest workers there. Garcia Venegas – who was born in Florida to Mexican parents – began filming the arrests with his mobile phone before officials reportedly knocked the device out of his hand and tried to arrest him as well.

Video of the arrest shows three officials wrestling him to the ground, while he yells: “I'm a citizen!”

According to an interview with the Spanish-language US news outlet Telemundo, officials took out his wallet, removed his ID – which complies with higher federal security standards for state-issued driver's licenses as well as identification – and told him that it was fake.

“They cuffed me,” he said. “They put the cuffs on quite hard.”

Four people at the job site were arrested, including Garcia Venegas's brother, who is undocumented.

Officials removed the cuffs from Garcia Venegas hours later – after he gave them his social security number, verifying his US citizenship.

“I feel really sad, honestly, and I feel a bit nervous for everything that's happening,” said Garcia Venegas, referring to the Trump administration's ongoing immigration-related crackdown.

His cousin, also a US citizen, told Telemundo they both went through the process of acquiring the Real ID, undergoing “the protocols the administration is asking for”.

“I feel sad because, even though we were born here, that doesn't matter any more,” the cousin said. She added: “To have our skin color has, apparently, become a crime. And it has become a crime deserving of this type of treatment – as if we were real criminals.”

In a statement to NBC News, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused Garcia Venegas of having “interfered” with the arrest during the operation.

“Anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including US citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest,” the DHS's statement to NBC said.

It is unclear whether the officials who cuffed Garcia Venegas were local officials, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents or other members of federal law enforcement.

Since Trump came into office, various federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and others, have been tasked with carrying out immigration enforcement operations. Some local police and sheriff's departments have also been deputized to carry out federal immigration arrests.

As the White House attempts to carry out a promise of “mass deportations” that vaulted Donald Trump to victory in November's presidential election, a number of US citizens have been caught up in its dragnet.

Some, such as Garcia Venegas, have been detained by officials, then released. But others, including children, have been deported.

Although rare, the deportation of US citizens has also happened during prior administrations.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

United Steelworkers President David McCall called the move “a disaster for American Steelworkers.”

President Donald Trump on Friday signaled broad approval for Japanese steel giant Nippon's bid to purchase U.S. Steel, a reversal of his campaign-trail opposition to the merger that came a day after the United Steelworkers union implored the president to uphold his pledge to scrap the proposed deal.

In a post on his social media platform, Trump announced a “planned partnership” between U.S. Steel and Nippon, prompting confusion about the specific terms of the deal. U.S. Steel's stock jumped over 20% on the news, and both companies applauded the announcement and praised Trump.

The president wrote that U.S. Steel “will REMAIN in America” and keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh.

One unnamed person familiar with the merger negotiations told the Financial Times that the president's post was “considered ‘tacit approval'” of the $15 billion takeover deal that was first announced in late 2023. The Biden administration blocked Nippon's proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel earlier this year, and Trump opposed the merger during his 2024 presidential campaign.

Former U.S Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) called Trump's reversal “a betrayal of American workers.

United Steelworkers international president David McCall said in response to Trump's announcement that “we cannot speculate” about the details of the arrangement. But he reiterated the union's concerns that “Nippon, a foreign corporation with a long and proven track record of violating our trade laws, will further erode domestic steelmaking capacity and jeopardize thousands of good, union jobs.”

Last month, Trump ordered the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to conduct an internal review of “potential national security risks associated with the proposed transaction.” Reuters reported that the committee, which submitted its review on Wednesday, was “divided in its recommendation,” but “most panel members believe any security risks posed by the deal can be addressed.”

McCall on Thursday responded to the panel's recommendation with a scathing statement, warning that “allowing the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon, a serial trade cheater, will be a disaster for American Steelworkers, our national security, and the future of American manufacturing.”

“It is simply absurd to think that we could ever entrust the future of one of our most vital industries—essential to both national defense and critical infrastructure—to a company whose unfair trade practices continue to this day,” said McCall. “For decades, Nippon has been dumping its products into our markets, costing us thousands of good, community-supporting jobs and undermining our steelmaking capabilities.”

“Now, as it continues to make flashy promises about proposed investments, it remains clear Nippon is simply seeking to undercut our domestic industry from the inside,” he continued. “President Trump has publicly pledged to block this sale since January 2024. We now urge him to act decisively, shutting the door once and for all on this corporate sellout of American Steelworkers and defending U.S. manufacturing.”

Follow:


Novak Djokovic became just the third man in the Open era to win 100 ATP singles titles on Saturday, defeating Hubert Hurkacz 5-7, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-2) in the final of the Geneva Open.
    


            The 24-time grand slam winner joins Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer as the only men to have achieved the feat.
    


            “I want to thank my wife and my kids for coming for three days only on the school break, cutting the school for one day, just to be with me,” Djokovic said in his on court interview.
    


            “My team, the only thing I can say is thank you for being with me in the good times but also in the bad times. Today was very challenging to stay with me on the court because I was going off at you quite a lot … so I want to thank you for staying here and earning with me this victory number 100.”
    


            Since claiming his 99th title when he won the gold medal in the men's singles at the 2024 Olympics in Paris eight months ago, Djokovic has endured a difficult run of form. He has particularly struggled on clay, recently exiting the Monte-Carlo Masters and Madrid Open in his first match of each tournament.
    


            And for much of Saturday's match, it seemed as if the milestone would elude the Serb once again.
    


            At 2-2 in the first set, he was unable to capitalize on two break points and that came back to haunt him when Hurkacz took the set thanks to a double fault from Djokovic in the 12th game.
    


            But as the match progressed, Djokovic – who turned 38 on Friday – showed the kind of resolute determination which appeared to have deserted him of late, breaking Hurkacz four times in a tiebreak after each player had held serve throughout the second set.
    


            Having been broken by Hurkacz in the first game of the third set, it looked for a long time as though the win was slipping away from Djokovic again. But his quality came to the fore again, and he broke back to make it 4-4 before winning another tiebreak.
    


            “I know it's a bitter taste in the mouth to lose the match like this,” Djokovic told Hurkacz in his on-court interview afterward. “I think that you were definitely for most of the match, the better player.”
    


            The victory means that, remarkably, the Serbian's 100th title comes against a player coached by Nicolas Massú, the Chilean former world No. 9 whom Djokovic beat to win his very first ATP title in 2006.
    


            Djokovic will now turn his attention to the French Open, where he will be aiming to win a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam. He faces American Mackenzie McDonald in the first round, which begins on Sunday.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has praised the country's formidable position among global arms exporters. He emphasized that being ranked among the world's top five sellers highlights the quality of Russian-made weapons.

“Russia continues to remain among the top five leaders in the global arms market and maintains its leading export positions in many areas,” Putin said on Friday during a meeting on military and technical cooperation.

The president stated that the order portfolio for Russian military products amounts to tens of billions of dollars, and he called for a further increase in the volume of exports.

Putin highlighted the need to improve cooperation with foreign partners by offering not only specific weapons and equipment but also a broader range of services, in order to boost Russian arms exports in a highly competitive environment.

He noted that such services could include “technological cooperation and the joint development of advanced models, assistance in their repair and modernization, as well as the supply of spare parts and training of foreign professionals.”

In November, the CEO of Russia's state-run arms agency Rosoboronexport, Aleksandr Mikheev, told Vedomosti newspaper that the nation's export order portfolio remained at a record level of $55 billion in 2024. He noted that the agency signed contracts for the supply of more than 30 types of modern weapons and military equipment to foreign customers.

Earlier this month, the head of the Russian state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec, Sergey Chemezov, said that Rosoboronexport had signed over 20 contracts worth a total of about $7 billion since the beginning of the current year.

In 2024, Russia ranked second in global arms sales, with exports accounting for 12.32% of the international market, according to data compiled by the Centre for Analysis of World Arms Trade (CAWAT). The US dominated the sector (37.92%), and the other top sellers were France (6.90%), South Korea and Italy (5.10% each).

Germany's defense minister says the draft could be brought back unless more volunteers sign up for the military. Meanwhile, the suspect in a stabbing in Hamburg will be placed in psychiatric care. DW has more.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said that mandatory military service, which was scrapped in 2011, could be reinstated.

Germany has looked to strengthen its military since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

Meanwhile, a woman who was arrested after a knife attack at Hamburg's main train station on Friday that injured 18 people will be sent to a psychiatric clinic.

The head of the country's federal police has warned of rising right-wing radicalization among Germany's youth.

Here is a roundup of the top news stories from Germany on May 24, 2025:

 

Bavarian Premier Markus Söder attended a disputed pork festival in the southern German state on Saturday.

""Out and about in Lower Bavaria at the first Viechtach Pig Festival: This is a true feast of pork,"" Söder posted on X.

Animal rights activists from PETA protested against the barbecue competition in the forest town of Viechtach, close to the Czech border.

But despite the controversy surrounding the event, no serious incidents were reported between pork enthusiasts and the activists.

""Of course, no one is forced to eat meat. Everyone can eat what they want. But for me personally, a grilled piece of pork from Bavaria is simply unbeatable. A life without meat? Theoretically possible — but pointless,"" Söder added, with a smiling emoji.

Söder, who leads the center-right Christian Social Union (CSU), the sister party of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), posted photos of himself holding a sandwich of traditional fried sausage — known in Germany as a ""bratwurst"" — and standing next to a pig being spit-roasted, as well as him addressing the pork festival's attendees.

According to German news agency dpa, Viechtach mayor Franz Wittmann had introduced the idea of a barbecue competition in a bid to attract locals and tourists.

But the proposal of a meat roasting competition angered local animal rights group Vegan in Viechtach, with the small town in the headlines for months before the event.

Germany's antisemitism commissioner has called for a debate on the country's staunch support for Israel.

Protecting Israel's security and supporting its interests in international organizations is one of Germany's ""Staatsräson"" ('Reason of state').

The policy is tied to Germany's historical responsibility to Israel after the Holocaust during World War II, in which 6 million Jews were killed.

Felix Klein told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung that while protecting Israel and defending its right to exist underpin German policy, he said that support can only go so far.

""We must do everything in our power to preserve the security of Israel and Jews worldwide,"" he said. ""But we must also make it clear that this does not justify everything.""

Israel has come under increasing international pressure over its military campaign in the Gaza Strip, which it launched in response to a Hamas terror attack on southern Israel in October 2023.

In addition to over 60,000 mostly civilian deaths, the Palestinian enclave has been devastated by waves of Israeli air strikes and multiple ground invasions.

International organizations including the UN have warned of a looming famine in Gaza, after Israel imposed a blockade on humanitarian aid, including food supplies, on the Gaza Strip for weeks. Israel partially eased the blockade this week.

""Starving the Palestinians and deliberately making the humanitarian situation dramatically worse has nothing to do with safeguarding Israel's right to exist,” Klein said.

""The humanitarian situation in Gaza is catastrophic. A country that occupies a territory must ensure that the population is adequately fed, that relief supplies get through and that medical care can take place,"" he said.

The antisemitism commissioner said the fact that Israeli government officials were questioning that is ""unacceptable,"" pointing out that Israel, as a democracy, is ""bound by international law.""

""Germany can and must remind it of this,"" Klein said. 

He emphasized that Israel is entitled to defend itself against Hamas, whom he accused of ""genocidal hatred,"" but he questioned the ""proportionality"" of Israel's military action.
 

A magistrate on Saturday ordered the only suspect in a knife attack at Hamburg's Central Station to be placed in a psychiatric clinic.

According to police, the woman was arrested for attempted murder in conjunction with 15 counts of grievous bodily harm.

Earlier in the day, the German police said that there does not appear to be a political motive behind the attack, which injured 18 people.

Germany is considering bringing back military conscription from next year unless more volunteers sign up for the armed forces, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said.

In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntaggszeitung (FAS), which was published on Saturday, Pistorius outlined plans to boost Germany's understrength army.

The initial plan to boost numbers will rely on volunteers, but Pistorius warned that could change if numbers remain insufficient. Compulsory military service was scrapped in 2011.

""Our model is initially based on voluntary participation,"" Pistorius told the newspaper.

""If the time comes when we have more capacity available than voluntary registrations, then a decision may be made to make recruitment mandatory. That is the roadmap,"" he added.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine three years ago, Germany has sought to boost its defense spending and capabilities.

Some 100,000 additional soldiers are required to meet its obligations as part of the NATO military alliance.

Pistorius added that Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition government is hoping to introduce a new military service bill by January next year. 

The defense minister accompanied Merz to Vilnius last week for the official unveiling of an armored tank brigade, Germany's biggest foreign military mission since World War II.
 

Moldovan President Maia Sandu has been awarded the prestigious Theodor Heuss Award for her achievements in fostering freedom and democracy in her country.

""Sandu is the president of a small country, but she is a big model with her courage, her persistence, her commitment to the political cause of liberty and democracy,"" said Gesine Schwan from the Theodor Heuss Foundation.

Sandu, who was not personally present at the award ceremony in the southern German city of Stuttgart, but sent a video message in which she said that democracy had not just happened in Moldova but had had to be fought for.

She said that it was still fragile in her country, as in all young democracies, but was getting stronger all the time.

The citizens in the former Soviet republic had chosen the rule of law over corruption and peace over provocation, she added.

Sandu, who turned 53 on Saturday, became the president of Moldova in 2020 as the country's first female head of state. She is a strong supporter of Moldova's accession to the EU and has promoted anti-corruption measures, economic reforms and liberalization throughout her political career, as well as being a strong supporter of Ukraine as it fights the ongoing invasion by Russia.

Moldova started EU accession talks in December 2023.

The Theodor Heuss Foundation, established in 1964, is named after the Federal Republic of Germany's first chancellor and aims to promote civil courage and democracy with its award, first presented in 1965.

Former award-winners include the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas and the Russian human rights organization Memorial International.

All the people injured in Friday's knife attack at Hamburg's main rail station are now in a stable condition, police said on Saturday.

Three women, aged 24, 52 and 85, and a 24-year-old man had received life-threatening injuries in the attack by a 39-year-old female suspect who is believed to be mentally ill.

Fourteen others were also wounded, seven of them seriously.

Following the attack, the chairman of the GdP police union, Andreas Rosskopf, called for improved surveillance methods at train stations, notably the use of AI-assisted camera technology.

Such technology should ""also include behavioral recognition so that such abnormal conduct can be detected ahead of time,"" he said.

Witnesses have allegedly reported seeing the woman brandishing the knife at another site in the station before going to the platform 13/14 where the crime was committed.

Users of mobile phones in Germany are being asked to help close the last gaps in coverage throughout the country by reporting areas where reception is poor or lacking.

The initiative, organized by the federal, state and local governments, is to start on Monday and run until next Sunday.

Users can go to the free broadband measurement app of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) so that gaps in reception are noted.

""Together we will create an up-to-date picture of network availability — and thus provide a database for better mobile coverage overall,"" said Digital Minister Karsten Wildberger.

Although mobile phone coverage in Germany has much improved in recent years, there are still spots in both rural and urban areas where users are frustrated by little or no reception.

 
 

German police say a 39-year-old woman has been arrested following a mass stabbing at the busy central train station in the German city of Hamburg.

Altogether 1,676 people have been turned back at the border to Germany since conservative Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt imposed stricter frontier controls two weeks ago, according to the German news magazine Focus.

The magazine cited figures from the German Interior Ministry in its report.

Dobrindt, from the Bavarian center-right Christian Social Union (CSU), imposed the harsher controls shortly after taking office.

He said, however, that they would not be in place for the long term and that exceptions would be made for ""vulnerable groups.""

The minister said that 739 people attempting to illegally enter Germany had been sent back in the first week, a 45% increase on the 511 cases in the week before he took office.

""The current number show that the stronger border controls are working,"" he told Focus, praising what he called the ""professional and committed work of our federal police.""

The new measures have drawn criticism from several migration researchers as being both ineffective and possibly illegal under EU law.

Police have also warned that the intensified border checks are unsustainable in the long term.

Train services at Hamburg's main station have resumed normal operations after a knife attack on Friday that left 18 injured, a spokeswoman for train operator Deutsche Bahn told the DPA news agency.

A 39-year-old woman was arrested at the scene on suspicion of carrying out the attack.

She is to come before a magistrate on Saturday.

Four of the 18 wounded suffered life-threatening inuries, while six were seriously hurt, officials said.

So far, police do not believe the attack was politically or ideologically motivated but was rather the result of some kind of psychological distress on the part of the attacker.

The head of Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA), Holger Münch, has warned that young people within right-wing extremist circles are becoming increasingly radicalized.
 
""For about a year, we've increasingly seen very young people with right-wing views becoming more radicalized and forming, at times, well-organized groups to carry out serious crimes,"" Münch told the Funke media group of newspapers in remarks published on Saturday.

He said the internet was a major factor aiding the far-right scene to spread its network.

""Radicalization, recruitment and mobilization increasingly happen via social networks and right-wing forums,"" Münch said.

The BKA head said right-wing crime was posing a ""major challenge"" to security agencies but that general society also had a big role to play in reducing the threat.

His remarks follow the arrests this week of five male suspects aged 14 to 18 who were members of a far-right extremist cell alleged to have plotted violent attacks on migrants.

The head of Germany's federal crime agency, Holger Münch, has told newspapers that young people are increasingly falling under the thrall of far-right extremist ideologies, with some prepared to commit ""serious crimes.""

Meanwhile, train services at the main station in the northern port city of Hamburg have resumed full operations after disruption caused on Friday by a knife attack carried out by a suspected female assailant in which several were injured.

President Donald Trump's illegal immigrant deportation push has officials looking for new places to put illegal immigrants if their home nations won't accept their citizens back.

However, if that fails, the section also allows for the agency to remove aliens to any country that will accept them.

Talks between the United States and countries such as Honduras, Panama, and Venezuela have resulted in the nations accepting illegal immigrants that the United States needs to remove.

Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo confirmed the agreement on Feb. 5, saying that they would accept not only Guatemalan deportees but those from other nations as well.

“We have agreed to increase by 40 percent the number of flights of deportees, both of our nationality as well as deportees from other nationalities,” Arévalo said during a news conference with Rubio.

The U.S. Embassy in Panama announced on May 6 that Panama has “significantly contributed” to the U.S. government's efforts to put an end to illegal immigration by sending a flight with 81 illegal immigrants from Cameroon, Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka to their countries of origin.

The package includes financial and travel assistance back to their home countries, organized through the CBP Home App.

“If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest, and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest. DHS is now offering illegal aliens financial travel assistance and a stipend to return to their home country through the CBP Home App,” said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.

“This is the safest option for our law enforcement, aliens, and is a 70 [percent] savings for U.S. taxpayers.”

DHS has reported that even with the stipend, the cost of the removal of an illegal alien via self-deportation is around 70 percent cheaper than through Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“This was a voluntary charter flight, not an [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] operation,” DHS said in its announcement

“We are working with other countries to say, ‘We want to send you some of the most despicable human beings to your countries. Will you do that as a favor to us?'” the secretary of state said.

“And the further away from America, the better, so they can't come back across the border.”

            Iran and the United States concluded a fifth round of high-stakes nuclear talks in Rome on Friday amid growing skepticism in Tehran about the chances of a deal as Washington hardens its position.
    


            A senior Trump administration official said Friday more talks are needed and both sides agreed to meet “in the near future.”
    


            “The talks continue to be constructive – we made further progress,” the official said, “but there is still work to be done.” The US side said the discussions, which was attended by Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, lasted more than two hours.
    


            Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Friday's nuclear talks with the US “are too complicated to be resolved in two or three meetings.” He said however that Iran and US delegations “have completed one of the most professional rounds of negotiations,” in a televised interview on state-run IRIB news.
    


            Two Iranian sources have told CNN the talks seem unlikely to lead to an agreement, with the US insisting that Tehran dismantles its uranium enrichment program – a demand Iranian officials say would cause the nuclear negotiations to collapse.

            The sources said Iran's participation in the Rome talks was solely to gauge Washington's latest stance rather than pursue a potential breakthrough.
    


            Araghchi reiterated Tehran's red lines before he departed for Rome on Friday.
    


            “Figuring out the path to a deal is not rocket science,” he posted on X before his flight. “Zero nuclear weapons = we DO have a deal. Zero enrichment = we do NOT have a deal.”
    


            The Trump administration has demanded Iran stop all uranium enrichment activity, which Witkoff says “enables weaponization.” Uranium, a key nuclear fuel, can be used to build a bomb if enriched to high levels. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful and says it is willing to commit not to enrich uranium to weapons-grade as part of an agreement.
    


            Araghchi met on Friday with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi in Rome “during the continuation of this round of talks,” and the two ministers “reviewed the latest status of today's talks and consulted on how to continue the work,” Iran's foreign ministry said in a statement.
    


            “The time and place of the next round of talks will be determined and announced later,” the statement added. US officials have yet to comment publicly on the outcome of Friday's talks.
    


            Al-Busaidi, who mediated the talks, said, “We hope to clarify the remaining issues in the coming days, to allow us to proceed towards the common goal of reaching a sustainable and honourable agreement,” in a post on X on Friday.
    


            On Saturday, a senior Iranian lawmaker told CNN that Tehran is disappointed with the progress of nuclear talks and is considering a “Plan B” if they fail – though he did not specify what it would entail.
    


            “We do not have hope yet, because the American side is still insisting on zero enrichment and I know the Islamic Republic of Iran will never agree with zero enrichment,” Ebrahim Rezaei, a member of the parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said in an interview at the Iranian parliament Saturday. “I got disappointed and do not have much hope that the negotiations will lead to a deal. We are preparing for plan B.”
    


            Rezaei said it was too early to judge whether the talks could succeed. “So far we have not seen much seriousness on their (US') part,” he added.
    


            Speaking Thursday, Araghchi said Iran was open to enhanced monitoring by international inspectors but would not relinquish its right to pursue nuclear energy, including uranium enrichment. Washington is offering to wind back crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for de-nuclearization.
    


            The US had previously sent mixed signals about whether Iran would be allowed to enrich uranium, but in recent weeks it has hardened its stance, insisting that no enrichment will be permitted.
    


            That shift has prompted officials in Tehran to question Washington's commitment to a deal, as Iran has repeatedly said enrichment is a red line in negotiations.
    


            The two Iranian sources told CNN that Tehran harbors mounting doubts about the US' sincerity in talks.

            “The media statements and negotiating behavior of the United States has widely disappointed policy-making circles in Tehran,” the sources said in a joint message. “From the perspective of decision-makers in Tehran, when the US knows that accepting zero enrichment in Iran is impossible and yet insists on it, it is a sign that the US is fundamentally not seeking an agreement and is using the negotiations as a tool to intensify pressure.”
    


            Initially, the sources noted, some Iranian officials believed Washington might seek a “win-win” compromise. However, a consensus has emerged that the Trump administration is steering discussions toward a deadlock.
    


            The sources said that although neither the US nor Iran wants to leave the negotiating table, the position of the US is making the talks unproductive and formal meetings are unlikely to continue much longer.
    


            They said that Tehran no longer takes seriously US efforts to distance itself from Israel's hardline stance on Iran, and it sees proposals made by the American side as following the agenda of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has insisted that no enrichment be allowed in Iran.
    


            Witkoff on Friday met with Ron Dermer, a confidant of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Rome on the sidelines of talks, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN.
    


            Washington has kept up the pressure on Iran with fresh sanctions and threats of war even as diplomatic talks continue.
    


            On Wednesday, the US State Department announced new measures, identifying Iran's construction sector as being “controlled directly or indirectly” by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and 10 strategic materials that it said Iran is using in connection with its nuclear, military or ballistic missile programs.
    


            “With these determinations, the United States has broader sanctions authorities to prevent Iran from acquiring strategic materials for its construction sector under IRGC control and its proliferation programs,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said.
    


            Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson criticized US Secretary of State Marco Rubio for the move, calling it “as outrageous as it is unlawful and inhuman.”
    


            “The US's consecutive rounds of sanctions only reinforce our people's deeply held belief that the American decision makers are set to make every malign effort to hinder Iran's development & progress. These sanctions, announced on the eve of the fifth round of Iran-US indirect talks, further put to question the American willingness & seriousness for diplomacy,” Baqaei wrote on X.
    


            Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group in Brussels, said there is a misguided perception in Washington that a weakened Iran is more likely to compromise.
    


            “The weaker Iran is, the more reluctant it will be to make major concessions,” he said, adding that it is unlikely that Tehran will agree to a deal that is based solely on US terms.
    


            “That's a complete misreading of Iranian psychology,” Vaez said. For Iran, capitulation is seen as a worse than an Israeli strike on its nuclear facilities, he added.
    


            “Iran would be reluctant to make concessions from a position of weakness, because if it does so, then it will put itself on a slippery slope that could result in regime collapse,” Vaez said.
    


            Multiple American officials told CNN this week that the US has obtained new intelligence suggesting that Israel is preparing to strike Iranian nuclear facilities even as the Trump administration pursues a diplomatic deal with Tehran.

            But threats of war will only lead to Iran “doubling down on its current position,” Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at London's Chatham House think tank, told CNN. “The best way to invigorate the talks would be through backchannelling and quiet discussions between both sides.”
    


            In an interview with CNN's Jim Sciutto on Thursday, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee signaled potential American support for Israel's nuclear plans under the right conditions.
    


            “I can't imagine the US would object to a sovereign nation defending itself against what they perceive as a legitimate threat to their very lives,” Huckabee said.
    


            He acknowledged that the US is aware Israel is making preparations for potential military action.
    


            “We certainly are aware of what the Israelis are at least preparing for. But it's not that they have made a firm decision. I think they recognize they face an existential threat from Iran.”
    


            Experts say an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities would likely spell the end of its negotiations with the US, and could even prompt Tehran to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which promotes nuclear disarmament.
    


            Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, said the Trump administration has “unnecessarily walked themselves into a dead-end by insisting on zero enrichment,” fueling the idea that Israeli strikes will follow if Iran doesn't back down. Iran, he added, is probably not taking those threats seriously.
    


            But if they do materialize in the midst of nuclear talks with the US, he said, Tehran is likely to respond with massive retaliation. “They won't play the patience game any longer,” Parsi said.
    


            “If the Israelis were to do anything, it has to be clearly understood that it is not about destroying the program at this point, because they don't have that capability.” Parsi added. “It is only about destroying diplomacy.”

President Donald Trump gives his commencement speech to graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy.

President Donald Trump told U.S. Military Academy graduates at West Point's commencement ceremony that they are all winners. 

""Let me begin by saying congratulations to the West Point Class of 2025,"" Trump said in a high-energy address at Michie Stadium in New York. You are winners. Every single one of you. Today I can proudly say mission accomplished, great job.""

Trump took to the stage to a loud chorus of ""USA, USA"" chants. The speech to the 2025 graduation class marks the first military commencement address of Trump's second term.

GRADING TRUMP: WHERE THE PRESIDENT STANDS IN THE EYES OF AMERICANS FOUR MONTHS INTO HIS SECOND TERM

He told the 1,002 graduating cadets that the academy is the ""most elite and storied military academy in human history.""

Trump railed against previous foreign policy initiatives. He declared to end critical race theory, DEI initiatives and men in women's sports while vowing to promote a return to merit-based systems and traditional military values.

""The job of the U.S. is not to host drag shows or transform foreign countries, to spread democracy to everybody around the world at the point of a gun. The military's job is to dominate and foe and annihilate any threat to America, anywhere, anytime and anywhere.""

He emphasized ""peace through strength,"" a common mantra he often uses and committed to helping build up the military.

""If the United States is under attack, the army will obliterate our opponents with overwhelming strength and devastating force,"" Trump said. ""That's why this nation has begun a colossal buildup of the United States armed forces, a buildup like you never had before."" 

""Because as much as you want to fight, I'd rather do it without having to fight. I just want to look at them and have them fold -- and that's happening.""

He announced a $1 trillion military buildup, including new stealth aircraft, tanks and a state-of-the-art ""Golden Dome"" missile defense shield, all which he declared would be ""Made in America."" He said the dome would be finished by the time he leaves office. 

Trump called Cadet Chris Verdugo on stage after announcing that he had ""smashed"" an international record for an 18-and-a-half-mile march, as well as Cadet Ricky McMahon, a fourth-generation West Point graduate whose father served in Iraq.

The president also celebrated Army football victories, noting wins over Navy and Air Force and national team rankings in what was a typical Trump speech, blending his unique blend of bravado, showmanship and crowd engagement.

Trump also offered personal advice which he said would be a recipe for success for the cadets. 

He told cadets to ""do what you love, ""think big,"" and ""work hard,"" citing an athlete who said the harder he worked, the luckier he got. He also told cadets to ""never lose momentum"" and to ""never give up.""

Trump also praised his administration for closing the border and said that the U.S. had been ""invaded"" over the last few years.

The academy is best-known for producing Army officers including Gen. George S. Patton and Gen. Douglas MacArthur as well as Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Some of its graduates have gone on to become CEOs of major companies, such as Jim Kimsey, founder of AOL; Bob McDonald, former CEO of Procter & Gamble; and Alex Gorsky, CEO of Johnson & Johnson.

Bill Smead was driving around Northern Alabama on Thursday, pitching potential clients on why it's an optimal time to buy into his Smead Value Fund (SMVLX).

He knows it may not be an easy sell. His energy and homebuilder holdings have gotten hammered recently, and the fund has had a rough 12 months. Since May last year, it's down 11% while the S&P 500 has risen 10%.

But to Smead, that's the point. Every investment discipline has its hard times, and it's during those periods when investors make money. The opposite is also true, he argues: When an investment is soaring, the likelihood that the outperformance continues decreases.

That's why Smead is warning against investing in the S&P 500, which remains just below its all-time highs.

""Even though the index has been a really good idea from 1981 to now in a rising market, every investment discipline goes through cold stretches,"" Smead said. ""The longer it goes on making people rich, the more likely it is for a catch-up period.""

One would probably expect Smead, a value manager, to question the merits of investing in a growth-led index like the S&P 500. But he has the long-term track record to lend him credibility — over the last 15 years, he's beaten 94% of similar funds, according to Morningstar data. In 2021, Smead crushed the market by returning 40% by betting heavily on unloved economic reopening stocks and ignoring pandemic darling tech stocks.

Valuations also support Smead's concerns. The Shiller cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, which measures the current price of stocks relative to a 10-year rolling average of earnings, is at one of its highest-ever levels.

According to a March report from Invesco, from 1983 to 2015, the Shiller CAPE ratio has explained 78% of the S&P 500's forward 10-year returns. When valuations have been high, returns over the next decade have been low, and vice versa.

Smead also points to the momentum factor as a source for his unease about the S&P 500.

Lisa Shalett, the chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, noted earlier this year that while the S&P 500 rose 23% in 2024, the momentum factor was up 58%. That shows that a FOMO attitude is driving the market, she said, and prices are surging at a pace well ahead of earnings growth.

Steve Sosnick, the chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said in a client note on Thursday that we've seen ""one of the most powerful momentum surges that I can remember"" in the weeks since Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs were paused.

But market conditions have more or less been momentum-driven since the Great Recession stock-market bottom in 2009, Smead said. Eventually, he warns, things will turn in the other direction.

""The momentum of the last 15 years is the biggest momentum market in US history — bigger than the roaring '20s, bigger than the go-go '60s, and bigger than the dot-com bubble in a wide variety of ways in measuring it,"" he said. ""I don't trust the S&P 500 farther than I can throw it.""

""This is maybe the most dangerous market of my career, and that includes 1987's crash, that includes the savings and loan debacle market of the early '90s, that includes the 1999 to 2009 lost decade in the S&P 500 in the dot-com bubble,"" he continued. ""This is the most difficult market of my 45 years.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Ukraine is using helium-filled balloons to extend the range of its attack drones","https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-using-helium-balloons-extend-range-attack-drones-russia-aerobavovna-2025-5","Sat, 24 May 2025 08:00:00 GMT","

Against the backdrop of Ukraine's drone-packed skies, one startup is offering a surprisingly low-tech solution to a modern problem.

Aerobavovna, which was founded in 2023, is supplying Ukraine's military with tethered, helium-filled balloons equipped with airborne radio repeaters, extending the range and effectiveness of the country's drones.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict has been defined by drone warfare, but drone operators have faced a number of challenges, including line-of-sight obstacles, which can cause drones to lose contact if radio signals are disrupted, and electronic warfare systems, which can jam communications.

That's where Aerobavovna comes in.

The company's aerostats are designed for surveillance, communication, and first-person-view (FPV) drone signal transmission, and help establish stable communication signals in the battlefield's tricky conditions.

Fitted with antennas and radio repeaters, Aerobavovna's aerostats anchor high over the battlefield to help Ukrainian drones continue operating in spite of obstacles and to maintain comms over much greater distances.

You need ""some kind of airborne radio repeater that allows drones to fly closer to the ground,"" Yuriy Vysoven, Aerobavovna's CEO, told Business Insider.

""For ground drones, it's crucial because their ground-to-ground signal would only reach the first hill; beyond that, you lose direct line of sight and, consequently, the connection,"" he said, adding that about 50 balloons were deployed ""all around the front line"" in Ukraine.

While aerostats aren't new technology, Aerobavovna's products have been designed to meet the demands of the modern battlefield, allowing for rapid deployment times.

Aerobavovna's balloons, which the firm says can be deployed in five to 25 minutes, are made with lightweight polymers and can remain airborne for up to seven days. They can lift repeater systems up to a height of 1 km (about 0.6 miles) and carry a payload of up to 25 kg (around 55 lbs), the company said.

The company, which says it produces around 10 to 20 balloons per month, recently announced that it had developed a new aerostat capable of carrying more advanced equipment.

In an interview with the Ukrainian outlet Militarnyi, engineers from Aerobavovna said they had created a new model that can hold a payload of up to 66 lbs, enabling it to carry more powerful equipment such as electronic warfare systems.

While the company has found success supplying tethered aerostats to the Ukrainian military, it continues to grapple with technical and structural hurdles as it scales.

One persistent challenge is maintaining stability and precision in airborne conditions, especially critical for payloads like FPV drone radio repeaters, which require highly accurate antenna positioning.

""Stability is a big problem,"" Vysoven said. ""For FPV drone radio repeaters, you need to position the antennas really, really precisely,"" but wind and turbulence make that very hard.

Funding also remains a major constraint.

Despite strong demand and a battlefield-proven product, capital is scarce for Ukrainian hardware startups.

Vysoven said the company has received investment offers in the range of $40 million, but considers that far below what's needed and called that figure ""a shame.""

""In California, you can raise that with just a pitch deck and a latte. I have a real product, 30 engineers building it, and it's already deployed,"" he said.

""And we still struggle to raise enough to scale,"" he added.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with James Crosby, a 26-year-old Deloitte consultant from Arlington, Virginia. It's been edited for length and clarity.

Online sports betting is legal in some states. Before participating, verify the legality in your specific state.

My first month doing arbitrage betting, I made a little over $2,000. The second month, I made about $2,500. This month, I'm on track to bring in more than $4,000 in pure profit.

The process is pretty straightforward: I've opened accounts on about 12 different sportsbook platforms, like FanDuel and DraftKings, and I pay to subscribe to a service call OddsJam, which helps me find the best bets. Once I've found them, I strategically bet against myself so I always turn a profit. I only use US sites.

Last week, I bet on Alex Ovechkin for the Capitals versus the Hurricanes playoff game in hockey. On one sports betting platform, I bet $100 to win $150 that Alex Ovechkin would get over three and a half shots on goal. That meant my total payout would be $250 because I would get my $100 back plus the $150 in profit.

During the same game, on another betting site, I had the exact opposite bet, where I bet Alex would get under three and a half shots on goal. The chances were betting $130 to win $119, so my total payout would be $249.

So, for both bets, I had a total wager of $230. But because one of the bets had to win and the other bet had to lose, my payout would either be $249 or $250, and I was guaranteed either $19 or $20 in profit, depending on the outcome.

Most of the time, I'm betting between $50 and $100 to win $3 to $4, but it all adds up.

For the returns I'm getting, I needed initial capital of about $20,000 and maybe one to two hours per day. But anyone can really be profitable with this.

The name of the game is maximizing your return on investment, so the more that you put in, the more profitable you will be. Each one of the bets you're making is going to have a profit margin between 3% and 4% — so if you have $1,000, you're going to make $30 or $40 bucks. If you only have $100, you're going to make $3 or $4. Even paying for the subscription to OddsJam, it really does pay for itself very quickly.

Online arbitrage betting is legal, depending on the state you're in, but of course, the sportsbook sites don't really like it because they're losing money. Each platform has different terms of service, but when they catch you — and they will because they have algorithms dedicated to detecting these kinds of bets — your account will probably get restricted so you can't bet as much money. That means you'll have to play more often or bet on more games to see the same returns.

If you're betting on very obscure sports that aren't usually bet on — like you're betting $2,000 that some cricket game in India is going to go a certain way — they're going to be able to figure out that you're probably arbitraging. So you can kind of mitigate the risk by not taking bets that are super obscure and just doing more main lines that are very, very common, which will help you remain undetected for a while.

I would say you could probably last a week or two on average before the casinos catch on. I lasted around two weeks on most of my sports books, but there were a couple that got me within three or four days, so I wasn't able to be super profitable on them, but it was still fun in the first couple of days to take advantage of the bigger bets.

You'd think it would probably be in the site's best interest to disband your account if you were just exploiting them and taking money from them. But, as arbitrage betters, we actually do provide a little bit of value to the sportsbook sites, because they can study an arbitrage player's activity for signals on where they can tighten up their odds.

It's actually kind of like a value feedback loop where we provide a service — almost like consulting — and help them make sure that other players aren't taking advantage of them and getting bets at a better value than they should be, which allows them to stay more profitable over time, and in return, they allow us to use their platform to place these bets, knowing that we'll probably squeeze out a little bit of profit.

I learned about arbitrage betting from my roommate, who has been doing it for years. He's been averaging between $30,000 and $40,000 a year with this side hustle and bought himself a Tesla with his winnings. I knew he was doing it, but I was always kind of skeptical of the time commitment that it would take, the amount of starting capital I would need, and the learning curve behind it, because it seemed kind of complex.

I finally started in March because I figured I would just give it a shot. I wanted an easy way to earn extra money because I've been worried about the job market. It ended up being really, really easy once I put a little bit of time into it, and it wasn't overly complicated, so my roommate and I started a blog and social media channels to teach other people our strategy.

One thing you have to keep in mind is taxes. Every state and player is different, but I know that I'll have to pay taxes of around 20% of my earnings. So I've accounted for that, and I put that portion in a fund that's allocated to low-risk stocks, so hopefully I don't lose any of that money. But even taking that money into account, it feels worthwhile.

I'm assuming I'll be able to keep this going because my roommate's been doing it for years, and he's been able to remain profitable. So there's no end in sight, hopefully. I'm hoping that in the future, my winnings could serve as a down payment on a house, a wedding ring for my girlfriend, a new car, or just, you know, a fallback fund if things go really south and I lose my job or something like that especially with the economy the way it is.

I have no idea exactly where I'll spend the money, but my plan is to save it and invest it wisely.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Joe Tsai said Asian companies can look to inter-Asia opportunities and the European market for growth as tensions between Washington and Beijing persist. 

During a tech conference in Macau on Saturday, Tsai also called out “some governments” who “try to tear down this bridge that we have built between Asia and the rest of the world.” While he didn't specify which administrations he was referring to, the comments come against the backdrop of President Donald Trump's trade war that has roiled markets and sparked retaliatory levies from other governments, as well as increased global scrutiny on Chinese corporates.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Liverpool FC's potential signing of German football star Florian Wirtz for a purported €150 million ($170 million) would not only leave Bayern Munich in the lurch, it's also likely to rekindle debate about the Bundesliga's ability to compete with Europe's more lucrative leagues for talent.

The 22-year-old attacking midfielder, who was widely expected to join the German champions next season after helping to power home team Bayer Leverkusen to its first-ever league title a year ago, has signaled his preference to move to Anfield after talks with both clubs, Bild newspaper reported on Saturday.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

President Donald Trump touted his administration's changes to the military during a commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point on Saturday that at times resembled a campaign-style speech.

""You are the first West Point graduates of the golden age of America,"" Trump, wearing his trademark red, 'Make America Great Again' hat, said to the graduating class.

""This is the golden age, and you are going to lead the army to summits of greatness that has never reached before,"" he added.

During remarks that spanned almost an hour, Trump promoted an ""America First"" worldview and he touted the strength of the U.S. military, which he claimed credit for bolstering.

He told the graduates they are becoming ""officers in the greatest and most powerful army the world has ever known.""

""And I know, because I rebuilt that army, and I rebuilt the military, and we rebuilt it like nobody has ever rebuilt it before in my first term,"" Trump said.

His remarks mixed elements of a traditional graduation speech, such as advice to the students, with aspects reminiscent of his 2024 campaign speeches, including criticisms of his predecessors.

Trump also used the remarks to highlight his administration's achievements.

""The military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America, anywhere, anytime and any place,"" he said.

""A big part of that job is to be respected again, and you are, as of right now, respected more than any army anywhere in the world,"" he continued.

He accused past administrations of sending some U.S. soldiers ""on nation building crusades to nations that wanted nothing to do with us.""

Trump's remarks come as his administration has zeroed in on military academies as part of its broader crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programs (DEI) across the country.

He praised those efforts during his address. ""We've liberated our troops from divisive and demeaning political trainings,"" Trump said.

West Point eliminated a number of cultural clubs, such as the Asian-Pacific Forum Club, the Japanese Forum Club and the Latin Cultural Club, following Trump's executive order removing DEI programs from the military, NBC News reported.

The Pentagon has also directed military academies, including West Point, to remove books that include mentions of racism or sexism from their libraries, according to the New York Times.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Saturday praised U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to boost U.S. technology as the leading chipmaker announced a partnership with a group of Swedish businesses to develop AI infrastructure in Sweden.

Nvidia will provide its latest generation AI data center platform to a group of Swedish companies, including telecoms gear maker Ericsson and drug developer AstraZeneca.

Nvidia has announced a number of similar partnerships in recent weeks in Saudi Arabia and the UAE after the Trump administration rescinded a rule put in place by former President Joe Biden that would have restricted exports of AI chips.

Huang, who had earlier called controls ""a failure,"" said Trump wanted U.S. firms to ""win.""

""American technology companies were very successful in China four years ago, we have lost about 50% of the market share and competitors have grown,"" he said on Saturday in Norrkoping, where he was due to receive an honorary doctorate from Linkoping University.

""The President would like American technology to win with Nvidia and American companies to sell chips all over the world and to generate revenues, tax revenues, invest and build in the United States,"" he said.

The Trump administration has introduced sweeping tariffs, saying they would stimulate growth, bring home manufacturing jobs and raise tax revenues.

Many businesses and economists, though, have warned tariffs could have the opposite effect and lead to a recession in the United States and a global downturn by pushing up costs, upending supply chains and hurting consumer and business confidence.

Huang said many policies related to re-industrialization were ""very visionary.""

""Manufacturing in the United States, securing our supply chain, having real resilience, redundancy and diversity in our manufacturing supply chain — all of that is excellent,"" he said.

As the Bitcoin price skyrockets past former all-time highs (ATH), one technical analyst has ignited a wave of excitement across the crypto community with his bold new prediction. According to the forecast, Bitcoin could blow off to an astonishing $325,000 price peak — and the most shocking aspect of this analysis is not just the price target but the accelerated timeline for this meteoric rise. 

Bitcoin Price To Peak At $325K?

The $325,000 Bitcoin price forecast by Gert van Lagen, a prominent crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter) is based on a technical analysis chart spanning BTC's movements from 2009 and 2025. The chart applies Elliott Wave Theory on a High Time Frame (HTF), tracking a massive five-wave impulsive structure, with each wave representing a major bullish cycle driven by halving events. 

Lagen disclosed that Bitcoin is currently in Wave 5, the last wave of this mega-cycle, suggesting that the market is on the verge of its final parabolic blow-off. 

Each of Bitcoin's past bull markets, according to the analysis, has ended with a near-vertical explosive surge, where price accelerates rapidly before crashing into a corrective phase. This surge has always been defined by a price angle of at least 82 degrees from the bottom. 



The crypto analyst has drawn a trendline connecting the peaks of Wave 1 and 2, creating a rising wedge pattern. The lower boundary of this wedge is represented by the 210,000 block SMA, which acts as a long-term support. 

Additionally, the upper trendline of this wedge intersects with the forecasted market top of Wave 5, which sits at around $325,000. Notably, this bullish prediction relies heavily on Bitcoin maintaining strong momentum and completing Wave 5 as a single clean impulse move, without any deviation or elongation, just like past cycles. 

Lagen's bold $325,000 price forecast for Bitcoin comes with an exceptionally near-term timeline. The market expert predicts that BTC could reach this ambitious target as soon as July 5, 2025, which is just over a month away. 

Interestingly, this timeline is grounded in the movements observed in previous post-halving cycles. The analyst's projected trajectory of Bitcoin's surge to a market top also aligns closely with the past patterns that followed each Bitcoin halving cycle. 

These halving events have triggered strong bull markets during past cycles. The current rally also follows Bitcoin's fourth and most recent halving event, which took place on April 20, 2024, reinforcing the repetitive and cyclic nature of Bitcoin's price movements. 

A Historic Correction Could Follow This Price Surge

Beyond the dramatic $325,000 Bitcoin price prediction, Lagen's analysis also carries a foreboding bearish outlook. He cautions that after Bitcoin reaches this projected market top, what comes next may be a high time frame price crash, possibly lasting several years. 

Once the five-wave structure is completed, Lagen expects Bitcoin to enter its first true Wave 2 correction at the highest degree. Historically, Wave 2 retracements are deep, and given the current backdrop of global tightening and recession risks, the post-peak environment could challenge even the most seasonal holders.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is establishing itself as a key player in the global cryptocurrency economy and setting trends rather than following them in the digital currency space, Pakistan Crypto Council's (PCC) Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib said on Friday.

Mr Saqib told a private news channel that the country is gaining recognition from international tech companies and investors for its  growing potential in digital and crypto finance

“For the first time, we are not standing behind the world but we are establishing our own trend in the digital currency landscape,” CEO said. He added, “Global tech leaders and companies are now looking toward Pakistan to explore its crypto potential.”

Mr Saqib emphasised the enthusiasm of Pakistani youth for crypto adoption, suggesting the nation could spearhead digital finance in the region. “Pakistan has the potential to become a regional leader in digital finance, exporting innovation and becoming an epicentre for emerging markets,” he said.

Says country has the potential to become ‘regional leader in digital finance'

He also pointed to the creation of Pakistan's Digital Assets Authority as a key  step towards “strong and smart regulation.”

The objective, Mr Saqib explained, “is to ensure that global-level companies can now be built in Pakistan, not just in the U.S. or Europe.”

PCC chief stressed the importance of empowering Pakistani freelancers and tech followers to become entrepreneurs. “Pakistan is progressing in this space faster than  neighbouring countries,” he said, asserting that “the world is  recognising our place in the digital economy.”

London, United Kingdom, May  24, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 



May 22, 2025, sees a major boom in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,404. This is propelled by rising institutional investments and optimism about upcoming U.S. rules for digital assets. Ripple's XRP has also experienced significant increases, trading at approximately $2.65, supported by a good market sentiment and possible regulatory progress.

In this changing environment, cloud mining has become a practical path for investors looking for passive income free from the headaches of conventional mining arrangements. ZA Miner distinguishes itself in this field by giving users simple access to mine Bitcoins and Dogecoin, among other currencies. The platform offers a straightforward and sustainable answer for anyone wishing to take advantage of the rapidly expanding crypto market with a user-friendly platform, a $100 free mining contract for new users, and operations driven by renewable energy.

Skip the Hardware, Keep the Profits: How Cloud Mining Works

Cloud mining provides a hassle-free approach to mining cryptocurrencies by renting computational capacity from remote data centers. Thus, people do not need to buy or maintain mining equipment themselves. Cloud mining, as opposed to conventional mining techniques, transfers the technical and logistical responsibility to third-party suppliers rather than calling for major investment in specialist equipment.

Users who run large-scale mining farms sign agreements with cloud mining companies. They pay fees depending on the level of computing (or hash) power they want to use; these suppliers manage all the gear and operational chores. In return, they get a share of the mined cryptocurrency; payouts usually depend on the state of the market and the user's chosen power allocation.

For instance, a person wishing to mine Ripple (XRP) might pick a mining strategy designed for a certain length and hash rate. The provider attributes this capability to its mining methods; earnings are allocated proportionately depending on the user's contract length.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has stabilized following significant price volatility, establishing a consolidation pattern between $0.00001440 and $0.00001456. 

The meme token faced intense selling pressure with volume reaching 1.72 trillion during peak decline, but multiple tests of support at $0.00001440 showed strong buyer interest. 

Despite short-term fluctuations, blockchain data reveals remarkable holder loyalty, with over 1.13 million addresses maintaining their positions for more than a year, signaling confidence in SHIB's long-term prospects. 

The Shiba Inu ecosystem continues development with a significant Shibarium blockchain update focused on improving decentralization. This aligns with the team's strategy to enhance utility beyond meme status. 

While technical indicators show mixed signals with moderate bullish momentum but lacking strong breakout confirmation, AI predictions from platforms like Google's Gemini suggest potential growth to $0.00003 by 2025, representing a possible 105.9% increase from current levels.Technical Analysis Highlights

Welcome back to Week in Review! Tons of news from this week for you, including a hacking group that's linked to the Spanish government; CEOs using AI avatars to deliver company earnings; Pocket shutting down — or is it?; and much more. Let's get to it! 

More than 10 years in the making: Kaspersky first revealed the existence of Careto in 2014, and at the time, its researchers called the group “one of the most advanced threats at the moment.” Kaspersky never publicly linked the hacking group to a specific government. But we've now learned that the researchers who first discovered the group were convinced that Spanish government hackers were behind Careto's espionage operations.

23andWe: Regeneron announced this week that it's buying genetic testing company 23andMe for $256 million, including the company's genomics service and its bank of 15 million customers' personal and genetic data. The pharma giant said it plans to use the customer data to help drug discovery, saying that it will “prioritize the privacy, security, and ethical use of 23andMe's customer data.” Let's hope so!

Google I/O: Google's biggest developer conference typically showcases product announcements from across Google's portfolio, and to nobody's surprise, AI was the talk of the town. But what we didn't bank on was Sergey Brin admitting that he made “lots of mistakes” with Google Glass. 

This is TechCrunch's Week in Review, where we recap the week's biggest news. Want this delivered as a newsletter to your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here.

io, not I/O: OpenAI is acquiring io, the device startup that CEO Sam Altman has been working on with Jony Ive, in an all-equity deal that values that startup at $6.5 billion. Besides the fact that the announcement was accompanied by perhaps the strangest corporate headshot of all time, we spotted some other unexpected news: Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski's family investment office, Flat Capital, had bought shares in io six months earlier, which means those io shares will be converted into shares in the for-profit arm of OpenAI. Not bad!

AI avatar contagion? Speaking of Klarna's CEO, Siemiatkowski used an AI version of himself to deliver the company's earnings this week. And he's not the only one! Zoom CEO Eric Yuan followed suit, also using his avatar for initial comments. Cool?

Out of Pocket: Mozilla is shutting down Pocket, the beloved read-it-later app, on July 8. The company didn't say why it's shutting Pocket down, only that it will continue to invest in helping people discover and “access high quality web content.” But maybe it can be saved: Soon after, Digg founder Kevin Rose posted on X that his company would love to buy it. Web 2.0 is back, baby.  

AI on my face: Apple is reportedly working on AI-powered glasses, similar to Meta's Ray-Bans, sometime next year. They'll have a camera and microphone and will work with Siri. Sure, why not? 

Uh, no thank you: At its very first developer conference, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, which can analyze large datasets, execute long-horizon tasks, and take complex actions, according to the company. That's all fine and good until I learned the Claude Opus 4 model tried to blackmail developers when they threaten to replace it with a new AI system. The model also gives sensitive information about the engineers responsible for the decision. 

Ah, now I feel better: But don't worry! Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that today's AI models hallucinate at a lower rate than humans do. That might be true, but at least humans don't immediately turn to blackmail when they don't like what they hear. 

Bluesky blue checks: The decentralized social network Bluesky quietly rolled out blue verification badges for “notable and authentic” accounts. People can now apply for verification through a new online form. But Bluesky is leaning on other systems beyond the blue badge to verify users. 

Google's new look: For what seems like 100 years, Google hasn't changed much. Sure there are ads and boxes and now AI summaries that, for better or worse, get you to the right answers — usually. But the premise has always been the same: Type your query into a box, and Google will surface results. 

At this year's Google I/O, we started noticing a change. As Maxwell Zeff, writes, “At I/O 2025, Google made clear that the concept of Search is firmly in its rearview mirror.” The largest announcement of I/O was that Google now offers AI mode to every Search user in the United States, which means users can have an AI agent search (or even purchase things) for them.

- I'm not sure whether the headline was manipulative, but I expected some sort of miracle healing story where the ""boy came back"" by recovering 100% after the brush with death. As the narrative ended, I became irate that ""changed life"" meant living with the subsequent impairments.- Nodding at the comment about ""lest we try to finish the job"" because of the various scandals accusing parents of the hoax ""shaken baby syndrome"" or turning them the wrong way while they slept- Reminded again that Dr. House and Doc Martin are pure fiction, and NHS docs can't diagnose their way out of a paper sack -- another imaginary ""SIDS"" and even this time we have ""SIDS without the D but call it SIDS anyway because we don't really care how it happened if it weren't criminal malevolent parents"".- Empathized with the perspective of the utterly bewildered naïvete of an obviously devoted and sensitive husband-father. He's thrust into a medical emergency unprepared and trying to deal with screaming, uncertain futures, a conga line of health care professionals, and the machines they wield, and the promises they can't make.

> accounts I have read from people with disabilities and their parents: would you undo it? In one sense, it's an idiotic query … If I could press a button that made Max's life easier by granting him everything he has been denied, I would do it in a second.For some reason there is this social pressure to express “I wouldn't trade it for the world because he is perfect just as he is”. Yes he is perfect in his own way, but the idea that you wouldn't trade it for perfect health is BS.The other thing that struck me is how many idiotic things people say to parents in these situations. (We haven't experienced that though, I guess we've been lucky).

If you want to keep up with all the big game releases of the year, you're not going to be able to do that without either immediately deleting them after playing or by expanding your storage capacity. When new titles clock in at over 100GB, you need to make some tough choices in terms of what gets to stay around. The easy solution it to just get yourself a much bigger solid state drive.

The Samsung 990 Pro SSD heavily discounted at the moment over at Amazon: The savings range from $60 to $163 off depending on the exact version you get, be it 1TB, 2TB, or 4TB. For instance, the 1TB model is available for $99 on Amazon, which is a almost a 40% discount from its regular price of $159, while the 4TB version has dropped to $309 from $464. The 2TB model is also on sale for $169, down 34% from its $249 original price.

See 4TB internal SSD at Amazon

Say goodbye to long load times in the games you play: The Samsung 990 Pro Gen 4 SSD is designed for superior performance with fast speeds while maintaining power efficiency. It has read speeds of up to 7,450 MB/s and write speeds of up to 6,900 MB/s. This generation 4 SSD from Samsung will help you achieve this high performance while using less power overall. Compared to the 980 Pro, the 990 Pro is capable of up to 50% improved performance per watt. Great for not just gaming, but any intensive workflows like video editing or working with large datasets.

Gaming consoles need the extra space just as much as gaming PCs do. The original PlayStation 5 comes with only 825 GB of internal storage. With the ballooning size of AAA games on the market, you'll be lucky if you can have more than 3 games downloaded onto your system at a time.

We have good news: The PS5's storage can be expanded by installing a compatible M.2 solid state drive. The Samsung 990 is compatible, but with a catch. You're going to want the heatsink option to prevent overheating. The heatsink also has futuristic RGB LED lights because of course it does. Right now, you can get the 1TB version of the 990 Pro with a heatsink for $108. The 2TB version goes for $180 while the 4TB version goes for $324.

That's just for the console players though. If you yourself or the loved one you're buying for is gaming on PC, then the non-heatsink version will work out just fine. Get the Samsung 990 Pro starting at $100 for the 1TB version ($60 off), $170 for the 2TB version ($80 off), or $202 for the 4TB version ($163 off).

AAA video games have gotten crazy. The map for Grand Theft Auto 6 set to release next year is approximately two and a half times larger than the explorable area of Grand Theft Auto 5. You can see lights in the environment reflecting off the sweat on characters bodies while they're muscles twist and stretch as they move they way it would for a real person. Whether these result in a game being more “fun,” is debatable, but what isn't up for discussion is just how much more processing power in needed to play the latest titles in their highest quality. If you haven't upgraded some of your gaming PC parts in awhile, it may be time to replace some stuff.

See at Amazon

Intel refreshes its CPUs on annual basis and the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor came out last year. Since it's release, it's steadily come down in price, but has just now gotten it's biggest drop yet. Originally priced at around $400, it has since been cut down by 33%. That amounts to a savings of $135, marking it down to just $269—it's lowest price ever.

Intel boasts the Intel Core Ultra 7 CPU will improve both performance and efficiency, allowing your PC to run cool, quiet, and fast, delivering up to 5.5GHz. It's contains 20 cores (eight P-cores plus 12 E-cores) along with 20 threads. You'll be able to have better gaming experience while using less power. In other words, “do more with less.”

Play all the latest big-budget video games with hyper realistic graphics and crazy good frame rates. And if you stream to Twitch or YouTube, you don't want your performance to suffer while taking on the extra task. You want ultra-smooth and responsive gameplay for both you and your viewers to experience, and Intel is here to help.

A solid processor like this isn't just good for gaming. If you find yourself regularly using the Adobe suite of apps, you'll find reliable performance with the Intel Core Ultra 7. Efficiently touch up photos or create massive designs in Photoshop without slowdown, render videos fast when working with Adobe Premiere, and much more.

For better or for worse, AI is becoming is huge demand in the tech space. Intel promises it's Intel Core Ultra processor is ready to take on not just your gaming and streaming.

The Intel Core Ultra 7 processor is designed for legendary gaming experiences but is capable of even more than that. And right now, Amazon reduced it by a third of its price. Order it today for just $269.

Oracle has reportedly purchased about 400,000 Nvidia GB200 AI chips, worth about $40 billion, for deployment in Abilene, Texas. According to the Financial Times, this site will be the first to host the U.S. Stargate project —a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure by OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund MGX that President Trump announced earlier this year.

Upon completion, the site is estimated to deliver up to 1.2 gigawatts of computing power, making it one of the most powerful data centers in the world and competing against Elon Musk's Colossus in Memphis, Tennessee.

The project's ownership is a bit complicated, though. The Abilene site is owned by Cruso, an AI infrastructure company, and Blue Owl Capital, a U.S. investment firm. Both have poured over $15 billion into the site through debt and equity financing.

The AI data center campus is approximately 875 acres and will have eight buildings. Construction began in June last year. Oracle will lease the Abilene site for 15 years, where it will deploy these AI chips. It will then lease this massive computing power to OpenAI, allowing it to use the AI chips to train its next-generation AI LLMs.

OpenAI has solely relied on Microsoft's data centers for its computer power needs. However, it has since become frustrated with the setup, because the former's demand was greater than what the latter could supply. So, the two decided to terminate their exclusive contract, allowing the AI pioneer to partner with other organizations for its processing power demands.

Interestingly, all these talks on equity and investments are commitments by the individual companies—the Financial Times said that Stargate itself has yet to commit any amount to a data center. Nevertheless, OpenAI recently also announced Stargate UAE, where it plans to deploy a 1GB cluster in Abu Dhabi in coordination with the U.S. government. The 5 GW data center will be built by G42 and is envisioned to utilize more than 2 million Nvidia GB200 chips.

All these AI data center deployments have helped Nvidia become one of the most valuable companies in the world, with Team Green hitting the number one spot (again) in late 2024. Aside from this $40 billion Oracle order, there has also been news that Elon Musk is raising cash to build Colossus 2, featuring a million GPUs. Other tech giants and even governments are trying to get in on the bandwagon, pushing the demand for the latest, most powerful AI chip through the roof.

Not everyone will find updating the vBIOS to be an easy task. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Many RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti users encounter blank screens when restarting their systems. Nvidia has released an update to resolve this problem, not through a new driver, but as a firmware update for the GPU, also known as the vBIOS. The report strictly advises that only users experiencing this problem should update their firmware.

The problem likely stems from how Nvidia's vBIOS communicates with the system's BIOS/UEFI. If your motherboard does not support UEFI boot mode, Nvidia recommends contacting the customer service of your GPU manufacturer for a legacy vBIOS update. The exact culprit hasn't been specified, but the fact that Nvidia is providing a fix strongly implies that part of the problem is within their domain.

Nvidia's RTX 50 GPUs have struggled with stability and compatibility, starting with the problematic R570 branch of drivers, which even affected older RTX 20/30/40 series GPUs. Having experienced these issues first-hand, it took Nvidia multiple weeks to address most of them with the 576.02 update. If your RTX 5060 or RTX 5060 Ti throws a black or blank screen on reboot, you may need to update its vBIOS. An abrupt power outage during firmware updates can potentially brick your GPU, so proceed cautiously.

Fortunately, Nvidia's provided utility can verify compatibility with your system's firmware and determine if a vBIOS update is necessary. Nvidia recommends only installing this update if you're encountering blank screens. To apply the fix, you must first boot into the Operating System, which might be a hassle given the current predicament. Nvidia suggests the following temporary workarounds to boot with a display:

Download the NVIDIA GPU UEFI Firmware Update Tool v2.0 to apply the update, run the executable, and follow the on-screen instructions. Interestingly, this issue only impacts the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti family of GPUs, both based on GB206 silicon. This raises the question of why older RTX 50 cards are unaffected. What specific changes in these GPUs led to this problem?

My reviews focus almost exclusively on the best gaming monitors, and this one is no different. However, there are displays aimed at the enterprise that perform equally well for entertainment. There are good deals outside the gaming category where you'll find panels with fast refresh rates and Adaptive-Sync.

One such product is a member of Acer's Vero line, the B247Y. It's a 24-inch IPS panel with FHD resolution, 120 Hz, and Adaptive-Sync. It also sports accurate color out of the box, a little extra gamut volume, and decent video processing. And it'll set you back just $155. Let's take a look.

IPS was once a premium category when TN ruled as the dominant panel technology. The resolution is Full HD 1920x1080, which means a pixel density of 92 ppi, not far below a 27-inch QHD screen's 109 ppi. The picture is sharp and clean with higher-than-average contrast that I measured at over 1,300:1.

You won't find extended color in this segment, but the B247Y has a little more gamut volume than typical budget screens, with over 116% coverage of sRGB. Accuracy is also excellent with no need for calibration to see a high-fidelity image. The only thing missing is HDR support. That's also something rarely found for less than $200.

Though the B247Y is marketed as an enterprise monitor, it has the two components needed for gaming, fast refresh, and Adaptive-Sync. The maximum 120 Hz refresh rate delivers a reasonably smooth moving picture, and Adaptive-Sync works over the DisplayPort input on AMD and Nvidia platforms. Gaming consoles connected via HDMI get it too, but only up to 75 Hz. Also included is blur reduction via backlight strobe with a two-level pulse width adjustment. I also discovered a frame rate counter in the menu, but no aiming points. Two internal speakers provide decent audio, or you can use the headphone jack.

On the outside, the B247Y is a sleeper with simple styling and Acer's usual high build quality standard. Not surprisingly, there are no USB ports or LED lighting. But hey, this monitor is $155. And it's part of an enterprise product line, which means you might be able to convince your IT manager to buy one for your cubicle. Then, you can enjoy a solid image for work and decent gameplay performance for that lunchtime frag session.

The B247Y arrives in something of a plain brown wrapper, but there are some subtle graphics on the box to set it apart. It opens clamshell-style to reveal molded pulp forms instead of crumbly foam protecting the contents. The stand is in two pieces and is as solid as what you'll find with more expensive monitors. The panel snaps on and includes fasteners for the 100mm VESA mount, should you wish to use an arm. Since three of these only cost $465, that's a real possibility. The cable bundle consists of HDMI, DisplayPort and IEC for the internal power supply. And there's a 3.5mm stereo cable for the audio input.

Hefting the B247Y out of the box showed it to be lightweight but solidly constructed. Nods to style include a large Acer logo on the base and brushed textures molded into the plastic shell to offset the matte finish. Another Acer logo and a thin grill for passive cooling are in the back. Down in the corner is an OSD joystick and a single button to toggle power.

The stand is as solid as anything I've seen packed with a premium display. It has a cable clip at the bottom and full ergonomics with 5/25 degrees tilt, 45 degrees swivel, 6.4 inches of height and a 90-degree portrait mode.

Experienced video geeks and the more seasoned (older) among us will recognize the VGA port on the downward-facing I/O panel. That's something rarely seen anymore, but it's there if you need it. More modern interfaces include one each of HDMI 1.4 and DisplayPort 1.2. What's up with the two 3.5mm jacks? One is a headphone output, and the other is a stereo input.

The B247Y's OSD is much like what one would see on any gaming monitor with signal info at the top, a gaming sub-menu and full calibration controls.

Acer calls the first menu Performance, which is great if you want to hide the B247Y's design intent from the accounting department. The video processing suite includes a two-level overdrive, Adaptive-Sync toggle and VRB which is a backlight strobe that works instead of AS and has two pulse width options. It reduces blur effectively but suffers from the phasing artifact common to this tech. FreeSync and G-Sync work just fine though, and I found the overdrive effective on its weaker setting. The extreme option caused visible ghosting.

In the Picture menu is a very important setting that needs to be changed from the default. It's called Max Brightness and when left off, it limits output to around 150 nits. That's fine if you work in the dark, but if you have lights over your workspace, turn it on to engage the full peak potential of around 288 nits. You can also turn on dynamic contrast, which has a subtly positive effect and Super Sharpness, which adds a tiny bit of edge enhancement to the image.

There are eight picture modes, all of which are fixed except User. This is typical of Acer monitors, where if you change any setting, it switches to User mode. The sRGB mode option has no effect since the B247Y is an sRGB monitor with just a little bonus color. Gamma comes in three presets and there are four color temps plus a user mode with gain and bias. Two-point white balance is something rarely seen at any price, impressive. You also get a grayscale mode and six-axis color sliders.

The B247Y looks just fine out of the box, and measures well too with no real need for calibration. Gamma isn't quite ruler straight, but it is close to the mark. I adjusted the very precise RGB sliders for even better grayscale tracking. The sRGB gamut option doesn't actually reduce the color gamut but that's OK since it's fixed to sRGB natively with just a bit of extra verve in every primary and secondary hue. I've provided my settings below.

I've played many hours of many games on many premium monitors, so I'm not going to claim that the B247Y is one of those. But when I consider all the sub-$200 screens I've experienced, it delivers better gameplay than it has a right to. I have said many times that 144 Hz should be considered a starting point, but the B247Y makes the most of its 120 Hz with an excellent overdrive. There is a little motion blur, but not enough to keep it from being responsive and accurate. If I really looked for it, there was some smearing, but when I concentrated on firing and maneuvering, there were no distractions.

The only thing I'd recommend avoiding is the VRB feature. It's a backlight strobe with two pulse width options. Neither solves the phasing artifact, which is a distraction. You won't need an expensive PC to peg the frame rate at 120 fps, so stick with Adaptive-Sync. It works perfectly with FreeSync and G-Sync systems.

Image quality is excellent when comparing the B247Y to other IPS sRGB monitors. If you're accustomed to a wide gamut OLED at home, playing games at work will be a less wondrous experience. But if you just want to blow off some steam by fragging your workmates during lunch, this monitor delivers the fun. And the internal speakers work well at both high and low volumes. They don't have a wide frequency range, but they are clean and low levels are clear enough that you can hear the action without disturbing the cubicles nearby.

For productivity, a 24-inch screen might be a little small on its own but since the B247Y is so inexpensive, why not get three? You can mount them on a nice arm and have a large-format desktop for around $600. That's less expensive than a single ultra-wide display and easier to get from the IT department. If you don't mind the lack of USB ports, it's a great option.

Takeaway: The B247Y offers solid gaming performance and excellent picture quality for a very low price. It's inexpensive enough that putting two or three of them on your desk is still a budget-friendly option. Though there are faster monitors out there, the B247Y offers excellent balance with no need for tweaking. Just unpack and enjoy, with money left over for pizza.

LOCAL ALERT: Public visitation for the late Va. Rep. Gerry Connolly to be held Monday from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Fairfax Memorial Funeral Home.



The Associated Press 

May 24, 2025, 6:08 AM

GENEVA (AP) — FIFA president Gianni Infantino says Cristiano Ronaldo might play in the Club World Cup because of a unique transfer window.

Ronaldo's Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr also did not qualify for the tournament, but Infantino suggested that the Portugal star could switch to one of the 32 teams playing in the competition in the United States starting next month.

“Cristiano Ronaldo might play in the Club World Cup,” Infantino told online streamer IShowSpeed. “There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup, who knows. Still a few weeks time, will be fun.”

FIFA confirmed Wednesday that last-minute transfer signings are open to all teams going to tournament, which fueled more speculation that one of them will try to sign the 40-year-old Ronaldo on a short-term deal, potentially a loan.

Such a move would be unprecedented in modern soccer though could appeal to FIFA by boosting the profile and ticket sales of an inaugural tournament being played in 11 U.S. cities. It has been unclear if many fans will travel to the U.S. for the 63-game tournament.

A transfer for Ronaldo also would reunite him and Lionel Messi in the same competition for the first time since the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Last October, FIFA invited Messi's Inter Miami to enter the tournament in the slot that was expected to be reserved for the host nation's champion. Inter Miami led the regular season standings but was then eliminated in the MLS Cup playoffs.

Speculative reports have linked Ronaldo to the one Saudi club that qualified, Al Hilal, the Brazilian club Palmeiras and Wydad of Morocco, even though that club is currently banned by FIFA from registering new signings.

Transfers can be made from June 1-10 and again June 27-July 3 according to exceptional rules FIFA approved in October.

“The objective is to encourage clubs and players whose contracts are expiring to find an appropriate solution to facilitate the players' participation,” FIFA said in Wednesday's statement.

Arsenal fans took to the streets of Lisbon ahead of a huge Women's Champions League final meeting with Barcelona, while thousands of Sheffield United and Sunderland supporters made their way to Wembley

The boys of 1995

That Ajax team still remain, for my years watching football, the most complete team. 100% collective, complete domination of virtually every match they played. Such a shame that they were immediately broken up, and Seedorf aside, none of them reached the kind of sustained success that they probably would have enjoyed had they stayed together.

There's a terrific podcast on the history of the Champions League called that includes a (very) detailed analysis of that magnificent Ajax team.

Every wedge has a thin end

Really shocked that no one is saying anything about the Neville ban. I get that it is a private arena and that the owners can pretty much do anything it wants. However, if Neville is banned for what he said, it has a chilling effect on everyone commenting on sports who may well be hesitant to criticise because it may lead to a similar ban...the other side of the coin is that rich owners can us the courts and lawyers to prevent and hinder criticism. Whatever you think of Nevill (I like him), he deserves others to speak up on his behalf, if only because of the importance of the subject: Freedom of expression...

It's just not football

Weather permitting, England will wrap victory against Zimbabwe today in the Test match at Trent Bridge. The peerless Tim de Lisle is covering the morning session.

“As a fan of cycling, I am not surprised by Scott McTominay winning the Serie A player of the year award,” writes Balaji. “Just look at the illustrious list of cyclists who have been let go by INEOS team under Jim Ratcliffe. In the current Giro, two of the stage winners last week – Lucas Plapp and Richard Carapaz – rode for INEOS before their current team.”

I can't even ride a bike so I'm not qualified to comment. It hasn't stopped me before, I know, but on this occasion I trust Balaji's judgement. (Still think the McTominay situation was more nuanced, and that it's a wonderful human story that doesn't need to be polluted by pointing fingers at Manchester United, but who cares.)

Fifa's president Gianni Infantino says “there are discussions” over a move that could see Cristiano Ronaldo play at the Club World Cup this summer.

Ronaldo's club Al-Nassr failed to qualify for the expanded tournament, which will feature 32 clubs for the first time, but Infantino appeared to talk up the prospect of a transfer for the 40-year-old Portugal forward in time for him to appear in the world governing body's new-look event.

Speaking to YouTuber and streamer IShowSpeed, Infantino said: “Ronaldo might play for one of the teams as well at the Club World Cup. There are discussions... Yeah. Cristiano Ronaldo might play in the Club World Cup.

“There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup... who knows, who knows.” PA Media

In other news, Manchester United have shortlisted Simon Cowell as a potential replacement for Ruben Amorim.

Gary Lineker and the BBC will consciously uncouple after tomorrow night's Match of the Day. Barney Ronay has written a seriously good piece, even by his standards, on the utter state of everything Lineker's 33 years at the Beeb.

And so, here we are, talking about this crap as though it is genuine political discourse. But there are still some things worth saying about this same crap. The first, and most obvious, is that Lineker should also not be dehumanised for making this mistake. He is not an avatar of hate, just as he also not a free speech hero silenced by The Cabal. He is, like all of us, a human trying to understand the world, while being bombarded by extreme information via a deeply addictive and confusing platform, one that also offers the chance for an instant, emotive response. Mistakes will be made. Minds will be bent into strange shapes. Odd stuff will happen.

Currently in Lisbon, excited but nervous. The Fan Zone yesterday was so much fun. So many Arsenal fans of all ages.Let's hope we get a competitive game and a win today. It's not going to be easy but who knows. COYG!

McTominay wins Serie A player of the year award

It's worth looking at the company Scott McTominay joined last night when he was announced as the Serie A player of the season. In the immortal words of Richie Aprile, look at this [expletive] line-up.

Roberto Mancini, Ronaldo, Francesco Totti, Christian Vieri, Kaka, Andrea Pirlo, Fabio Cannavaro, Pavel Nedved, Cristiano Ronaldo, Victor Osimhen, Gianluigi Buffon, Leonardo Bonucci, Alberto Gilardino, Carlos Tevez, Zlatan, Mauco Icardi, Rafael Leao, Diego Milito, Zinedine Zidane, Lautaro Martinez. And Scott Francis McTominay.

Another plug for Tom Garry's WCL final preview

Saturday's final is Barcelona's 100th women's European fixture. Their first came against Arsenal, in the 2012-13 season. The Gunners ran out 3-0 winners against a team that included a young Alexia Putellas. “Arsenal are a great team with great players and a great coach,” said the Spain midfielder on Friday. “They are in the final for a reason. They eliminated Real Madrid and scored four against Lyon, but if we are in our best version then many things can turn out well. We trust our match plan.

Was McTominay played inthe wrong position?

So Scott McTominay was basically played in the wrong position by United? Is that what we are saying?

This isn't really true, certainly not in his last season at Old Trafford. Erik ten Hag usually played McTominay as a goalscoring midfielder; the problem was how to fit McTominay and Bruno Fernandes in the same team in a 4-2-3-1 formation. United also needed money to buy a defensive midfielder (whether they bought the right one is a different discussion).

I'd have tried to keep him as a squad player and impact sub, not least because Man Utd need as many reliable characters as they can get. But as with the ostensibly ridiculous sale of Gerard Pique to Barcelona for peanuts in 2008, there were sound reasons for it. I doubt it's in the 100 unfathomable decisions that United's suits have made in the past decade.

Talking of club legends, Napoli's four Serie A titles are indelibly associated with three players: Diego Maradona, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Scott McTominay. There have been some classic feelgood stories this season; McTominay's might be the best of the lot.

Thanks Emillia, morning everyone. Let's start with a bit of news from the north east, where – on today of all days – Newcastle legend* Dan Burn has signed a one-year extension to his contract. That'll take him through to 2027.

“I'm delighted to sign a new deal here,” Burn said. “I knew that I was going into my last year and I really wanted to get my future tied down. I've said before that I would love to finish my career here so to be given that opportunity, I'm very grateful.

“I still feel like I'm getting better and I don't feel that I've hit the top of the hill yet. It'll be tough to top this season but hopefully we can do that over the next couple of years. It's a dream come true to be playing for this club and I'm delighted that I get to keep doing it.”

* I think we can call him taht after the Carabao Cup final, can't we.

Rob Smyth will be taking the reins of this matchday live for the next few hours while I head off for a break. Over to you, Rob!

Manchester United's women picked up a significant cash injection of $1m US dollars after finishing as the runners-up in the inaugural World Sevens Football event in Estoril, Portugal, but ultimately missed out on the top prize of $2.5m as Bayern Munich struck late through Sarah Zadrazil to win the final 2-1.

The German club, whose humorous goal celebrations became a running theme throughout the tournament, clearly rejoiced in the small-sided, fun-orientated format and their captain Glódís Perla Viggósdóttir said: “From the moment we got here, we were all in a tournament that you would play when you were a kid. We enjoyed it as a team. We came with everyone and winning is just a bonus because it is fun. We're used to playing with a lot of pressure on our shoulders so to just come here and enjoy it was nice.”

Fans of National League playoff finalists Southend United and Oldham Athletic face a nightmare journey to Wembley Stadium next Sunday due to TfL engineering works.

The works are set to affect the Jubilee and Metropolitan lines, meaning no trains will stop at Wembley Park station – the main station used by fans on a Wembley matchday. Most people will therefore be forced to travel via Wembley Central, which can only be accessed through the Bakerloo Line and Lioness Line.

As a result, ticket sales have been capped at 17,500 per club due to safety concerns. Around 30,000 Southend fans were initially expected to attend the match. The club has since sourced 28 coaches for supporters in order to ease the travel difficulties.

Essex-based newspaper The Echo has also started a petition asking for both teams to be given more tickets for the occasion, citing the significance of the match for supporters.

All three playoff finals this weekend are scheduled to kick-off one minute past the hour as part of the Every Minute Matters campaign.

 Championship Play-Off Final – Saturday, 24 May 2025 – 15.01 League One Play-Off Final – Sunday, 25 May 2025 – 13:01 League Two Play-Off Final – Monday, 26 May 2025 – 15:01

You may be wondering why the Championship playoff final kicks off at 3:01pm rather than 3pm this afternoon.

The change has been made as part of the Every Minute Matters campaign – a collaboration between the EFL and the British Heart Foundation which aims to inspire supporters to learn CPR, equipping them with vital skills that could help them save someone's life.

Launching at the playoffs last season, the campaign has already inspired 270,000 people to learn CPR. Now, the EFL and the British Heart Foundation want to encourage 360,000 people to learn a lifesaving CPR technique.

The EFL Chief Executive Officer, Trevor Birch, said: “The Sky Bet Play-Offs are a special moment in the football calendar and tens of thousands of supporters will be at Wembley Stadium across the weekend with millions more tuning in from home. By kicking off all three Play-Off Finals one minute later, Every Minute Matters continues to harness the power and visibility of football to encourage even more people to learn CPR, which could ultimately help to save even more lives.”

Manchester City wrap up their Premier League campaign on Sunday with a game Pep Guardiola believes is “by far” their most important of the season. City head to Fulham knowing a draw will almost certainly secure a top-five spot and a place in the Champions League for next season.

After winning the title in the past four seasons, it is a relatively modest target but Guardiola recognises it is the least of the club's expectations. The City manager said: “If we want to play in the Champions League, we have to take a result there. This is what we are going to do. Of course, it's really important.” Asked if it was the most important game of the season, Guardiola said at a press conference: “By far.”

City go into the game in third place on 68 points, two ahead of Newcastle, Chelsea and Aston Villa. Nottingham Forest, a point further back, are also still in contention for a place in the top five. Given a superior goal difference over all their rivals, a draw should be sufficient for City but Guardiola is taking nothing for granted against a Fulham side that could finish as high as ninth.

“Maybe it's age, maybe it's having the experience of doing it in other moments,” Leah Williamson told The Guardian this week. “The Euros final was fairly level to this in terms of testing my ability to manage the emotions of the day and occasion. I'm just going to enjoy it.

“If I think that the fact that I'm an Arsenal fan is going to get in the way I have to shift, because that's not my focus for the day – my job is to be a player, a player that wants to do it for the fan in me.”

Suzanne Wrack spoke to Arsenal defender Leah Williamson this week about her journey from being a mascot for the Gunners in 2007 to now playing in a Champions League final.

Sam has messaged in from Lisbon…

“In Lisbon for the WCL final with my daughter Eleanor. Weather fantastic - just nailed our first Pastel de Nata for breakfast. Going to wander round taking in the sights and then head to the stadium around 3. Seen a couple of Barca fans also far.

“Predicting an Arsenal victory (please) COYG.”

In case you missed it, Scott McTominay was the hero as Napoli secured the Serie A title with a 2-0 win over Cagliari last night.

As always, I want to hear from you today! Are you off to a match? Are you in Lisbon for the Women's Champions League final? If so, what's the weather like? Because I can confirm that in London it's absolutely miserable - take note if you're heading to Wembley.

A disappointed Jurgen Klopp turned off the TV when he heard fans of his former team Liverpool booing Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is set to leave this summer after two decades at the club, during a 2-2 home draw with Arsenal earlier this month.

Liverpool-born Alexander-Arnold, who joined the club in 2004 when he was six, debuted for the senior team when Klopp was the manager.

The 26-year-old, who is regarded as one of the best right-backs in the world, has made 353 appearances for Liverpool, winning the Premier League, the Champions League and the Club World Cup during Klopp's tenure.

“I watched the game when he came on and I heard the booing,” Klopp said at a fundraising event for the LFC foundation on Friday. “I am old so I thought it might be my hearing, so I switched up the volume ... I needed another 10 seconds to realise and I switched the TV off. I honestly couldn't have been more disappointed in this moment. This is not us, 100% not us.”

England international Alexander-Arnold also featured prominently as Liverpool won the Premier League again this season under new manager Arne Slot.

Slot earlier said he was not sure if Alexander-Arnold would make his final appearance for the club in Sunday's home game against Crystal Palace, after which Liverpool would lift the Premier League trophy.

Klopp, who is set to attend Sunday's match, held up an Alexander-Arnold Liverpool shirt to show his support for the player. Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah, who leads the league's scoring charts with 28 goals, also spoke out earlier in support of his teammate, saying Alexander-Arnold did not deserve the boos.

Klopp said Liverpool fans should not forget what Alexander-Arnold has done for the club. “I don't tell you, you should not be disappointed, you should not be angry. I tell you, don't forget. This club doesn't forget,” he said. “Every day he gave absolutely everything for this badge ... after 20 years he decided he wanted to go somewhere else. If somebody should be angry about this, it's the owners, but they're not.”

Hello, good morning and welcome to another matchday live! We have some huge games to look forward to this afternoon - including a European final.

Arsenal face Barcelona in the Women's Champions League final at Estádio José Alvalade, with Renée Slegers in search of her first major trophy as a manager. The North London side go into the match as major underdogs having not won the Champions League since 2007 - back when Leah Williamson was just a mascot. Meanwhile, the Liga F giants have their sights set on their third successive European title.

Also this afternoon is the Championship playoff final between Sheffield United and Sunderland. Fans were in full voice across London yesterday as they prepared for the highly-anticipated Wembley meeting, with a place in the Premier League at stake. Sheffield United finished 14 points above their rivals in the table earlier this month, but as we all know anything can happen at the home of English football.

And it's the Scottish Cup final at Hampden Park, where Aberdeen take on league champions Celtic. I'll be getting you warmed up and ready for these games throughout the day with the help of Rob Smyth, so be sure to stick with us!

Spot Easter eggs in his design","https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2025/05/23/fifa-world-cup-2026-poster-nj-rich-tu-south-orange/83753892007/","Sat, 24 May 2025 15:58:45 GMT","

The FIFA World Cup is coming back to New Jersey for the first time in more than 30 years in 2026, and a local artist is helping define how the world will see it.

Rich Tu, a visual artist raised in South Orange and now based in Brooklyn, was selected by the region's host committee to pen the official poster for the New York/New Jersey host region. Tu said his composition was meant to reflect the cultural depth of both sides of the Hudson and blend local identity with global scale. Making sure New Jersey was not lost in the shuffle was key, he said.

""What I love about New Jersey is it's so much more than what people think it is,"" Tu said.

FIFA revealed Tu's poster for the New York/New Jersey host region in April at Poster House in Manhattan. It was part of a rollout of official artwork for each of the 16 host stadiums across North America, as the U.S. is set to co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Mexico and Canada.

Tu's vivid, high-energy design is centered on a multicolored soccer ball engulfed in the flames of the Statue of Liberty's torch. Dominated by bold colors, the flame is rendered in fiery reds and oranges, while the torch itself is depicted in cool green and teal tones. 

""I wanted to embody the voice of the fans ... the loudness of the stadiums,"" he said. ""It's bold, like the people of this region.""

In the background, Tu layered iconography from both New York and New Jersey. There are florals for the Garden State and a splash of Knicks orange. Deep blues and purples are layered with architectural outlines and symbols of the regional cultural identity. There is an apple for the big city, a pair of dice for the Jersey Shore's gambling mecca and the face of Lady Liberty, a symbol shared by both sides of the Hudson.  

""This poster is a bold celebration of everything that makes the NY/NJ region so dynamic — our diversity, creativity, and unmistakable energy,"" said Bettina Garibaldi, the regional host committee's chief marketing and communications officer. ""Rich Tu's design captures the essence of who we are: a region that stands out.""

Tu said his poster draws inspiration from past World Cup visuals, including Lance Wyman's work during the 1970 Mexico campaign. Tu said he approached the project with an eye toward scale and permanence, aiming to reflect not just the sport but the energy of the region and the significance of the moment. Having a place in the history of the World Cup and its identifying art for his home region is both gratifying and deeply humbling, he said.

""The world is going to converge here at the end of the World Cup for the final, and this poster is going to sit in kids' rooms,"" Tu said. ""Just to be a part of the history is crazy.""

The poster is on display at 352 Marin Blvd., in Jersey City and set to join the permanent collection at Poster House in New York, the country's only museum dedicated to poster art. The digital version has also been on display in Times Square and at MetLife Stadium, where both the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2026 FIFA World Cup are scheduled to take place. MetLife is set to host nine matches in 2025 and eight in 2026, including the World Cup Final.

Tu, who earned degrees from Rutgers University and New York City's School of Visual Arts art college, is a partner at the studio Sunday Afternoon. He teaches at the art college and co-founded the COLORFUL Awards, a program supporting early-career artists from underrepresented backgrounds. He has also led creative efforts for MTV and Nike and worked with brands including Budweiser, G-Shock and The New York Times and been nominated for a Webby Award.","{'href': 'https://www.northjersey.com', 'title': 'Bergen Record'}","soccer"

Casper Ruud is one of tennis' most well-liked figures, always coming across as a very affable and approachable individual.

A supremely gifted tennis player too, he is one of many who has seen his career somewhat thwarted by the Big Three, particularly Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.

And now with Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner having assumed that position at the pinnacle of the sport, the 26-year-old must battle relentlessly all over again to win the very biggest titles. 

The French Open represents his best chance, given his penchant for the iconic clay surface which adorns this event.

However, speaking about surfaces, he has one issue which he wishes the tour would fix.

Speaking on the UTS Talk Show with Jakub Mensik and Tomas Machac, the Norwegian almost acted as a moderator between the two Czechs as he directed the conversation.

However, when given the chance, he was more than keen to voice his opinion on various matters including one minor issue he holds with the ATP Tour.

Chatting about the distribution of matches across each surface, he noted: ‘The thing is like, Wimbledon is so nice. It's like ridiculously nice and beautiful, so I really like playing there. It's fun because it's so different, for me at least.

‘I have to reset my game completely because I don't feel like my spin shots are working.'

‘The thing is like, I played a junior two times and the first year it was like 30 degrees every day and sunny. So then it's more playable because it bounces up than when it's like foggy, humid. It's so slippery.

‘But it's so historic. I like playing on grass. Tennis started on grass and clay so it's fun to play on them, the most historic surfaces.

‘Now most of the tournaments are on hard which I wish they weren't but, what can you do?'

Whilst he might claim to enjoy Wimbledon, it is clear where Ruud's favoured surface remains.

And, having already removed one monkey from his back this year by finally winning a Masters 1000 final, there's no reason why he can't go one step further at the upcoming French Open.

After all, he is a two-time finalist at this event, with the clay season almost always marking the most successful period of his year historically.

That is why Ruud is one of three players who could win the French Open outside of Sinner and Alcaraz, the two obvious favourites.

Should he keep his focus and play his best tennis, the title is there for the taking.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

The second of tennis' Grand Slam events gets underway on May 25 with the start of the French Open. The clay-court tournament is one where a slower surface speed puts an emphasis on the ability to win extended rallies and play off the baseline rather than relying on a dominant serve.

Those conditions create an environment where certain players have thrived, though none more than Rafael Nadal, who won 14 French Open titles in his career and racked up an absurd 112-4 record at the event while winning every final he made. Nadal will not participate in Roland Garros in 2025, having retired in November with an astounding 92 titles won in his legendary career.

While Nadal's absence will be notable, even after he'd fallen from his incredible career heights, his biggest career rival will be in action as Novak Djokovic looks to build on the momentum of winning his 100th career title when he defeated Hubert Hurkacz in the finals of the Geneva Open, ending a title drought that extended back to when he won gold at the 2024 Olympics.

Djokovic sits at +1200 to win Roland Garros, which may seem like long odds, but places him as third most likely to win the men's tournament. Those odds result from the dominance of the new generation of stars like last year's French Open winner Carlos Alcaraz, 22, and Italy's Jannik Sinner, 23.

Alvaraz is the favorite, currently sitting at +100 to repeat last year's accomplishment, while Sinner sits at +225. Alvaraz has won four Grand Slam tournaments to Sinner's three, though Sinner won the Australian Open to pick up the first Grand Slam title of the year.

While the men's side features two clear-cut favorites, the women's field feels far more competitive.

Poland's Iga Swiatek has won five Grand Slam titles in her career, including four titles at Roland Garros. Swiatek has won the French Open each of the past three years and is looking to extend that run to four this year. Despite her wild success at the tournament, Swiatek is not the favorite, sitting at +300.

Swiatek has not been in her best form in 2025, opening the door for current world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus to enter the tournament as the favorite at +240. Swiatek has won 20 WTA titles, including three Grand Slam titles.

America's best hope for a French Open winner is 21-year-old Coco Gauff. She won the U.S. Open in 2023 and is now on the hunt for her second Grand Slam singles title. Gauff is one of two women, along with Mirra Andreeva, listed at +500 heading into the tournament.

Men's tournament: Upsets happen and could make for a fun tournament, but this does feel like a two-horse race between Sinner and Alcaraz. For the first time, the two men will enter a Grand Slam seeded No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. A clash in the finals would be thrilling but depend on overcoming some potentially tricky matches along the way. Still, the pair are the clear favorites for a reason, and a Grand Slam final showdown is the expectation. When considering the clay surface, that potential match becomes a battle of Alcaraz's movement and speed against the cleaner ball-striking and forehand of Sinner.

Alcaraz has four consecutive wins over Sinner, including in straight sets in the finals in Rome one week prior to the start of the French Open. Rome marked Sinner's return to the court after serving three months of a doping ban after a settlement centering around accidental exposure due to what was ruled accidental contamination. Should Sinner and Alcaraz meet in the finals, another straight set win for Alcaraz would be unexpected, but a win in the end still feels like the most likely outcome. Pick: Carlos Alcaraz (+100)

Women's tournament: The women's field feels ripe for an upset. As mentioned, Swiatek has won four of the five most recent French Opens, including the three most recent. Her form is simply off heading into Roland Garros, and it doesn't set up a promising situation for the defending champ. Sabalenka is an obvious threat to run away with the tournament, but she may have a tougher path to the finals than expected. Swiatek and Sabalenka are situated on the same side of the bracket, meaning if they both win all of their matches, they would meet in the semifinals.

Gauff was given a much better draw, with Andreeva as her biggest possible obstacle to making the finals (their potential meeting would come in the semifinals). Gauff beat Andreeva in Rome and Madrid and dominated Swiatek in Madrid, winning 6-1, 6-1. Gauff's serving is an issue, but the clay makes a dominant serve less of an important factor. As long as she can minimize the double faults, Gauff plays so well off the baseline and has such a friendly draw heading into the tournament that she can make a deep run. If she meets her biggest possible challenge (Andreeva) in the semifinals, she clearly has the edge based on recent results. It would then take one good match in the finals to take down her second career Grand Slam title. Pick: Coco Gauff (+500)

Left-handed players across the tour have long shared similar experiences. At this year's Australian Open, fellow southpaw Ben Shelton told reporters that securing a practice partner is nearly “impossible”—unless his would-be partner is about to face a lefty in the next round.“People get very paranoid about hitting with someone who is a lefty if they're playing a righty,” Draper explained during a pre-tournament press conference in Paris. “I do understand it. It's probably not what you're going to face.”Left-handers are a minority on the ATP Tour—Draper is currently one of just 12 in the Top 100—but that's still slightly above the estimated global average of 10 percent. And like in baseball, cricket, and fencing, tennis players who swing from the left often enjoy a strategic advantage.Lefty forehands naturally target opponents' backhands, typically the weaker side at the pro level. Their serves, especially out wide, can create angles and spin patterns that right-handers rarely face. Even other lefties admit to struggling against their own.

Interestingly, despite playing left-handed, Draper isn't a natural lefty at all.“My biggest strength is probably the fact that I am naturally right-handed,” the 23-year-old said. “My backhand is a shot which I've always been really confident on. So when right-handers go into my backhand, as well, it feels like a great shot for me.“I think I've got kind of the best of both worlds almost. I always say people say it's an advantage. Still trying to figure one out, I suppose.”

My biggest strength is probably the fact that I am naturally right-handed... I think I've got kind of the best of both worlds.

Draper likely isn't short on practice opportunities anymore. He's enjoying a career-best ranking, has three ATP titles to his name—including his first Masters 1000 win at Indian Wells—and a standout clay season that included a runner-up finish in Madrid and a semifinal appearance in Rome.And at tournaments like Roland Garros, there's always a pool of hitting partners available if needed.“I don't care who I hit with. If I'm getting that ball in front of me, I'm able to hit, get in the groove, it doesn't really matter,” he said. “Maybe that's just the mentality I've grown up with the fact that not many people want to hit with lefties before tournaments and stuff.“But yeah, whoever is playing (Ben) Shelton or (Denis) Shapovalov or someone like that, I know they'll be asking me for practice.

American women have been at the forefront of the tennis world for decades, with legends such as Billie Jean King, Serena Williams, and Chris Evert leading the way over the years. 

There have been American winners at Grand Slams since the inception of the format, and it has been no different in the last few years, with Coco Gauff‘s triumph at the US Open in 2021 and Madison Keys' victory at the Australian Open.

Four of the world's top ten are from the US, including Gauff, Keys, Jessica Pegula and Emma Navarro.

The American major champions of the last two years spoke on the prevalence of players from their country in the women's game ahead of Roland Garros.

When asked on media day at Roland Garros why American women's tennis players are so good, Gauff said: “Other than the obvious size of the country and things like that, that plays a big role.

“But I feel like us having a lot of role models to look up to throughout the history of the sport, there have always been multiple American women doing well in the sport, so it inspires other people to do that.

“And obviously, when you have had people who have done that before, and the coaches are still very involved in the sport, it helps develop young players.

“We have a lot of resources in the US, thankfully, when it comes to tennis, so I think that also helps.And being on tour, seeing your compatriot do well, you have to remember a lot of us grew up playing against each other in juniors, lost to each other and beat each other.

“I think if you see your friend who you beat in juniors and they do super well in a slam, you say okay we were at the same level at this age, so I don't see why I can't do the same.

“A lot of tennis and a lot of being successful is literally just that belief factor. It's not as much the game. I think we have a lot of belief in our country due to the amount of success we have had over the years.”

When asked the same question, Keys responded: “I think the American women, we have had many years of long success with a lot of us being in the top 10 or 20. We have had a large group always.

“I think that has really helped push all of us to continue to do better. I grew up playing with a lot of these girls and now there's even the younger generation.

“I think it's just that we have a lot of really good competition and we have been able to keep pushing each other throughout our entire careers and I think it's shown that not only have we all made it to the pros but we all continue to push each other, even later in our careers and are continuing to do well.

“I really think it's been the sheer amount of players we have in juniors and from there there has been a lot of us who have just had success.”

Both Gauff and Keys will look to clinch a second Grand Slam title at Roland Garros. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Alex de Minaur's running joke this claycourt season revolves around his evolution into a “dirt dog”.

This is the same de Minaur who walked through the gates at Roland-Garros last year with a reputation within his tight-knit team for complaining about playing on clay, and at that time holding a 25-31 career tour-level record on the surface.

The Australian star went on to reach his second-ever grand slam quarter-final – upsetting Daniil Medvedev before a tight three-set defeat to Alex Zverev – to transform his belief.

That de Minaur achieved that in wet and cool conditions rather than the “hot, lively” environment he felt he needed to thrive on clay made the feat even more remarkable to him.

He made the last eight at every major since, including a maiden Australian Open quarter-final to start this year that extended his streak to four.

What has become obvious is that de Minaur is extremely confident about, and proud of, his new-found claycourt prowess.

“I'm close to my peak on clay, I believe, but right now, I see myself ready to beat anyone on this surface,” de Minaur said.

“Three years ago, this part of the season was difficult for me because I couldn't deliver my usual competitiveness. My goal was always to be solid on all surfaces and be able to compete at my highest level every week of the year.”

Mission accomplished: de Minaur, one of 16 Australians contesting the claycourt slam this fortnight, has proven across the past two months that his claycourt efforts a year ago were no fluke.

It took defending Roland-Garros champion Carlos Alcaraz, Italian top-tenner Lorenzo Musetti (twice) and American star Tommy Paul – the 2015 junior winner in Paris – to beat him in his four lead-in clay tournaments.

First round: Laslo Djere (Serbia)

Second round: Alexander Bublik (Kazakhstan)

Third round: 19-Jakub Mensik (Czech Republic)

Fourth round: 5-Jack Draper (Great Britain)

Quarter-finals: 1-Jannik Sinner (Italy)

Semi-finals: 3-Alexander Zverev (Germany)

Final: 2-Carlos Alcaraz (Spain)

Musetti pipped de Minaur for a top-eight seeding, meaning Australia's headline act will likely need to account for Czech rising star Jakub Mensik and fifth-seeded Brit Jack Draper to extend his last-eight run at majors.

First, the 26-year-old must face off with Serbia's Laslo Djere, who he boasts a 3-0 head-to-head record against, before meeting the winner between countryman James Duckworth and former world No.17 Alexander Bublik.

Draper comfortably beat a physically compromised de Minaur in last year's US Open quarter-finals, but the Australian won their other four meetings.

However, Draper has surged from a ranking of 18th to a career-high No.5 this season, including capturing the Indian Wells title and pushing Casper Ruud to three sets in the Masters 1000 final on clay in Madrid.

De Minaur's significant improvement on clay owes, in his words, to his dedication to strengthening his lower body, moving better on the surface and increasing the power of his shots.

The numbers paint a clear picture of how that extra strength has paid off, particularly on serve, where he has sacrificed a higher first-serve percentage searching for cheaper points.

De Minaur's first-serve percentage on the red dirt dropped each year from 2022 to last season, from 58 per cent to 54 before a slight rise to 55 this year. The strategy has worked, given the world No.9's points won on his first delivery spiked in that period from 64 per cent to a high of 74 per cent in 2025.

His total service points won have also gone up in each of those seasons from 57 per cent to 65, while he has climbed from the tour's eighth-best returner on clay in 2022 to No.1 this year.

De Minaur's satisfaction was most obvious after he defeated Medvedev in the fourth round in Paris last year, when he turned and bellowed in jovial fashion towards his player box.

“I screamed, ‘I love the clay. I love it here – I can't get enough',” a smiling de Minaur told reporters afterwards. “I'm a clay specialist now.”

Meanwhile, Daria Kasatkina will make her grand slam debut for her adopted country as the No.17 seed, while Alexei Popyrin is the 25th men's seed as he seeks to end a five-match losing streak at the event.

Popyrin, the 2017 Roland-Garros boys' singles winner, will arrive with confidence after reaching the quarter-finals in Geneva this week.

Maya Joint advanced to her first WTA Tour singles final in Rabat, Morocco, when compatriot Ajla Tomljanovic retired after losing the first set 6-4. They will clash again in the opening round in Paris, but Joint will first try to defeat Romania's Jaqueline Cristian in the Rabat final.

Cristian faces another Australian, Kim Birrell, in her Roland-Garros opener.

Daria Saville qualified to increase Australia's main draw presence to 16, but faces a tough first-round match against Australian Open champion Madison Keys.

Jordan Thompson, Adam Walton, James Duckworth, Chris O'Connell, Rinky Hijikata, Aleks Vukic, Olivia Gadecki and wildcards Tristan Schoolkate and Destanee Aiava round out the Australian contingent.

Novak Djokovic added the latest historic achievement to his stellar career on Saturday at the Gonet Geneva Open, where he claimed his 100th tour-level title.

The former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings rallied for an absorbing 5-7, 7-6(2), 7-6(2) victory over sixth seed Hubert Hurkacz to triumph at the clay-court ATP 250. Djokovic overturned a 2-4 deficit in the deciding set before sealing victory after three hours, five minutes, the longest match of this year's tournament.

After claiming the gold medal at last year's Paris Olympics, Djokovic had remained agonisingly on 99 titles, while twice coming close to the century. He fell to Jannik Sinner in the Shanghai final in October and was stunned by #NextGenATP Czech Jakub Mensik in the Miami championship match in March this year.

With his victory in Geneva, Djokovic joined Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only men in the Open Era to win 100 or more titles. The Serbian claimed his first in Amersfoort in 2006, when he defeated Hurkacz's current coach Nicolas Massu in the final.

Djokovic became the first man in the Open Era to lift a trophy in 20 different seasons. The Serbian, who turned 38 earlier in the week, is also the oldest winner in Geneva tournament history.

“Primarily I want to thank my wife and kids for coming for three days on their school break just to be with me,” Djokovic said to his family. “I love you, thank you very much for coming to see me, for my birthday, for coming to see the family I have in Geneva.

“My team, thank you, not only for being with me in the good times, but also in the bad times. Only you know how difficult it is to sustain this level of craziness from me on the court. I want to thank you for earning, together with me, this victory number 100.”



Tour-Level Title Leaders (Open Era) 




In 2023, Djokovic produced an outstanding season, in which he claimed seven titles, including a record 24th major and seventh Nitto ATP Finals trophy. His dominance was underscored by his run to within one victory of completing the Calendar Grand Slam, falling just short to Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final.

However, the following campaigns have brought unexpected challenges. Djokovic was forced to withdraw ahead of his Roland Garros quarter-final in 2024 to undergo knee surgery, but made a miraculous recovery to reach the Wimbledon final and claim the Olympic gold medal that had eluded him for so long.

That triumph in the French capital would be his last for a while. After suffering opening round defeats in Doha, Indian Wells, Monte-Carlo and Madrid this year, Djokovic claimed that he was confronting a “new reality” in his career.

Yet with his resurgence in Geneva, Djokovic has proved that the fire still burns. He will now travel to Roland Garros, where his sights are firmly set on winning a record 25th Grand Slam title.







There were nerves from both players, highlighted by Djokovic hitting his first double fault on set point in the opener, but he channeled the fighting spirit for which he has become known. Hurkacz did not drop a point in his opening three service games of the final set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, but Djokovic remained resolute to upend his opponent and notch his eighth consecutive Lexus ATP Head2Head win over the Pole (8-0).
The decisive moment of Saturday's final came in the eighth game of the final set, with Hurkacz serving at 4-3 with a break. He opened by dumping a routine short forehand in the net to set the tone for the rest of the game, in which he hit a double fault before Djokovic scrambled to win for a passing winner at 30/40 to break back and halt the Pole's momentum.
“I was just trying to hang in there, I don't know how I broke his serve,"" said Djokovic. ""He probably broke himself in the third, when he was 4-3 up, but this is what happens at the highest level. Very few points decide the winner. Incredible match, 7-6 in the third with a full stadium, beautiful atmosphere. I'm just grateful to clinch the 100th here.”

Hurkacz underwent meniscus surgery in July last year before reaching a career-high World No. 6 a month later. In Geneva, he was aiming to win his ninth ATP tour trophy and second on clay before he came unstuck by a remarkable comeback from Djokovic.
“Congrats to Novak, his family and his team. One hundred [titles], it's a lot,” Hurkacz said with a laugh during the trophy presentation. “It's really inspiring how you present yourself on the court, off the court. It's just incredible what you have achieved, so congrats for that and for what you have done for the whole sport of tennis.”

Norris vs Leclerc, clever team tactics, and the new two stop rule – What To Watch For in the Monaco Grand Prix

Charles Leclerc completed a practice clean-sweep after setting the fastest time in FP3 ahead of the Monaco Grand Prix, as the session finished under a red flag following a crash for Ferrari team mate Lewis Hamilton.

Drivers and teams embarked on the final hour of practice on the streets of the Principality to find as much performance from their cars as possible, before the most crucial Qualifying session of the season on Saturday afternoon.

PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Is Ferrari's pace in Monaco real – or are McLaren and Red Bull still the teams to beat?

But with track conditions not at their optimum initially, many drivers remained in the pits for the opening 10 minutes with Franco Colapinto the first to set some timed laps on the soft tyre but which were several seconds off the pace from Friday.

Liam Lawson was the only other driver to push for a time during the same period, reporting over the radio that ""the track is very low grip"" to his Racing Bulls team.

Practice 3 results

Nico Hulkenberg moved his Kick Sauber to the top of the times on the medium tyre with a 1m 13.916s, but nearly found the barrier at the final corner later having locked up, before reversing and rejoining unharmed.

Hamilton slotted into second on the soft tyres, but the Ferrari driver complained that ""the rear is sliding a lot"" over the radio before times soon began to tumble as leading runners took to the circuit.

Lando Norris posted a 1m 12.970s on the softs, before his lap was bested by Friday pacesetter Leclerc as the Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Yuki Tsunoda jumped up to third and fourth on the 20-minute mark.

Leclerc and Norris soon engaged in their own personal duel, as first the McLaren driver reasserted himself back at the top with a 1m 12.347s, Leclerc then set a new benchmark of 1m 12.199s, before Norris immediately replied and improved by less than one tenth.

Reigning World Champion Verstappen then asserted himself at the top, the first man of the day to dip below the 1m12s barrier as the Red Bull driver posted a 1m 11.961s with the medium tyre.

He lowered this further, first to a 1m 11.653s, then a 1m 11.233s, the latter a time which was faster than Leclerc's best from Friday as the session reached its halfway point.

Qualifying simulation runs took place over the final 15 minutes, with most drivers performing push, cooldown and push laps, with Verstappen reporting ""I have no grip"" on the soft tyre after failing to improve on his remaining laps.

With just over five minutes remaining, Leclerc moved back to the top on a 1m 11.179s on the soft tyre before the Ferrari driver set a 1m 10.953s, which would finish as the benchmark as the red flags flew with just under two minutes remaining.

Hamilton found the barrier in the final moments of FP3

Hamilton, who set the fifth fastest time, came to a stop at Casino Square having hit the barrier hard through Massenet, with the team in a race against time to repair the damage before Qualifying in just a few hours.

Verstappen finished second, just 0.280s adrift of Leclerc, as Norris and the second McLaren of Oscar Piastri completed the top four.

Alex Albon was the lead Williams in sixth, followed by Lawson and Carlos Sainz, as Tsunoda and Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli completed the top 10 ahead of team mate George Russell, who struggled for pace in 11th.

Fernando Alonso's Aston Martin, Hulkenberg and the Alpine of Pierre Gasly finished 12th-14th, with Lance Stroll next in the order, the Canadian set to serve a one-place grid drop for his clash with Leclerc in FP1.

Ollie Bearman, who will serve a 10-place grid penalty for a red flag infringement in FP2, was P16 with Haas team Esteban Ocon 18th as Isack Hadjar split the pair. Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto and Alpine's Colapinto completed the order.

Max Verstappen knew “straight away” that he faced a difficult Qualifying session for the Monaco Grand Prix, explaining how the nature of the Monte Carlo street circuit has exposed Red Bull's low-speed “weakness”.

Verstappen featured at the front of the field in Saturday's final practice session but the reigning World Champion was left behind by rivals McLaren and Ferrari when the all-important grid decider developed.

In the end, Verstappen had to settle for fifth on the grid, almost three quarters of a second slower than pole-sitter Lando Norris, after struggling to make an impact in the middle sector of the lap.

Verstappen: Monaco highlighted ‘weakness we have in the car'

However, the Dutchman will gain a spot ahead of Sunday's race after the stewards determined that he was impeded by Lewis Hamilton in the first phase of Qualifying – the Ferrari man given a three-place grid drop.

“I felt it straight away in Q1,” Verstappen, who has three pole positions and two race wins to his name this season, said of the RB21's limitations.

“We were lacking quite a bit in Sector 2, all the low-speed, mechanical grip corners, where the track also drops away from you, where you have to ride kerbs… that's where we struggle the most, unfortunately, and that never really seemed to improve a lot.”

Pushed on how much he has been chasing the balance this weekend, Verstappen added: “I think it's just the weakness that we have in the car. The low-speed corners are not good, we know that, and it's just highlighted again.”

In the other Red Bull, Yuki Tsunoda was a disappointed Q2 eliminee with his run to 12th – suggesting after Qualifying that there was more to that early exit than meets the eye.

Asked what happened on his final lap, he said: “I mean, it's not just the last push, it started in Q2, but it's okay… I know what's happened and I don't have to talk [about it] here. I'll try my best to score points. Monaco is always difficult, so let's see.”

Lando Norris claimed his first pole position for the Monaco Grand Prix, the McLaren driver besting home hero Charles Leclerc at the last moment.

The Briton posted a 1m 09.954s with his final effort – the first lap in Monaco history that was under 70 seconds – which left him 0.109s clear of Leclerc to deny the Ferrari driver, who had topped all three practice sessions in the build-up to Qualifying and was sat in provisional pole.

Verstappen admits Monaco exposing Red Bull ‘weakness' after low-key Qualifying performance

When Leclerc topped FP3, it looked like Mclaren were realistically fighting for second today, but come Qualifying, their car came alive. Norris looked the more stable of the duo throughout Qualifying, Piastri quick but erratic as the Australian even clipped the barriers at one point, but both made it to Q3 relatively easily.

They were the only team to come out early enough on their last set of tyres for two push laps – which is just as well. They went 1-2 on their first lap on that last run, but while Piastri made a mistake on his second lap, Norris nailed his to jump back ahead of a rapid Leclerc. It's Norris' first pole since Australia and first in Monaco.

Lando Norris, 1st, 1:09.954

""Pole in Monaco, it feels good! We've worked hard to have a day like this. It's very special to do it here in Monaco, the hardest track to take Pole, and I'm very proud of the whole team, here at the track and back at the factory.

""We employed a different run plan to our rivals but it's what we believed would be best and we stuck with it. The final lap in Q3 around this circuit is about who can risk a little bit more. It was a well put-together lap and it feels good when you cross the line and know it has paid off. I'm going to live in the moment for a little bit and then shift focus to tomorrow.”

Oscar Piastri, 3rd, 1:10.129

“Third is a decent result. It's been a slightly messier weekend on my end, but we were able to put together some solid laps. My first lap in Q3 felt good, and then on the second lap, I made a small mistake in the Nouvelle Chicane which meant I left a little bit out there, but we can be happy. Well done to Lando. It's going to be an exciting race tomorrow with the two stops, so let's see what happens.”

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“An intense and tight Qualifying session – as is often the case here in Monaco. The car was competitive throughout, with Lando and Oscar putting together strong laps. It's a positive outcome, with the cars on the front two rows, which is important for tomorrow where the two mandatory stops are likely to make the race much more open than it has traditionally been. Well done to Lando in securing a Pole position, setting the new lap record for the Circuit de Monaco, and likewise for Oscar who was right up there all the way through Qualifying. Now, the focus goes onto tomorrow.”

Hamilton crashed at the end of FP3, which was hardly ideal heading into Qualifying but at least his team mate topped the session, Leclerc again demonstrating how much pace Ferrari have in Monaco. The team did a good job to repair Hamilton's car for Qualifying, and he repaid them with a Q3 slot. He did get investigated for impeding Verstappen in Q1, swiftly apologising to the Dutchman afterwards after explaining that he had been told his rival was on a slow lap. But he still picked up a three place grid drop and will start seventh.

As for Leclerc, having flirted with pole throughout Qualifying, it took a very special last lap from Norris to beat the Monegasque here on his own streets, as he was forced to settle for second.

Charles Leclerc, 2nd, 1:10.063

""Our expectations for this weekend weren't particularly high, so finishing at the top of the FPs was a positive sign. Unfortunately, this brings some disappointment with it, not having taken pole today. It should be an interesting race tomorrow. There will be strategic games between the teams with the mandatory two-stop, and it's possible that we will find some cars from further down the grid in the mix, so it should be exciting and I can't wait to race on my home streets again.""

Lewis Hamilton, 4th, 1:10.382

""It's been a demanding day, but there are plenty of positives to take. I'm incredibly grateful to the team for getting the car back out after FP3, their effort was outstanding. We got the most out of qualifying today. Obviously, I'm disappointed with the final starting grid position, as I've been pleased with how the car has felt all weekend and the steps we've made. The two-stop strategy will definitely add an extra layer of complexity to the race, but that also opens up opportunities. The goal is to keep pushing and fight for a strong result.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""For the first time this season, we managed to put everything together in qualifying, and doing so here in Monaco makes it even more rewarding. The team did a very good job today and we were competitive right from Q1. However, there's a bit of frustration, as Charles had been quickest in every session, but he still delivered a strong performance and came very close to pole. Lewis also did a great job of rebuilding his confidence after this morning's crash. But unfortunately he will have to start from seventh. In general, we can say we've made good progress compared to previous Saturdays. Now we need to focus on the race, where the goal will be to put pressure on McLaren. We'll focus on ourselves and prepare for tomorrow's challenge.""

Verstappen was exceptionally quick on the medium tyre in FP3, but he could not extract the grip he wanted on the softs which was a worry for the team. But he did much better on the C6 rubber in the early stages of Qualifying. He looked in the mix for pole, but in Q3 his pace faded badly, and he wound up fifth. As for Tsunoda, he also struggled with rear grip and exited in Q2 – having to settle for a disappointing P12 on the grid.

EXPLAINED: What is the new two-stop rule for the Monaco Grand Prix – and how will it work?


Max Verstappen, 5th, 1:10.669

“In FP3 it was clear that we had limitations but unfortunately in sector two we were fairly slow, which was a shame. We were hoping for a bit more pace but it is clear that we are weaker in low speed. We had issues with the kerbs, which has always been the case with this car, and we generally struggle on the low-speed corners. We were just lacking feeling and balance and only managed P5 today. Regarding the moment with Lewis, I understand the Team told him that I was driving slow when in the fast lane so that was not his fault and had nothing to do with him but was a scary moment. Tomorrow, we will have to see how the two stop affects the race and what it brings. It can work for you, or against you, so it is impossible to know at the moment how it will work. It is difficult to pass so we will have to really rely on our strategy and see what the race brings for us.”

Yuki Tsunoda, 12th, 1:11.415

“It was a frustrating day today. I had the pace in FP3 and Q1 and I was running close to Max. I felt ok and the pace was there to reach Q3, I just wasn't able to put a normal lap in during Q2 or one to show what we were capable of. In Monaco it is always difficult to get a clean lap and there was also a red flag thrown in. It had been a pretty clean race week until today and the car had felt good for me, so I am disappointed. I think we will see some interesting stuff tomorrow with the two-stop requirement and I don't think it is going to be a straightforward race. It is hard to predict what will happen in the race but I will do my best. If I see an opportunity I will go for it, and I will try my best to score points.""

Christian Horner, Team Principal

“It was a tough Quali in the end. We haven't managed to carry the speed we found in P3 into Qualifying. It was looking ok at times, I think in Q1 we were looking like we were in with a shout. Then, in Q2 as the track was starting to grip up, we started to see some issues with pace. It was particularly in sector two, where we were struggling and that seems to be where the most damage was. We knew coming here it wasn't going to be our track but with two pit stops tomorrow there is a little more to play with than usual and we still have a chance.”

1 / 2

After a quick Friday, Hadjar struggled for grip in FP3 and wound up down the order, but Lawson showed there was still good pace in the car as he finished in the top 10. The Kiwi carried that form into Qualifying, making Q3 with ease and he was joined there by his team mate – who somehow found the rhythm that he'd lacked earlier. Both grabbed their best grid slots of the season – Hadjar with a brilliant P6, promoted one spot due to Hamilton's penalty, with Lawson starting a few slots further back.

HIGHLIGHTS: Watch the Qualifying action as Norris denies home hero Leclerc pole position in Monaco

Isack Hadjar, 6th, 1:10.923
""I think this is the perfect result and the maximum we could achieve today. We had a difficult FP3 this morning, and going to Qualifying, I didn't have great confidence in the car. Honestly, I wasn't even sure we would reach Q3, so getting to P6 is outstanding. We played it smart and took it step by step, lap after lap. We made the right adjustments every time we went back to the garage, and we were able to make the right steps forward. In Q2, I really felt the car came more alive.

""The target today was to qualify well before starting to think about tomorrow, so there will be plenty to look at tonight in terms of strategies. I'm optimistic about going to the race, and I think that it's going to be interesting having to do two stops. We definitely have the car to fight.”

Liam Lawson, 9th, 1:11.129
""We were able to unlock the car in Free Practice and I've been feeling pretty comfortable all weekend. It was a strong Qualifying for the team, we had a really fast car today but we had even more on the table, as we struggled a little bit with the tyres and had some traffic in Q3. It will be exciting tomorrow with the new rules, we are all going to be learning and trying to make the most of every opportunity and the two stops will certainly make it interesting.

""We will plan the best we can but the most important part of the weekend is done. It's nice that everything has come together to get us to this point, I am stoked for the team with both cars in Q3, we are in a decent position and I'm positive for tomorrow.”

Tim Goss, Chief Technical Officer
“An excellent day for the team. Not without its challenges though. After Friday, we knew we needed more and worked hard in engineering support and the simulator to dial some understeer out of the car and to improve the kerbing performance through the swimming pool chicane. The plan for FP3 was to give our two drivers as many laps as possible to get dialled into the circuit and to give them consistency on the tyres to gain confidence. Here at Monaco, every bit of learning counts. The set up changes were a success for Liam.

""Isack still lacked some confidence in the car and we took the decision to further evolve his setup with a few more small adjustments. As Qualifying progressed, both drivers gained further in the understanding of the car and how to get the tyres into the right window. They both delivered phenomenal laps to put themselves P6 and P9. It's a driver's circuit. We have two great drivers.”

Stroll was carrying a one-place grid drop into Qualifying, and his day did not start much better when he impeded Gasly in Q1 after saying he didn't see the Frenchman coming. He fell by the wayside in Q1, and then the stewards handed him a further three-place grid drop.

Alonso though made it all the way to Q3 on the medium tyres, his last Q2 effort so special he crowed down the radio. He backed that up in the top 10 shootout with seventh – not quite as good as Imola, but not bad at all.

Fernando Alonso, 7th, 1:10.924

""I'm very happy with P7 in Qualifying and I think we did the best job possible. It's such a high adrenaline circuit here and you have to take a huge amount of risk around the lap, but this is what makes it the best Saturday of the year. It's extremely rewarding as a driver. In a normal Monaco, P7 in Qualifying would normally mean the same result in the race, but with the new rules it creates different strategies and opportunities for everyone. Let's see what happens and if we can be on the right side of the luck tomorrow.""

Lance Stroll, 19th, 1:12.563

""Unfortunate session for me today, there was lots of traffic at the start of Q1 that cost me valuable time and then a messy end to Q1 with the yellow flag which cost me the chance to improve my lap time and progress to Q2. We'll see what we can do with the two-stop strategy tomorrow, if there are opportunities to fight back some positions and with some luck there could be the Safety Car playing into our hands.""

Andy Cowell, Team Principal

""Saturday in Monaco is the most important Qualifying session of the year, so it was great to see Fernando deliver some excellent laps and secure seventh on the grid. He really enjoyed those laps, and you could see how much it meant to him and the entire team. Fernando was the only driver to progress through Q2 on the Medium tyres and full credit to the team for a well-executed session. Lance was really unlucky today: his opening laps were impacted by traffic and the yellow flag at the end of Q1 cost him the chance to progress. There's plenty to play for tomorrow, especially with different strategies expected up and down the grid with all cars pitting at least twice.""

1 / 2

Williams looked quick on Saturday, as they did on Friday and aimed to get both cars into Q3, but a gamble on the mediums in Q2 did not pay off with the timing of the red flags. In the end they swapped to softs, Albon making it through but Sainz tumbling out after complaining of a lack of rear grip. In Q3, Albon opted for the mediums for his first run, but his second run was not strong enough and he wound up a slightly disappointing P10.

Alex Albon, 10th, 1:11.213

""Frustrating day. I think my Q2 lap was half a second quicker than my Q3, so we need to understand why. We were in a really good rhythm from FP1 to FP3 and then in Qualifying it seemed that the tyres were not working properly throughout, and they were inconsistent. With that Q2 lap I thought we finally got it to work then we lost grip again in Q3. Even though it's a two-stop it's still going to be a managed race to some extent so it will be interesting.""

Carlos Sainz,11th, 1:11.362

""My weekend has been challenging from the beginning, never finding a sweet spot with the car. Despite that, I had enough pace to go into Q3 but for some reason the Soft tyre on our car felt a bit like a lottery and in Q2 we clearly didn't switch it on, which meant we had no grip at all. It's frustrating, but I think that tomorrow we might have an interesting race with the mandatory two-stops. We'll try to make the most out of it.""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""Today was all about tyres. We didn't have them working the right way with Carlos in Q2 or with Alex at the end of Q3. There is lots to learn and understand but that won't apply tomorrow. The main element now is working on how we move forward with the new two-stop regulations in the race and I'm confident the car is still quick.""

1 / 2

Bearman was carrying a 10-place grid drop into Qualifying, so would have been forgiven for sitting it out and saving tyres. But instead he took part fully, although he exited in Q1 thanks to the late red flags. Ocon made it to Q2, and then motored all the way into Q3 for just the second time this season. He ran the mediums for his first run in Q3, before switching to the softs and bagging eighth, fractions behind Alonso in P7 as the Frenchman chases his first points since Bahrain.

Esteban Ocon, 8th, 1:10.942

“I'm extremely happy, it's very unexpected. Looking at where we've struggled at some events now with the front end of the car, we're not exactly where we want to be. We've seen the issue more and more at these last events and it's been good to see that we've continued working as a team, even through qualifying to figure it out. That Q2 lap was decent and we saw that something was to play for, and that Q3 lap I was really happy with, I think we maximized the potential. It was a nice effort from everyone, I'm happy with that, but I'm sure we can do better than this. Tomorrow, there's going to be a lot of unknowns – we need to see who's on which tire, but we'll enjoy it now and start working on strategy tonight.”

Oliver Bearman, 17th, 1:11.979

“The feeling was really good in qualifying; the car felt the best it had done all weekend and I had great confidence. I was really happy with that qualifying, but we didn't want to be in Q2 because of our penalty, although I think my lap would've got me into Q2 quite cleanly. A good qualifying position wouldn't have changed my life unless it was in the top five, and we didn't expect to be there today. I still wanted to push and see, and I was really happy with the two laps I did on new tires. It's a shame as the pace was really good today but we're going to have to suck it up and get on with it. I'm sure we can try something though, it's going to be a crazy race tomorrow.""

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“There are mixed feelings after qualifying because of Ollie's penalty and the pace he's been showing all weekend, but I'm so happy for Esteban. In Monaco, qualifying is so important, and it's definitely the most challenging qualifying to manage, but I'm delighted in the way that everyone worked together. Our execution and operation was good, communication was good, and Esteban just stepped up every single time. On Ollie's lap, we told him to back off and we discussed it before. It was tricky to manage but we got it spot on, as Ollie ended one tenth behind Esteban in Q1, and that's what we wanted to do. Anyway, I'm so happy we could show this potential and the whole team's execution of the session.”

1 / 2

It was a mixed bag for Kick Sauber in Monte Carlo. Bortoleto exited in a disrupted Q1 session, the late red flags limiting everyone's flying laps as the chequered flag fell. Hulkenberg made Q2 though, and briefly flirted with the top 10 but ultimately did not have the pace for Q3. He was 13th though, the second best Grand Prix Qualifying he has managed this season.

Nico Hulkenberg, 13th, 1:11.596

“It was a clean qualifying session today. Reaching Q2 was an important target, and I'm pleased we achieved that: to be honest, however, I was hoping for a stronger grid position than P13. In the final runs of Q2 I wasn't able to find more lap time, especially in sector one and two; sector three was really strong, but it unfortunately the wasn't quite enough to make it into Q3.

“Our focus now shifts to tomorrow's race. We showed solid pace on long runs during yesterday's free practice, which gives us some confidence. The real challenge, though, will be managing the three mandatory sets of tyres. It will be interesting to see how teams approach that, as there are quite a few strategic options on the table. Obviously, teams and drivers will have long meetings tonight and cook up some ideas.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, 16th, 1:11.902

""It's very painful to miss Q2 by just two hundredths of a second, especially here in Monaco, where everything is so close and the difference hangs on getting every corner perfectly. I braked just a bit too late going into the second-to-last corner, which caused some understeer and likely cost me those crucial milliseconds. But in a qualifying session like this, everyone could say the same—there's always something more you could have done. After a tough FP3, I'm glad we found a better balance for qualifying; it was the first session in which I felt at ease with the car, which is crucial as you need to be on the pace from the first run.

“Tomorrow's race, with the new tyre compound rules, will be interesting—we'll likely see some crazy strategies, some successful and others not, but there will be a few more chances to move up compared to a regular Monaco. We're close to our rivals, and we'll try to maximise any opportunity. Even though today's result is disappointing, it's part of the unique challenge of Monaco. Now, our focus shifts entirely to tomorrow—we have to be clever with our strategy and fight for every position.""

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

""Today's qualifying session underscored just how incredibly tight the margins are this season. In Q1, the gap between P1 and P15 was a mere six-tenths of a second. Gabriel delivered a clean and composed performance throughout all three practice sessions and into qualifying. It's important to remember that this was his first time driving on this circuit in a Formula One car, and his measured approach gave him the best possible foundation going into the session. In the end, he narrowly missed out on Q2 by just 0.022 seconds, finishing P16.

“Nico, meanwhile, found a strong rhythm over the weekend, carried that momentum into qualifying, and progressed through to Q2 to secure P13. What stood out most today was the team's execution—communication was sharp, decisions were well-timed, and everything came together cohesively. It's a strong indicator of the team's operational strength and gives us confidence heading into tomorrow's race.

“Looking ahead, the revised sporting regulations—which require all teams to use three sets of tyres—will demand smart, flexible strategy calls. That's where opportunities may arise, and we'll be doing everything we can to identify and capitalise on them.”

Mercedes were not particularly quick in final practice, Russell even saying on the radio that he was out of ideas. But their day went from bad to worse in Qualifying. First Antonelli clipped the barriers coming into the Nouvelle Chicane, hitting the opposite wall as he exited Qualifying as a result. Then Russell lost power at the start of Q2, having to be pushed out of the tunnel by the marshals to end his day earlier than planned. Far from ideal, but the team might now gamble big on strategy tomorrow to try and salvage a point or two.

George Russell, 14th, 1:11.507

""Today was incredibly disappointing. I felt good in the car in Q1, and the team had done a fantastic job in turning it around after three difficult practice sessions. To not have the chance to show what was possible in Qualifying is both frustrating and a little heartbreaking. I believe we had a chance to get the car onto the front two rows of the grid. I had only used one set of the Soft tyres in Q1 and the Medium compound at the start of Q2 felt good. It was definitely coming towards us.

""The issue itself was odd. I hit a bump on the run out of Turn 1 and lost power. It felt like something electronic just disconnected. I tried everything I could to get the car back to the garage and then restart it when I stopped in the tunnel. Unfortunately, there was nothing more we could do. Starting P14 tomorrow is obviously far from ideal. That is even more true in Monaco. It will be a struggle to score anything more than minor points but, with the two mandatory stops, let's wait and see what happens.""

Kimi Antonelli, 15th, No time set in Q2

""I am gutted by how today's Qualifying session went. We are always close to the limit in Monaco and the line between getting it right and getting it wrong is thin. That is particularly true come Qualifying. I tried to find those missing tenths but ultimately had an unnecessary and costly mistake. I turned slightly earlier than usual in Turn 10 and clipped the barrier. I damaged the front, and I know there was nothing I could do from there and was a passenger into the barrier. I had enough pace to get through to the latter parts of Qualifying, so it was a costly error.

""It is such a shame because we were coming back into a good place with the car and I was finding a good rhythm. We had struggled the entire weekend up to that point, but I kept improving lap after lap in Q1. I felt good in the car today and I can only say sorry to the team. Starting P14 tomorrow in Monaco means that we need to think differently. We did not expect to be starting this far back with both cars so tomorrow we will be looking to take any opportunities we can and chase all the positions possible.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""Today was a difficult day and a very disappointing result - to finish P14 and P15 is a long way below our level. We were struggling for pace in practice and made some sizeable set-up changes going into Qualifying. For George in particular, this made the car come alive and he showed really strong pace to finish Q1 in the top five.

""Unfortunately, it was a more difficult session for Kimi. He was right on the cut-off when he made a small mistake on the entry of the Nouvelle Chicane - but like always in Monaco, it had big consequences, and he finished in the barrier.

""We therefore began Q2 with one car and George running the Medium tyre; he had found nearly one tenth of a second in the first corner when he suddenly lost power going up the hill to Massenet. We suspect an electrical fault, but the team is still working to track down the exact cause. As he came to a halt in the tunnel, and was unable to restart the car, it became clear that he would line up just ahead of Kimi in P14. It's all the more frustrating as George had the pace to fight for the front two rows today.

""It goes without saying that it will be a long afternoon tomorrow - the mandatory two stops might open up more opportunities than usually happens in Monaco, but it won't be easy to make up places. Notwithstanding that, we will be giving it our all and racing hard to get the maximum from what has been a difficult weekend so far.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""It is really disappointing to be this far down the grid with both of our cars for tomorrow's race.

""We've been struggling the entire weekend with our single laps, and it has not been easy on our drivers. That has put them under a lot of pressure this weekend to deliver fast laps at the critical moments and that definitely contributed to Kimi's incident. Drivers are always on the limit here in Monaco and a little mistake can cost a lot. That was certainly true on his side of the garage and that left him P15.

""On George's side, he was pleased with the progress we had made since the end of FP3. We had been making significant setup changes from FP1 through to Qualifying and it felt like we had found a good pace by the start of Q1. That allowed George to only use one set of Soft tyres in that segment and would have been beneficial in the latter parts of Qualifying. In Q2, we decided to go for the Medium tyres as they appeared to be quick as well. Our session came to an end shortly after with a loss of power after hitting a bump. We're investigating the cause of that, but it looks like an electrical issue.

""Starting P14 and P15, we will review all the strategic options for tomorrow's race overnight. We know that starting so far back that it won't be an easy Grand Prix. The silver lining is that with the mandatory two stops regulation, it should afford us more flexibility and create more opportunities. It hopefully will increase our chances to make progress, and we will stand ready to take advantage.""

1 / 2

Not to be for Alpine in Monaco. They gambled on the medium tyres at the start of Qualifying, but soon switched to the softs. Gasly lost a flying lap after being impeded by Stroll, and then the late red flags for Antonelli's crash meant he lost a chance to move on. Colapinto just didn't have the pace all day, as he continues to struggle to get to grips with the track here.

Pierre Gasly, 18th, 1:11.994

“It is always disappointing to be knocked out in Q1 so right now I feel sad for everyone at the team. We were lacking pace today. It is all relative, though, as we were seven tenths off the best time in Q1 and that is the difference between being in the top ten in the session or being in the bottom five and out. For some reason we are just too slow here. The car is moving around on the bumps, we are lacking grip and generally sliding too much. We tried different set-ups but we just could not fix those difficult areas. Tomorrow, we have the mandatory two-stops, so it certainly is not over yet. We need something to happen and we will see what we can do tomorrow to try and work our way back up towards the points positions. There are a lot of cars ahead in order to make our way to the top ten but tomorrow could be interesting with some variation on strategy. We just have to be on top of it and see what we can achieve.”

Franco Colapinto, 20th, 1:12.597

“It was not the easiest day for us today. We have struggled with the pace of the car, in particular on the Soft tyres in low speed corners where we face some difficulties with traction. We expected to be able to extract more from the car here but that has not been the case and the result from Qualifying sets us a challenge to move forward tomorrow. We will look to capitalise on the uncertainty the new mandatory two-stop at this track will bring to the race. No one knows what advantage the new rule will give to teams, which will make the race even more unpredictable, especially with how a Safety Car could make or break anyone's strategy. We will keep our heads down and work tonight to prepare for the challenge tomorrow.”

Flavio Briatore, Executive Advisor

“We thought coming to Monaco we would be more competitive than we have shown so far this weekend. It has not been a good Saturday and it is clear we need to improve and give the drivers a car that is quicker and more consistent. With two stops in the race tomorrow it gives us more of a chance with strategy to make a move in the pit-stops, so let's see what we can do with the engineers to help Pierre and Franco tomorrow.”

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“What a qualifying session! Saturday in Monaco always delivers plenty of excitement and that was the case once again today. For us, it was very interesting to see how the C6 performed in qualifying again and I believe we can say that, on this track, the softest compound in the 2025 range offered a little something extra in terms of performance compared to the C5. We're definitely not talking about a big difference, around a tenth of a second or so, a tenth and a half, but it was definitely there. Yes, we saw some drivers using the Medium in qualifying which confirms the performance gap is not that big and also, as we saw last week in Imola, that in some situations, the C5 can offer greater confidence compared to its softer sibling, something that takes on great importance at this track. Usually, Sunday can be less exciting than Saturday in Monaco, but I think that this time we can expect a different afternoon's action to usual.

FACTS AND STATS: Norris smashes Monaco lap record to claim McLaren's first pole there since 2007

""In terms of strategy, tomorrow's race will be a one-off. The changes to the Sporting Regulations introduced specifically for this Grand Prix require the use of at least three sets of tyres, which means anything is possible in terms of the pit stop windows, given that there really are so many theoretical possibilities, not to mention appearances from the Safety Car being quite likely at this track. All three compounds will come into play: in fact, drivers from three teams, Red Bull, Racing Bulls and Sauber, only have one set of Hard tyres and one of Medium, so they are bound to have to use the C6 during the race.

""We know how good the teams are when it comes to exploiting any opportunity presented by the regulations, so we can expect some surprises, including in terms of stint lengths.”

Neon, which acquired the new film from the dissident Iranian director for North America a few days ago, has picked the Palme winner for the sixth year in a row.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Dissident Iranian director Jafar Panahi has won the Palme d'Or for best film for It Was Just an Accident at the 78th Cannes international film festival.


	Panahi, who just a few years ago was imprisoned in Tehran and under a 20-year travel and work ban, returned triumphantly to Cannes, accepting his award from jury president (and vocal Panahi fan) Juliette Binoche.




	Panahi's film, his first since being released from prison in 2023, is a direct assault on Iran's authoritarian regime. The thriller follows a former political prisoner who kidnaps a man he believes to be his torturer and then debates with other dissidents whether to kill or forgive him.

	The win marks the sixth time in a row a film acquired by Neon for North America has won the Palme d'Or. Tom Quinn's indie outfit kept its Cannes streak going by picking up It Was Just an Accident earlier this week.


	With his Cannes win, Jafar Panahi has now completed the rare festival triple crown, winning the top prize at all three major European film festivals, following his Golden Lion win in Venice for The Circle (2000) and Berlin's Golden Bear for Taxi (2015). Panahi is only the fourth director — after Henri-Georges Clouzot, Michelangelo Antonioni and Robert Altman — to win the big three.


	The 2025 Cannes jury included actors Halle Berry, Jeremy Strong and Italy's Alba Rohrwacher; directors Dieudo Hamadi, Hong Sang-soo, Payal Kapadia and Carlos Reygadas; and French-Moroccan writer Leïla Slimani.


	The festival got its own dramatic twist ending early on Saturday when a regional power outage shut down the electrical grid serving Cannes and much of the surrounding region. The outage, apparently caused by deliberate sabotage on the electrical infrastructure, disrupted early morning screenings and forced hotels, shops and cafes in the city to close. 


	But the festival was largely unaffected. The Palais, where the closing ceremony is held, switched to emergency power and carried on much as before.


	Cannes had a particularly strong lineup this year, with no single film the overall frontrunner going into the awards.


	Binoche began the ceremony by bestowing a special prize on Chinese director Bi Gan for Resurrection. Rohrwacher gave the Camera d'Or trophy for first feature to The President's Cake director Hasan Hadi, who is the first Iraqi director to win a prize in Cannes.

	











	John C. Reilly, in Cannes for the Un Certain Regard film Heads or Tails?, added a musical touch to the ceremony, breaking out into an English-language rendition of “La Vie en Rose” when presenting best screenplay prize to two-time Palme d'Or winners Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne for the Belgian social drama Young Mothers.


	Brazilian actor Wagner Moura took best actor for his starring role in The Secret Agent, Kleber Mendonça Filho's 1970s-set Brazilian political thriller. In a rare double award, Filho also took best director for the feature.


	Newcomer Nadia Melliti beat out Jennifer Lawrence's turn in Lynne Ramsay's Die, My Love to take the best actress honor, playing the lead role in Hafsia Herzi's Muslim lesbian coming-of-age story The Little Sister.


	German director Mascha Schilinski won the Jury Prize for Sound of Falling, only her second film, an epic family drama set across four generations in the same rural farmhouse. She shared the honor with Spanish director Oliver Laxe for Sirat, a techno-infused apocalyptic drama set in the Moroccan desert.

She also appeared alongside Clint Eastwood in several films, most famously as a hostage in the ""Go Ahead, Make My Day"" scene in ‘Sudden Impact.'


							By 

	Mike Barnes


Senior Editor


	Mara Corday, who was menaced by a huge hairy spider in the cult horror film Tarantula and appeared in several films thanks to Clint Eastwood, whom she called a “godsend,” has died. She was 95.


	Corday died Feb. 9 at her home in Valencia, California, according to a death certificate filed with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health that was obtained by The Washington Post. The cause was arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease.




	A onetime contract player at Universal-International, Corday also worked in many Westerns, among them Drums Across the River (1954), starring Audie Murphy; King Vidor's Man Without a Star (1955), starring Kirk Douglas; and The Quiet Gun (1957), starring Forrest Tucker.

	She said she was especially proud of her turn as a fun-loving French girl in the Technicolor romantic musical comedy So This Is Paris (1954), directed by Richard Quine and starring Tony Curtis and Gloria DeHaven.


	Corday was married to actor Richard Long (Bourbon Street Beat, 77 Sunset Strip, The Big Valley, Nanny and the Professor) from 1957 until his death in 1974 at age 47 from heart problems.


	In the Jack Arnold-directed Tarantula (1955), also starring John Agar, Corday portrays the lab assistant Stephanie “Steve” Clayton, who comes to Arizona to work for a scientist (Leo G. Carroll) who has developed an artificial super-nutrient through radioactivity that sparks extraordinary, rapid growth.


	“There's not much of a plot,” Corday said in an interview for Tom Weaver's 1996 book It Came From Horrorwood. “You're at the mercy of the ‘fright,' the ‘horror,' or whatever. You're at the mercy of the special effects people, because if they don't do a good job, then the whole picture goes in the toilet. For instance, The Giant Claw!”


	Yes, Corday starred in that monster movie about a giant bird and in another one also released in 1957, The Black Scorpion.


	When Eastwood, a fellow Universal contract player who had bit parts in Man Without a Star and (as a jet fighter pilot) in Tarantula, became a big star, he got Corday work in The Gauntlet (1977), Sudden Impact (1983), Pink Cadillac (1989) and her last film, The Rookie (1990).


	In the 1983 film, she played the coffee shop waitress who puts way too much sugar in Dirty Harry's coffee, then gets held at gunpoint by a bad guy.

	











	“My buddy! One of my closest, dearest friends — a godsend!” she said of Eastwood in a 1996 chat for the Western Clippings website. “When my [SAG] insurance ran out, he put me in The Gauntlet. Then my insurance was OK. When it ran out again, he put me in Sudden Impact. I was the hostage — and it's here that Clint said the famous line, ‘Make my day!'”


	Marilyn Joan Watts was born in Santa Monica on Jan. 3, 1930. She worked as an usherette at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles, then was hired by the Earl Carroll Revue in Hollywood when she was 17. She spent about two years there, going from showgirl to acting in sketches with vaudeville legend Pinky Lee.


	She took Mara from a nickname given to her by a bongo player and Corday from a perfume and signed with top Hollywood agent Paul Kohner, who got her on TV in The Adventures of Kit Carson and Craig Kennedy, Criminologist and in films including Two Tickets to Broadway (1951) and Problem Girls (1953).


	The exotic actress signed with Universal for $175 a week and appeared in Yankee Pasha (1954), Playgirl (1954) — that's where she first met Long — Francis Joins the WACS (1954), Foxfire (1955) and Arnold's The Man From Bitter Ridge (1955).


	After she left Universal — she and Mamie Van Doren had received the most fan mail of all the contract players at the studio, she said — she starred in Naked Gun (1956), Raw Edge (1956), A Day of Fury (1956), Undersea Girl (1957) and Girls on the Loose (1958) and appeared in Playboy magazine.

	











	She followed with guest shots on several TV Westerns, including The Restless Gun, Tales of Wells Fargo, Wanted: Dead or Alive and Laramie.


	After Long's first wife, actress Suzan Ball, died of cancer in 1955 at age 22, Corday and Long wed in Las Vegas in January 1957. “I thought when we married we would make a great showbiz team, but Richard didn't want me in the business,” she said.


	She noted that she had roles sewn up in the films Night Passage (1957) and The Oregon Trail (1959) and on a 1966 episode of The Big Valley, but Long torpedoed those. She eventually abandoned her acting career and raised their three kids, Carey, Valerie and Greg. 


	“Richard Long was an enigma,” Corday said in her Western Clippings interview. “I divorced him 10 times the first year of our marriage, getting a lawyer and everything … and 13 times the second year. He'd plead — literally on his hands and knees, ‘Please forgive me, I don't know why I did it, give me another chance.' I loved him and I am still in love with him — 22 years after his death.”

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Call them a barometer, clairvoyant, or just god damn shrewd when it comes to choosing award-winning movies, but Neon has just scored its sixth Cannes Palme d'Or in a row with It Was Just an Accident.


	Deadline's Andreas Wiseman first reported two days ago that Neon scooped up North American rights to the movie.


	This comes after last year's Cannes top prize winner Anora, Justine Triet's 2023 title Anatomy of a Fall, 2022's Triangle of Sadness, 2021's Titane and 2019's Parasite. Out of that bunch, Anora and Parasite went on to win Best Picture at the Oscars, which is whole other level of award campaigning genius on behalf of the Tom Quinn run distribution label.

It Was Just an Accident blurb reads “What begins as a minor accident sets in motion a series of escalating consequences.” The pic was one of the best-reviewed movies at the festival, deals in a fictional way with past wrongfully incarcerated working-class people seeking revenge against the guard who tortured and berated them.

	Interesting, Neon had all bases covered in regards to who might spring up as a Palme d'Or winner with their other acquisitions coming up with alotta gold tonight. Last year, Deadline exclusively reported that Neon took domestic on Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value which was buzzed to take the top prize as well, but settled with the Grand Prix.


	Neon's Sirat from Oliver Laxe won the Jury Prize in a tie with Sound of Falling. NEON took North American on Sirat yesterday. 


	In addition, Neon took Brazil's buzzy 1977 political thriller The Secret Agent earlier this week, that Kleber Mendonca Filho directed movie walking away with Best Director tonight as well as Best Actor for Wagner Moura.


	No theatrical release dates have been set yet for these titles by Neon. October has been a prized timeframe for the distributor to launch Cannes titles, read, that's when Anora, Parasite and Triangle of Sadness opened.

When did the entertainment industry start its downturn? Was it the rise of Netflix? The strikes? The COVID-19 pandemic? Brad Hall, founder of EntertainmentCareers.Net, said the dip began in December 2019. During the final quarter of that year, he and his team noticed some very “strange signals” that suggested jobs in production were about to take a massive hit.

“We felt that we had reached a pinnacle of production in our lifetime, especially in the United States, especially in Los Angeles, and we didn't see a meaningful recovery for 10 years,” he said. “Then, of course, that was all hidden because the pandemic happened and then multiple labor strikes.”

 








Related Stories Documentarian Sacha Jenkins Has Died: ‘Louis Armstrong's Black & Blues' Filmmaker Started as a Journalist ‘It Was Just an Accident' Wins the Palme d'Or at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival (Complete Winners List) 

Hollywood took a similar hit during the economic crisis and recession that began in 2008, but recovery came when tech companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Apple poured in cash to build platforms and libraries. Today, Hall doesn't see a savior — but there's still creative work to be found and a lot of it on Entertainment Careers, with members who pay $9.95/month or less depending on the plan they choose receiving the full benefits of the site. This work just might not be where you expect.




			Popular on IndieWire		






“What we do now is try and point people to see themselves in a larger skillset,” said Hall, “like pointing [producers] to experiential marketing or  pivoting into live events.”

Hall predicts “massive growth” in live events: It's where companies like Amazon and Netflix are redirecting their investments with comedy and sports. He believes one of these platforms may stream music festivals like Coachella or live Broadway shows down the line.

“The cost of production is relatively low,” Hall told IndieWire. “It's an event that's already happening. So we are trying to get people that have any experience in live events to start shifting in those directions.” 

At Backstage, vice president Luke Crowe takes a similar view. He said while self-tapes now make it easier for actors to audition, that glut also makes it harder to get noticed. Through its $24.99/month or $199.99/year membership fee, what Backstage wants to provide, Crowe said, is redirection.

“There's a lot of new types of work coming up,” Crowe said. “Depending where somebody's interests are and where they are at in their career, there are some good opportunities. We've seen a lot of growth in online advertising — branded content that's not meant to really look like advertising.” 

 










These are typically TikTok or YouTube videos featuring actors using a product in a way that doesn't feel like too much of a pitch or when a company puts their name behind a live event or series that attracts its sales base. “Branded content” does not sound as sexy as “network pilot”; the work may not be union and the pay will be lower. However, it's still a paycheck and can go on a reel. It's also possible that it will be seen by more people than an independent feature or even some television shows. More importantly, Crowe said, working in this space of creative advertising will likely lead to more job opportunities.

“Actors and directors and crew who may not have even had those opportunities before, they get that one big nationwide commercial, now there's like a 1,000 smaller [commercial] spots for them to be able to get into,” he said. “It can build up better reels and you can really create a living out of a lot of that, cumulatively.” 

Another key to creating long-term success is self reflection: Where are you, really, in your career? Dreams of fame, fortune, and the belief that your story is so special that it must be told are common; it's what draws many people to entertainment. However, the ability to stick around is based largely on the ability to get over yourself and focus on developing interpersonal skills and the ability to adapt. 

 










“You've got to jump over this chasm from graduating or from career changing to becoming employable, to start getting consistent paid work,” said My First Job in Film founder and managing director Sam Kirkwood. 

As a “hybrid film school/agency,” My First Job in Film offers a free service that focuses on teaching soft skills, like networking and the ability to cold-call with grace. They also aim to adjust mindsets, advising some to take jobs that may not do anything for your entertainment career other than making you available for it.

“We start advocating for what we call ‘safety net jobs.' It's a job that gives you flexibility — typically shift work,” said Kirkwood, “so if a job does come up last minute or tomorrow there's a great opportunity, you can get someone to cover.”

Developing these soft skills and sense of determination can represent all the difference in making the leap across what he calls “the employability chasm.” With each member, Kirkwood and his team assess what specific stage they're at and work to level them up.

“For a production PA, it might be you've gotta do half a dozen short films,” Kirkwood said. ”Why? Because on the fifth one you might meet somebody who's doing a favor for somebody and they're looking for a PA for their next paid gig. And so you've come from somewhere having no experience, met people, networked, had time to get comfortable in the environment, understand the lingo of being on set — all the soft skills that are required.”

 










For jobs in development or at agencies, My First Job in Film promotes a challenge that requires members to execute 20 steps each day toward advancing their careers. That could be a LinkedIn post or a cold call, but it's all about getting in the habit of putting themselves out there — and being easier to find. 

Who you know in this industry always matters, but Hall added that experience you rack up is what recruiters find most attractive nowadays.

“I would say we're back into that era of the resume,” Hall said. “For us, 85 percent of the people are applying incorrectly.” He said most people look at “how awesome this job would be for them” rather than communicate how they fit “the needs of the employer.” 

Truth is, chasing your dreams is a marathon. When creative work is impossible, it's always okay to redirect your skills to whatever lets you pay the bills. Said Hall, “Any port in a storm.”

“Louis Armstrong's Black & Blues” documentarian Sacha Jenkins is dead. His wife Raquel Cepeda confirmed his passing on Instagram in a post asking for privacy for their family at this time. 

Hailing from Philadelphia and born in 1971, Jenkins began his career as a journalist before becoming an acclaimed documentarian. He founded Graphic Scenes & Xplicit Language, an early magazine devoted to graffiti art, and co-founded hip-hop magazine Beat Down as well as the alt-culture magazine Ego Trip.

Jenkins was the kind of journalist for whom making the transition to documentary filmmaking was a natural one, and a hip-hop sensibility infused his film work — either directly as in his 2015 directorial debut “Fresh Dressed” about hip-hop fashion or the 2019 miniseries “Wu-Tang: Of Mics and Men,” for which he was Emmy nominated, or more in terms of attitude, such as having Nas narrate Satchmo's letters in Apple TV+'s “Louis Armstrong's Black & Blues.”

“Louis Armstrong's Black & Blues” world premiered at TIFF 2022 and was campaigned heavily by Apple during that awards season. It won the IDA Award for Best Music Documentary, and IndieWire featured it at our November 2022 Consider This FYC Brunch, where this writer interviewed Jenkins and producer Julie Anderson onstage. 

The film broke out of a lot of music documentary conventions, utilizing a unique collage-like graphic style to bring Armstrong's words to life, rather than relying on talking head interviewees. Finding a new way to tell stories that could be very straightforward was his specialty — and part of the reason Eminem chose him to co-author his 2008 autobiography “The Way I Am.” 

Obviously exhausted from just having flown into LA from London, where he had been promoting the “Black & Blues” just beforehand, he showed a deadpan wit in our onstage interview at our brunch nonetheless. When I asked him how he avoided music doc tropes, he said, “I haven't watched those other films.”

“I'm supposedly a hip-hop guy,” Jenkins added. “But I will tell you, I made films about Rick James and the Wu-Tang Clan and now Louis Armstrong, and it's the same story every time,” he said. “Louis Armstrong went to reform school for a gun charge at 14. And if you go through the streets of New York right now, 14-year-olds are killing each other with guns every day.”

 










“Is it jazz, is it blues, is it techno… to me, when it comes to Black music in America, there are no genres,” he said. “It's just the music is a reflection of and a reaction to the environment. And unfortunately, in some ways, the environment hasn't changed. But that environment doesn't stop us from being very creative. It doesn't stop us from expressing ourselves. And that, to me, was the most important point of the film.” 

Jenkins directed two final films, afterward: “Sunday Best,” about how Ed Sullivan platformed Black artists during the Civil Rights era, and “All Up in the Biz: The Life and Rhymes of Biz Markie.”

	Wearing a red MAGA hat, President Donald Trump said that his election victory means he can do whatever he wants in his commencement speech at West Point on Saturday. 


	“We had the greatest election victory,” Trump told cadets of the elite United States Military Academy. “This was November 5. We won the popular vote by millions of votes. We won all seven swing states. We won everything.… We had a great mandate, and it gives us the right to do what we want to do to make our country great again, and that's what we're going to do.”


	Although the president loves insulting the military, this time he showered the graduates with praise. He also took credit for creating the military's strength. 


	“In a few moments, you'll become graduates of the most elite and storied military academy in human history,” Trump said. “And you will become officers of the greatest and most powerful army the world has ever known. And I know, because I rebuilt that army, and I rebuilt the military. And we rebuilt it like nobody has ever rebuilt it before in my first term.”

	











	He told the cadets they are “the first West Point graduates of the golden age of America. This is the golden age. I tell you, promise, we're in a new age.”

	Of course, this is not the first time that Trump has laid claim to unlimited power. Trump posted a similar declaration on social media in February. “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” he wrote on Truth Social and X. 


	This idea was validated by the Supreme Court last year, when the conservative justices ruled that a former president is entitled to sweeping immunity from criminal prosecutions. At the time, sources told Rolling Stone that a second Trump administration would use this decision as a shield against pesky laws and rules as they sought to implement their policy agenda. 


	“It's like Christmas,” a conservative attorney close to Trump told Rolling Stone. 


	“In every use of official power,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in her dissent, “the president is now a king above the law.”

	Just months into Trump's second term, his administration has disregarded due process rights and orders from judges, including those on the Supreme Court, that it return Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia from his incarceration in El Salvador. 

	











	In March, Trump sent hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to a notorious prison system in El Salvador without due process, in defiance of a Maryland judge's order. This week, a Massachusetts judge found that Trump officials violated his court order — which prohibits the administration from deporting immigrants to third-party countries without due process — as it moved to send a group of detainees to South Sudan, a dangerous and war-torn country.   


	Over and over again, courts have ruled that the Trump administration's actions are unlawful. Speaking before the West Point cadets, Trump expressed hope that judges will stop standing in the way and allow him to continue his lawless deportations, framing them as necessary to stop a criminal “invasion” at the border. “It's not easy, but hopefully the courts will allow us to continue,” he said.


	Trump separately praised his record so far as president. 


	“Our country is doing well,” he told the cadets. “We've turned it around, very quickly. We've turned it around.”

It's true. We have the hottest country in the world, and the whole world is talking about it, and that's an honor for all of us. I cannot wait to see the glory that is still ahead.”


	Trump also took aim at critical race theory and transgender people's participation in sports. Earlier this year, West point disbanded several clubs including the Asian-Pacific Forum Club, the Japanese Forum Club, the Latin Cultural Club, the National Society of Black Engineers Cub, the Native American Heritage Forum, and the Society of Women Engineers Club in response to the Trump administration's executive order to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, or DEI.

	“We've liberated our troops from divisive and demeaning political trainings,” Trump said. “There will be no more critical race theory or ‘transgender for everybody' forced onto our brave men and women in uniform, or on anybody else for that matter, in this country. And we will not have men playing in women's sports.”


	He drew attention to West Point's football quarterback, Bryson Daily: “I don't think a lot of women want to tackle him. I don't think so. How crazy is it — men playing in women's sports? How crazy is it? So ridiculous, so demeaning, so demeaning to women. And it's over. That's over. We've ended it.”

In 2010, in a small New Hampshire town, next door to a copy center and framing shop, a ghost lab opened. The Kitt Research Initiative's mission was to use the scientific method to document the existence of spirits. Founder Andy Kitt was known as a straight-shooter; and was unafraid — perhaps eager — to offend other paranormal investigators by exposing the fraudulence of their less advanced techniques. But when KRI started to lose money, Kitt began to seek funding from the paranormal community, attracting flocks of psychics, alien abductees, witches, mediums, ghost hunters, UFOlogists, cryptozoologists and warlocks from all over New England, and the world. And there were plenty of them around.

Matthew Hongoltz-Hetling, author of the new book The Ghost Lab, explains the wild ecosystem of paranormal profiteers and consumers through the astonishing story of what happened in this one small town. He also maps the trends of declining scientific literacy, trust in institutions, and the diffusion of a culture that has created space for armies of pseudoscientists to step into the minds of an increasingly credulous public.

Matthew Hongoltz-Hetling is a freelance journalist specializing in narrative features and investigative reporting. He was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. He is the author of A Libertarian Walks into a Bear and It Sounds Like a Quack. His new book is The Ghost Lab: How Bigfoot Hunters, Mediums, and Alien Enthusiasts are Wrecking Science.

When astronomers announced last month they might have discovered the most promising hints of alien life yet on a distant planet, the rare good news raised hopes humanity could soon learn we are not alone in the universe.

But several recent studies looking into the same data have found that there is not enough evidence to support such lofty claims, with one scientist accusing the astronomers of ""jumping the gun"".

The debate revolves around the planet K2-18b, which is 124 light years away in the Leo constellation. 

The planet is thought to be the right distance from its star to have liquid water, making it a prime suspect in the search for extraterrestrial life.

Last month, astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope made headlines by announcing they had detected hints of the chemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) on the planet.

These chemicals are only produced by life such as marine algae on Earth, meaning they are considered potential ""biosignatures"" indicating life.

The astronomers, led by Cambridge University's Nikku Madhusudhan, expressed caution about the ""hints"" of a biosignature, emphasising they were not claiming a definitive discovery.

Their detection had reached a three-sigma level of statistical significance ""which means there is still a three in 1,000 chance of this being a fluke,"" Madhusudhan said at the time.

Two of Madhusudhan's former students, Luis Welbanks of Arizona State University and Matthew Nixon of Maryland University, were among the researchers who have since re-analysed the data behind the announcement.

When deploying other statistical models, ""claims of a potential biosignature detection vanish"", according to their preprint study published online late last month. 

Like the other papers since the April announcement, it has not been peer-reviewed.

In one model, Welbanks and colleagues expanded the number of possible chemicals that could explain the signals detected by Webb to 90 from the original 20.

More than 50 received a ""hit"", Welbanks told AFP. 

""When you detect everything, did you really detect anything?"" he asked.

They are not saying the planet definitely does not have DMS -- just that more observations are needed, Welbanks added.

Madhusudhan welcomed the robust debate, saying that remaining open to all possibilities is an essential part of the scientific method.

""These sort of arguments are healthy,"" he told AFP.

His team even went further, releasing their own preprint study last week that expanded the number of chemicals even further to 650.

The three most ""promising"" chemicals they found included DMS but not DMDS -- a major part of the team's announcement in April.

The other two chemicals were diethyl sulfide and methyl acrylonitrile, the latter of which is toxic.

Madhusudhan admitted that these little-known chemicals are likely not ""realistic molecules"" for a planet like K2-18b.

Welbanks pointed out that ""in the span of a month -- with no new data, with no new models, with no new laboratory data -- their entire analysis changed"".

Telescopes observe such far-off exoplanets when they cross in front of their star, allowing astronomers to analyse how molecules block different wavelengths of light streaming through their atmosphere.

Earlier this week, a paper led by Rafael Luque at the University of Chicago combined Webb's observations of K2-18b in both the near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths of light.

It also found ""no statistical significance for DMS or DMDS"", the paper said.

An earlier paper by Oxford astrophysicist Jake Taylor using a basic statistical test also found no strong evidence for any biosignatures. 

Madhusudhan dismissed the latter paper, saying the simple exercise did not account for observing physical phenomena.

He also stood by his research, saying he was ""just as confident"" in the work as he was a month ago.

More data about K2-18b will come in over the next year which should offer a much clearer picture, Madhusudhan added.

Even if the planet does have DMS, it is not a guarantee of life -- the chemical has been detected on a lifeless asteroid. 

However, many researchers do believe that space telescopes could one day collect enough evidence to identify alien life from afar.

""We are the closest we have ever been"" to such a moment, Welbanks said.

""But we have to use the frameworks that are in place and build up (evidence) in a reliable method, rather than using non-standard practices and jumping the gun -- as has been done in this particular case,"" Nixon added.

Supernatural is a cult classic series created by Eric Kripke (The Boys) that had an unprecedented run on The CW. In fact, the show was on the air for so long that when it premiered in 2005, the network was still called The WB. Starring Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as demon-hunting brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, Supernatural aired for 15 seasons. That is a total of 327 episodes.

15 seasons means 15 season finales, some of which are undoubtedly better than others. Even so, Supernatural is one of those rare shows that aired for so long that quality did not just slowly decrease over time. It ebbed and flowed, with the early and late seasons being celebrated in equal measure. Of course, there is something to be said about Eric Kripke's initial five-season arc, but over time this beloved show has become so much more than that. Fans are fiercely loyal and, subsequently, have very strong opinions about each season.

Here are the top 10 Supernatural season finales throughout the entire series.

 Season 6 aired as a two-part finale, with ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" being the second installment. In this episode, the wall in Sam's head keeping out memories of Hell finally breaks, unleashing havoc in his mind. Much of the action takes place in Sam's head, while Dean and Bobby (Jim Beaver) try to stop Castiel (Misha Collins) from opening Purgatory.

If the title of the episode sounds familiar, that's because it is a wink to the 1956 Alfred Hitchcock film of the same name. Overall, season 6 has a 100% rating from critics and 77% rating from audiences on Rotten Tomatoes. It's also worth noting that this was Sera Gamble's first season as showrunner, with Kripke having departed after the completion of the five-season story arc he'd developed. It wasn't an easy role to take on and the fact that the Season 6 finale is still held in such high regard speaks to how the season was handled.

Having taken on the Mark of Cain in Season 9 to help defeat Abaddon (Alaina Huffman), Dean continues to struggle with the Mark's dark influence. At the same time, Sam and Castiel are working with Rowena (Ruth Connell) to find a spell that can destroy the Mark for good. It's an emotionally fraught episode and Supernatural is always at its best when exploring the strong bond between Sam and Dean.

This finale successfully brought the Mark of Cain storyline to a close and left audiences with a strong cliffhanger. It also brought back Julian Richings as Death, which is always a delight. ""[The Mark's] removal had unexpected consequences with the death of Death and the unleashing of the Darkness..."" writes Amy Ratcliffe for IGN. ""It sets up a big bad for Season 11 and the Winchesters need to unite against a common enemy."" The episode has a 100% rating from critics but only a 64% rating from viewers on Rotten Tomatoes.

""I don't know what we're doing.""

Jeremy Carver, who wrote the Season 10 finale, also wrote the Season 9 finale. Dean is now deeply affected by the Mark of Cain and so Sam and Castiel have no choice but to lock him up for everyone's safety. Meanwhile, Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) starts playing God up in Heaven. Sam, Castiel, and the angel Gadreel (Tahmoh Penikett) search for a way to break the connection between Metatron and the Angel Tablet. Meanwhile, Dean has his own plan for killing Metatron and to do so, he enlists Crowley's (Mark Sheppard) help. The episode ends with Dean dying only for him to come back as a demon.

Fans saw that Dean twist coming, but that doesn't devalue it. ""As unsurprising as this turn of events is, it sets up a storyline with so much potential,"" notes Anastasia Klimchynskaya for Den of Geek. The season as a whole holds a 100% rating from critics and a 75% rating from audiences on Rotten Tomatoes.

Early inklings of Supernatural's long-running success can be found in its first season finale, which was written by Kripke and directed by Kim Manners. In ""Devil's Trap"", Sam and Dead rescue their father, John (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), from demons, only to discover that John is possessed by Azazel (Frederic Lehne), the ""Yellow-Eyed Demon"" who they've been hunting all season. Sam and Dean manage to get Azazel out of their father's body, but wound John in the process. While they are rushing their father to the hospital, a demon rams their car with a truck.

This is Supernatural's first cliffhanger finale, and it delivers with action, compelling family drama, and shocking twists. Critics only gave Season 1 a rating of 87% on Rotten Tomatoes, but viewers gave it a 93% rating. It also sets up the Season 2 premiere, ""In My Time of Dying"", which is arguably one of the best episodes from the show's early years.

Supernatural had an astoundingly long run of 327 episodes, but there are still some pieces of lore that never appeared. 

In this episode, Sam and Dean trap Crowley because ""curing"" him of being a demon is one of the trials required to close the Gates of Hell for good. The ritual costs Sam dearly, though. In the midst of it all, Metatron steals Castiel's grace as part of a plan to close off Heaven, making Castiel mortal. The entire thing comes to a head when all the angels fall to Earth from Heaven.

As a whole, Season 8 isn't the show's strongest. It only has a 65% rating from critics and 55% rating from viewers on Rotten Tomatoes. Nonetheless, the finale is considered one of the best and paves the way for several higher-rated seasons. ""Supernatural's eighth season went out on a high note,"" writes Diana Steenbergen for IGN, ""With some game changing twists and great performances."" Shephard in particular gives an incredible performance as Crowley begins to feel the effects of Sam's blood treatment to make him human.

Written by Kripke and directed by Kim Manners, ""No Rest for the Wicked"" takes place on the last day of Dean's demon deal. With Lilith in possession of the contract, Sam and Dean track her to Indiana, where Lilith is torturing a family in the guise of a young girl for her own amusement. Lilith sends a hellhound to kill Dean and drag his soul to hell. As it turns out, Dean's torture in hell is all part of Lilith's plan to break the 66 seals that have trapped Lucifer in Hell.

It's a gutting episode, with this deal for Dean's soul having hung over everything all season. ""Dean being torn apart by hellhounds is one of the scariest things the show has done yet..."" writes Diana Steenbergen for IGN. ""It was a disturbing sight, and the special effects worked well."" Steenbergen goes on to note that the show's willingness to actually send Dean to hell is incredibly effective. ""It is what the entire season has been building toward, and it is a good thing that they didn't give us a quick or cheap fix."" Overall, Season 3 is a solid one. Critics give it an 88% rating and fans give it a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Now that Jack (Alexander Calvert) is soulless, Dean sees the young Nephilim as a ticking time bomb — another monster they must kill, despite the fact that Jack has been like a little brother to them. Overwhelmed by the full force of his powers, Jack isn't faring too well. Chaos ensues and Chuck aka God (Rob Benedict) shows up to help. Sort of. He gives Dean a gun that will kill Jack, but when Dean finally has the opportunity to pull the trigger, Jack agrees to go willingly, and Dean can't bring himself to do it. This upsets Chuck, who calls the Winchesters his ""favorite show."" From here, Sam and Dean's relationship with Chuck unravels real fast.

Supernatural was nearing the end here, but that didn't mean the quality of the show suffered. In fact, it's surprising a finale so late in the game could still be so bold and be pullled it off so well. The last few moments are absolutely epic and change everything moving into the show's final season. ""If this finale doesn't get you excited for the final season,"" Samantha Highfill declares in Entertainment Weekly, ""Nothing will."" As a whole, Season 14 has an 83% rating from critics but only a 65% rating from audiences on Rotten Tomatoes.

Kripke wrote and directed ""Lucifer Rising"" himself. With the apocalypse on the horizon, Sam teams up with the demon Ruby (Genevieve Padalecki) to fight Lilith (Katherine Boecher). Unfortunately, Ruby has been lying to Sam about her motives. Castiel tells Dean that killing Lilith will open the final seal keeping Lucifer in Hell. When Dean tries to warn his brother, it is too late. The seal has already been broken. Dean and Sam kill Ruby, but Sam is devastated, knowing that he has unwittingly contributed to the world's demise. Lucifer is free.

When Kripke initially developed the series, he came up with a five-season arc and this finale sets up Season 5 perfectly. The guilt that weighs on Sam, as well as his reunion with Dean, make for some excellent television. And with Lucifer rising, the stakes have never been higher. The season has an 88% rating from critics and 68% rating from viewers on Rotten Tomatoes.

This is the second half of a two-part finale that delivers on every front. Azazel's psychic children, now adults, were all brought together to fight to the death in Part One. This includes Sam, who dies in Dean's arms at the end of the episode. In Part Two, Dean sells his soul to a Crossroads Demon (Ona Grauer) to bring Sam back to life. The brothers then join Bobby and Ellen (Samantha Ferris) to stop Azazel. The Devil's Gate, a doorway to Hell, opens, but they manage to close it. The victory isn't all it should be though, because the shadow of Dean's deal hangs over them. He has one year before his soul gets sent to Hell.

This episode brings the ""psychic children"" arc to a close and opens the series for new challenges, higher stakes, and the introduction of a certain angel in a trenchcoat that fans know and love. The two-parter ""stood tall as a two-hour apocalyptic blockbuster that essentially ended the series, only to rebirth it anew,"" writes Michael John Petty for Collider. Season 2 holds a 100% rating from critics and a 96% rating from audiences on Rotten Tomatoes.

Using Sam's body as a vessel has been Lucifer's (Mark Pellegrino) plan from the beginning, and in ""Swan Song"" he gets his wish. Sam and Dean allow this to happen because they plan for Sam to regain control of his own body long enough to throw himself — and Lucifer — into a cage in Hell, thus avoiding the apocalypse. The episode ends in epic fashion, with Sam pulling both Lucifer and Michael (Jake Abel) into hell. Dean thinks that Sam is dead, but the audience catches a glimpse of Sam watching Dean from afar in the final moments. Has he managed to escape hell? And how? Is it Sam in this body or Lucifer? The episode really leaves audiences guessing.

One would be hard-pressed to find a fan who doesn't consider ""Swan Song"" to be Supernatural's all-time best finale. Everything built up to this episode, and it certainly delivers. Season 5 holds a 100% rating from critics and a 76% from audiences on Rotten Tomatoes, but this finale remains unmatched.

Right-wing podcaster Joe Rogan thinks “Pfizer alone” may have killed off more people than World War I, World War II, and Vietnam. 

Rogan said “a conservative range of 470,000 to 600,000” Americans may have died as a result of Pfizer's COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. 

“That's a lot of people, man, more than World War I, World War II, and Vietnam combined,” he said during a sit-down on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast with NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers on Thursday, then hedged, “If that's true.”

Rogan was presumably referring to American military deaths during those wars, which come in at around 600,000 people, as opposed to all deaths across the three conflicts.

“But they saved millions,” Rodgers shot back.

“Yeah, I keep hearing that,” Rogan replied on Thursday's edition of the show.

Rogan has repeatedly come under fire for pushing vaccine scepticism and other conspiracy theories via his podcast, which has racked up almost six billion views on YouTube since it was first launched in 2009. 

In September 2021, the commentator drew controversy for publicly discussing his use of ivermectin, a deworming drug designed for livestock, as part of his treatment regimen after he tested positive for COVID-19. 

The remarks prompted an open letter in January 2022 from more than 270 medical professionals and research scientists who accused Rogan of “broadcasting misinformation” about the pandemic, in turn followed by a boycott by music artists, including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, of Spotify for hosting Rogan's podcast.

The World Health Organization states in its most recent guidance on vaccine safety that “billions of people have been safely vaccinated against COVID-19” and that “all of the approved COVID-19 vaccines have been carefully tested and continue to be monitored.”

No doubt some will never be, but with luck I might go to the great beyond gaining a few more answers.

I asked my barber just a couple of weeks ago why at my age the hair on the sides of my head grow faster than those that I'm losing on the top of my head. He has a barber's license and I'm sure he reads lots of texts that explain why this is. 

I also asked him why the hairs in my nose seem to get longer without my knowing it.

He told me that to the best of his knowledge, the hair on my head was determined by blood circulation. Evidently there is more blood flow around my ears than there is on the top of my head. 

And the hairs in my nose? He told me I was just not paying attention to them. He also asked me if my mother's brothers lost their hair. I said yes, and he said, ""Case closed!""

So much for that question.

Other questions I've never gotten the answer to include why an outboard boat motor that was running like a charm last October chose not to start this spring.

I did all the proper storage things last October as I put the boat to bed for the winter, so why should it not start this spring? It just doesn't make sense. 

But, after a $300 trip to the marine shop, I found out that the fuel pump decided to give up the ghost sometime in January while just sitting in our garage.

I never figured out why my mother never bought shoes that fit her. 

ADVERTISEMENT

Well, after her passing a number of years ago, I think I've figured it out. You see, as a shoe salesman I prided myself on getting the right size shoe for my customer. And for the most part they left our store satisfied. 

But my mother was another case. I measured her carefully and came up with her size, 10 wide. I brought out that size and fitted her. She walked around the shoe floor and said, ""These feel just fine! What size are they?"" 

Although I tried to hide the size on the box, she had me. ""They're a 10 wide,"" I said, knowing what the response would be. 

""I don't take that size. I take a 9 medium,"" she said. ""Get me a pair in that size."" 

I knew better, but the tone of her voice told me that any bit of resistance from me would be for naught. I brought out a pair of 9 mediums and she limped out of the store, happy as a clam. 

I've learned that vanity outweighs reason at certain times. A mystery was solved.

There are other mysteries I've encountered, such as why does one forget the mosquito dope on a camping trip?

ADVERTISEMENT

Why does campfire smoke circle the fire ring and give everyone a smoke bath? 

Why do weeds grow where a planted corn seed won't? 

Why do wood ticks exist? 

What does a doctor mean when he or she says, ""See you in a few weeks?"" 

Why was I required to take a course in library science in college (most boring class ever!) when I was majoring in wildlife management? 

Why are there no wild cranberries where there were tons last year? 

Why do I not hear my wife when she is speaking to me from the kitchen while she is using the meat grinder?

ADVERTISEMENT

Ah, the mysteries that probably will never be solved during my lifetime.

Two other mysteries: How have I continued to write this Last Windrow column every week since 1983? I'll never figure that one out. 

And, why do fish bite always on the far side of the lake? Go figure.

See you next time. Okay?

In 2010, in a small New Hampshire town, next door to a copy center and framing shop, a ghost lab opened. The Kitt Research Initiative's mission was to use the scientific method to document the existence of spirits. Founder Andy Kitt was known as a straight-shooter; and was unafraid — perhaps eager — to offend other paranormal investigators by exposing the fraudulence of their less advanced techniques. But when KRI started to lose money, Kitt began to seek funding from the paranormal community, attracting flocks of psychics, alien abductees, witches, mediums, ghost hunters, UFOlogists, cryptozoologists and warlocks from all over New England, and the world. And there were plenty of them around.

Matthew Hongoltz-Hetling, author of the new book The Ghost Lab, explains the wild ecosystem of paranormal profiteers and consumers through the astonishing story of what happened in this one small town. He also maps the trends of declining scientific literacy, trust in institutions, and the diffusion of a culture that has created space for armies of pseudoscientists to step into the minds of an increasingly credulous public.

Matthew Hongoltz-Hetling is a freelance journalist specializing in narrative features and investigative reporting. He was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. He is the author of A Libertarian Walks into a Bear and It Sounds Like a Quack. His new book is The Ghost Lab: How Bigfoot Hunters, Mediums, and Alien Enthusiasts are Wrecking Science.

Reseller marketplaces are often the only way for non-TSMC folk to grab this swag, and the mark-ups can be high.

TSMC's new custom-designed employee-exclusive 20-inch suitcase is pretty awesome to behold. However, semiconductor analyst Ray Wang has observed that lucky owners are reselling them for up to US$16,700 (NT$500,000) on online marketplaces in Taiwan.

TSMC custom-branded products are highly coveted inside and outside of its employee base. We have seen many new TSMC custom employee-exclusive products become collectors' items, like TSMC Starbucks mugs and even co-branded snack products.

Due to the rarity of TSMC-branded items and their restricted employee-only initial sale, even new releases can command significant premiums on resale marketplaces. A case in point is this premium-looking suitcase, a co-brand effort between TSMC and Eminent, which is worth a closer look.

You can't be serious 😭 TSMC's employee‑exclusive 20‑inch suitcase is already hitting resale sites for an eye‑watering NT$500,000—about US$15,500.I want one tho...... pic.twitter.com/8ylgDNobSZMay 23, 2025

We dug up listings like Mr Wang's clipped from Taiwan's Shopee platform and note that these subtly computer-chip-styled silver suitcases are made using Makrolon polycarbonate. The material's German maker, Covestro AG, describes it as “extremely robust, lightweight with glass-like transparency and is impact resistant—even at low temperatures.""

In other details, we can see that the case measures 56 x 36 x 23cm and is characterized as a 20-inch suitcase. It weighs about 2.9kg (6.4 pounds) empty. This snazzy case is made in Taiwan (by Eminent) and comes with a decent 5-year warranty.

During our perusal of the new TSMC suitcase listings, it quickly became apparent that this employee-exclusive can be had for much more reasonable money. However, some of the best prices were for pre-orders, which have a chance of not being fulfilled.

Shockingly, the US$16,700 (NT$500,000) case seller didn't even have a case in their possession. They promised that the case was “expected” before June 30.

Our hunt continued through the Shopee listings, and we found one reseller with actual stock (1 case) at US$334 (NT$10,000). The majority of other sellers were listing goods they didn't yet have in their possession.

Elsewhere in the listings, we were reminded how handsome the range of TSMC Starbucks co-branded coffee mugs was. There were also listings with TSMC sportswear accessories, TSMC-branded mobile phones (dumb phones, ironically), packs of Guai Guai, and more. Please don't go and buy this stuff; save some for me…

					By Nancy Tartaglione 

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


UPDATE: In a triumphant in-person return to the Cannes Film Festival, 22 years after he last attended (though some of his movies have screened in the intervening time), Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi was awarded the Palme d'Or this evening for It Was Just an Accident. 


	An emotional Panahi, who has spent most of his filmmaking career in the crosshairs of Iran's authoritarian Islamic Republic government — including more than a decade of multiple detentions, prison sentences, house arrests and filmmaking and travel bans — implored from the Lumière stage: “Let's put all the problems, all the differences aside; the most important thing right now is our country and our country's freedom.”

					NEON Shines Brightly With Six For Six Palme d'Or Winners After Jafar Panahi's 'It Was Just An Accident'		
			








	To cheers, he continued, “Let's reach that moment together when no one dares to tell us what we should completely include, what we should say, what we shouldn't do… Cinema is a society. No one has the right to tell us what you should do, what you shouldn't do.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	On a six-year Palme streak, Neon acquired It Was Just an Accident earlier this week, and also has Grand Prize winner Sentimental Value from Joachim Trier who dedicated his win to his grandfather.


	Brazil also had a great night with prizes for Wagner Moura as Best Actor in Kleber Mendonça Filho' The Secret Agent, which also scooped Best Director.


PREVIOUS, 9:36am PT: It's the final day here at the Cannes Film Festival with prizes including the Palme d'Or due to be handed out across the next hour (scroll down for the list of laureates as we update live)


	Among those to arrive on the red carpet this evening were Sentimental Value star Elle Fanning, Resurrection director Bi Gan and cast, Sirat director Oliver Laxe and Two Prosecutors director Sergei Loznitsa.


	This final day got off to quite the bizarre start when, at about 10am local time, a mass power outage affected the region, cutting off electricity and greatly blocking cell service. The festival, however, was well prepared for such an odd scenario, pivoting to an independent power supply to keep the Palais juiced so that all scheduled events and screenings, including this Closing Ceremony, could proceed as planned. In the end, the lights came back on across town at about 3:30pm here — and the city heaved an audible sigh of relief. 

	











	Otherwise, the past 10 days have gone down a treat, with the lineup of films being called the strongest in many years. The Competition films were well-reviewed except for an outlier or two, while outside of the Competition, there were such glossy events as the premiere of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning with Tom Cruise bringing the mega-star wattage. 


	As ever, Deadline timed the ovations inside the Palais, including one that saw the audience erupt with 19 minutes of praise. 


	Although the length of applause is not always indicative of awards, that movie, Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value, is the one that Deadline's critics are tipping as the likely Palme d'Or winner.


	Other movies singled out by our critics include Jafar Panahi's It Was Just an Accident, Richard Linklater's Nouvelle Vague, Bi Gan's Resurrection, Mascha Schilinski's The Sound of Falling and Sergei Loznitza's Two Prosecutors. For all of their picks, see here.


	The jury is presided over by Juliette Binoche this year, and while no one really ever knows which way the panel will swing, we'll know more in just a little while. Check back for updates.

And the wins keep on coming for Neon. But also for Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi, currently in exile from his home country of Iran for how he's voiced opposition through his cinema. This includes his latest film and now Palme d'Or winner, “It Was Just an Accident,” a moral thriller that finds five dissidents debating whether or not to murder their former torturer.

In IndieWire's review out of Cannes, David Ehrlich said of the film, “From the plot description alone, it's obvious that ‘It Was Just an Accident' finds Panahi working in a very different register than he had to while “banned” from making films — a period that saw his long-standing penchant for metafiction become considerably more pronounced, as he was forced to make himself the subject of iPhone/camcorder masterpieces like ‘This Is Not a Film.' This one still had to be shot in secret in order to skirt government approval, but it takes great pleasure in replacing the self-reflexivity of Panahi's illegal work with a slightly more formal sense of composition, even if it remains impossible to separate the final product from the personal experience that informed it.”

This year's Palme was presented by Cate Blanchett and European Film Academy president Juliette Binoche, who also led the Main Competition jury. She was joined by Halle Berry, Dieudo Hamadi, Hong Sang-soo, Payal Kapadia, Carlos Reygadas, Alba Rohrwacher, Leïla Slimani, and Jeremy Strong.

Cannes 2025 was defined by a healthy competition between indie distributors Neon and Mubi, with the former winning out. The company has acquired the Palme d'Or winner six years running now and also took home Best Actor, Best Director, the Jury Prize, and the Grand Prix. Coming into the fest, they had already put their weight behind Julia Ducarneau's body horror “Alpha” and Joachim Trier's family drama “Sentimental Value,” but during the last week and change also picked up the well-received competition entries “Sirât,” “It Was Just an Accident,” and “The Secret Agent.” Meanwhile, “The Substance” distributor Mubi came in with queer romance “The History of Sound” and heist film “The Mastermind,” then subsequently bought two buzzy titles: Lynne Ramsay's “Die My Love” and Mascha Schilinski's generational drama “Sound of Falling.”

 










On Friday, Un Certain Regard awarded it prizes from a jury led by Molly Manning Walker and including Nahuel Pérez Biscayart, Louise Courvoisier, Vanja Kaluđerčić, and Roberto Minervini. The Jury Prize was presented to Simón Mesa Soto for his satire, “A Poet,” while Harry Lighton took home Best Screenplay for his BDSM romance “Pillion.” Both films were IndieWire Critic's Picks. Chilean filmmaker Diego Céspedes took home the top prize for his directorial debut “The Mysterious Gaze of the Flamingos.” The 1980s-set drama was an international co-production between Chile, France, Belgium, Spain, and Germany.
