Lando Norris denied home hero Charles Leclerc pole position for the Monaco Grand Prix, as the McLaren driver finished fastest by one-tenth of a second.

Leclerc, who topped all three practice sessions on the streets of Monte Carlo, went fastest at the chequered flag before Norris posted a 1m 09.954s with his final run to finish 0.109s faster and claim his first pole since the Australia season-opener.

Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri was 0.175s behind his team mate in third, as the second Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton lines up ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen in fourth.

Both red flags during the one-hour session were caused by the Mercedes drivers, Kimi Antonelli producing the first at the end of Q1 after hitting the barrier at the Nouvelle Chicane.

George Russell then caused the second at the very start of Q2 when his car lost drive and became stranded in the tunnel, leaving the duo in P14 and P15.

Kimi Antonelli brought out the red flags during Qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix, the Mercedes driver hitting the wall at the end of Q1.

The Italian rookie was on his final flying lap in the first part of Qualifying in Monte Carlo and at risk of finding himself in the drop zone as drivers lowered their times.

Antonelli clipped the inside wall on the entry to the Nouvelle Chicane which popped the tyre off its rim and meant the 18-year-old was unable to navigate the following right as he ended up in the barrier.

Confirming that he was okay over the radio, Antonelli added "I'm sorry", having ended his day of running respite making it through to Q2 in P15.

There was further pain to come for Mercedes later in the session, with George Russell forced to stop in Q2 due to technical issues, as McLaren's Lando Norris went on to take pole at the end of a thrilling session.

Carlos Sainz could not quite join team mate Albon in that top 10 after lamenting a lack of grip on the soft tyres during his final Q2 run, leaving him 11th on the grid over another frustrated driver in Yuki Tsunoda, who continues to get to grips with Red Bull's package. Kick Sauber made it through to Q2 courtesy of another solid effort from Nico Hulkenberg, who took advantage of a dramatic session for Mercedes drivers George Russell and Kimi Antonelli to line up in 13th position. Bearman will fall to the back of the grid with his 10-place grid penalty for a red flag breach during Friday practice, while Stroll has a one-place drop thanks to his sanction for an FP1 clash involving Leclerc. Leclerc set the pace as Qualifying got under way around his home streets Those laps would be impacted by a crash for rookie Antonelli at the Nouvelle Chicane, though, with the yellow flags initially coming out and scuppering a handful of laps, before turning into a red flag and ending the opening phase of Qualifying early. Leclerc thus finished quickest from the McLarens, Verstappen, Russell and team mate Hamilton, with Albon, Alonso, Sainz and Tsunoda also reaching the top 10 on an incredibly close timesheet that saw P1 to P15 covered by just over six-tenths of a second. Antonelli was left to rue a crash in the first phase of Qualifying Soft-shod Norris was the early pace-setter on a 1m 10.959s, putting him marginally in front of Verstappen, Leclerc and Albon, but Russell's hopes of joining them were dashed when he lost power, ground to a halt in the tunnel and triggered another red flag. Another mad dash to the flag saw Norris come out on top via a 1m 10.570s, from Leclerc, Albon (who switched to softs late on), Piastri, Verstappen and Hamilton, while both Racing Bulls, Alonso (who stuck with those mediums) and an ecstatic Ocon also progressed. Like Albon, Sainz took on softs for his final run but could not improve, lamenting that he had “no grip” with the red-marked tyre en route to P11, followed by another disappointed Q2 eliminee in Tsunoda, Hulkenberg and the sidelined Mercedes drivers. Norris and McLaren began to show their hand as Qualifying developed Norris picked up where he left off in Q2 by pumping in a 1m 10.464s on his first lap, just over half a tenth clear of Piastri, while Leclerc went third from Verstappen and Hamilton and left his passionate home fans wanting more across the final runs. Piastri's marginal improvement was not enough for an all-McLaren front row, leaving him third over Hamilton and Verstappen, who could not make an impression on his last lap. “It's been a long time coming, so I feel good,” said Norris. “I don't think you realise how good this feels after quite a few struggles over the last couple of months.

PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Is Ferrari's pace in Monaco real – or are McLaren and Red Bull still the teams to beat? Leclerc and Norris soon engaged in their own personal duel, as first the McLaren driver reasserted himself back at the top with a 1m 12.347s, Leclerc then set a new benchmark of 1m 12.199s, before Norris immediately replied and improved by less than one tenth. Qualifying simulation runs took place over the final 15 minutes, with most drivers performing push, cooldown and push laps, with Verstappen reporting "I have no grip" on the soft tyre after failing to improve on his remaining laps. Alex Albon was the lead Williams in sixth, followed by Lawson and Carlos Sainz, as Tsunoda and Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli completed the top 10 ahead of team mate George Russell, who struggled for pace in 11th. Ollie Bearman, who will serve a 10-place grid penalty for a red flag infringement in FP2, was P16 with Haas team Esteban Ocon 18th as Isack Hadjar split the pair. Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto and Alpine's Colapinto completed the order.
