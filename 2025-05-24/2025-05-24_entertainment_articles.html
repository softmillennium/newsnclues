                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Dissident Iranian director Jafar Panahi has won the Palme d'Or for best film for It Was Just an Accident at the 78th Cannes international film festival. Panahi, who just a few years ago was imprisoned in Tehran and under a 20-year travel and work ban, returned triumphantly to Cannes, accepting his award from jury president (and vocal Panahi fan) Juliette Binoche. Panahi's film, his first since being released from prison in 2023, is a direct assault on Iran's authoritarian regime. The thriller follows a former political prisoner who kidnaps a man he believes to be his torturer and then debates with other dissidents whether to kill or forgive him. Gay Kink, Godard (Via Linklater) and German Girlhood: THR's Critics Pick the 20 Best Films of Cannes 2025 Tom Quinn's indie outfit kept its Cannes streak going by picking up It Was Just an Accident earlier this week. With his Cannes win, Jafar Panahi has now completed the rare festival triple crown, winning the top prize at all three major European film festivals, following his Golden Lion win in Venice for The Circle (2000) and Berlin's Golden Bear for Taxi (2015). Binoche began the ceremony by bestowing a special prize on Chinese director Bi Gan for Resurrection. John C. Reilly, in Cannes for the Un Certain Regard film Heads or Tails?, added a musical touch to the ceremony, breaking out into an English-language rendition of “La Vie en Rose” when presenting best screenplay prize to two-time Palme d'Or winners Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne for the Belgian social drama Young Mothers. Brazilian actor Wagner Moura took best actor for his starring role in The Secret Agent, Kleber Mendonça Filho's 1970s-set Brazilian political thriller. In a rare double award, Filho also took best director for the feature. Newcomer Nadia Melliti beat out Jennifer Lawrence's turn in Lynne Ramsay's Die, My Love to take the best actress honor, playing the lead role in Hafsia Herzi's Muslim lesbian coming-of-age story The Little Sister. German director Mascha Schilinski won the Jury Prize for Sound of Falling, only her second film, an epic family drama set across four generations in the same rural farmhouse. She shared the honor with Spanish director Oliver Laxe for Sirat, a techno-infused apocalyptic drama set in the Moroccan desert.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UPDATE: In a triumphant in-person return to the Cannes Film Festival, 22 years after he last attended (though some of his movies have screened in the intervening time), Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi was awarded the Palme d'Or this evening for It Was Just an Accident. An emotional Panahi, who has spent most of his filmmaking career in the crosshairs of Iran's authoritarian Islamic Republic government — including more than a decade of multiple detentions, prison sentences, house arrests and filmmaking and travel bans — implored from the Lumière stage: “Let's put all the problems, all the differences aside; the most important thing right now is our country and our country's freedom.” 'Homebound' Cast & Director Neeraj Ghaywan Talk Martin Scorsese's Notes, Gujarati Folk Singing & Artistic Vocations -- Cannes Studio To cheers, he continued, “Let's reach that moment together when no one dares to tell us what we should completely include, what we should say, what we shouldn't do… Cinema is a society. On a six-year Palme streak, Neon acquired It Was Just an Accident earlier this week, and also has Grand Prize winner Sentimental Value from Joachim Trier who dedicated his win to his grandfather. Brazil also had a great night with prizes for Wagner Moura as Best Actor in Kleber Mendonça Filho' The Secret Agent, which also scooped Best Director. Among those to arrive on the red carpet this evening were Sentimental Value star Elle Fanning, Resurrection director Bi Gan and cast, Sirat director Oliver Laxe and Two Prosecutors director Sergei Loznitsa. This final day got off to quite the bizarre start when, at about 10am local time, a mass power outage affected the region, cutting off electricity and greatly blocking cell service. The festival, however, was well prepared for such an odd scenario, pivoting to an independent power supply to keep the Palais juiced so that all scheduled events and screenings, including this Closing Ceremony, could proceed as planned. Other movies singled out by our critics include Jafar Panahi's It Was Just an Accident, Richard Linklater's Nouvelle Vague, Bi Gan's Resurrection, Mascha Schilinski's The Sound of Falling and Sergei Loznitza's Two Prosecutors. The jury is presided over by Juliette Binoche this year, and while no one really ever knows which way the panel will swing, we'll know more in just a little while.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deadline's Andreas Wiseman first reported two days ago that Neon scooped up North American rights to the movie. This comes after last year's Cannes top prize winner Anora, Justine Triet's 2023 title Anatomy of a Fall, 2022's Triangle of Sadness, 2021's Titane and 2019's Parasite. Cannes Film Festival Winners Announced: Palme D'Or Goes To Jafar Panahi's 'It Was Just An Accident' Grand Prize To 'Sentimental Value'; 'The Secret Agent's Wagner Moura Best Actor, Kleber Mendonça Filho Best Director - Updating Live Neon Taking North American Rights To Natalie Portman Cannes Animation 'Arco' It Was Just an Accident blurb reads “What begins as a minor accident sets in motion a series of escalating consequences.” The pic was one of the best-reviewed movies at the festival, deals in a fictional way with past wrongfully incarcerated working-class people seeking revenge against the guard who tortured and berated them. Interesting, Neon had all bases covered in regards to who might spring up as a Palme d'Or winner with their other acquisitions coming up with alotta gold tonight. Last year, Deadline exclusively reported that Neon took domestic on Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value which was buzzed to take the top prize as well, but settled with the Grand Prix. Neon's Sirat from Oliver Laxe won the Jury Prize in a tie with Sound of Falling. In addition, Neon took Brazil's buzzy 1977 political thriller The Secret Agent earlier this week, that Kleber Mendonca Filho directed movie walking away with Best Director tonight as well as Best Actor for Wagner Moura. No theatrical release dates have been set yet for these titles by Neon. October has been a prized timeframe for the distributor to launch Cannes titles, read, that's when Anora, Parasite and Triangle of Sadness opened.

On any given day, Nancy Bliven will spend hours watching 747s roar down the runway at LAX. Which itself might not be particularly remarkable — except for the fact that she lives more than 2,000 miles away. Think of it as the Bob Rossification of air travel: planes taking off and landing in high def, narrated in soothing tones by amateur broadcasters who've turned this niche pastime into a big-time business. Disney Sues YouTube Over Poaching Exec Ahead of Licensing Renewal Deals Airline Videos, a YouTube juggernaut with more than 800,000 subscribers. Three times a week, creator Kevin Ray livestreams jumbo jets arriving and departing at LAX, among other airfields, splicing in air traffic control audio, eye-catching onscreen graphics and his own colorful play-by-play that gives the whole thing the feel of a cable sports broadcast — if ESPN covered nothing but wide-body Boeings. Other livestreaming channels have also found audiences: Airliners Live, based out of Manchester Airport in the U.K., has nearly as many live viewers as Ray's feed. “Other channels don't have Kevin,” Bliven notes. For Ray, the fascination with air travel started early. “Just the smell of jet fuel as you came into the airport,” he recalls, “I fell in love with it.” Two years later, he quit his day job. Airline Videos, which he operates from a rooftop at the LAX-adjacent H Hotel, is now his full-time gig. Other income streams include PayPal donations and YouTube's Super Chat, which lets viewers pin their comments on the broadcast for a fee. Bliven, who is on the $24 a month subscription plan, falls somewhere in between, though she did travel from Michigan to New York to join other Rayettes for a special livestream event at the JFK airport. In February, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan revealed that, for the first time, more people are viewing YouTube programs like Ray's on TV sets than on mobile or desktop devices. In other words, as more consumers abandon traditional media for creator-led content, broadcasters like Ray are poised to become even bigger stars than they already are.

Hailing from Philadelphia and born in 1971, Jenkins began his career as a journalist before becoming an acclaimed documentarian. Jenkins was the kind of journalist for whom making the transition to documentary filmmaking was a natural one, and a hip-hop sensibility infused his film work — either directly as in his 2015 directorial debut “Fresh Dressed” about hip-hop fashion or the 2019 miniseries “Wu-Tang: Of Mics and Men,” for which he was Emmy nominated, or more in terms of attitude, such as having Nas narrate Satchmo's letters in Apple TV+'s “Louis Armstrong's Black & Blues.” Related Stories Here's How to Find Work When Entertainment Jobs Are Scarce ‘It Was Just an Accident' Wins the Palme d'Or at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival (Complete Winners List) “Louis Armstrong's Black & Blues” world premiered at TIFF 2022 and was campaigned heavily by Apple during that awards season. It won the IDA Award for Best Music Documentary, and IndieWire featured it at our November 2022 Consider This FYC Brunch, where this writer interviewed Jenkins and producer Julie Anderson onstage. The film broke out of a lot of music documentary conventions, utilizing a unique collage-like graphic style to bring Armstrong's words to life, rather than relying on talking head interviewees. Finding a new way to tell stories that could be very straightforward was his specialty — and part of the reason Eminem chose him to co-author his 2008 autobiography “The Way I Am.” Obviously exhausted from just having flown into LA from London, where he had been promoting the “Black & Blues” just beforehand, he showed a deadpan wit in our onstage interview at our brunch nonetheless. “Louis Armstrong went to reform school for a gun charge at 14. And if you go through the streets of New York right now, 14-year-olds are killing each other with guns every day.” But that environment doesn't stop us from being very creative.

This includes his latest film and now Palme d'Or winner, “It Was Just an Accident,” a moral thriller that finds five dissidents debating whether or not to murder their former torturer. In IndieWire's review out of Cannes, David Ehrlich said of the film, “From the plot description alone, it's obvious that ‘It Was Just an Accident' finds Panahi working in a very different register than he had to while “banned” from making films — a period that saw his long-standing penchant for metafiction become considerably more pronounced, as he was forced to make himself the subject of iPhone/camcorder masterpieces like ‘This Is Not a Film.' This one still had to be shot in secret in order to skirt government approval, but it takes great pleasure in replacing the self-reflexivity of Panahi's illegal work with a slightly more formal sense of composition, even if it remains impossible to separate the final product from the personal experience that informed it.” This year's Palme was presented by Cate Blanchett and European Film Academy president Juliette Binoche, who also led the Main Competition jury. She was joined by Halle Berry, Dieudo Hamadi, Hong Sang-soo, Payal Kapadia, Carlos Reygadas, Alba Rohrwacher, Leïla Slimani, and Jeremy Strong. Cannes 2025 was defined by a healthy competition between indie distributors Neon and Mubi, with the former winning out. On Friday, Un Certain Regard awarded it prizes from a jury led by Molly Manning Walker and including Nahuel Pérez Biscayart, Louise Courvoisier, Vanja Kaluđerčić, and Roberto Minervini. The Jury Prize was presented to Simón Mesa Soto for his satire, “A Poet,” while Harry Lighton took home Best Screenplay for his BDSM romance “Pillion.” Both films were IndieWire Critic's Picks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been mostly — but perhaps not entirely — wishful thinking. In Fountain of Youth, Guy Ritchie's fast-past, wisecracking Indiana Jones homage, John Krasinski and Natalie Portman play siblings on a global hunt for the source of eternal life. “Charlotte, you and I both know that there is a seed of truth cloaked in every myth, metaphor or fable,” he argues. 'Fountain of Youth' Review: John Krasinski and Natalie Portman Play Squabbling Siblings on a Mission in Guy Ritchie's Ho-Hum Apple TV+ Actioner John Krasinski Didn't Know Brother-in-Law Stanley Tucci Was His 'Fountain of Youth' Co-Star Until Midway Through Filming In Greek myth, the Hesperides were maidens who guarded golden apples that, once eaten, promised everlasting life. Anyone who drank from the Holy Grail would find immortality. It's every studio head's dream: Send your lead actors into magical waters and watch them come out the other side forever young, beautiful and marketable. In 1516 the Italian historian of religion Peter Martyr told Pope Leo X that “There is an island named Boiuca or Agnaneo [in the Bahamas] in which is a continual spring of running water of such marvelous virtue that the water thereof being drunk, perhaps through some deity, makes old men young again.” (Even today, the magician David Copperfield who owns a 700-acre island in the Bahamas, claims the local water does “miraculous things… Bugs or insects that are near death come in contact with the water, they fly away.”) It was in search this rumored fountain of youth that the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León supposedly hightailed from the Bahamas to Florida in 1513 to get famous and be forever young. After being shipwrecked, at aged 13, on the Florida Keys around 1549, and living among Native Americans for 17 years, Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda — from a noble family in Cartagena, Colombia — heard all about Ponce de León. The explorer, Fontaneda later wrote, “giving heed to the tale of the Indians of Cuba and Santo Domingo, went to Florida in search of the River Jordan… the kings and caciques [rulers] of Florida, although savages, took information and sought after, as though they had been a more polite people, that they might see what river that could be which did such good work, even to the turning of aged men and women back to their youth.” Old Spanish towns like St. Augustine today claim to be the real fountain whose waters amazed the adventurer when he planted a Spanish flag on La Florida. But there's a twist to the tale — a sinkhole shaped like an hourglass is off the beaten track in Sarasota County, Florida. Sadly, there's no proof the Spaniard ever reached Sarasota. “Ponce de León, like other conquistadors, had the responsibility to finance his expeditions and establish settlements in new lands, as stipulated by royal agreements,” De Narvaez told The Hollywood Reporter. “In this context, it's understandable that attractive stories were promoted to motivate potential settlers and financiers. “As handy as it would be to have secret family documents mapping the source to everlasting life or hidden vials of magic water,” De Narvaez adds, “the reality is more sober. Juan Ponce de León did lay claim to La Florida for Ferdinand II of Aragon, but he never said a word about a fountain of youth. The secret to immortality certainly never helped him when he was shot and killed by an arrow fired by a Calusa Native American in 1521. The geothermal water, naturally heated to 37 degrees Celsius, is blended with 51 minerals. Bathers who take the waters swear they can miraculously cure everything from stress, kidney problems and slipped discs to arthritis and heart failure. Beneath the surface of Warm Mineral Springs, divers have discovered prehistoric remains dating back 10,000 years. Thousands of years before even Gilgamesh, people had maybe already discovered the secret to a long life. As for the dream of stopping aging, a billion-dollar industry today, the comedian Bob Hope was probably nearest to the truth when he said, “My secret for staying young is good food, plenty of rest, and a makeup man with a spray gun.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justin Bieber made a surprise (and increasingly rare) onstage appearance Friday when he popped up during SZA's set Friday during the Grand National Tour's stop at Inglewood, California's SoFi Stadium. Following a trying couple of months that included since-denied Diddy rumors, a report about his “financial distress,” and concerning social media posts, Bieber was back in his artistic element Friday as he joined SZA for a rendition of “Snooze”; Bieber previously appeared on the acoustic remix of the SOS single. While Bieber hasn't performed a full public concert since September 2022, the singer has sporadically appeared onstage at other artists' shows in recent years, including a cameo at Don Toliver's Los Angeles gig in October 2024 to perform “Private Landing.” Billy Joel Cancels All Concerts After Brain Disorder Diagnosis Trump's FEMA Denies North Carolina's Request for Hurricane Helene Aid Trump Pumped and Dumped His Crypto Backers With Dud Dinner Party To date, “Snooze” is the most recent single that Bieber has featured on, as the singer hasn't released any new music of his own since 2021's Justice. SZA's previous Grand National Tour set at SoFi Stadium featured a guest appearance by Lizzo. She and Kendrick Lamar will play one more show at the Englewood stadium Saturday night.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>D'Angelo will no longer be headlining the 2025 Roots Picnic, he announced in a statement shared on the festival's social media pages on Friday. The Roots Picnic takes place on May 31 and June 1 in Philadelphia. D'Angelo has not played live since 2022, when he dropped by the Netflix Is a Joke festival for a surprise performance. Before that, he played a big show at the Apollo Theater in February 2021. He's not released an album since 2014's Black Messiah. It is with the deepest of regrets that @must cancel my performance at the Roots Picnic in Philadelphia next weekend. But, due to an unforeseen medical delay regarding surgery @had earlier this year, @ve been advised by my team of specialist that the performance this weekend could further complicate matters. And even more disappointed not to see all of You. @m so thankful to my beautiful fans for continuing to rock with me and @Thank u for your continued support. LOVE U All and will see you very soon!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If Mia Threapleton had to pick an avatar for her creative awakening as a kid, she might choose a fox. She could have gone with a lion, the animal she'd pretended to be during summer camps and after-school “acting clubs” with her friends, and which gave her an early peek at the thrill of performing for others. Or maybe a 1930s gangster, courtesy of the childhood viewings of Bugsy Malone; Threapleton vividly remembers seeing a very young Jodie Foster, along with dozens of other kid actors pretending to be Prohibition-era hoods and molls in that 1976 movie, and thinking, How old is she? And there were also her parents, who… well, we'll get to them later. All of those figures factored into Threapleton's decision to mention in passing, during her preteen years, that she maybe kinda sorta wanna give the professional acting thing a try. But what really stands out in her memory is one particular fox. It didn't matter that he was just a stop-motion-animated animal. Plus this mischievous creature had a lot of eccentric friends. And he seemed to move in a world that felt odd, funny, weird and unique in the best possible of ways. “Yes, Fantastic Mr. Fox!” Threapleton says, with a machine-gun giggle. But something about it really got me as a kid. “That was the first time I was aware of who Wes Anderson was,” she recalls, sitting in front of an open hotel room window overlooking the beaches of Cannes. And it was like, ‘Oh, this is great, too. I love everything that he's doing here.' That movie became an important piece of cinema to me. So, you know, when you go from that to, um, this….” She looks around the room, wide-eyed, and the staccato laugh returns. That seeing a pair of Anderson's movies was such a formative experiences for Threapleton — now that she stars in one of them — seems like a detail that might have been ret-conned into an origin story. And she's admittedly still swooning over the fact that she's stepped through the looking glass and somehow, after being so entranced by his work, has now become a cornerstone of a genuine Wes world. Threapleton plays Liesl, the only daughter of wealthy, infamous business tycoon Anatole “Zsa Zsa” Korda (Benicio Del Toro). Having just survived that latest in a long series of attempted assassinations by his rivals, the industrialist has finally decided to get his affairs in order. Korda has declared that, because his nine sons are, frankly, nincompoops and rapscallions, Liesl will be the sole heir to his fortune. The one caveat: She must avenge his death should he perish. Still, when Korda asks her to accompany him as he secures financing for one last massive project, his daughter relents and trots the globe with her dad, along with a Swedish tutor named Bjorn (Michael Cera). ‘Highest 2 Lowest' Isn't Spike Lee's Best or Worst — Just a Chance to Watch Denzel Go HAM Wes Anderson Questions Logic Behind Trump's Movie Tariffs: ‘It Doesn't Ship That Way' That Doc on Shia LaBeouf's Acting School Is Even Crazier Than You've Heard Pedro Pascal Speaks Out at 'Eddington' Premiere: 'Fear Is the Way That They Win' As with most of Anderson's films, there's a who's-who ensemble cast (Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, Jeffrey Wright, Bill Murray, Bryan Cranston, Riz Ahmed, Benedict Cumberbatch, Willem Dafoe), sophisticated in-jokes and references, and the sort of meticulous mise-en-scène that's inspired rabid fandom among the film-nerd set. Threapleton, however, doesn't just hold her own against a lot of A-listers and an insanely detailed production design. She ends up being the film's secret weapon, courtesy of a less-is-more approach that makes her placid expressions and impeccable comic timing feel like she's channeling Buster Keaton. Told that this vast inheritance will change her life forever, Liesl replies with the world's most barely discernible shrug. “It's interesting, because I feel like a lot of people would think the environment on his sets are very restrictive, very controlled — and it's not, actually,” Threapleton says. “Wes loves naturalism, which I know is a weird sentence to say regarding him — but he loves naturalism. He loves simplicity and subtle complexity in a scene. And while Wes knows exactly what he wants, the end result is kind of like this beautiful collage of moments that were sometimes worked out and planned, and sometimes discovered as we were filming.” She mentions one sequence early on in Phoenician, where a series of shoeboxes are spread out on the floor. Suddenly, a head poked out from behind the monitor: Don't move, Wes said. Let's go one more time, but with you standing like that. He's constantly paying attention in case something random or unplanned catches his eye.” Which is a good way of describing how Threapleton suddenly found herself meeting her cinematic idol-slash-future director in London, sharing tea and reading a few very select pages from The Phoenician Scheme‘s script. She had no real sense of what the project was, and how Liesl might fit in to a much bigger, immaculately composed picture. “I just did what felt right, without any context. According to Anderson, he'd already seen over a thousand other auditions by the time Threapleton's tape arrived. Which isn't always the case.” After Threapleton did a callback, she was invited to meet with Anderson in London. She was admittedly anxious over an encounter with the person who'd made two of her favorite movies, until he opened the door of his hotel room and, per her recollection “he was wearing pink socks, hotel slippers, stripy linen trousers and a blue linen shirt with clear, quite small glasses. Threapleton and Anderson proceeded to chat “about everything but the movie: the world, our mutual dislike of social media, films that we admired, things that we enjoyed, books that we liked. And then I think probably about the hour mark, we both sort of went, ‘Perhaps let's do some acting now? '” She and Anderson's friend, the writer-director-actor Fisher Stevens, read some scenes together. “It's the usual, ‘Oh my god, I'm going to act against this person. Oh my god, I'm going to meet this person. Oh my god, I hope I don't look like a mess,'” Threapleton says, twisting in her seat at the memory. When Del Toro walked in on the first day of her test, she shyly introduced herself. I realized, he's just this huge purring cat. Or maybe Benicio is like a big bear. “I think I've mentioned this in an interview before,” she adds, “but at one point early on during filming, Benicio came up to me and asked, ‘You good?' Then when he wrapped, I went up to give him a hug goodbye, and he said, ‘See, I told you, we did it together. The second day, Threapleton says, involved hair, make-up and costumes — what Anderson calls “a sort of mock up of what they might be like as the characters.” At one point, they were trying to put together Liesl's all-white habit together, and they couldn't find a veil. By that point, however, she had already been cast. “But five minutes into that second day, she already had the part. And when you saw her read against Benicio… I mean, he's a very imposing figure, and about a foot and a half taller than Mia, for one thing. !” Still, it's not like Threapleton hadn't shared the screen with super-famous movie stars before, even so early into a promising career. The Titanic star had acted with her daughter in the aforementioned I Am…Ruth episode, playing a mom concerned over social media's effect on her child's mental health. “That whole experience was very intense,” Threapleton says, nodding. “Everything was improvised, but the director [Dominic Savage] would direct us in different rooms, so when we both came in to do the scene, neither of us knew what the other one was going to do. It's so clever, because it made for such an electric — and sometimes, quite frightening at times — energy within the scene. But it was also organic, because we didn't have a plan. We had a plan of, like, where the scene was going, but we didn't know what the other one was going to say to get to that point. “It's funny, because I had no idea who her mother was,” Anderson admits. “It was only after I'd watched Mia's audition video a few times and went to look up what else she'd done that I discovered: Wait, she's Kate Winslet's daughter? Then I went back and watched her video again, and I swear if you listen closely, you can hear someone doing an East London accent offscreen, playing the scene with her. Maybe I'm projecting here — I've never discussed this with either of them — but perhaps she worked with her mother on it. Perhaps she had the advantage of a very good collaborator. Again, I don't know for sure. But what that immediately told me was: She's open to collaborating. What I saw and heard when I rewatched it was someone working with another person to make a scene come to life, in a way that was absent from the thousands of other auditions. Threapleton remembers the moment she told her mom that she was thinking about trying her hand at acting, and that the initial response was: “‘I thought you wanted to be a marine biologist?' She recognized that I was serious, and also that I wanted to sort of do it on my own. And yeah — I kind of tried, fell down a bit, and sort of managed to make it happen. Billy Joel Cancels All Concerts After Brain Disorder Diagnosis Trump's FEMA Denies North Carolina's Request for Hurricane Helene Aid Trump Pumped and Dumped His Crypto Backers With Dud Dinner Party “There was no guarantee, in other words,” Threapleton adds. “So to be able to get work on my own, and then have that work be in a Wes Anderson movie, is…” Once again, her eyes widen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“What is this that stands before me?” Well, it might not be Louisa Livingstone, the witchy-looking woman on the cover of Black Sabbath's 1970 self-titled debut album, but she is at least willing to give you her autograph — for charity. Livingstone will write the raffle winner a letter and sign it. The raffle will end July 19, a few weeks after Black Sabbath and Ozzy Osbourne make an appearance together for a final time in their hometown of Birmingham, England. Five years ago, Rolling Stone discovered the identity of the gothic figure — who may or may not have been holding a cat — on Black Sabbath's cover. Long a mystery to metalheads, and the band members themselves, Livingstone says she was amazed at the outpouring of interest in who she was. “I had heard rumors [that the image had become iconic] through friends that I never really took very seriously before the ‘big reveal' with your article,” she tells Rolling Stone via email. What kind of spell was at work there I wondered?” “I have had a lot of online requests from avid collectors and fans to send autographs by post, receive items to autograph and return by post, etc.,” she says. “I've had to ignore them all because I don't live anywhere near a post office … and didn't have the time or funds to spare, to be repeatedly doing this kind of thing.” So she came up with the idea of raffling one autograph for a good cause. “I hadn't planned to go down the cat rescue route but it all started after moving to a tiny rural village four years ago with an abandoned kitten that needed bottle-feeding screaming two meters from my doorstep,” she says. “I have now got an assortment of street cats depending on me, each with its own sad story. “Some paid help at times would be an absolute godsend.” Livingstone also says she feels “miffed” that she didn't remunerate on the success of her cover image, so she hopes to do some catching up with the raffle. “As they say, you can't change the world, but you really can change someone's entire world, whether it's an animal or a person,” she says. Meanwhile, Livingstone has relaunched her own musical career, recording electronic music under the name Indreba. Billy Joel Cancels All Concerts After Brain Disorder Diagnosis Trump's FEMA Denies North Carolina's Request for Hurricane Helene Aid Trump Pumped and Dumped His Crypto Backers With Dud Dinner Party Livingstone's next goal will be to write and publish an autobiography that will tell of her experiences in the music industry, both on album covers and with artists. “I will never forget his friendly openness and being shown loads of photos of their recent USA tour and hearing the new album tracks,” she says. He never made any inappropriate moves either — an absolute gentleman.” “There are many millions of Black Sabbath fans, and quite a few might like the chance to get my rare autograph this way at very little cost without any inconvenience,” she says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Local media is reporting that a fire at an electricity station outside the town of Tanneron overnight, followed by the downing of pylons close to the towns of Villeneuve-Loubet, Mougins and Cagnes-sur-Mer this morning had caused the electricity cuts which began at around 10 am local time (1 am PT). French radio network Franceinfo said local police and sources at the Ministry of Interior had informed it that foul play was suspected, with signs that the downed pylons had been sawn. Cannes Power Restored; Festival Closing Ceremony To Go Ahead As Planned In Wake Of Five-Hour Power Outage In South Of France The incident is reminiscent of an arson attack on France's national rail network on the eve of the Paris Olympics last July, when electrical and signal installations on high-speed lines running north, east and west out of the capital boxes were deliberately set on fire throwing the public transport system into chaos. It also follows a massive power outage in Spain and Portugal at the end of April, which caused mass blackouts across both countries. In Cannes, the power cut briefly interrupted screenings in the Palais des Festival, before a generator kicked in, while a press conference for Kelly Reichardt's Mastermind continued as normal. In Cannes itself, Deadline journalists saw that lights in shops were off shops and restaurants, which could only take cash payments. Internet connectivity was hit and mobile communications difficult.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His other hits included Three Dog Night's "Out in the Country" & Paul Anka's "Times of Your Life." Roger Nichols, best-known for co-writing such Carpenters hits as “We've Only Just Begun,” “Rainy Days and Mondays” and “I Won't Last a Day Without You” with lyricist Paul Williams, died on May 17. Williams confirmed Nichols' death in an extended, and deeply affectionate, post on Instagram. “Roger Nichols passed away peacefully four days ago, at home with his beautiful family …his wife Terry and the daughters he was so proud of, Claire and Caitlin at his side.” (See full text of Williams Instagram post below.) Nichols signed as an artist to A&M Records in 1968, a year before Karen and Richard Carpenter were signed to the Los Angeles-based label. His debut album Roger Nichols and the Small Circle of Friends was produced by Tommy LiPuma, engineered by Bruce Botnick, and featured session contributions from Van Dyke Parks, Randy Newman and Lenny Waronker. Although the album failed to crack the Billboard 200, A&M co-founder Herb Alpert thought there was something there and recommended that Nichols be hired by A&M's publishing company as a staff songwriter. That was a characteristically astute call on Alpert's part. On the charts dated Oct. 17 and 24, Carpenters' version of “We've Only Just Begun,” a ballad which had originated as “soft-sell” commercial for Crocker-Citizens National Bank, was in the top five (on its way to a No. Three Dog Night's “Out in the Country” was holding at its No. The Carpenters smash, an instant standard, was lushly romantic. The Three Dog Night hit was a fresh-sounding mix of pop, rock and folk. “We've Only Just Begun” went on to receive two Grammy nominations – for song of the year and best contemporary song — at the first live Grammy telecast in March 1971. 2 (it took Carole King's letter-perfect “It's Too Late” to keep it out of the top spot), “Let Me Be the One” (another first-rate ballad that the duo never got around to releasing as a single), and “I Won't Last a Day Without You,” a 1972 album track that was finally released as a single in 1974, when it climbed to No. Barbra Streisand covered “I Won't Last a Day Without You” on her ButterFly album later in 1974. On her following album, Lazy Afternoon, she recorded another Williams-Nichols song, “I Never Had It So Good.” Both of those albums went gold. Art Garfunkel recorded a tender Williams-Nichols song, “Traveling Boy,” for his first solo album, 1973's Angel Clare, which made the top 10 on the Billboard 200. Nichols also had some successes with other collaborators. He teamed with William Lane to write “Times of Your Life,” which Paul Anka recorded in 1975. Like “We've Only Just Begun,” this song was also adapted from a popular TV commercial – for Kodak. Anka's recording reached No 7 on the Hot 100 in February 1976.

Roger Nichols passed away peacefully four days ago, at home with his beautiful family …his wife Terry and the daughters he was so proud of, Claire and Caitlin at his side.
