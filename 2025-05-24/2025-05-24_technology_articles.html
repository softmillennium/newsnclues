                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tons of news from this week for you, including a hacking group that's linked to the Spanish government; CEOs using AI avatars to deliver company earnings; Pocket shutting down — or is it? But we've now learned that the researchers who first discovered the group were convinced that Spanish government hackers were behind Careto's espionage operations. 23andWe: Regeneron announced this week that it's buying genetic testing company 23andMe for $256 million, including the company's genomics service and its bank of 15 million customers' personal and genetic data. The pharma giant said it plans to use the customer data to help drug discovery, saying that it will “prioritize the privacy, security, and ethical use of 23andMe's customer data.” Let's hope so! But what we didn't bank on was Sergey Brin admitting that he made “lots of mistakes” with Google Glass. Want this delivered as a newsletter to your inbox every Saturday? io, not I/O: OpenAI is acquiring io, the device startup that CEO Sam Altman has been working on with Jony Ive, in an all-equity deal that values that startup at $6.5 billion. Besides the fact that the announcement was accompanied by perhaps the strangest corporate headshot of all time, we spotted some other unexpected news: Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski's family investment office, Flat Capital, had bought shares in io six months earlier, which means those io shares will be converted into shares in the for-profit arm of OpenAI. Speaking of Klarna's CEO, Siemiatkowski used an AI version of himself to deliver the company's earnings this week. Zoom CEO Eric Yuan followed suit, also using his avatar for initial comments. The company didn't say why it's shutting Pocket down, only that it will continue to invest in helping people discover and “access high quality web content.” But maybe it can be saved: Soon after, Digg founder Kevin Rose posted on X that his company would love to buy it. AI on my face: Apple is reportedly working on AI-powered glasses, similar to Meta's Ray-Bans, sometime next year. Uh, no thank you: At its very first developer conference, Anthropic unveiled Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4, which can analyze large datasets, execute long-horizon tasks, and take complex actions, according to the company. That's all fine and good until I learned the Claude Opus 4 model tried to blackmail developers when they threaten to replace it with a new AI system. Ah, now I feel better: But don't worry! Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that today's AI models hallucinate at a lower rate than humans do. That might be true, but at least humans don't immediately turn to blackmail when they don't like what they hear. Bluesky blue checks: The decentralized social network Bluesky quietly rolled out blue verification badges for “notable and authentic” accounts. People can now apply for verification through a new online form. But Bluesky is leaning on other systems beyond the blue badge to verify users. Sure there are ads and boxes and now AI summaries that, for better or worse, get you to the right answers — usually. But the premise has always been the same: Type your query into a box, and Google will surface results. At this year's Google I/O, we started noticing a change. As Maxwell Zeff, writes, “At I/O 2025, Google made clear that the concept of Search is firmly in its rearview mirror.” The largest announcement of I/O was that Google now offers AI mode to every Search user in the United States, which means users can have an AI agent search (or even purchase things) for them.

According to the Financial Times, this site will be the first to host the U.S. Stargate project —a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure by OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund MGX that President Trump announced earlier this year. Upon completion, the site is estimated to deliver up to 1.2 gigawatts of computing power, making it one of the most powerful data centers in the world and competing against Elon Musk's Colossus in Memphis, Tennessee. The project's ownership is a bit complicated, though. The Abilene site is owned by Cruso, an AI infrastructure company, and Blue Owl Capital, a U.S. investment firm. Both have poured over $15 billion into the site through debt and equity financing. The AI data center campus is approximately 875 acres and will have eight buildings. OpenAI has solely relied on Microsoft's data centers for its computer power needs. So, the two decided to terminate their exclusive contract, allowing the AI pioneer to partner with other organizations for its processing power demands. Interestingly, all these talks on equity and investments are commitments by the individual companies—the Financial Times said that Stargate itself has yet to commit any amount to a data center. Nevertheless, OpenAI recently also announced Stargate UAE, where it plans to deploy a 1GB cluster in Abu Dhabi in coordination with the U.S. government. The 5 GW data center will be built by G42 and is envisioned to utilize more than 2 million Nvidia GB200 chips. Aside from this $40 billion Oracle order, there has also been news that Elon Musk is raising cash to build Colossus 2, featuring a million GPUs.

Nvidia has released an update to resolve this problem, not through a new driver, but as a firmware update for the GPU, also known as the vBIOS. The report strictly advises that only users experiencing this problem should update their firmware. If your motherboard does not support UEFI boot mode, Nvidia recommends contacting the customer service of your GPU manufacturer for a legacy vBIOS update. Nvidia's RTX 50 GPUs have struggled with stability and compatibility, starting with the problematic R570 branch of drivers, which even affected older RTX 20/30/40 series GPUs. Having experienced these issues first-hand, it took Nvidia multiple weeks to address most of them with the 576.02 update. An abrupt power outage during firmware updates can potentially brick your GPU, so proceed cautiously. Fortunately, Nvidia's provided utility can verify compatibility with your system's firmware and determine if a vBIOS update is necessary. Nvidia recommends only installing this update if you're encountering blank screens. Nvidia suggests the following temporary workarounds to boot with a display: This raises the question of why older RTX 50 cards are unaffected. What specific changes in these GPUs led to this problem?

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Launched in 1912, it used 28-millimeter film and a hand crank. Thanks to this kernel of an idea, I've just watched a film on the new Anker Nebula X1, in my garden, projected in 4K Ultra High Definition, onto a 120-inch screen, with a genuinely thrilling 4.1.2 surround-sound speaker system. But I do love the big screen, and in the pursuit of something close to a compromise I have tested dozens of superb portable projectors. As mobile technology has improved, these tiny Android-toting boxes of fun have made it possible for anyone to stream content onto a blank wall, screen, or the side of a tent. But none have come closer to looking and sounding like a proper home cinema than the Anker Nebula X1. Anyone familiar with Anker's range of portable projectors will recognize the X1. Externally there are similarities for sure, but inside "the world's first cinema-grade outdoor entertainment system" is a completely reengineered beast, with 3,500 ANSI lumens of brightness, 5,000:1 contrast ratio, liquid cooling, a built-in micro gimbal, and AI powered setup, plus the possibility of adding two wireless satellite speakers to give it true 4.2.2 surround sound, and mics for karaoke. But to get the best from it you'll need to spend big, and with fierce competition from brands including XGIMI, Hisense, and BenQ, is it worth your money? The built-in gimbal (an industry first) tilts up to 25 degrees to help it align with your chosen surface, while keystone correction, focus (there's a 1.67x optical zoom), and ambient light are all tweaked automatically. This is all done via a single button on the remote control, making it one of the easiest projectors I've set up. This setting works well but isn't always 100 percent—it needs to be placed pretty close to the original position—but you can tweak screen angle and focus manually too. Yes, lighting and screen conditions were optimal, but I was still impressed by the detail and brightness created by the combination of 3,500 ANSI Lumen brightness, 4K (3840 × 2160) resolution and a cinema-grade 14-element all-glass lens. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It's not as good as a great television; blacks are a little washed out, but the sharpness of the image and punched-up detail stands it apart from any portable I've ever tested. It's also better than any other portable projector when the lights dim. There is a little shading in the shadows, but that's to be expected, and forgiven, unless you're buying a pro-grade system. Portable projectors are fun, and I'm happy to forgo a little color saturation for the enjoyment of a movie anywhere I like. But without exception, all the portable projectors I've tried in recent years have had bang-average audio. Handling action, music, and voice is difficult, but none can compete with dedicated surround-sound (or stereo) speakers or soundbar. The X1 has four built-in speakers (40 watts total) and on its own it sounds better than I expected, especially at lower volumes. It's brilliantly effective and means you don't have to pump up the volume to mask the fan noise. Nebula estimate it lowers noise to just 26 decibels—most portable projectors are rated 30 to 35 decibels—which isn't a huge difference, but trust me, the noise it does make isn't nearly as distracting as a fan. On its own the X1's audio is pretty good, but add a pair of dedicated battery powered satellite speakers with Wi-Fi, and the upgrade is phenomenal. You can also buy them as part of a bundle with the X1 for $3,298. Each speaker has up to eight hours of battery life and cute flip-out feet. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Combined with the X1's four speakers, you've got 200 watts of lossless audio power through one cable, and with Dolby Audio support (although no Dolby Atmos) and 25 ms latency on screen there's no synching issues I could spot. I missed the cinema release of the Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, but streaming it via Disney + in 4K Ultra HD, I was sucked right into 1960s Greenwich Village, and both concert, dialog, and studio audio were superb, with instrumentation, crowd noise, and FX impressively balanced. Even the bang-crash-wallop of Tom Hardy's dreadful Netflix caper Havoc sounded powerful and engaging. If you want to connect to a Blu-ray player or gaming console there are two HDMI ports (one with eARC). Back in my living room and with a karaoke YouTube channel loaded, the microphones in the speaker kit really came into their own, especially if you're a ten-year-old girl and her mother. Enthusiastic warbling aside, the quality was rock-solid, and battery life far too long! It's worth remembering that while the retractable handle makes this projector “portable” it does weigh 13.7 pounds (6.2 kilograms) and requires a power outlet. If you want a true go-anywhere battery-powered design, like the excellent XGIMI Go+ ($699), you'll need to sacrifice brightness and audio power. I'm yet to be sold on backyard movies, but I live in a cold, overpopulated part of the world. Just make sure your Wi-Fi signal is strong enough. If anything, it tends to be easier than the remote, although finding menus for manual control is a bit of a fiddle if you don't know where to look. It's comparable in price to a quality home cinema projector, but those often lack streaming capabilities or audio. The impact the satellite speakers has on your enjoyment of a movie, combined with excellent image quality and whisper-quiet operation makes it an easy, albeit it expensive, product to recommend.

The Acer Vero B247Y doesn't have everything, but it has enough for good gaming and comfortable productivity. Image quality and video processing are better than its low asking price suggests. My reviews focus almost exclusively on the best gaming monitors, and this one is no different. However, there are displays aimed at the enterprise that perform equally well for entertainment. There are good deals outside the gaming category where you'll find panels with fast refresh rates and Adaptive-Sync. One such product is a member of Acer's Vero line, the B247Y. It's a 24-inch IPS panel with FHD resolution, 120 Hz, and Adaptive-Sync. It also sports accurate color out of the box, a little extra gamut volume, and decent video processing. IPS was once a premium category when TN ruled as the dominant panel technology. The picture is sharp and clean with higher-than-average contrast that I measured at over 1,300:1. You won't find extended color in this segment, but the B247Y has a little more gamut volume than typical budget screens, with over 116% coverage of sRGB. Accuracy is also excellent with no need for calibration to see a high-fidelity image. Though the B247Y is marketed as an enterprise monitor, it has the two components needed for gaming, fast refresh, and Adaptive-Sync. The maximum 120 Hz refresh rate delivers a reasonably smooth moving picture, and Adaptive-Sync works over the DisplayPort input on AMD and Nvidia platforms. Gaming consoles connected via HDMI get it too, but only up to 75 Hz. Also included is blur reduction via backlight strobe with a two-level pulse width adjustment. I also discovered a frame rate counter in the menu, but no aiming points. Two internal speakers provide decent audio, or you can use the headphone jack. Not surprisingly, there are no USB ports or LED lighting. And it's part of an enterprise product line, which means you might be able to convince your IT manager to buy one for your cubicle. The B247Y arrives in something of a plain brown wrapper, but there are some subtle graphics on the box to set it apart. It opens clamshell-style to reveal molded pulp forms instead of crumbly foam protecting the contents. Since three of these only cost $465, that's a real possibility. And there's a 3.5mm stereo cable for the audio input. Another Acer logo and a thin grill for passive cooling are in the back. Down in the corner is an OSD joystick and a single button to toggle power. It has a cable clip at the bottom and full ergonomics with 5/25 degrees tilt, 45 degrees swivel, 6.4 inches of height and a 90-degree portrait mode. More modern interfaces include one each of HDMI 1.4 and DisplayPort 1.2. The B247Y's OSD is much like what one would see on any gaming monitor with signal info at the top, a gaming sub-menu and full calibration controls. The video processing suite includes a two-level overdrive, Adaptive-Sync toggle and VRB which is a backlight strobe that works instead of AS and has two pulse width options. It reduces blur effectively but suffers from the phasing artifact common to this tech. That's fine if you work in the dark, but if you have lights over your workspace, turn it on to engage the full peak potential of around 288 nits. You can also turn on dynamic contrast, which has a subtly positive effect and Super Sharpness, which adds a tiny bit of edge enhancement to the image. This is typical of Acer monitors, where if you change any setting, it switches to User mode. Two-point white balance is something rarely seen at any price, impressive. You also get a grayscale mode and six-axis color sliders. I adjusted the very precise RGB sliders for even better grayscale tracking. The sRGB gamut option doesn't actually reduce the color gamut but that's OK since it's fixed to sRGB natively with just a bit of extra verve in every primary and secondary hue. But when I consider all the sub-$200 screens I've experienced, it delivers better gameplay than it has a right to. I have said many times that 144 Hz should be considered a starting point, but the B247Y makes the most of its 120 Hz with an excellent overdrive. There is a little motion blur, but not enough to keep it from being responsive and accurate. If I really looked for it, there was some smearing, but when I concentrated on firing and maneuvering, there were no distractions. It's a backlight strobe with two pulse width options. Neither solves the phasing artifact, which is a distraction. You won't need an expensive PC to peg the frame rate at 120 fps, so stick with Adaptive-Sync. Image quality is excellent when comparing the B247Y to other IPS sRGB monitors. If you're accustomed to a wide gamut OLED at home, playing games at work will be a less wondrous experience. But if you just want to blow off some steam by fragging your workmates during lunch, this monitor delivers the fun. They don't have a wide frequency range, but they are clean and low levels are clear enough that you can hear the action without disturbing the cubicles nearby. For productivity, a 24-inch screen might be a little small on its own but since the B247Y is so inexpensive, why not get three? That's less expensive than a single ultra-wide display and easier to get from the IT department. If you don't mind the lack of USB ports, it's a great option. Takeaway: The B247Y offers solid gaming performance and excellent picture quality for a very low price. It's inexpensive enough that putting two or three of them on your desk is still a budget-friendly option. Just unpack and enjoy, with money left over for pizza.

Having reviewed dozens of drones of all shapes, sizes, and prices, I'd recently come to the conclusion that smaller, lighter, and cheaper drones were the way to go for 90 percent of consumers. Premium drones, with all their equipment and flight regulations, just didn't make sense. But then DJI launched its new premium-priced, jumbo-size flagship consumer drone, the Mavic 4 Pro, and made me fall in love all over again. As well as ongoing issues around flight restrictions and security, a DJI spokesperson told WIRED, “Like many global companies, we have had to adjust our market strategy as local conditions and the industry environment have evolved. It's not for sale, yet, but there is at least some hope. There's an ultra-high-spec wide-angle camera partnered with slightly lower-spec medium-telephoto and telephoto cameras. They're all improvements over the Mavic 3 Pro's cameras. And the star of the show features a new 4/3 sensor capable of 100 MP photographs and 6K video capture at up to 60 fps (or 4K at 120 fps, for slick slow-motion playback), with an astounding 16 stops of dynamic range. It also has an adjustable aperture, allowing pilots to pick anything between f/2.0 and f/11.0. The other cameras' sensors are a little smaller in size, their video is limited to 4K resolution, and their apertures are fixed at f/2.8, but all three cameras can capture video at 10-bit quality using the D-Log, D-Log M, or HLG color profiles. In other words, all are built for pro-quality aerial movie making. And better yet, it is all mounted on a completely new design of gimbal that's able to freely rotate and tilt. Not only does this mean it can be pointed directly upward, it can also rotate to capture true portrait-oriented content, perfectly formatted for the likes of TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts. It's a fantastic aerial camera in almost any lighting conditions (the 28-mm Hasselblad is particularly capable at night-time, for instance) and its range of motion and choice of focal lengths makes it incredibly versatile. If there's something else this accomplished in consumer drones, image-quality wise, I've yet to encounter it. The drone's flight capabilities are impressive, too, right down to new time-saving touches like the fact it automatically powers on when unfolded. The 4 Pro is also the first Mavic model to come with a front-facing Lidar sensor, which, when teamed up with the low-light vision sensors that poke out in all directions, gives this drone a lot more situational awareness and anti-collision capability, even in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. This works well with its tracking capabilities, which allow it to accurately keep the camera focussed on people, boats, and vehicles while being flown either manually or autonomously. The drone's enhanced visual skills now let it automatically fly back to its take-off point without the use of GPS. Its screen is larger and brighter and can rotate through 90 degrees to act more like a smartphone (it runs on Android, so you can install third-party apps), and it powers on automatically when you lift the screen from the body. This movement also results in the two thumb sticks popping up, meaning you don't have to screw them on each time you use the controller. All in all, the Mavic 4 Pro represents a major upgrade over its already impressive predecessor and makes the idea of owning a larger drone once again very appealing. While it's true that heavier drones are subject to a lot of (often tiresome) restrictions compared to ultra-lightweight models, but the extra paperwork and care around flight locations seems like a price worth paying when they perform as well as this does. If you're just looking for something to get in the air and capture a few good-looking shots, the much cheaper DJI Mini 4 Pro (8/10 WIRED Recommends) is all you need. I just hope DJI is able to navigate around the ongoing uncertainty of the Trump administration's tariffs, as it'd be a true shame if this brilliant drone were not available in the US.

TSMC's new custom-designed employee-exclusive 20-inch suitcase is pretty awesome to behold. However, semiconductor analyst Ray Wang has observed that lucky owners are reselling them for up to US$16,700 (NT$500,000) on online marketplaces in Taiwan. TSMC custom-branded products are highly coveted inside and outside of its employee base. Due to the rarity of TSMC-branded items and their restricted employee-only initial sale, even new releases can command significant premiums on resale marketplaces. You can't be serious 😭 TSMC's employee‑exclusive 20‑inch suitcase is already hitting resale sites for an eye‑watering NT$500,000—about US$15,500.I want one tho...... pic.twitter.com/8ylgDNobSZMay 23, 2025 We dug up listings like Mr Wang's clipped from Taiwan's Shopee platform and note that these subtly computer-chip-styled silver suitcases are made using Makrolon polycarbonate. The material's German maker, Covestro AG, describes it as “extremely robust, lightweight with glass-like transparency and is impact resistant—even at low temperatures." This snazzy case is made in Taiwan (by Eminent) and comes with a decent 5-year warranty. During our perusal of the new TSMC suitcase listings, it quickly became apparent that this employee-exclusive can be had for much more reasonable money. They promised that the case was “expected” before June 30. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Our hunt continued through the Shopee listings, and we found one reseller with actual stock (1 case) at US$334 (NT$10,000). The majority of other sellers were listing goods they didn't yet have in their possession. Please don't go and buy this stuff; save some for me… Mark Tyson is a news editor at Tom's Hardware.

The map for Grand Theft Auto 6 set to release next year is approximately two and a half times larger than the explorable area of Grand Theft Auto 5. You can see lights in the environment reflecting off the sweat on characters bodies while they're muscles twist and stretch as they move they way it would for a real person.

But the company's technological capabilities extend far beyond such everyday essentials: It also produces powerful portable power stations to meet the needs of users looking for robust sources of power on the go or as reliable home standbys.

This rapid recharge functionality makes the power station ready when you want it whether it's for an unexpected loss of power or a prior-to-activity charge before venturing out on an outdoor adventure. The greatest thing about the Solix C1000 is its battery technology: It features a LiFePO4 battery which is renowned for its long lifespan and safety. The station features 11 different ports for great compatibility whether you're running essential home equipment during an outage, powering tools at a job site or charging multiple devices while camping.

If you want to keep up with all the big game releases of the year, you're not going to be able to do that without either immediately deleting them after playing or by expanding your storage capacity. When new titles clock in at over 100GB, you need to make some tough choices in terms of what gets to stay around. The easy solution it to just get yourself a much bigger solid state drive. For instance, the 1TB model is available for $99 on Amazon, which is a almost a 40% discount from its regular price of $159, while the 4TB version has dropped to $309 from $464. The 2TB model is also on sale for $169, down 34% from its $249 original price. Say goodbye to long load times in the games you play: The Samsung 990 Pro Gen 4 SSD is designed for superior performance with fast speeds while maintaining power efficiency. Great for not just gaming, but any intensive workflows like video editing or working with large datasets. The original PlayStation 5 comes with only 825 GB of internal storage. With the ballooning size of AAA games on the market, you'll be lucky if you can have more than 3 games downloaded onto your system at a time. We have good news: The PS5's storage can be expanded by installing a compatible M.2 solid state drive. The Samsung 990 is compatible, but with a catch. The heatsink also has futuristic RGB LED lights because of course it does. That's just for the console players though. If you yourself or the loved one you're buying for is gaming on PC, then the non-heatsink version will work out just fine. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.
