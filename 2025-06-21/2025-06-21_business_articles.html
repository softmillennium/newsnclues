                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In another blow to the Republicans' tax and spending cut bill, the Senate parliamentarian has advised that a proposal to shift some food stamps costs from the federal government to states — a centerpiece of GOP savings efforts — would violate the chamber's rules. The Republican leadership scrambled on Saturday, days before voting is expected to begin on President Donald Trump's package that he wants to be passed into law by the Fourth of July. They have been counting on some tens of billions of potential savings from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to help offset the costs of the $4.5 trillion tax breaks plan. The parliamentarian let stand for now a provision that would impose new work requirements for older Americans, up to age 65, to receive food stamp aid. "We will keep fighting to protect families in need," said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, which handles the SNAP program. "The Parliamentarian has made clear that Senate Republicans cannot use their partisan budget to shift major nutrition assistance costs to the states that would have inevitably led to major cuts," she said. It all points to serious trouble ahead for the bill, which was approved by the House on a party-line vote last month over unified opposition from Democrats and is now undergoing revisions in the Senate. At its core, the goal of the multitrillion-dollar package is to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term that would otherwise expire if Congress fails to act. It also adds new ones, including no taxes on tips and or overtime pay. To help offset the costs of lost tax revenue, the Republicans are proposing cutbacks to federal Medicaid, health care and food programs — some $1 trillion. Additionally, the package boosts national security spending by about $350 billion, including to pay for Trump's mass deportations, which are running into protests nationwide. Trump has implored Republicans, who have the majority in Congress, to deliver on his top domestic priority, but the details of the package, with its hodge-podge of priorities, are drawing deeper scrutiny. Additionally, it would reduce or eliminate food stamps for more than 3 million people. Late Friday, the parliamentarian issued its latest findings. It determined that Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee's proposal to have the states pick up more of the tab for covering food stamps — what Republicans call a new cost-sharing arrangement — would violate the Byrd Rule. They warned many would lose access to SNAP benefits used by more than 40 million people. Cost estimates for the Senate's version, which made changes to the House approach, have not been publicly available. The parliamentarian's office rulings leave GOP leaders with several options. They can revise the proposals to try to comply with Senate rules or strip them from the package altogether. They can also risk a challenge during floor voting, which would require the 60-vote threshold to overcome. It found several provisions from the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which is led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to be in violation. They include one to provide $250 million to Coast Guard stations damaged by fire in 2025, namely one on South Padre Island in Texas. Some of the most critical rulings from parliamentarians are still to come. The parliamentarian has also advised of violations over provisions from the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that would roll back Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards on certain vehicles and from the Senate Armed Services Committee to require the Defense secretary to provide a plan on how the Pentagon intends to spend the tens of billions of new funds. The new work requirements in the package would require many of those receiving SNAP or Medicaid benefits to work 80 hours a month or engage in other community or educational services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Walmart has agreed to pay $10 million to settle a U.S. Federal Trade Commission civil lawsuit accusing the world's largest retailer of ignoring warning signs that fraudsters used its money transfer services to fleece consumers out of hundreds of millions of dollars. The settlement was filed on Friday in Chicago federal court, and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Manish Shah. Walmart also agreed not to process money transfers it suspects are fraudulent, or help sellers and telemarketers it believes are using its services to commit fraud. "Electronic money transfers are one of the most common ways that scammers tell consumers to send them money, because once it's sent, it's gone for good," said Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC consumer protection bureau. "Companies that provide these services must train their employees to comply with the law and work to protect consumers." The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Walmart did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In its June 2022 complaint, the FTC accused Walmart of turning a blind eye to fraudsters who used its money transfer services to cash out at its stores. Walmart acts as an agent for money transfers by companies such as MoneyGram, Ria and Western Union. Money can be hard to trace once delivered. The FTC said fraudsters used many schemes that included impersonating Internal Revenue Service agents, impersonating family members who needed money from grandparents to avoid jail, and telling victims they won lotteries or sweepstakes but owed fees to collect their winnings. Friday's settlement would end the appeal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Returns have driven some sellers to exit the popular Fulfillment by Amazon program, while others told CNBC they'd like to leave the platform altogether. At the heart of the problem is a big rise in returns fraud, which has led to customers mistakenly receiving used products when they ordered something new. In two particularly egregious examples involving baby products described to CNBC, Amazon sent customers used diapers and a chiller with someone else's rotten breastmilk inside. "I really don't think that consumers understand how many small businesses are on Amazon and how their return habits affect small businesses and families like mine," said Rachelle Baron, owner of Beau and Belle Littles, which sells reusable swim diapers on Amazon. Baron said her business tanked after a return incident with Amazon. The e-commerce platform shipped soiled swim diapers to customers after the used baby products had been returned to Amazon, Baron said. Amazon started charging sellers in its fulfillment program (FBA) a new fee in June 2024 for items that exceed certain return rate thresholds. In September, a couple months after the fee went into effect, e-commerce group Helium 10 saw return rates for U.S. Amazon sellers drop nearly 5%. However, the new fee may also be leading to rising prices. One survey by e-commerce analysis company SmartScout found that 65% of sellers said they raised prices in 2024 directly because of Amazon fee changes. Other sellers told CNBC returns fraud is the reason they've raised prices. "We're running at about just over 1% net profit on Amazon, totally due to fraud and return abuse," said Lorie Corlett, who sells Sterling Spectrum protective cases for hot wheels. People would stop doing it if Amazon held them accountable." Those measures include denying refunds and requiring customer identity verification. Mike Jelliff sells professional music gear through his GeekStands brand on Amazon and eight other marketplaces. "On eBay, we're allowed to block specific customers out," Jelliff said. "But on Amazon, that customer is still allowed to repurchase from us." Jelliff showed CNBC the system of about 40 cameras he's installed in his Tyler, Texas, warehouse to track every outgoing item, incoming return and unboxing. He keeps a blacklist of repeat offenders who commit this kind of fraud and those who return used and damaged items, which become a total loss for him. Amazon has made some improvements to its returns process, said Jelliff, who doesn't rely on FBA. This includes Amazon allowing small businesses to make multiple appeals when fighting a fraudulent return. Amazon has also let Jelliff opt-out of automatic return labels for items above $100 starting in 2023, and his return rate has been dropping since. "Because it's such a large operation, things are missed," said Lu of Helium 10. "I think they're probably missed on the margins, but these stories are very impactful because it is such a reckoning for the brand." Ceres Chill founder Lisa Myers, who once relied on Amazon to handle returns for her business as part of FBA, has one of these stories. In 2023, Amazon sent one of Ceres Chill's products to a customer with someone else's rotten breastmilk inside, said Myers, adding that the customer wrote a review saying, "she will never forget that smell." "To have something, and I don't mean to be dramatic, but dangerous, somebody else's bodily fluids in your kitchen rotting in something that you had intended to use for your child is unacceptable," Myers said. "That's the moment I broke down crying and just sat down and thought, I have no idea how this could have happened." Myers said she left FBA after the incident, leaving behind benefits like having her products labeled with Amazon's Prime badge. "It hurts our business to not participate in Fulfilled by Amazon," Myers said. Instead, Myers outsources all her returns to baby resell specialist Goodbuy Gear, which is on track to re-sell 200,000 returned baby products this year. "For some of these, there's 40 points that we inspect on the item itself, and it's really complicated." Langenfeld showed CNBC the process at her warehouse in Malvern, Pennsylvania, where each item is inspected for about 15 minutes and is typically handled by at least four employees. She says 33 new sellers signed up in 2024, three times more than the previous year. And with business growing 50% year-over-year, she's upgrading to a bigger warehouse in Columbus, Ohio. Returns generated an estimated 29 million metric tons of carbon emissions in 2024, and 9.8 billion pounds of returns ended up in landfills, according to reverse logistics software provider Optoro. In 2022, Amazon told CNBC it was "working towards a goal of zero product disposal," but wouldn't give a timeline for that ambition. Three years later, that goal is still in the works, with Amazon telling CNBC in a statement, "The vast majority of returns are resold as new or used, returned to selling partners, liquidated, or donated." In 2020, Amazon added two new options for sellers to re-home returns. "Grade and Resell" allows all U.S. FBA sellers to have Amazon rate the return and mark it as "used" before re-selling it. FBA Liquidation allows sellers to recoup some losses by offloading palettes of goods for re-sale on the secondary market through liquidation partners like Liquidity Services. There's also an FBA Donations program that's been around since 2019, allowing sellers to automatically offer eligible overstock and returns to charity groups through the non-profit Good360. For shoppers wanting to keep returns from incineration or landfills, Amazon also has options. Daily deal site Woot!, bought by Amazon for $110 million in 2010, also sells scratched and dented items. Customers can also trade in certain electronics, like Amazon devices, phones and tablets, for Amazon gift cards or send them to the company's certified recycler.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most people in the early stages of a new romance look for evidence that confirms their compatibility. We would discover a deal-breaker down the road — something big like how much money we wanted to give our aging parents or something small like what temperature room we like to sleep in — that would lead to our demise. Academic jobs are hard to come by, which meant we might be stuck in that awkward situation for life. So we created a list of questions, guided by basic principles of relationship science, that are critical for couples to openly communicate about if they want to know whether they're really compatible. Unlike the questions you find on dating apps, they don't apply to everyone. The stress we feel at work has an outsized effect on our interpersonal relationships, even influencing sexual function, like the ability to reach orgasm. When we have chemistry with someone and feel aligned with them on big things like values and goals, we assume the daily things will fall into place. Sleep is a must on this list; it's one the strongest predictors of health outcomes and relationship satisfaction. But I also suggest touching on food, pets, humor, and time alone. Annie and her partner Alvy are both in therapy, shown on a split screen. Their respective therapists ask them, "Do you have sex often?" Alvy laments, "Hardly ever, maybe three times a week," whereas Annie responds in an exasperated, annoyed tone, "Constantly, I'd say three times a week." Despite its outsized effect on relationship longevity and physical health, we don't have good social scripts for talking about sex. What we're "allowed" to talk about in relationships is based on norms, and when it comes to relationships, these norms are often morally tinged. In some cases, you're too embarrassed to ask the question. In others, you worry that caring about the answer will reflect poorly on your character. Ours included questions about family history of mental health problems. We often slide into relationships, rather than making thoughtful, deliberate decisions. Going through this exercise won't make you feel comfortable, but that's not the goal. What good will avoiding that temporary discomfort do when you find yourself lying awake next to the love of your life, his cat that you're allergic to at the foot of the bed, feeling all hot and sweaty because he likes it balmy at night and you love the air conditioner?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Mark Zuckerberg feels the heat, he opens his wallet. The 41-year-old Facebook founder and Meta CEO is on a spending spree like never before in an effort to position his company at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom and make up for recent costly mistakes in a market that's rapidly revolutionizing the business world. Following last week's stunning $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, which brought with it Meta's hiring of the startup's founder, Alexandr Wang, and a small group of his top staffers, Meta now plans to hire former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and his business partner, Daniel Gross, who had been CEO of $32 billion AI startup Safe Superintelligence, CNBC reported this week. Meta previously tried to buy Safe Superintelligence, which was launched a year ago by OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, sources told CNBC. What Zuckerberg didn't say then is that he was about to start shelling out mounds of cash to revamp his AI organization. "Mark Zuckerberg is in founder mode and he's not going to be stopped," said Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview on Friday with CNBC's "Money Movers." Luria has a buy rating on the stock, but said that to win in AI, Meta needs to be successful with the next round, with the dream team that they're building." At Meta, AI is being embedded across the company, from its core online advertising unit and Instagram algorithms to its effort to build the metaverse. Better AI models and technology enhance the company's existing business, both by improving ad targeting and by bringing down costs. However, the building of fundamental models used by the vast community of developers — where the company competes with Google, OpenAI, Anthropic and others — is where Meta is viewed by many as a laggard. Meta's unique open-source approach is built around the Llama family of models. Its most recent update in April, the Llama 4 AI models, was not well received by developers. At the time, Meta only released two smaller versions of Llama 4 and said it would eventually release a bigger and more powerful "Behemoth" model. "On the heels of a successful rollout of Llama 3 a year ago, Llama 4 that came out this year was an absolute failure, almost by his admission," Luria said, referring to Zuckerberg. "Meta can't afford to fail in having the leading AI model. So they're out in the marketplace desperately trying to replace their AI team right now." Bringing on Scale AI's Wang was Zuckerberg's most headline-grabbing move yet. While Meta is gaining a 49% stake in the startup, Zuckerberg's real prize in the deal was hiring Wang, a dropout from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who started his company at age 19. Zuckerberg then turned his attention to Github's Friedman and Gross, who have been investing together at their venture firm NFDG. Meta, meanwhile, will get a stake in NFDG, according to multiple sources. Some are in the tens or hundreds of millions. Altman said on the latest episode of the "Uncapped" podcast, which his brother hosts, that Meta has tried to lure OpenAI employees by offering signing bonuses as high as $100 million, with even larger annual compensation packages. "I've heard that Meta thinks of us as their biggest competitor," Altman said on the podcast. "Their current AI efforts have not worked as well as they have hoped and I respect being aggressive and continuing to try new things." Meta technology chief Andrew Bosworth told CNBC's "Closing Bell Overtime" on Friday that Altman is countering the offers. "The market is setting a rate here for a level of talent which is really incredible and kind of unprecedented in my 20-year career as a technology executive," said Bosworth, who joined Meta in 2006. Analysts at Argus maintained their buy recommendation on the stock this week and lifted their price target to $790 a share from $725 a share. "The company's ability to capitalize on GenAI advances in advertising targeting is a particularly relevant opportunity to drive advertising spending, which is the company's lifeblood," the Argus analysts wrote. Davidson's Luria said that Zuckerberg has put more pressure on himself to turn Meta into a long-term AI leader, but said he won't bet against him. Luria said: "The last time Mr. Zuckerberg felt like he was under the gun," he snapped up Instagram for $1 billion, a deal that set the stage for Facebook to become a dominant player in mobile. Luria also highlighted Zuckerberg's controversial $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp two years later. He sees the Meta CEO making an equally bold wager in AI. — CNBC's Kate Rooney and Jonathan Vanian contributed to this report.

After 150 years without minimal innovation, the beehive is getting an upgrade that is making it easier to protect colonies and the crops that rely on them.

Lifting up the hood of a Beewise hive feels more like you're getting ready to examine the engine of a car than visit with a few thousand pollinators. 

The unit — dubbed a BeeHome — is an industrial upgrade from the standard wooden beehives, all clad in white metal and solar panels. Inside sits a high-tech scanner and robotic arm powered by artificial intelligence. Roughly 300,000 of these units are in use across the US, scattered across fields of almond, canola, pistachios and other crops that require pollination to grow.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's grad season, and Gen Z job seekers are feeling desperate. It's long been typical for 20-somethings to have a higher unemployment rate than the general population, and the overall US unemployment rate is still relatively low. One relatively new development, however, is that young people with college degrees are being hit hard by the economic slowdown — especially if they're hoping to land a role in traditionally white-collar fields. Even as the cost of higher education has risen, more people are getting a bachelor's degree at US schools, which means more qualified competition for the available jobs. The National Center for Education Statistics showed there were almost 2 million bachelor's degrees conferred in the 2022-2023 academic year, up from 1.8 million a decade ago. "​​We are used to thinking about college as being a meal ticket to economic opportunity," said Guy Berger, the workforce economist in residence at Guild and senior fellow at the Burning Glass Institute. Still, he added that having a degree could bring less of a premium in the job market because there are more college graduates than in the past. This is a new trend: young people with degrees have historically almost always been more likely to be employed than the rest of the labor force. Those who studied anthropology, physics, or computer engineering had the highest unemployment rates in 2023, per the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's analysis of Census Bureau data. In what's been dubbed the Big Stay, current employees are holding on to their seats as well, with the monthly quit rate falling from 3% in March 2022 to 2% this past April. Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said college and high school graduates are entering a job market where people are holding onto their jobs and companies aren't cutting roles or hiring new employees. Gusto, a payroll and benefits platform for small- and medium-sized businesses, found the rate of primarily white-collar hires aged 20 to 24 at small and midsize employers has fallen from pre-pandemic levels, declining from 9.4% in May 2019 to 2.7% this past March. Still, Aaron Terrazas, an economist at Gusto, said there are US cities where new grad hiring looks strong, including in the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley. "We all come out of school with grand ambitions and thinking our plan is set," Terrazas said. "Being open to unexpected opportunities is particularly important in an economy like the present." While this figure fluctuates over time, the share of 20-somethings who have jobs they're overeducated for is rising in 2025. It coincides with the generation's pivot toward skilled-trades roles such as electricians or plumbers. Many young people are seeing these opportunities as a safer bet compared to a corporate world hit by layoff waves and hiring freezes. Construction laborers, electricians, and truck drivers are projected to grow faster than the average job-growth rate of 4% from 2023 to 2033, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel said on Saturday it had killed a veteran Iranian commander during attacks by both sides in the more than week-long air war, while Tehran said it would not negotiate over its nuclear program while under threat. Calling his killing a "major achievement for Israeli intelligence and the Air Force", Katz said in a statement that Izadi had financed and armed the Palestinian militant group Hamas ahead of its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza. The Revolutionary Guards said five of its members died in attacks on Khorramabad, according to Iranian media. They did not mention Izadi, who was on U.S. and British sanctions lists. Iranian media said earlier on Saturday that Israel had attacked a building in Qom, with initial reports of a 16-year-old killed and two people injured. At least 430 people have been killed and 3,500 injured in Iran since Israel began its attacks on June 13, Iranian state-run Nour News said, citing the health ministry. In Israel, 24 civilians have been killed by Iranian missile attacks, according to local authorities, in the worst conflict between the longtime enemies. Israel says Iran was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons, while Iran says its atomic programme is only for peaceful purposes. Israel is widely assumed to possess nuclear weapons, which it neither confirms nor denies. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Israel's aggression, which he said had indications of U.S. involvement, should stop so Iran can "come back to diplomacy." On Friday in Geneva, Araqchi met European foreign ministers who were seeking a path back to diplomacy. He said on Friday he thought Iran would be able to have a nuclear weapon "within a matter of weeks, or certainly within a matter of months," adding: "We can't let that happen." Iran's Fars news agency said Israel had targeted the Isfahan nuclear facility, one of the nation's biggest, but there was no leakage of hazardous materials. Israel said it had launched a wave of attacks against missile storage and launch infrastructure sites. Ali Shamkhani, a close ally of Iran's supreme leader, said he had survived an Israeli attack. Early on Saturday, the Israeli military warned of an incoming barrage from Iran, triggering air raid sirens across parts of central Israel and in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Interceptions were visible in the sky over Tel Aviv, with explosions echoing as Israel's air defense systems responded. The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a U.S.-based rights organization that tracks Iran, gave a higher death toll than Tehran, saying Israeli attacks have killed 639 people there. Those killed in Iran include the military's top echelon and nuclear scientists. Israel said it also killed a second commander of the Guards' overseas arm, whom it identified as Benham Shariyari, during an overnight strike. Nour News on Saturday named 15 air defense officers and soldiers it said had been killed in the conflict with Israel. Iran's health minister, Mohammadreza Zafarqandi, said Israel has attacked three hospitals during the conflict, killing two health workers and a child, and has targeted six ambulances, according to Fars. Asked about such reports, an Israeli military official said that only military targets were being struck, though there may have been collateral damage in some incidents. An Iranian missile hit a hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba on Thursday. At the OIC meeting, where the Israel-Iran conflict topped the agenda, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said Israel's attacks on Iran right before a planned new round of nuclear talks with the U.S. aimed to sabotage negotiations and showed Israel did not want to resolve issues through diplomacy. A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Iran was ready to discuss limitations on uranium enrichment but that it would reject any proposal that barred it from enriching uranium completely, "especially now under Israel's strikes."

Activists from "No Space For Bezos" gather in Campo San Giacomo square in Venice on June 13.

The $10 million bash has called attention to whether the city needs to take stronger actions to stop a deluge of visitors. 

When Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former TV presenter Lauren Sanchez get married in Venice next week in a three-day, $10 million bash, they'll be joined not only by fellow celebrities but also by some unwelcome guests: anti-tourism activists determined to disrupt the festivities.

“We will throw ourselves into the water and use inflatables to oppose the event,” said Federica Toninello, a representative of the “No Space for Bezos” movement, which has announced plans to peacefully block land and water access to the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, which is among the rumored wedding party venues. The protest, she added, would be open to anybody “who wants to join us to take back our city.”</p>

Andreessen Horowitz led a $15 million funding round for an artificial intelligence startup called Cluely Inc., famous on social platforms like X for controversial viral marketing stunts and the slogan “cheat on everything.” 

The startup was co-founded by 21-year-old Roy Lee, who was booted from Columbia University earlier this year for creating a tool called Interview Coder that helped technical job candidates cheat on interviews using AI. At the time, he wrote on LinkedIn, “I'm completely kicked out from school. LOL!”</p>
