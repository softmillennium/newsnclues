                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says it would be “very, very dangerous for everyone” if the United States becomes actively involved in the war with Israel. Iranian missiles were intercepted over Jerusalem in the early hours of Saturday. A week into their war, Israel and Iran have exchanged more strikes, while diplomatic efforts led by the Europeans took place in Geneva. Iran's response to Israeli strikes on its territory was “legitimate and legal,” while condemning Israel's actions as “banditry,” says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. A spokesperson for the Fire Department in Northern Israel said on Saturday that an Iranian drone hit a building in northern Israel causing damage but no injuries. TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel ‘s military said Saturday it was preparing for the possibility of a lengthy war, and announced it struck an Iranian nuclear research facility overnight and killed three senior Iranian commanders in targeted attacks. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen said they would resume attacks on U.S. vessels and warships in the Red Sea if the Trump administration joins Israel's military campaign against Iran. The target was a centrifuge production site, Israel's military said. Iran again launched drones and missiles at Israel but there were no immediate reports of significant damage. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity under army guidelines to brief reporters, called it a “small barrage” that was largely intercepted by Israel's defenses. The official estimated that Israel's military has taken out more than 50% of Iran's launchers. “We're making it harder for them to fire toward Israel,” he said. “Having said all that, I want to say the Iranian regime obviously still has capabilities.” Gen. Effie Defrin, later said Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir told the army to prepare for a “prolonged campaign.” U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing active U.S. military involvement in the war. On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said “I think that it would be very, very dangerous for everyone.” He spoke on the sidelines of an Organization of Islamic Cooperation meeting in Turkey. Barring a commando raid or even a nuclear strike, Iran's underground Fordo uranium enrichment facility is considered out of reach to all but America's “bunker-buster” bombs. Trump said he would put off his decision on military involvement for up to two weeks. At least 722 people, including 285 civilians, have been killed in Iran and more than 2,500 wounded, according to a Washington-based Iranian human rights group. Another patient, Shahram Nourmohammadi, said he had been making deliveries when “something blew up right in front of me” at an intersection. “Everyone is leaving Tehran right now,” said one who did not give his name after crossing into Armenia. Iran has retaliated by firing more than 450 missiles and 1,000 drones at Israel, according to Israeli army estimates. Israel's multitiered air defenses have shot down most of them, but at least 24 people in Israel have been killed and hundreds wounded. Iran has long maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but it is the only non-nuclear-weapon state to enrich uranium up to 60% — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Israel is widely believed to be the only Middle Eastern country with a nuclear weapons program but has never acknowledged it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel's military operation will continue “for as long as it takes” to eliminate what he called the existential threat of Iran's nuclear program and ballistic missile arsenal. He emphasized that Tehran had no interest in negotiating with the U.S. while Israel continues to attack. No date was set for a new round of talks. Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org said Saturday that limited internet access had again “collapsed.” A nationwide internet shutdown has been in place for several days. Iranian officials did not immediately confirm Saeed Izadi's death, but the Qom governor's office said there had been an attack on a four-story apartment building and local media reported two people had been killed. Israel also said it killed the commander of the Quds Force's weapons transfer unit, who it said was responsible for providing weapons to Hezbollah and Hamas. Behnam Shahriyari was killed while traveling in western Iran, the military said. Iranian leaders say IAEA chief Rafael Grossi's statements about the status of Iran's nuclear program prompted Israel's attack. On Saturday, a senior adviser for Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamanei, Ali Larijani, said on social media, without elaboration, that Iran would make Grossi “pay” once the war is over. “In case of an attack on the Bushehr nuclear power plant, a direct hit would result in a very high release of radioactivity,” Grossi said, adding: “This is the nuclear site in Iran where the consequences could be most serious.” Israel has not targeted Iran's nuclear reactors, instead focusing strikes on the main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, centrifuge workshops near Tehran, laboratories in Isfahan and the country's Arak heavy water reactor southwest of the capital. Iran previously agreed to limit its uranium enrichment and allow international inspectors access to its nuclear sites under a 2015 deal in exchange for sanctions relief. But after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal during his first term, Iran began enriching uranium up to 60% and restricting access to its nuclear facilities. But Trump, like Israel, has demanded Iran end its enrichment program altogether. This story has been corrected to show Israel hit one centrifuge production site, not two.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., from left, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., speak to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, April 4, 2019. Rep.-elect Yassamin Ansari, D-Ariz., stands as newly-elected House members gather for a freshman class photo on the Capitol steps, in Washington, Nov. 15, 2024. Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., speaks during a Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing at the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 14, 2025. President Donald Trump gestures as he boards Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, Md., Friday, June 20, 2025. After nearly two years of stark divisions over the war in Gaza and support for Israel, Democrats are now finding themselves at odds over U.S. policy toward Iran as progressives demand unified opposition to President Donald Trump's consideration of a strike against Tehran's nuclear program while party leaders tread more cautiously. U.S. leaders of all stripes have found common ground for two decades on the position that Iran cannot be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. But Trump's public flirtation with joining Israel's offensive against Iran may become the Democratic Party's latest schism, just as it is sharply dividing Trump's isolationist “Make America Great Again” base from more hawkish conservatives. While progressives have staked out clear opposition to Trump's potential actions, the party leadership is playing the safer ground of demanding a role for Congress before Trump could use force against Iran. Many prominent Democrats with 2028 presidential aspirations are staying silent, so far, on the Israel-Iran war. “They are sort of hedging their bets,” said Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who served under Democratic President Barack Obama and is now a strategist on foreign policy. “The beasts of the Democratic Party's constituencies right now are so hostile to Israel's war in Gaza that it's really difficult to come out looking like one would corroborate an unauthorized war that supports Israel without blowback.” Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., has called Trump's consideration of an attack “a defining moment for our party” and has introduced legislation with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., that calls on the Republican president to “terminate” the use of U.S. armed forces against Iran unless “explicitly authorized” by a declaration of war from Congress. “That's going to cost this country a lot of money that should be being spent here at home,” said Khanna, who is said to be among the many Democrats eyeing the party's 2028 primary. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who twice sought the Democratic presidential nomination, pointed to Trump's stated goal during his inaugural speech of being known as “a peacemaker and a unifier.” Sanders has reintroduced legislation prohibiting the use of federal money for force against Iran, insisted that U.S. military intervention would be unwise and illegal and accused Israel of striking unprovoked. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York signed on to a similar bill from Sanders in 2020, but he is so far holding off this time. Some believe the party should stake out a clear anti-war stance as Trump weighs whether to launch a military offensive that is seemingly counter to the anti-interventionism he promised during his 2024 campaign. “The leaders of the Democratic Party need to step up and loudly oppose war with Iran and demand a vote in Congress,” said Tommy Vietor, a former Obama aide, on X. Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., was also cautious in responding to the Israeli action and said “the U.S. must continue to stand with Israel, as it has for decades, at this dangerous moment.” “It really seems like the Trump and Iran war track is kind of going along like a Formula 1 racetrack, and then the Democrats are in some sort of tricycle or something trying to keep up,” said Ryan Costello, a policy director for the Washington-based National Iranian American Council, which advocates for diplomatic engagement between U.S. and Iran. Other Democrats have condemned Israel's strikes and accused Netanyahu of sabotaging nuclear talks with Iran. A Pearson Institute/Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from September 2024  found that about half of Democrats said the U.S. was being “too supportive” of Israel and about 4 in 10 said their level support was “about right.” Democrats were more likely than independents and Republicans to say the Israeli government had “a lot” of responsibility for the continuation of the war between Israel and Hamas.

David is one win away from taking down Goliath. The Indiana Pacers have scratched and clawed their way to forcing a Game 7 against the heavily favored Oklahoma City Thunder. Game 7 on Sunday night may be in Oklahoma City, but former Pacers star Jalen Rose has a (rather not surprising) bold prediction. "All Indy all day," he told Fox News Digital at Fanatics Fest in New York on Friday. Rose raved about Tyrese Haliburton, who has had his fair share of memorable playoff moments this year. In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he mimicked Pacers legend Reggie Miller with a choke signal. In Game 1 of this series, he hit a game-winner with 0.3 seconds left. Haliburton played 23 minutes in Game 6 as he deals with a reported calf strain, but if he gets even better by Sunday, Rose thinks his prediction is even more obvious. "I just wish Haliburton is healthy for Game 7. I'm really rooting for him, I'm really rooting for the team, and he's going to keep getting better." But with the Pacers' 108-91 win on Thursday, Oklahoma City has outscored Indiana by just seven total points in the entire series. A win for the Pacers on Sunday would give them their first NBA championship. They won three ABA titles in the early 1970s. Jalen Rose at JAY-Z's 40/40 Club during Fanatics Fest NYC held at the Javits Center on June 20, 2025, in New York, New York. As for Oklahoma City, it would be their first championship since 1979 when they were the Seattle SuperSonics.

Amid a week of daily attacks between Middle Eastern juggernauts Israel and Iran, President Donald Trump has repeatedly drilled home a key point. "IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON," the president wrote on social media. And speaking with reporters in the Oval Office at the White House, Trump highlighted, "I've been saying for 20 years, maybe longer, that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon." And it appears most Americans agree with Trump and his presidential predecessors when it comes to the possibility of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. President Donald Trump, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., on June 18, 2025, takes questions from reporters regarding the possibility of launching a military strike on Iran. Nearly three-quarters (73%) of registered voters questioned in a new Fox News national survey said they think Iran poses a real security threat to the U.S. That's a 13-point boost since Fox News last asked the question six years ago. Majorities of Republicans (82%), Democrats (69%) and Independents (62%) agreed that Iran poses a threat. The survey also showed that 78% of those questioned said they were very or extremely concerned about Iran obtaining a nuclear bomb. Daron Shaw, a veteran GOP pollster and the Republican partner on the Fox News poll, said that "the increased sense that Iran constitutes a threat is real, but it also reflects the unique timing and circumstances surrounding this poll." A massive plume of smoke and fire rises from an oil refinery in southern Tehran following reports that an overnight Israeli strike targeted the site on June 15, 2025. There was a similar response regarding the threat from Iran in a Ronald Reagan Institute national survey conducted earlier this month, before Israel's initial attack last week sparked the daily bombardments by both nations. Eighty-four percent of those questioned in the poll, which was shared first with Fox News, said preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons matters to U.S. security and prosperity. Trump is weighing whether the U.S. should join Israel in striking Iran to cripple its nuclear program and prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. "President Trump doesn't often get a political softball sent his way. His decision to support Israel's attacks on the Islamic Republic of Iran and the prospective decision to deal a limited but decisive blow to Iran's nuclear ambitions by striking the Fordow facility can prove to be political mana from heaven," veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance said. Lesperance, president of New England College, noted that "If the President makes the case clearly and firmly to the American people, polling data suggests he would enjoy support from his own party, Democrats and Independents. What's more, Trump's decision and subsequent action would crowd out any of the issues or coverage like immigration, the budget, or tariffs in the near term. Politically, a decision to act against Iran is smart politics." Fox News' Dana Blanton and Victoria Balara contributed to this report.

Six B-2 stealth bombers from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri appear to be en route to a U.S. Air Force base in Guam, U.S. officials confirmed to Fox News. The bombers apparently refueled after launching from Missouri, suggesting they launched without full fuel tanks due to a heavy onboard payload, which could be bunker-buster bombs. Experts say the bombs could be critical to targeting Iran's most heavily fortified nuclear site: Fordow. According to Jonathan Ruhe, Director of Foreign Policy for JINSA, the bunker-busters are designed to use the force of gravity to "penetrate through any mixture of earth, rock, and concrete before the bomb itself then explodes" underground. U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber (C) is flanked by 4 U.S. Marine Corps F-35 fighters during a flyover of military aircraft down the Hudson River and New York Harbor past York City, and New Jersey, on July 4, 2020. President Donald Trump, who has said he will make a decision on U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, is expected to return to the White House on Saturday afternoon. The president is expected to receive intelligence briefings with the National Security Council on Saturday and Sunday as he considers possible actions against Iran. Recently, the president appeared to publicly disagree with Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, stating she was "wrong" when she testified in March that there is "no evidence" Iran is building a nuclear weapon. Gabbard later responded to the apparent controversy, saying that "the dishonest media is intentionally taking my testimony out of context and spreading fake news as a way to manufacture division." "America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly. President Trump has been clear that can't happen, and I agree," Gabbard added in her post on X. Barricade tape secures the site, where crews work, around a building that was damaged in a drone attack by Iran on Israel, amid the Iran-Israel conflict, in Beit Shean, in the Jordan valley, June 21, 2025. While the U.S. has not taken direct action in the conflict, the State Department on Friday announced sanctions on Tehran despite Secretary of State Marco Rubio initially putting distance between Jerusalem and Iran. The sanctions were imposed on eight entities and one individual "for their involvement in the procurement and shipment of proliferation-sensitive machinery from China for Iran's defense industry." The Pentagon did not respond to FOX News' request for comment. Lucas Y. Tomlinson serves as a correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC) based in Washington, DC.

A pedestrian walks past a banner celebrating the 5th Anniversary of the implementation of Hong Kong National Security Law in Hong Kong, Saturday, June 21, 2025. Zhou Ji, director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, from left, John Lee, Hong Kong Chief Executive, and Xia Baolong, director of Hong Kong & Macao Affairs Office, attend the 5th anniversary of Hong Kong National Security Law Forum in Hong Kong, Saturday, June 21, 2025. HONG KONG (AP) — A top Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs on Saturday warned of persisting threats in the city as a China-imposed national security law approaches its fifth anniversary, while seeking to allay concerns about the law's impact on the financial hub's openness. Speaking at a forum about the law, attended also by the city leader John Lee and other officials, Xia Baolong, the director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Work Office, said various forms of soft resistance continue to emerge in new forms and external forces have never ceased their intervention in Hong Kong. “Hong Kong has transformed from chaos to order. But just as a tree desires stillness, the wind continues to blow,” Xia said. Under the law, many leading pro-democracy activists, including Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, were prosecuted. This month, authorities have stepped up their crackdown, including charging young activist Joshua Wong, who was already sentenced last year over a subversion case, under the law for the second time and targeting a mobile game app. Last week, China's national security authorities in Hong Kong and the city's police launched their first publicly known joint operation, raiding the homes of six people on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security. Critics say the political changes indicate that the Western-style civil liberties Beijing promised to keep intact when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 are shrinking. But Xia said the law only targeted an extremely small number of people who severely endanger national security. He also sought to allay concerns about Hong Kong's openness and international position. He insisted that normal international exchanges do not violate Hong Kong's national security law but rather are protected by it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Her name is Jordan – the AI-powered “digital twin” of former British glamor model Katie Price – and people can pay her to act out their “uncensored dreams.” It's like looking at me years ago,” Price, who shot to fame in the late 1990s as a peroxide-blonde tabloid model and Playboy cover star, told CNN. On June 9, she joined the ranks of creators, celebrities and AI-generated avatars to be digitally immortalized by OhChat, an eight-month-old startup that uses artificial intelligence to build lifelike digital doubles of public figures. Its patrons can live out their “spicy fantasies” through these AI avatars, OhChat's Instagram page states. It goes a step further than platforms such as OnlyFans, where users pay to gain access to adult content from content creators. It also comes amid growing ethical concerns around AI – from its role in how people earn a living to how they form intimate connections – underscoring questions about whether AI companies are doing enough to ensure the technology isn't being misused. Once activated, the avatars run autonomously, offering “infinite personalized content” for subscribers. Price, like other creators on the platform, receives an 80% cut from the revenue her AI avatar generates, according to Young. “You have literally unlimited passive income without having to do anything again,” Young told CNN. The platform “is an incredibly powerful tool, and tools can be used however the human behind it wants to be used,” he added. “We could use this in a really scary way, but we're using it in a really, I think, good, exciting way.” Since launching OhChat in October 2024, the company has signed 20 creators – including “Baywatch” actress Carmen Electra. “It takes away the opportunity cost of time,” he told CNN. “Just don't touch it at all and receive money into your bank account.” Price's AI avatar is trained to mimic her voice, appearance and mannerisms. Jordan can “sext” users, send voice notes and images, and provide on-demand intimacy at scale – all without Price lifting a finger. Price's avatar is categorized as “level two” out of four on the platform's internal scale, which ranks the intensity and explicitness of their interactions. “Level two” means sexualized chats and topless imagery, but not full nudity or simulated sex acts. Creators contributing to the platform decide which level their avatar will be. Price told CNN that creating a digital version of herself has left her feeling “empowered.” The digital twin offers a round-the-clock connection that even her subscription-based OnlyFans account cannot match, she said. The rise of AI avatars like Jordan invites deeper scrutiny into a new frontier of digital labor and desire – where creators risk being replaced by their own likeness, fans may be vulnerable to forming emotional attachments to simulations, and platforms profit from interactions that feel real but remain one-sided. Sandra Wachter, professor of technology and regulation at the University of Oxford, questioned whether it is “socially beneficial to incentivize and monetize human-computer interaction masquerading as emotional discourse.” Her remarks reflect concerns around emotional dependence on AI companions. While OhChat is for adults, it enters an ecosystem already grappling with the consequences of synthetic intimacy. Elsewhere, social media users have gone viral describing ChatGPT “boyfriends” and emotional bonds with such digital entities designed to mimic human affection. OhChat strikes what Young called a “balance between immersion and transparency,” when asked whether users are informed that they are speaking with AI instead of a real person. OhChat is “clearly not presenting itself as an in-person or real experience,” he said. “It isn't in the users' interest to be reminded overtly that this is all AI, but we're very clear about that upfront and in the entire experience and offering of the platform.” But it's in Young's interests to keep users hooked on the platform with personalities like “Jordan,” even if she isn't real, says Walsh. “These platforms profit from engagement,” he told CNN, “which means the AI is optimized to keep users coming back, spending more time and likely more money.” Éamon Chawke, a partner at the intellectual property law firm Briffa, notes that there are risks for creators' reputations as well, especially for high-profile figures like Price and Electra. “And if their avatar is hacked or hallucinates and says something offensive, reputational harm to the public figure is likely.” Young said OhChat uses safeguards that build on those used by Meta's Facebook – which has struggled to control content on its own platform in the past. Each creator signs an agreement outlining the exact behavioral rules for their digital twin, he said, including the level of sexual content permitted. Avatars can also be revoked or deleted at any time, he added. “I think it just will be the case, with absolute certainty, that every single creator and celebrity will have an AI version of themselves, and we want to be the layer that makes that happen.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

McHugh via AP) Actor Robin Williams takes a break from a make-up session to speak with locals watching the filming of Jumanji on Nov. 15, 1994 in Keene, N.H. (Maureen E. McHugh via AP File) Local extras stampede through Central Square during a looting scene shot during the filming of Jumanji on Nov. 17, 1994 in Keene, N.H. (Maureen E. McHugh via AP File) Madeline Murphy remembers the instructions she was given on the set of “Jumanji” when she was an extra some 30 years ago: “Pretend you're frightened and you're screaming because an elephant's coming after you.” So, that's what she did in the Central Square of Keene, New Hampshire, running back and forth, over and over, on a long day in November 1994. She got a check for $60.47 — and several seconds of screen time. Murphy was one of about 125 extras cast in the classic Robin Williams film, which is marking its 30th anniversary. It's spawned several sequels, including one planned for next year. A featured event is a “Rhino Rumble Road Race” saluting the film's stampede scenes of elephants, rhinos and zebras on Saturday. Veteran location manager Dow Griffith was crisscrossing New England in search of the right spot. He was a bit east of Keene at the time, and someone suggested a shop that was near the square. “I took my cherished cup of double dry cappuccino out to the front porch, took a sip, looked to my left — and by God — there was the place I had been looking for!” he told The Associated Press. “So really, we have coffee to thank for the whole thing.” The fall scenes show a present-day town that had declined. Extras played homeless people and looters, in addition to panicked runners fleeing from the jungle animals. “They were very impressed that I was in the movie,” she said. “They just found me the right lady's suit and right flat shoes, and then the hair is kind of what I suspect did it.” The “Jumanji” crews worked well with the city in getting the permits to transform Central Square into a dilapidated, neglected piece of public property, recalled Patty Little, who recently retired as Keene's clerk. “They brought in old, dead shrubbery and threw it around and made the paint peel on the gazebo,” she said. Items such as parking meters and lilac bushes were removed and a large Civil War-era statue was brought in to cover a fountain. Everything was restored, and fresh flowers were brought in the following spring, she said. Little, whose classic 1961 Ambassador is caught on camera, could see everything happening from her office window. I don't know during those days,” she said. In the movie, he had just been freed from the game that had trapped him as a boy for years. But so hairy!” and “Isn't he freezing dressed like that?” He stayed in character for 15 to 20 minutes, “just bouncing off the walls,” approaching people in the audience and pulling their hats over their eyes. Eventually, he stopped, ending with a solemn “Thank you,” Filiault said. “I am really seeing something cool here,” Filiault remembered thinking. When Williams died by suicide in 2014, people left flowers and photos beneath a painted “Parrish Shoes” wall sign advertising a fictional business left over from “Jumanji.” Former Keene police officer Joe Collins, who was assigned to watch over then-child actors Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce, also died by suicide, last year. “I think Robin would have been impressed with that,” said Murphy, who met Williams and shook his hand.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Diplomacy with Iran can “easily” be started again if US President Donald Trump orders Israel's leadership to stop its strikes on Iran, Majid Farahani, an official with the Iranian presidency told CNN on Friday. “President Trump can easily stop the war by only one telephone (call) to (the) Israelis,” he said, repeating the Iranian position that talks were impossible while Israeli bombs were striking Iran. Farahani said that Iran would not countenance halting nuclear enrichment – which Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes - but added that concessions were possible. French president Emmanuel Macron says "moving towards zero enrichment" should be a priority in European talks with Iran in Geneva. CNN's Becky Anderson speaks to French Foreign Ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine about the diplomatic efforts to stop the Israel-Iran conflict. Related video Iranian FM meets with UK, Germany, France, EU counterparts In recent days, European powers have joined American and Israeli calls for a ban on enrichment, hardening their positions on the key issue, with France putting forward “a clear position on zero enrichment,” France's foreign ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine told CNN Friday. Iran says it needs enriched uranium for peaceful purposes, while also manufacturing large quantities of near-weapons-grade material. After days of increasingly aggressive messages from the Trump administration, it has opened the possibility that military action can be averted. “If America gets involved in the war,” Farahani said, “there are so many options and all (of) those options are on the table.” Pro-government protests Friday on the streets of Tehran saw an outpouring of anger at both Israel and the United States. Chants of “death to Israel, death to America” – a staple at such events – rang out, while Iranians spoke of their fury at the bombing campaign. “Trump, you are threatening my leader,” one woman told CNN, “Don't you know that my nation believes death is sweeter than honey?”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Friday granted a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration's efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students. It marks another victory for the Ivy League school as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House. Vice President JD Vance referred to Sen. Alex Padilla as “Jose Padilla,” eight days after the California Democrat was forcefully removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference and handcuffed as he tried to speak about immigration raids. “I guess he decided not to show up because there wasn't a theater. Vice President JD Vance speaks during a visit to the Wilshire Federal Building Friday, June 20, 2025, in Los Angeles. Jose Padilla is the name of a convicted al-Qaida terrorism plotter who was sentenced to two decades in prison. He was arrested in 2002 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport during the tense months after 9/11 and accused of a “dirty bomb” mission. It later emerged through interrogation of other al-Qaida suspects that the “mission” was only a sketchy idea, and those claims never surfaced in the South Florida terrorism case. Responding to the outrage, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk said: “He must have mixed up two people who have broken the law.” The evacuations came Friday as the conflict between Israel and Iran intensifies and growing numbers of American citizens seek information on how to leave those countries. An internal State Department memo obtained by AP said the military flight, the second known to have occurred this week, left Tel Aviv for Sofia, Bulgaria, where some or all of the passengers were to catch a charter flight to Washington. The document also said more than 6,400 U.S. citizens in Israel filled out an online form on Friday alone asking for information about when and if the government would organize evacuation flights. He said his time in the detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, showed him “a different reality about this country that supposedly champions human rights and justice.” “No human is illegal,” Khalil said when asked what message he would like to send the public. “The message is: Justice will prevail, no mater what this administration may try to portray, portraying that immigrants are criminals.” The president and his administration have tried several tactics to block its enrollment of international students, part of an effort to secure policy changes at the private Ivy League college. Courts have stopped some of the government's actions, at least for now, but not all. “This shouldn't have taken three months,” Khalil said, speaking outside the immigration detention center in remote Louisiana following his release. An art installation critical of immigration enforcement stands outside Dodger Stadium on Friday, June 20, 2025, in Los Angeles. “What's happening in Los Angeles has reverberated among thousands upon thousands of people, and we have heard the calls for us to take a leading role on behalf of those affected,” Dodgers president Stan Kasten said. “We believe that by committing resources and taking action, we will continue to support and uplift the communities of Greater Los Angeles.” The Dodgers announced the steps in a five-paragraph statement that was delicately worded to avoid potentially inflammatory political terms and which stopped short of an explicit condemnation of federal policy. Held for over three months while the Trump administration sought to deport him for his role in pro-Palestinian protests, Khalil was released after U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz said it would be “highly, highly unusual” for the government to continue detaining a legal U.S. resident who was unlikely to flee and hadn't been accused of any violence. Speaking at a news conference in Los Angeles, Vice President JD Vance said, “I was hoping Jose Padilla would be here to ask a question.” “I guess he decided not to show up because there wasn't a theater. It was an apparent reference to an altercation eight days earlier in which Padilla, a California Democrat, was forcefully removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference in LA and handcuffed by officers as he tried to speak up about immigration raids. U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., is pushed out of the room as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem holds a news conference regarding the recent protests in Los Angeles on Thursday, June 12, 2025. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Josh Stein vetoed his first bills Friday, blocking for now Republican legislation that would let adults carry concealed handguns without a permit and make state agencies and local sheriffs more active in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Voting so far followed party lines for one of the immigration measures, which in part would direct heads of several state law enforcement agencies, like the State Highway Patrol and State Bureau of Investigation, to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But one House Democrat ended up voting for the other immigration bill that Stein vetoed. It would toughen a 2024 law that required sheriffs to help federal agents seeking criminal defendants. Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for playing a substantial role in easing the conflict — despite Indian authorities disputing that. The nomination came after Trump was asked Friday about the Nobel and said he should be awarded it for a variety of reasons, including his work on India and Pakistan and arranging a treaty he said would be signed on Monday to end hostilities between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. “I should have gotten it four or five times,” the president said. Hours later Gabbard posted on the social media platform X a clip of her testimony in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing where she said that though Iran was not currently constructing a nuclear weapon, its “enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons.” She said in the post that intelligence shows Iran can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months “if they decide to finalize the assembly.” Vice President JD Vance is in Los Angeles to tour federal immigration enforcement operations. In a post on the social platform X, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said Vance should visit victims of the deadly January wildfires while in town and also talk with Trump. Earlier this week the president suggested that his feud with Newsom might influence his consideration of $40 billion in federal wildfire aid for California. “I hope we get that back on track” Newsom said. Trump narrowly lost the 2016 Iowa presidential caucuses to Ted Cruz but overwhelmingly defeated Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley in 2024. Bishop Micheal Pham, center, leads an inter-faith group as they enter a federal building to be present during immigration hearings, Friday, June 20, 2025, in San Diego. About a dozen religious leaders paid the visit Friday to serve as witnesses to “what goes down” as some cases arising from the Trump administration's migration crackdown are heard, an organizer said. Some migrants have been arrested at the court by federal immigration officers. “Our goal is not trying to prevent arrests — but we can witness it.” The visit was preceded by a Mass at San Diego's Catholic Cathedral with bishops and other clergy — including Bishop Michael Pham, the top-ranking official in the group and one of the first bishops appointed by Pope Leo XIV — offering prayers for refugees and migrants on World Refugee Day. The bureau was designed as a way to better protect Americans from financial fraud but has been opposed by many GOP lawmakers since its inception. The Trump administration has targeted it as an example of government over-regulation and overreach. Coming to court this week, Erin Smith wanted to prove that a man assaulted her husband during the attack on Jan. 6, 2021, and ultimately was responsible for his suicide nine days later. On Friday an eight-member jury held a 69-year-old chiropractor, David Walls-Kaufman, liable for assaulting Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith. The panel will hear more testimony before deciding whether to award Erin Smith any monetary damages. But the judge presiding over the civil trial dismissed her wrongful-death claim before jurors began deliberating, saying no reasonable juror could conclude that Walls-Kaufman's actions were capable of causing a traumatic brain injury leading to Smith's death. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes divided the trial into two stages: one on the merits of Smith's claims and another on damages. Levinson disappeared March 9, 2007, when he was scheduled to meet a source on the Iranian island of Kish. For years U.S. officials would say only that he was working independently on a private investigation. But a 2013 Associated Press investigation revealed that he had been sent on a mission by CIA analysts who had no authority to run such an operation. The family said then that it did not know when or if his body would be returned but vowed that those responsible would face justice. “We want to make sure that our dad is not forgotten,” son Daniel Levinson told AP on Friday. The president is again suggesting that he doesn't want his hard-line immigration policies to hurt American farmers — seemingly flip-flopping anew on the issue. The Department of Homeland Security said this week that immigration raids at farms hotels and restaurants would continue despite Trump suggesting that longtime employees in such jobs were difficult to replace. On Friday he again suggested that exemptions might be made for agricultural workers. The president defended getting “the criminals out of our country” but said that in cases of “good, reputable farmers, they can take responsibility for the people they hire” and “you can't put farms out of business.” “We don't want to hurt people that aren't criminals,” Trump said, adding, “I never want to hurt our farmers are great people. A copy of the Ten Commandments is posted along with other historical documents in a hallway at the Georgia State Capitol Building Thursday, June 20, 2024, in Atlanta. Friday's ruling is a major win for civil liberties groups who say the mandate violates the separation of church and state and that the poster-size displays would isolate students — especially those who are not Christian. The mandate has been touted by Republicans including Trump and is one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms. Circuit Court of Appeals' order stems from a lawsuit filed last year by parents of Louisiana students from various religious backgrounds who said the law violates First Amendment language guaranteeing religious liberty and forbidding government establishment of religion. The mandate was signed into law last June by Republican Gov. An appeals court is set to hear the case in late July. FILE - The Voice of America building is pictured in Washington, May 5, 2025. The notices were sent Friday to 639 employees of Voice of America and the U.S. agency that oversees it, effectively shutting down an outlet that has provided news to countries around the world since World War II. They included employees at VOA's Persian-language service who were suddenly called off administrative leave last week to broadcast reports to Iran following Israel's attack. Three journalists working for the Persian service Friday who left their office for a cigarette break had their badges confiscated and were not allowed back in, according to one fired employee. In total some 1,400 people at Voice of America and the U.S. Agency for Global Media, or 85% of its workforce, have lost their jobs since March, said Kari Lake, Trump's senior advisor to the agency. FILE - Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, left, joined by CIA Director John Ratcliffe, testifies as the House Intelligence Committee holds a hearing on worldwide threats, at the Capitol, in Washington, March 26, 2025. Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, told lawmakers in March that U.S. spy agencies believed that Iran hadn't made a decision to build a nuclear weapon. Speaking to reporters after touching down in New Jersey, Trump was asked about that assessment and responded, “Then my intelligence community was wrong.” When told it was Gabbard who had said that he responded, “She's wrong.” Members of the NATO alliance will meet next week with hopes of finalizing a pledge for all countries to pledge to spend more on defense. The NATO pledge would entail all members spending 5% of their gross domestic product on defense. “We've been supporting NATO so long,” he told reporters. “They were either good negotiators or they weren't doing the right thing,” Trump told reporters in northern New Jersey, where he is spending part of the weekend. I just don't know why they'd need that for civilian purposes,” Trump told reporters after landing in New Jersey on Friday, when asked about Iran developing nuclear capabilities for use to generate power and other civilian pursuits. “It's a little bit hard to see why you'd need that.” U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer put off any more rulings Friday. Instead, he asked for briefings from both sides on whether the Posse Comitatus Act is being violated. That act prohibits troops from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil. Friday's preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs preserves the ability of Harvard University to host international students while the case is decided. It marks another victory for the Ivy League school as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House. The exact conversation couldn't be heard, but Trump spoke to a crew of workers for several minutes. Trump also had two towering flagpoles erected outside the White House. Protesters stand off against California National Guard soldiers at the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles during a “No Kings” protest on Saturday, June 14, 2025. Friday's hearing in San Francisco comes after an appeals court handed Trump a key procedural win. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said that for now, Trump can keep control of the California National Guard troops he deployed in response to protests over immigration raids. Despite the appellate setback, California's attorneys are expected to ask a judge Friday for a preliminary injunction returning control of the troops in Los Angeles, where protests have calmed down in recent days. Lawyers for the Palestinian activist had asked a federal judge to immediately release him on bail from a Louisiana jail, or else transfer him to New Jersey, where he can be closer to his wife and newborn son. The judge previously determined that Khalil couldn't continue being held based on the U.S. secretary of state's determination that he could harm American foreign policy. It said that while presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's guard, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for doing so, citing violent acts by protesters. “The federal government's interest in preventing incidents like these is significant.” “This is something that really matters,” says Jacobson, “it's so wrong against the constitution [to take away birthright citizenship].” (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The justices released six opinions on Friday on everything from California emission standards to a lawsuit filed by victims of terrorism attacks. That leaves 10 cases still to decide, including Trump's executive order denying birthright citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who are in the country illegally. These nationwide court orders have emerged as an important check on Trump's efforts and a source of mounting frustration to the Republican president and his allies. ▶ Read more about what's left for the Supreme Court this term California National Guard and Marines hold back demonstrators at the Federal Building during a protest Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Los Angeles. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded that Trump can likely show that he lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the California National Guard — and that even if the federal government failed to notify the governor of California in advance as required by law, Newsom had no power to veto the president's order. Trump celebrated the decision on his Truth Social platform, calling it a “BIG WIN.” He wrote that “all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done.” Vance's office did not release a topic of discussion for his visit. The state sued for a temporary injunction to stop the deployment, but a federal appeals court ruled in Trump's favor Thursday night while that legal challenge continues. The evidence is MASSIVE,” Trump posted Friday on his social media site. This cannot be allowed to happen again in the United States of America! Trump has for years claimed, without evidence, that Democrat Joe Biden only won the 2020 election because of widespread voter fraud. Evidence presented in courts showed this didn't happen — judges, including some appointed by Trump, rejected nearly every claim of widespread fraud as false or frivolous. A special prosecutor in Biden's Justice Department investigated Trump's efforts to undermine the 2020 election, but that probe ended when Trump won back the White House in 2024. Treasury yields also edged higher in the bond market after Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the U.S. military will get directly involved in Israel's fighting with Iran. Oil prices have been gyrating as fears rise and ebb that war could disrupt the global flow of crude. “The stock market's risk premium isn't just rising — it's recalibrating for a world where every macro lever now doubles as a tripwire,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management wrote in a commentary, adding that traders are bracing for what comes next. Trump's tariffs agenda may have been eclipsed by the conflict in the Middle East, but it remains another major factor weighing on markets, Innes said: “A delayed fuse is still a fuse.” Trump on Thursday signed an executive order to keep TikTok running in the U.S. for an additional 90 days, giving his administration more time to broker a deal that would bring the social media platform under American ownership. The first extension was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban — approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court — took effect. The second was in April when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump's tariff announcement. It is not clear how many times Trump can — or will — keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far there have been no legal challenges to fight them. We'll answer a few each day during our live coverage.</p>

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — California's challenge of the Trump administration's military deployment in Los Angeles returned to a federal courtroom in San Francisco on Friday for a brief hearing after an appeals court handed President Donald Trump a key procedural win. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer put off issuing any additional rulings and instead asked for briefings from both sides by noon Monday on whether the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits troops from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil, is being violated in Los Angeles. Gavin Newsom said in his complaint that “violation of the Posse Comitatus Act is imminent, if not already underway” but Breyer last week postponed considering that allegation. Vice President JD Vance, a Marine veteran, traveled to Los Angeles on Friday and met with troops, including U.S. Marines who have been deployed to protect federal buildings. According to Vance, the court determined Trump's determination to send in federal troops “was legitimate” and he will do it again if necessary. “The president has a very simple proposal to everybody in every city, every community, every town whether big or small, if you enforce your own laws and if you protect federal law enforcement, we're not going to send in the National Guard because it's unnecessary,” Vance told journalists after touring a federal complex in Los Angeles. Tens of thousands have also marched peacefully in Los Angeles since June 8. National Guard troops have been accompanying federal agents on some immigration raids, and Marines briefly detained a man on the first day they deployed to protect a federal building. California has sought a preliminary injunction giving Newsom back control of the troops in Los Angeles, where protests have calmed down in recent days. Trump, a Republican, argued that the troops have been necessary to restore order. Newsom, a Democrat, said their presence on the streets of a U.S. city inflamed tensions, usurped local authority and wasted resources. The demonstrations appear to be winding down, although dozens of protesters showed up Thursday at Dodger Stadium, where a group of federal agents gathered at a parking lot with their faces covered, traveling in SUVs and cargo vans. The Los Angeles Dodgers organization asked them to leave, and they did. On Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass lifted a downtown curfew that was first imposed in response to vandalism and clashes with police after crowds gathered in opposition to agents taking migrants into detention. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under an authority known as Title 10. Breyer found that Trump had overstepped his legal authority, which he said allows presidents to control state National Guard troops only during times of “rebellion or danger of a rebellion.” “The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of ‘rebellion,' ” wrote Breyer, a Watergate prosecutor who was appointed by President Bill Clinton and is the brother of retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. The appellate panel ruled otherwise, saying presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's guard, but the panel said that by citing violent acts by protesters in this case, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for federalizing the troops. It is the first deployment by a president of a state National Guard without the governor's permission since troops were sent to protect Civil Rights Movement marchers in 1965. Trump celebrated the appellate ruling in a social media post, calling it a “BIG WIN” and hinting at more potential deployments. Newsom, for his part, has also warned that California won't be the last state to see troops in the streets if Trump gets his way.</p>
