                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police say Arturo Gamboa was carrying a rifle when safety volunteer fired on him and accidentally killed bystander Local district attorney Sim Gill's office said on Friday that it was unable to make a decision on charges against Arturo Gamboa after the 14 June shooting that killed demonstrator Arthur Folasa Ah Loo – but that the investigation into the slaying continues. The volunteer has not been publicly identified as investigators work to determine who was at fault. Judge James Blanch said in the release order that Gamboa must live with his father and is forbidden from possessing firearms. The conditions terminate after two months or if criminal charges against him are pursued, Blanch wrote. Gamboa's attorney, Greg Skordas, did not immediately respond to a telephone message left for him seeking comment. He fled but was arrested nearby, accused of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo's death. Salt Lake City police said in a statement the next day that Gamboa “knowingly engaged in conduct … that ultimately caused the death of an innocent community member”. But three days after Gamboa was booked into jail, with no formal charges filed, police acknowledged that the circumstances surrounding the shooting remained uncertain. They issued a public appeal for any video footage related to the shooting or Gamboa and said detectives were still trying “to piece together exactly what happened”. The volunteer who confronted Gamboa was described by event organizers as a military veteran whose role as a safety volunteer was to maintain order. Experts say it's extremely rare for such individuals, often called safety marshals, to be armed. Protest organizers have not said whether or how the safety volunteer who shot Ah Loo was trained or explained why he was armed. It was one of hundreds nationwide against Donald Trump's military parade in Washington, which marked the US army's 250th anniversary and coincided with the president's birthday.</p>

Please make this work possible with a quick donation. Leaving an immigration detention center in Jena, Louisiana, after being imprisoned for 104 days for protesting Israel's U.S.-backed bombardment of Gaza, former Columbia University organizer Mahmoud Khalil said Friday evening that he will continue fighting against the Trump administration's targeting of him and immigrants across the country. “They chose the wrong person for this,” said Khalil outside the facility where he'd been detained since being abducted by immigration agents outside his New York City apartment in March. Khalil told reporters his top priority as he was released was being reunited with his wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, and their two-month-old son, whom he was able to meet only briefly after a judge ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials to allow the family to attend a meeting together with Khalil's legal team in May. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. “Now I can actually hug him and Noor, my wife, without looking at the clock,” said Khalil. Mahmoud Khalil is finally free 104 days after being abducted by ICE from his home in New York. “The Trump administration is doing their best to dehumanize everyone here. “Justice will prevail no matter what this administration may try to portray.” The administration acknowledged after Khalil was detained that he was not accused of a crime, but of being a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests because he helped lead protests and negotiations with Columbia administrators, calling on the university to divest from companies that benefit from Israel's assault on Gaza. Officials have also accused Khalil of lying about his background on his immigration paperwork — failing to disclose his work with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which aids Palestinians in Gaza, and with a British government agency after 2022. Federal judges have ordered the release of several student protesters in recent weeks. Farbiarz previously ruled that Khalil could not be detained or deported under the Immigration and Nationality Act — rejecting immigration Judge Jamee Comans' ruling that the deportation effort could proceed. After Khalil's release, the administration said it would appeal Farbiarz's ruling, with Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin saying that on Friday Comans had denied Khalil asylum and a bail hearing in her court. “On the same day an immigration judge denied Khalil bond and ordered him removed, one rogue district judge ordered him released,” McLaughlin said. “Once you cross literally that door, you see the opposite side of what is actually happening in this country under the eyes of everyone.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An ancient ethical maxim, traditionally ascribed to Chilon of Sparta — one of the illustrious Seven Sages of Greece — and transmitted through the revered writings of Diogenes Laërtius, counsels that no reproach be cast upon the departed, enjoining a solemn silence where calumny might otherwise find voice. This august injunction was enshrined for posterity in the hallowed Latin adage: De mortuis nil nisi bonum dicendum est — “Of the deceased, naught but good is to be pronounced.” On the contrary — within the noble pursuit of leadership inquiry, it is not only appropriate but essential to cast an unflinching gaze upon the darker contours and missteps of those once revered. Such clear-eyed scrutiny is not to be mistaken for condemnation but must be understood as an exercise in principled discernment: a means of lifting the veil, exposing the insidious patterns which — far from being modern aberrations — have emerged, reappeared, and entrenched themselves down the annals of human history. Echoing through time, Ecclesiastes' memento rings clear: “There is nothing new under the sun.” One such enduring pattern resides in the very act of writing history. Likewise, particularly within the spheres of religion and ideology, the full gestalt and profound richness of traditional teachings are seldom faithfully conveyed in their entirety. The late Pope Francis, though hailed by many as an inclusive reformer, did not escape the perils of selective moral emphasis and partial judgment. Conspicuously, in his earthly ministry, he sought to embody the mercy of Christ, but his actions betrayed a troubling incompleteness and imbalance. A critical yet fair evaluation of his papacy reveals deficiencies that extend well beyond superficial and incidental missteps and need to be juxtaposed with his strengths. This kind of vigilant examination assumes greater urgency beneath the prevailing progressive refrain of self-appointed narrative shapers, tastemaker, and gatekeepers who tirelessly exalt his supposed abundance of virtues — often echoed uncritically with near-liturgical zeal by an enthused and ecstatic throng within both popular and ecclesial discourse. Many erudite and discerning minds falter in reconciling this fervent dithyramb — one that smothers sober reflection and muffles measured dissent — with the ledger of history, a dissonance so strident that it warrants a reassessment, both searching and unsparing, in light of mounting countervailing evidence and truths long eclipsed. The initial focus here centers on the pope's foremost failing: to appease sin by diverting attention from repentance and redemption — favoring synods over spiritual surgery, and dialogue over doctrine. Metaphorically, the shepherd's relinquishment of his crook, substituting conviction with compromise, bespeaks, as critics may assert, a grievous dereliction: not merely a forfeiture of authority, but a profound breach of the Holy Father's solemn duty to cleanse his flock — not merely a failure of governance, but a profound betrayal of the Church's prophetic and pastoral mandate. Narrated with exquisite economy — wherein, as in the grand drama of salvation, no detail is superfluous — it reaches its consummate fulfillment in a redemptive nostos (homecoming). Though he envisioned the Church as a field hospital in the aftermath of battle, he surrendered his vital post and sacred duty as surgeon general, dispensing comfort without cure. He failed to consistently lay bare and confront the abhorrent nature and existential threat of sin and to insist on repentance as the thorned but ineluctable path to the mystery of redemption. Called to be the Church's chief healer of souls, Pope Francis ought to have discerned that a physician does not aid the gravely afflicted by neglecting to diagnose the condition — be it bodily, mental, or spiritual — nor by concealing its severity. The prodigal son, in the unfolding parsimonious trajectory of the eponymous Gospel parable, willfully sunders communion with his father — himself a figura Dei, an allegorical referent of God — by boldly and brashly demanding his inheritance ante mortem, as though preempting paternal death itself. In this hubristic move, he enacts a symbolic patricide, pronouncing his progenitor dead in his own heart as a precondition for asserting existential autarkeia (autonomy). Mistaking rupture — a symbolic schism without institutional breach — for liberation, the son is ensnared in the illusion that severance constitutes selfhood. In forsaking the sacred demands of pietas — that classical foundational virtue of sacred devotion to both the divine and societal order — the son precipitates not mere geographical estrangement, but an abyssal spiritual fall — a dark, self-imposed exile and willful banishment from the grace that once sustained him. Unmoored from home, he embarks upon a peregrination of dissipation — at once truly epic and dramatic —squandering the unmerited bounty in a far-off land, and in true katabasis echoing the somber depths of classical Attic tragedy descends into spiritual and material destitution. In that critical juncture of spiritual awakening, he steels his heart and vows to mend what was broken: With resolute heart and solemn intent, he turns his weary steps toward the hearth of home. Though compelled initially by fleshly urge rather than lofty virtue, his contrite confession in this pivotal soteriological and eschatological moment bears witness to genuine repentance. Overwhelmed by compassion, the earthly sire bursts forth in a swift sprint to embrace and kiss his returning offspring — seemingly unable to wait even a moment longer for the restoration of his beloved one. This climactic consummation — God's final, life-bestowing word to the contrite soul yearning for home — eschews retribution in favor of redemption in a divine reunion with what is truly essential: the paternal embracing of the penitent son, who still bears the vestiges of abject poverty wrought by sin — all fully and faithfully canonized in sacred oil by Rembrandt. In a parallel vein, the oft-told Johannine narrative of the woman caught in adultery (John 8:1-11) — the iconic confrontation between law and mercy — depicts Jesus as literally disarming the incensed crowd with a piercing challenge: “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her” (John 8:7, KJV). This laconic yet succinct command reveals mercy as but a prelude to profound personal and redemptive transformation in harmony with God's sacred design, not a carte blanche to persist in licentiousness. Consequently, this pivotal moment — etched indelibly into the Gospel narrative — may be regarded as the true climax and crowning point of the episode, transcending and shining forth beyond even Christ's terse rebuke of hypocritical judgment: a critical oversight by the progressive faction, which, in a self-serving manner that engenders interpretative bias, dwells exclusively on the suspension of both judgment and condemnation while minimizing, or altogether neglecting, the gravity of sin. Cast your gaze once more upon those hauntingly poignant gospel scenes, rich in both sacred and secular resonance. Jesus, the rabbi par excellence, functions not as a facilitator of value-neutral, error-prone democratic discourse, but as prophet, priest and king — an infallible divine pedagogue whose authority derives from true and unassailable heavenly commission. He speaks not as a broker of compromise but as the Logos incarnate, whose majesty admits neither confusion nor contradiction. He does not offer terms but absolute, unambiguous and eternal truth — impervious to dissent. For a true herdsman does not linger and trail behind his sheep; he goes before them as sure-footed guide. Left to their own devices, sheep scatter, stumble, and are lost. A shepherd who surrenders his sacred charge to the caprice of the flock is not merely unfaithful or negligent; his dereliction surpasses administrative deficiency and rises to the level of moral collapse. In abdicating his duty, he becomes not a guardian but a hazard — an agent of peril, rightly subject to removal. The ramifications for ecclesial ministry are nothing short of dire. The priest, as alter Christus — a living icon cast in His likeness — participates in this divine pastoral mandate, not as a hireling, but as one called to lead, guard, and lay down his life for the sheep. Just as a true shepherd does not confer with his flock, soliciting its counsel on the path to green pastures, so too the spiritual tender of the fold is tasked with guiding, not yielding. Such definite and resolute divine authoritarianism and heteronomy — externally imposed norms which, in this particular instance, nonetheless resonate with the natural law engraved upon the human heart — stands in marked contrast to Pope Francis' emphasis on what I term pastoral synodality. The Bishop of Rome's increasing deference to democratic modalities within ecclesial governance risks fostering a theologically erroneous and pastorally perilous impression. It may suggest that the Ecclesia is to be shaped in an adaptive manner by the transient values and shifting norms prevailing in secular society. This stands in glaring and haunting contrast to the Church's true vocation as a transcendent spiritual and moral authority, prophetically calling the world to repentance and conformity to the divine will. Succinctly put, the Church is to stand as mater et magistra — Mother and Teacher — not a mirror to the age, but its corrective lodestar. Historically, such a treacherous trajectory has borne spiritually and politically deleterious fruit. The Protestant endemic susceptibility to ideological capture was starkly revealed with apocalyptic effect when völkisch nationalism — arguably irreconcilable with the universalism of Christianity — spread like wildfire across Europe. It remains a little-known yet well-documented fact that during the ascent of National Socialism, Protestant communities in Germany — frequently aligned with the political, social and cultural mainstream — were markedly more inclined than their Catholic counterparts to embrace Adolf Hitler, his creed, and his cause. routinely garnering over 60% of the vote — its electoral traction proved markedly weaker in Catholic strongholds, where its popular support rarely rose above 20 to 30 percent at the polls. Its aim was nothing less than the institutionalization of “Positive Christianity” — that vague, pliable creed enshrined in the party program — within the official Protestant churches of Germany, which were to be recast as racially purified vessels of an Aryan faith. The Protestant pursuit of ideological conformity — where fads trump facts, and meek docility slips into outright complicity — lays bare the hazardous repercussions of forsaking theological orthodoxy and moral constancy in favor of cultural assimilation. One unprecedented papal experiment in collegial governance and ecclesial deliberation — evocative of Protestant practices — stands out as a landmark embodiment of the piercing maxim, Scalpel shelved, sinners spared. On 7 March 2020, Pope Francis formally convoked the Synod on Synodality — a visionary initiative conceived to reimagine the Catholic Church as a more participatory, inclusive, and mission-oriented communion, animated by the guiding principle of “journeying together.” This ecclesial initiative endeavored to engage the entire People of God in far-reaching discernment concerning the Church's mission and its unfolding destiny. It aspired to transcend the traditional confines of hierarchical decision-making in favor of cultivating a more participatory and inclusive ecclesial ethos. The multi-year process unfolded in carefully delineated phases, ascending from the grassroots upward: commencing with local consultations at the parish and diocesan levels, it advanced through national and continental assemblies, ultimately culminating in a convocation of bishops and ecclesial delegates in Rome. Framed in the aspirational rhetoric of structured dialogue and shared responsibility, the methodical schema encompassed parish assemblies, diocesan surveys, and global listening sessions — each designed to draw forth input from every stratum of the Church. The Synod's vast scope and lofty aspirations reflected Pope Francis's vision of a Church that listens with attentiveness and walks in communion. Yet as the process unfolded, it gave rise to profound and still-unsettled questions touching the very nature of reform — penetrating inquiries that transcend superficial considerations of formal and stylistic veneers and modalities, implicating substantial matters central to the foundational pillars of magisterial authority, ecclesial unity, and the integral coherence of doctrine. Central to the operational-procedural critique of this synod resides the observation that, over time, it appreciably assumed the semblance of a meticulously choreographed ecclesial outreach campaign — a theatrical pageant, some may deem a charade, marked by consultation bereft of true compass. More often than not, it bore the hallmarks of a managed descent from theological abstraction to pastoral anecdote, all under the guise of inclusivity. Particular solicitude was granted to those styled as “marginalized voices,” whose indeterminate status only heightened the process's ambient vagueness. Perspicacious and judicious detractors might espy therein a curious spectacle: a hierarchy of herdsmen consulting the flock not for veritas (truth), but for vibes — a dynamic tension evident in some tenderly phrased and gently meandering yet pastorally skewed lines of inquiry. For instance, the wise in spirit may find illustrative sample questions — such as “What experiences of Church life bring you joy?” — bathetic in their earnest and reductionist simplicity, casting a faintly sentimental hue over a process ostensibly aimed at serious and momentous structural reform. At a higher, strategic level, unity through division seems to have become the Church's disquieting new logic and latest innovation — epitomized by the tautologically termed ecclesial consultation process. Most pointedly, the papal venture dilutes the bishops' magisterial role by dispersing responsibility through decentralized, quasi-democratic lay-driven processes, often buoyed by ersatz spirituality. Principally, it jeopardizes doctrinal integrity and clarity, fostering corrosive relativism by supplanting immutable divine truths with ephemeral secular opinions. To revisit Pope Francis' guiding metaphor of a field hospital is to witness a perplexing paradox: the papal surgeon general appears to have stepped away from the operating table of his faltering ecclesial infirmary, abundant in compassion yet deficient in cure, leaving the wounded to wait and bleed without the blade — untended by the very hand ordained to minister restoration. It is fitting to acknowledge that the Vicar of Christ may arguably have exercised wise and prudent pastoral caution and discretion in eschewing the heavy and blunt sledgehammer of harsh public censure against sinners exiled to the moral edges of society. Yet in his overwrought, some might say affected, gentleness, he let fall into disuse, of all things, the very scalpel entrusted to him — both archetype and apex of his vocation — that precise, exacting and incisive implement of definitive, primal and pure truth, whose keen edge wounds not to harm, but to heal. Over the arc of this insidious crusade, Pope Francis's emphasis on inclusion seeded instability, while the rhetoric of empowerment, at length, ushered in tangible upheaval and uncertainty. The unvarnished gravity of this trajectory grows ever more apparent under closer scrutiny, inasmuch as what once passed for a mere reform of ecclesiastical governance upon reflection unveils its true countenance, its full dimension, and its far graver stakes: far from constituting a solely surface-level administrative adjustment, the synodal offensive has been quietly and deftly interwoven with the threads of a Vatican-style color revolution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This item has been expanded with additional details. Belarusian opposition leader and political prisoner Siarhei Tsikhanouski was released on June 21, shortly after dictator Alexander Lukashenko met in Minsk with U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg. Tsikhanouski , a popular blogger who planned to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, was arrested shortly before the vote and later sentenced to 18 years in prison on politically motivated charges. His wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, stepped in and became the main opposition candidate against Lukashenko. At least 13 political detainees, including prominent blogger Ihar Losik, were also released on June 21, Belarusian independent outlet Nasha Niva reported. In a post on social media, Tsikhanouskaya welcomed the news but highlighted that "1,150 political prisoners remain behind bars." It's hard to describe the joy in my heart.Thank you, 🇺🇸 @POTUS, @SPE_Kellogg, @JohnPCoale, DAS Christopher W. Smith, @StateDept & our 🇪🇺 allies, for all your efforts.We're not done. Kellogg's deputy, John Coale, said the released political prisoners had been transferred to Vilnius and expressed gratitude to the Lithuanian government for facilitating their relocation. "President Trump's strong leadership led to the release of 14 prisoners from Belarus today. At least seven demonstrators were killed during the protests. Minsk has faced repeated Western sanctions since the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests. Lukashenko, in power since 1994, is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has allowed Russia to use Belarusian territory for military operations against Ukraine. "You have caused quite a stir in the world with your arrival," Lukashenko told Kellogg during their meeting at the Palace of Independence, according to state-run outlet Belta. Can't we have a normal dialogue and talk about our affairs – about relations between Belarus and the United States of America?" Kellogg is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Belarus in recent years, following former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's 2020 trip under Trump's first term. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Lukashenko's regime has played a key logistical role in supporting Moscow's campaign, offering its territory for troop deployments and weapons stockpiles.</p>

DUBAI, June 21. /TASS/. The Israel Defense Forces said its fighter jets are currently attacking military infrastructure in southwestern Iran.

According to the Fars news agency, explosions were heard in the city of Ahvaz and the port of Mahshahr. Air defenses are working to eliminate the threat.

Overnight into June 13, Israel started Operation Rising Lion against the Iranian nuclear program. Less than a day later, Iran carried out a retaliatory attack. Over the following days, Israel and Iran traded blows again. Both sides reported fatalities and other casualties in the attacks, acknowledged that some targets on their territory were hit. Mutual strikes are ongoing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Other countries have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients, which allow for more advanced sunscreens Many dermatologists and experts say US sunscreens are still not as effective as many available overseas when it comes to protecting against ultraviolet radiation linked to skin cancer and premature ageing – despite years of research. The concern comes as a brutal heatwave, with a suffocating “heat dome”, is arriving for more than 200 million people across vast swaths of the US this weekend, bringing extreme heat and humidity . Studies have shown that the global climate crisis is making heatwaves more severe, frequent and long lasting. As fierce sun  beats down on parts of the US this weekend, people are urged to try to stay out of the direct sun, stay hydrated and apply lots of sunscreen if outdoors – but people will probably have to rely on sunscreens that are less effective at fending off the ultraviolet rays than sunscreen available in some other countries. While American sunscreens generally do a good job at blocking UVB rays, which cause sunburn, experts and studies have noted in recent years that they often provide weaker protection against ultraviolet radiation in the form of UVA rays, compared to products available in places like Europe and South Korea. A 2017 study found only around half of US sunscreens tested met the European standards for UVA protection. Experts often point out that the FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in more than 20 years. Meanwhile, in countries like France, South Korea, the UK and Japan, governments have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients, which experts say allow for more advanced sunscreens. But, dermatologist Dr Nazanin Saedi told Axios that a decision is not expected before 2026. “So do not delay in stocking up on your sunscreen for this summer!” she said. “In many other countries, sunscreens are regulated differently and may not be required to have the data that FDA, and other experts, consider necessary to fully evaluate the safety of sunscreen ingredients.” “US sunscreens are far behind the rest of the world and our regulations aren't necessarily making our sunscreens better or safer – but it doesn't have to be this way!” Ocasio-Cortez said. Republican senator Mike Lee agreed with the New York representative, and in a post on social media, wrote: “There is no left or right when it comes to UV light.” A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress aims to modernize sunscreen regulations and allow non-animal testing alternatives for regulatory approval.</p>

Please make this work possible with a quick donation. The Supreme Court has intervened repeatedly over the past four months to overturn temporary restraining orders (TROs) issued by lower court judges against an array of reckless edicts from Donald Trump and his agents — including the dictates of his then-resident billionaire, Elon Musk. These interventions have allowed a number of press releases dressed up as executive orders to take effect while the litigation against them proceeds. This is a reversal of the way TROs are supposed to function — to preserve the status quo from irreparable harm while litigation against a new rule or edict is proceeding. In a nutshell, several lower courts have found that plaintiffs suing the Trump administration have proven that they would face irreparable harm if the action were not halted and that they have a substantial likelihood of success under the law, in addition to showing that issuing an injunction or restraining order is in the public interest. While lower courts have made such detailed findings, the Republican-appointed judges on the Roberts Court have set several of them aside. This Supreme Court majority was made possible by Leonard Leo, the unelected right-wing operative Trump delegated judicial selection to during his first term. Together, those three along with three other men Leo helped get confirmed to the Supreme Court — John Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas — have been on a binge of reversing legal precedents, accomplishing Leo's long-term agenda and the Republican Party's goal of overturning Roe v. Wade. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Trump is upset that in the lower courts his administration has lost 96 percent of the time so far, according to one analysis. In reality it is the law that is biased against actions that defy the web of statutes, regulations, rules, contracts, and case law that have long been part of our legal system. Trump, upset that he cannot just act like a king and defy the law at his whim, attacked Leo for not choosing judges who would put loyalty to him above the Constitution. However, Trump is far from done doing Leo's bidding. One of Leo's first jobs with the Federalist Society was at a program called “ABA Watch,” set up in 1996 to critique the association. The ABA had given Leo's buddy, Clarence Thomas, a partial “Not Qualified” rating when he was nominated to the Supreme Court, an evaluation that came well before Anita Hill's damning testimony that Thomas had engaged in sexual harassment, testimony he hotly denied. That ABA rating was appeared to be based in part on the fact that Thomas had never argued a case before the Supreme Court, had only briefly worked as a judge, and his primary work in the past decade had not been as a litigator in federal or state courts. After Thomas was confirmed despite the controversy surrounding his nomination, Leo reportedly became the Federalist Society's first full-time employee since it was launched with the aid of Antonin Scalia and Robert Bork back in 1982 as a student group building a pipeline to power for “conservative and libertarian” lawyers. Leo's ABA Watch assailed the bar and its role in evaluating judicial nominees while Bill Clinton was president. Then, in 2001, after George W. Bush became president, Leo and his cohorts in the Senate seemingly succeeded in getting the ABA out of the role it had for many years of evaluating judicial candidates before they were nominated — rating their experience and reputation before the bar. That 30-day prenomination evaluation process, which I was a liaison to when I worked on judicial nominations in the Clinton administration, weeded out judicial candidates whom the ABA advised would get a “Not Qualified” (NQ) or partially NQ rating, if they were nominated, because of their lack of experience, poor temperament, or bias. In that administration, we considered the ABA to be an important part of the merit evaluation of candidates for judgeships who were recommended by Democratic and Republican senators and members of Congress, to help ensure they had good reputations and not just good connections. In 2001, instead of the ABA screening judicial candidates before they were nominated, Leo and the Federalist Society began screening George W. Bush's potential judicial candidates for their ties to the group and alignment. Meanwhile, in the early 2000s, Leo also began targeting state merit selection systems for destruction, as Evan Vorpahl and I documented last year in a special report and previously. Why would he want anyone other than himself screening people in or out of the bench based on their alignment with his agenda for the law? Fast forward to 2016 and, as Trump White House Counsel Don McGahn later said, the administration “in-sourced” the Federalist Society to choose Trump's slate of judges, some of whom have proven to be independent and willing to defend the rule of law and some of whom (like Aileen Cannon, James Ho, and Matthew Kacsmaryk) have seemingly chosen loyalty or advancing an extreme political agenda over the law. Trump 2.0 seems determined to choose more judges of that ilk, evidenced by Trump's nomination of his criminal defense lawyer Emil Bove and anti-abortion zealot Joshua Divine. In the first Trump term, the ABA continued to give post-nomination ratings and some of Trump's nominees were so unqualified — including some who were essentially just MAGA bloggers — that they received NQ votes even though the Republican-controlled Senate was unlikely to be critical of Trump nominees. That's a win for Leo and a loss for the rest of us — because the U.S. needs fair judges, now more than ever.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A young grizzly bear in Davis Bay near Sechelt, September, 2024. Some time in late May, a young male grizzly made an improbable journey to Texada Island, one of the few rural communities in British Columbia that is considered bear-free. His most likely path involved a challenging but not impossible swim of about five kilometres across the Malaspina Strait from the mainland. The bear who has been dubbed “Tex” is believed to be four years old – a teenager who would have been chased from his home by bigger grizzlies, including his mother. While the Texada Island community is divided between fear of the bear and concern for its welfare, both sides agree that Tex can't stay. But the provincial government doesn't want to move him. She feels like the bear, labelled aggressive by the provincial government, has been set up for conflict that will likely end badly for him. Black bears are found in most non-urban areas of the province, but B.C. They have been listed as extirpated on Vancouver Island and the smaller coastal islands for more than a century. For this youngster, Texada would seem like a haven, without dominant bears around to threaten him. He was first spotted on the island on May 25, and likely swam from Powell River, where he had been seen a week earlier. Conservationists there are building bear dens out of old growth stumps to help bears reclaim habitat that has been damaged by commercial logging. In Kananaskis, a special security challenge: How to keep world leaders safe from grizzlies On Texada Island, however, residents have not learned to live alongside large predators. Texada Elementary's principal announced that because of the bear's presence, the school bus would not drop off students unless there was someone on hand to meet them. “There's no future here for him on Texada Island, because he's targeted, and if he makes a mistake – which may very well happen – he will be instantly destroyed,” said Ms. Glenn-Bittner, who has organized the funds to pay for the bear to be relocated to a remote section of the B.C. The Mamalilikulla have been working on watershed restoration in their ICPA and salmon are starting to return. Ecotour grizzlies less likely to encounter conflict with humans, B.C. The COS knows this bear: Tex was relocated twice last year after he was found wandering near schools and downtown areas in Gibsons and Sechelt. But they didn't move him far enough, and the bear returned to populated areas. Because of that, they say he is not a candidate to be moved again. The COS released a statement saying the bear is displaying aggressive behaviour to both people and livestock, but it does not have plans to either kill or relocate the bear from Texada at this time. Neither Randene Neill, Minister of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship, nor Tamara Davidson, Minister of Environment and Parks, would agree to an interview. The two issued a joint statement saying there is “no ‘kill order' on this bear.” “However, it is also our responsibility to keep people safe and if further behaviour by the grizzly bear occurs that threatens public safety, Conservation Officers will respond to those situations. These are difficult decisions, but again, people's safety is always the top priority. Bear biologist Wayne McCrory, a leading expert on grizzly bear hazard assessments, said Tex's travels are not so unusual: There is increasing evidence of grizzlies returning to the islands. Prematurely born harbour seal called Zeus is rescued on B.C. “It would be an ideal place to attempt another translocation,” he said. “We need to step out of the box of the Conservation Officer Services, and go the extra mile to try and keep these bears alive, instead of leaving them wandering around quite an inhabited island.” Ellie Lamb has spent 28 years as a bear guide, specializing in grizzlies. Populations are declining because they are vulnerable to human disturbance and they suffer unsustainable mortality rates in some parts of the country. Ms. Lamb, who has spent countless hours in the wilderness with grizzlies, believes people have been conditioned to respond with fear because grizzlies are widely misunderstood. People can co-exist with bears, if they understand how. “I've been taught by the bears, and I am just teaching people, that when a bear is in front of them, it doesn't mean that their life flashes before their eyes, but they actually can peacefully move away from the bear and give them space,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A panel of three federal appellate judges has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in each of the state's public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The ruling Friday marked a major win for civil liberties groups who say the mandate violates the separation of church and state, and that the poster-sized displays would isolate students — especially those who are not Christian. The mandate has been touted by Republicans, including President Donald Trump, and marks one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms. “This is a resounding victory for the separation of church and state and public education,” said Heather L. Weaver, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. “With today's ruling, the Fifth Circuit has held Louisiana accountable to a core constitutional promise: Public schools are not Sunday schools, and they must welcome all students, regardless of faith.” Oldest stone tablet inscribed with Bible's Ten Commandments sells for $5 million “All school districts in the state are bound to comply with the US Constitution,” said Liz Hayes, a spokesperson for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which served as co-counsel for the plaintiffs. “Thus, all school districts must abide by this decision and should not post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms.” Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she disagreed and believed the ruling only applied to school districts in the five parishes that were party to the lawsuit. Murrill added that she would appeal the ruling, including taking it to the US Supreme Court if necessary. In a court with more than twice as many Republican-appointed judges, two of the three judges involved in the ruling were appointed by Democratic presidents. The court's ruling stems from a lawsuit filed last year by parents of Louisiana school children from various religious backgrounds, who said the law violates First Amendment language guaranteeing religious liberty and forbidding government establishment of religion. The ruling also backs an order issued last fall by US District Judge John deGravelles, who declared the mandate unconstitutional and ordered state education officials not to enforce it and to notify all local school boards in the state of his decision. Jeff Landry signed the mandate into law last June. Landry said in a statement Friday that he supports the attorney general's plans to appeal. “The Ten Commandments are the foundation of our laws — serving both an educational and historical purpose in our classrooms,” Landry said. Similar laws have been challenged in court. And comparable legislation in Texas currently awaits Gov. And in 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution.</p>

Mr. Zelensky did not meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the summit.TERESA SUAREZ/AFP/Getty Images Hoping to avoid a repeat snub after failing to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the G7 in Kananaskis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he hasn't decided whether he'll attend next week's NATO summit in the Netherlands. Mr. Zelensky has been formally invited to the NATO summit that begins Tuesday in The Hague but hasn't yet confirmed he'll attend. Speaking Friday, Mr. Zelensky said there were several factors that would decide whether he makes the trip – including whether he could secure a “very important” meeting with Mr. Trump. “We need more certainty and more pressure from the world on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin – this is necessary for the sake of diplomacy. I would like to talk about these formats with him,” Mr. Zelensky said late Friday, speaking inside the fortified Presidential Administration complex in Kyiv. “For us, it is a priority to maintain America's support,” he added, saying that having to fight the Russian invasion without U.S. support would be “the most difficult situation” for Ukraine. Ukraine received US$64.6-billion in military assistance from the U.S. under former president Joe Biden following the start of the Russian invasion in February, 2022, but no new weapons shipments since Mr. Trump took office in January. He said his office was in talks with Canada, Britain, Germany, Norway, Denmark and Lithuania to begin joint weapons production. His departure came before an expected meeting with Mr. Zelensky, who said it was evident that “for President Trump, the Israel-Iran issue is certainly a higher priority” than the Russia-Ukraine conflict. One of the things Mr. Trump did do in Kananaskis was lobby for Russia to be restored as a member of what used to be called the G8. At least 28 people were killed in the nine-hour attack.

A year ago, the alliance declared “Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has shattered peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area and gravely undermined global security” and pledged to “bolster our long-term support to Ukraine so it can prevail in its fight for freedom.” “They threw the corpses of their citizens at us. “I consider Russians and Ukrainians to be one people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robert Kubica is a name which engenders strong emotion amongst all motorsport fans. Competing at the Ronde di Andora rally championship, the Pole was left trapped in his car for over an hour after colliding with a metal barrier at high speed. Further operations followed, with Kubica also suffering severe injuries to his right elbow, shoulder and leg. However, this past weekend and more than 14 years later, Kubica completed what is perceived by many to be the greatest motorsport comeback of all time, winning the iconic 24 hours of Le Mans endurance race. In doing so, he became just the second driver this century to win both an F1 grand prix and Le Mans, joining Fernando Alonso. “As an endurance racer, this is the highest goal you can achieve. It is the Olympic Games of motorsport, so I am honoured to have won such an event,” Kubica, who was driving for AF Corse alongside Great Britain's Phil Hanson and China's Yifei Ye, told CNN Sports. “Even people who aren't into racing text(ed) me, which shows the regard Le Mans is held in. I think we can compare it to the biggest events in sport, and certainly motorsport.” “But what they don't see is all the difficult moments and tough times. “After my accident, I had hard weeks, months, even years, where I struggled to adapt and come to terms with what had happened. “There were many moments where I could have cracked,” he said. “But the key for me was that I always had a very strong character. Sometimes before the accident this was probably an obstacle in my life, but during those tough and difficult periods, it certainly helped me.” It is this attitude which Kubica feels helped him so much with his clearly successful transition into the world of endurance racing from F1. Having battled back following his initial rehab and working his way up through the racing circuit, Kubica ultimately managed to reclaim an F1 seat in 2019 for Williams Racing. “The strength of character certainly helped me when joining endurance racing', Kubica said. The 99-race veteran added that the requirement to compete as part of a team unit often proves too much of an obstacle for many F1 drivers looking to enter endurance racing. With races ranging from six to 24 hours long, Kubica has shared the driving responsibilities in AF Corse's Porsche Hypercar this season with Hanson and Ye. “My teammates will probably tell you that I can be a little hard on them sometimes but that just comes from my will to win. We actually all get on really well,” he said. “The biggest thing for me is that I already feel fulfilled as a driver. I have raced in F1 already and don't have that urge to act in my own self-interest to try and impress a manufacturer. Already a national favourite for his exploits in F1, he cemented his legacy as one of the nation's sporting greats by becoming its first Le Mans champion. “I had people coming up to me and telling me how they had no interest in racing at all but that they sat and watched the final moments of the race with family and friends,” Kubica explained. “I even had one woman come up to me and tell me how she burst into tears as I crossed the finish line. It really seems to have been a moment which has gone far beyond sport for not only motorsport fans, but Polish people in general.” But one thing that is for sure is that I will do whatever I would like to do, and not what pays me most money in my pocket or what will bring me the most fame.” He added: “Knowing myself, the next thing will not be easy. It must be a challenge and an adventure for me. “That might be trying to come back and win Le Mans again but we'll see. But for the Pole, as long as that passion for the sport is still burning, he will find it hard to walk away. “My passion has brought me to where I am today. “But in the end, my passion was too great to let that happen and even now, I can still feel it there at the same levels it was at when I first started karting as a small kid.” “I always say we have no control over the future and can just influence what is happening now,” he said. “So for the next few months, I am solely thinking about each race as it comes. But for now, I am focusing on making more of these moments which can last forever'.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has issued layoff notices to over 600 employees of Voice of America (VOA), dramatically reducing the outlet's staff to fewer than 200, the New York Times (NYT) reported on June 20. VOA, launched in 1942 to counter wartime propaganda, has long been a central pillar of U.S. public diplomacy, broadcasting in 49 languages to more than 360 million people worldwide. The dismissals, described as reductions in force, affect both journalists and support staff, who will remain on paid leave until Sept. 1. Since then, programming has been slashed, with broadcasts now limited to just four languages. The decision to dismantle VOA has met legal challenges. On April 22, a U.S. federal judge ordered the administration to reinstate all employees and contractors, ruling that the mass dismissal likely violated U.S. law. However, a federal appeals court overturned that order, allowing the layoffs to proceed. But at least two of those individuals also received layoff notices on June 20, according to the NYT. Trump has repeatedly attacked U.S.-funded media outlets over their coverage, often referring to them as "fake news." His administration has framed the VOA cuts as a cost-saving measure and a response to what it views as politically biased reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump believes a negotiated agreement between Russia and Ukraine is the only viable path to ending the conflict between the two countries, according to State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce. Trump's efforts to mediate a truce between Russia and Ukraine contributed to the countries restarting direct negotiations in Türkiye last month – talks that Kiev abandoned in 2022 to focus on its military efforts. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that while Moscow is not seeking an unconditional surrender, Kiev must acknowledge the “realities on the ground,” and that its negotiating position worsens with each passing day. In a press briefing on Friday, Bruce was asked whether those remarks mean that Moscow is not serious about the talks, and how Washington would respond. That's the whole point of negotiations and conversations: You signal how long you're generally willing to wait, but you also know if someone is serious,” she said, noting, “At the same time, we've heard some very blunt comments by President Trump about President Putin.” That's where we've landed at this point in comments from both the president and secretary of state – that the only way this is going to end is for the two parties to meet and come to a conclusion and a decision, and some kind of an agreement. She added that while the US remains Ukraine's “biggest supporter,” the process of peace negotiations is complex and constantly evolving. “We are clearly making our presence and our care about the situation known... but this is not about reacting to a single quote or online statement,” she said. Only he knows all the elements about what's important and how we're going to make a difference,” she said. “As I term it… there is one guiding hand to the choices that we make.</p>
