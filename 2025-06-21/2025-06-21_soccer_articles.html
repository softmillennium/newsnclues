                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CINCINNATI — Borussia Dortmund was gifted an easy goal to start the match and held off a strong response from the Mamelodi Sundowns on a fiercely warm day to win 4-3 in the Club World Cup group stage on Saturday. Both teams and the crowd of 14,006 at TQL Stadium sweat through high temperatures that forced a heat advisory and cooling breaks, called at the referee's discretion. Dortmund evened the score in the 16th minute when Sundowns goalie Ronwen Williams inadvertently passed to Dortmund's Felix Nmecha right in front of the net. Dortmund stole all momentum on the play and increased its lead to 3-1 at halftime. Khuliso Mudau's own goal on an attempt to deflect Daniel Svensson's cross in front of the net made it 4-1 in the 59th before South African Mamelodi centered itself and began putting pressure on the German club.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Borussia Dortmund held off a spirited comeback from Mamelodi Sundowns to secure a 4-3 victory and move closer to the Club World Cup knockout stages. Dortmund were behind after 11 minutes to the South African champions at the TQL Stadium in Cincinnati but rallied to win their second game in Group F and move top of the standings with four points, one more than Sundowns. Felix Nmecha, Serhou Guirassy and Jobe Bellingham scored for the Bundesliga club, who also profited from an own goal. Lucas Ribeiro had given Sundowns the lead while Iqraam Rayners and Lebo Mothiba scored in the second half as they looked to rally from 4-1 down in blazing hot conditions. Ribeiro burst through a static Dortmund defence, picking up the ball on the halfway line and gliding past two opponents to score a shock opener. But the lead lasted only five minutes before a calamitous error from Sundowns goalkeeper Ronwen Williams, whose short misplaced pass to Nmecha gave him an easy tap-in for the equaliser. Dortmund went ahead after a slick set of one-two passes between Julian Brandt and Guirassy, who powered home with his head. Bellingham, in his second appearance for Dortmund, made it 3-1 on the stroke of half-time as Williams parried Brandt's cross straight at him, and he delayed shooting for a split second before wrong-footing the goalkeeper. Mothiba struck in the 90th minute as Sundowns stole away possession and the substitute scored from close range but they could not find an equaliser.

Many seats are empty as teams warm up before the Club World Cup group F soccer match between Ulsan HD and Mamelodi Sundowns in Orlando, Tuesday, June 17, 2025. Fans wait for the start of the Club World Cup Group D soccer match between Chelsea and Los Angeles FC, Monday, June 16, 2025, in Atlanta. MIAMI (AP) — As kickoff approached it was clear — the fans weren't coming. “It's like playing football during lockdown,” observed one fan on social media. For days, world governing body FIFA didn't register the attendance for the game between Mamelodi Sundowns and Ulsan HD on its official website. It took until Friday for a figure of 3,412 to be acknowledged on the site, but by rough count, there were less than 1000 fans in the stands as the game got underway. The Mamelodi Sundowns and Ulsan HD game stands out as the low point so far for FIFA and its president, Gianni Infantino, who is banking on the Club World Cup becoming one of the most popular and valuable competitions in sport. A group game between largely unheralded teams from South Africa and South Korea was never likely to be a big seller. Still, it was an uncomfortably low turnout and one of three games in the opening week that drew less than 10,000 fans. There were also swathes of empty seats for Chelsea's game against L.A. FC in Atlanta. It was an afternoon kickoff on a weekday, but one of the Premier League's most popular teams vs. an opponent from MLS couldn't manage to fill a third of the 71,000-capacity stadium, with 22,000 fans showing up. “I think the environment was a bit strange. You know, the stadium was almost empty,” Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca said, and even with Lionel Messi in town for the second game in Atlanta — Inter Miami's win against Porto — the crowd was far from capacity at 31,783. Uncertainty over ticket sales had been a point of debate in the build up to the tournament, with prices falling dramatically before the opening game between Miami and Al Ahly last Saturday. An impressive crowd of nearly 61,000 watched that game at Hard Rock Stadium, though it is not known how many paid anywhere near the $349 that tickets were being quoted at in December. As of Tuesday, FIFA said 1.5 million tickets had been sold and more than 340,000 fans had attended the first eight games. Numbers in Miami have been good — nothing lower than 55,000 and topping out at a near-capacity 63,587 for Bayern Munich vs. Boca Juniors. Bayern forward Harry Kane described the atmosphere inside a stadium dominated by Boca fans as “hostile.” Crowds have still come to Miami in a week when the Florida Panthers were playing in the Stanley Cup Final. At the 2022 men's World Cup in Qatar there was an average attendance of just under 50,000 per game for the opening week. Focus on the Club World Cup has been intense for more than one reason. There is still uncertainty over how much of an appetite there is among fans for another elite soccer tournament and it was unknown how many would be prepared to follow their team to the U.S. Perhaps more significant is what this tournament says about the men's World Cup, which is largely being staged in the U.S. next year. The Club World Cup could be seen as a gauge of how America's interest in soccer has grown since last hosting the planet's biggest sporting event in 1994. In that sense, it's not just about statistics, but optics as well. Which is why FIFA will hope to avoid a repeat of the scenes at Mamelodi Sundowns vs. Ulsan HD.</p>

Livvy Dunne had an unfortunate moment at Fanatics Fest.

The former LSU gymnast and influencer was playing in a soccer-themed display at the event and accidentally kicked the ball into the FIFA World Cup trophy. The ball deflected off the trophy and into the net but also broke it.

Dunne knocked the ball off of the trophy, which is handed out every four years at the world championship event. She wasn't the only former athlete to break a trophy at the event as former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers stars Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski accidentally damaged a Lombardi Trophy.

The Fanatics event pits athletes against celebrities and fans as they test their skills. The event began on Friday and runs through Sunday at Hudson Yards in New York City.

Dunne's main event will be on Sunday where she is slated to take photos with fans and sign autographs. While breaking the trophy certainly wasn't in her plans, it did provide a comical moment in a weekend full of them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But women's soccer is not just having a moment. A joint report released by Nielsen and PepsiCo stated that with a predicted 38% growth in its global fan base by 2030, women's soccer has the potential to enter the top 5 sports globally, getting cozy with sports like tennis and motorsport (F1) up in the rarified air at the top. Women's soccer boasts a unique fan base featuring a nearly 50/50 gender split with women expecting to take over the majority at 60% by 2030. Fans also skew young and affluent with a knack for social media, a love of entertainment, and a passion for advocacy. An audience as invested as they are in growing the sport in new and creative ways, with the tools to make it happen. Think Gotham FC's Midge Purce making her Broadway debut in Chicago. A surprising but brilliant crossover to pull in a large fan base that shares the joy of entertainment and the financial means to experience that joy. Or Angel City FC gifting their fans shirts that read "Immigrant City Football Club" and "Los Angeles is for everyone/Los Ángeles es para todos," marking the club as leaders in the pursuit of social justice and change. A powerful and important statement in today's climate, and one that gets them in front of the media.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump had some unusual guests at the White House this week: players and staff members of the Italian soccer team Juventus, in town for their opening match of the FIFA Club World Cup. After a reporter asked Trump whether his travel ban on nationals from 19 countries would affect the ongoing tournament or next year's World Cup, Trump turned to another guest in the room: FIFA President Gianni Infantino. He doesn't know what it is,” Trump said. By “sold out,” Trump was referring to the Club World Cup. With less than a year to go before the World Cup, which the United States is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico, Trump has turned soccer into a political battleground. In addition to the president's very public bromance with Infantino, Customs and Border Protection posted and then deleted a message saying its agents would be “suited and booted” for games of this year's Club World Cup. ICE told NBC Miami last week that noncitizens should carry their immigration papers with them to games. Last month, an ICE operation prompted Latino supporters of Major League Soccer club Nashville SC to suspend their gameday events, fearing raids. But soccer has also been a hub of resistance to Trump's worst actions. Last weekend, Los Angeles' team, Angel City FC, handed out shirts to fans with “Immigrant City Football Club” on the front and “Los Angeles is for everyone” in English and Spanish on the back. Players, coaches and team staff members all wore the shirts pregame. “My mom's parents came here from China, and it wasn't easy for them. My dad is first-generation American,” Angel City captain Ali Riley said postgame. In Portland, Oregon, just hours after federal officers launched tear gas and smoke bombs at people protesting ICE actions, Portland Thorns player Reilyn Turner spoke out after Sunday's game. “I feel like family's such a big thing to look back on and play for, especially what's going on right now — people being stripped from their families,” Turner said. Immigration is not the only issue in which where soccer has been a battleground. The Athletic reported Monday that FIFA scrapped its use of anti-racism and anti-discrimination slogans for Club World Cup events in the United States. MLS has designated June as its pride month every year since 2016. The NWSL has made Juneteenth a league holiday, with more than half of all clubs hosting Juneteenth theme nights at home games, and all NWSL teams observe Pride nights. Bay FC, based in Northern California, featured a pregame performance at its Pride game this month by two San Francisco drag queens, Silvanna Danniels and Cassie Brown, both Mexican immigrants. I don't like it,” Danniels said in an interview with MSNBC. “But having the opportunity to share what I'm really passionate about in this scenario, in this environment, it's definitely like a dream come true.” “I grew up with all the soccer things in Mexico, which is huge and like a very masculine thing. We have all this crowd supporting us, enjoying our shows.” Seeing soccer crowds cheer drag queens, wave LGBTQ+ Pride flags and chant “abolish ICE” is a reminder that Americans have a space where they organize and make their voices heard.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MIAMI GARDENS, FL – It took six days and 24 matches, but the FIFA Club World Cup finally secured its first sellout of the tournament. A sea of singing and chanting fans clad in the yellow and blue of Argentine club Boca Juniors serenaded Hard Rock Stadium, while fans of German giants Bayern Munich, wearing red, were scattered among them on Friday night. They got to see the first win by a European club against a South American side in the Club World Cup, too. Michael Olise broke a deadlock in the 84th minute, English captain Harry Kane also scored (18') and Bayern beat Boca Juniors 2-1. European soccer fans will wake up Saturday morning breathing a sigh of relief seeing the scoreline. CONMEBOL teams had won six matches with three draws and zero losses against UEFA clubs before the Bayern-Boca match. “There's still a long way to go, of course,” Kane said after the victory, which pushed Bayern through to the knockout stage. “But I think people looking at us will definitely put us as one of the favorites for the thing this week.” All four clubs play their final group-stage match Tuesday at 3 p.m. Flamengo beat Chelsea 3-1 in Philadelphia earlier Friday, while the biggest upset was Copa Libertadores winners Botafogo edging Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 in Los Angeles on Thursday. Lionel Messi and Inter Miami scored the first victory for a North American club against a European side when they beat Portugal's FC Porto 2-1 on Thursday in Atlanta. Al-Hilal also became the first Arab and Asian team to score a point against a European side, when they drew 1-1 with Real Madrid in Miami on Wednesday. “I think it's great to experience different teams,” Kane said. “I think you've seen in this tournament already, the South American teams, especially, have caused big problems for some of the European teams. I'm loving this tournament so far, and hopefully, we're going to be here for a while.” Hard Rock Stadium has hosted three of the top four attended Club World Cup matches. The tournament opener between Messi's Inter Miami and Egyptian club Al Ahly drew 60,927 fans last Saturday. The most attended Club World Cup match was Paris Saint-Germain's 4-0 win against Atlético de Madrid at the Rose Bowl Stadium near Los Angeles. There's been debate over whether NFL-sized stadiums were the right choice for games instead of soccer-specific venues with lesser capacities. Three matches at the Rose Bowl near Los Angeles led to 108,629 more fans, than if matches were held at Los Angeles FC's BMO Stadium, FIFA shared with USA TODAY Sports. It's also a stress test for the venues World Cup matches will be played at next year. “They always make you feel it on every pitch, and it proves once again that this is the greatest team in Argentina, without a doubt.” Added Kane: “I love playing in front of these fans. One of the best in my career, for sure. The Bayern fans tried to help us as much as possible, but it was hard with all the Boca fans there.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So they strolled into this expanded version, the 2025 Club World Cup, as heavy favorites. Their supporters assumed they'd waltz to the latter stages, untouched. Instead, halfway through the group stage, they've been humbled. In six games so far against South American opposition, they've lost two, drawn three, won one (finally, on Friday, thanks to Bayern Munich). They have also dropped seven points to the Saudi Pro League, MLS and Liga MX. Their early stumbles have delighted fans from other continents. Flamengo didn't just beat Chelsea 3-1 on Friday in Philadelphia; at times, it pummeled the free-spending English Premier League giants. And Fluminense — Brazil's 13th best team last year — didn't just hold Borussia Dortmund to a 0-0 draw; it outplayed what was, a month ago, the hottest team in Germany. In almost every single match between South American and European foes, there was evidence that the gap is slimmer than most Europeans (and non-Hispanic Americans) realize. Botafogo's upset of PSG was a so-called “smash-and-grab,” but even smash-and-grabs require a certain level of physical, technical and tactical quality. Boca Juniors, similarly, bellied up to Bayern Munich on Friday and snatched a second-half equalizer, before conceding late. It was a “really tough game,” Bayern's Harry Kane said postgame. There was also Monterrey 1, Inter Milan 1; and Al Hilal 1, Real Madrid 1, “a very balanced match,” as Al Hilal fullback João Cancelo said afterward. As Kane's teammate, Konrad Laimer, said: “Because they are good teams, too. On the other side of the debate, however, there are excuses — or at least other explanations, some legitimate. There is the timing of this tournament, which falls at the end of 10-month European seasons, but mid-campaign for clubs from Brazil, Argentina and MLS. Whereas South American teams built up to the Club World Cup, weary European bodies and minds were ready to wind down. Most got a couple weeks off before reconvening with teammates 7-10 days before their Club World Cup openers, or after an international window. “There are many tournaments that they've had to play, and perhaps they'll arrive with some fatigue,” Inter Miami forward Luis Suarez predicted before the competition began. “I think there will be some surprise results.” There is also the suffocating U.S. summer heat, which has seemed to affect European teams more than others. “We are used to the heat,” Al Hilal's Brazilian winger Malcom said after his team hung with Real Madrid on a humid 90-degree afternoon in suburban Miami. Atlético Madrid's Spanish midfielder Marcos Llorente, on the other hand, called an 88-degree afternoon in Southern California “impossible.” There is travel to which the Europeans aren't accustomed. There are distant time zones, and games that kick off after all their friends and family back home are asleep. There are all sorts of confounding variables that preclude the Club World Cup from being an accurate point of comparison. And most of all, there is the unavoidable sense, or narrative, that the European teams just don't really care. But do they care, with every last ounce of their being, like some of their South American counterparts do? There has undoubtedly been an intensity gap that has neutralized the quality gap, and helped some South American sides show well. To them, these games are among the most significant in recent club history. Public attitudes toward the Club World Cup have also colored this excuse. While European fans have stayed home, and in some cases slept through games, supporters of South American and North African clubs have filled stadiums with balloons, flags, banners and unceasing noise. “We've all been a part of big moments; this is still something totally different,” Bayern head coach Vincent Kompany said Friday after experiencing the locura of Boca fans. Kane confirmed: “It felt like an away game out there.” There is a massive gulf, for example, between Bayern Munich, which ultimately outclassed Boca here on Friday night; and Porto, which finished third in the Portuguese Primeira Liga, closer to fourth-place Braga than to the top two. There is also a sizable gulf between Palmeiras or Flamengo, the two most powerful teams in South America's richest league, and most of the other non-European challengers at this Club World Cup. Most of the teams Porto and Benfica play, weekend after weekend, are probably worse than the best of MLS — and certainly worse than Boca, River Plate and much of the Brasileirão. There is still, though, a distance to the tippy-top. “There is an elite in football that is superior,” Flamengo coach Filipe Luis, who played for Atlético Madrid and Chelsea, admitted Friday. “Brazilian clubs are competitive at the second level of European football. Flamengo will not devalue themselves against any opponent. What we underestimated, though, was how streetwise grit and pure desire and all the aforementioned variables could close the gap between those squads for 90 minutes. We underestimated how much a $100 million squad could trouble a $1 billion squad when it plays as an impassioned unit that's “really emotional in some situations,” as Laimer said of Boca. “They play at a high level,” Kane said.</p>
