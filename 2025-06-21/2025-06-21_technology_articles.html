They argue it would be impossible for you to work elsewhere in this industry during your entire career without violating confidentiality with the technical and business instincts you bring to that domain. It doesn't require conscious violation on your part (they argue).So beware and read your employment agreement carefully.More here  https://www.promarket.org/2024/02/08/confidentiality-agreements-can-act-like-noncompetes/And this is the insane legal doctrine behind thishttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inevitable_disclosure So beware and read your employment agreement carefully.More here  https://www.promarket.org/2024/02/08/confidentiality-agreements-can-act-like-noncompetes/And this is the insane legal doctrine behind thishttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inevitable_disclosure More here  https://www.promarket.org/2024/02/08/confidentiality-agreements-can-act-like-noncompetes/And this is the insane legal doctrine behind thishttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inevitable_disclosure And this is the insane legal doctrine behind thishttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inevitable_disclosure Meanwhile California bans non-competes, and its GDP is 4th largest in the world if it were a country!

I know of several cases where lawyers said "don't bother arguing with them about clause X, just sign it and ignore it". In that case you need to ask for a lifetime worth of salary, including growth from being in position to be put in escrow before you sign the dotted line. At the time I was working for a competitor and I figured they could use the fact that I interviewed with them to argue that I - either intentionally or unintentionally - gained proprietary knowledge of their product and my current employer gained from it. I moved from New York to California a bit over 20 years ago in large part because I personally encountered this (the IP ownership bit), and preferred to live under California's rules.It is worthwhile to read https://www.paulgraham.com/america.html.

You are required to hold confidential stuff for life, like business contracts, but you can use your know-how, if it does not violate any patents, in a competing company as you see fit. Even if you do decide within those two years to employ yourself in competing company, this can be held back by your original company only if they give you X% of your pay at them (X can be 80, or as low as 50, as my friends inform me). California bans anything that is effectively a non compete. "Defendant has never worked in any other industry.

You've got a friend in PC—MSI has announced a new collection of Toy Story-themed PC components, sold as a complete prebuilt PC, bringing Pixar's first family to the gaming battle station. From the graphics card to the motherboard's CMOS battery, the DIY PC is plastered in Toy Story branding and will be available only in Taiwan for a very limited time. The MAG PANO Toy Story Edition PC bundle includes Toy Story versions of the MSI PANO 110R case, RTX 5070 Gaming Trio GPU, Z890 Gaming Plus motherboard, 850W MAG A850GL power supply, and MAG CORELIQUID AIO cooler. Each of the five branded components is themed around a different major Toy Story character or object from the first two movies. The Buzz Lightyear RTX 5070 Gaming Trio was displayed at MSI's Computex 2025 booth, where Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang signed it. Dramatic irony holds that this evil emperor-branded PSU will inevitably attempt to take its revenge on the Buzz Lightyear GPU, making it a very good thing that the build uses the RTX 5070 rather than a cable-melting prone RTX 5090. Other goodies included with the 500-unit box set include a set of building blocks spelling out "Toy Story", joined by a set of eight small Toy Story figurines based on characters from the four films, plus an official Disney plaque with a collector's number labelled from 1 to 500 and a set of themed magnets. The brand-new PC will run buyers NT$ 79,900 ($2,700), and is limited to 500 units. It's now available for pre-order from MSI, with the first 50 buyers receiving 2,000 free LINE Pay points, connected to Taiwan's largest payment service. The FAQ also shares that the parts are "currently" only available in Taiwan, hopefully hinting at a future international release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Data breaches are so common these days that, when a new one gets announced, most web users can do little more than yawn and mutter something like “Yeah, no shit” before scrolling up to the next story in their newsfeed. This week, however, a breach was announced that was allegedly so earth-shatteringly huge that it managed to break through the internet's wall of collective cynicism. Dubbed the “Mother of All Data Breaches,” the breach is said to involve some 16 billion user credentials, and impact a vast number of accounts on platforms like Facebook, Google, and Apple. The breach was initially reported by Cyber News, a site that focuses on web security, and was written by the site's deputy editor and researcher, Vilius Petkauskas. Petkauskas's article describes the discovered breach as “a plethora of supermassive datasets, housing billions upon billions of login credentials” that have been sourced from “social media and corporate platforms to VPNs and developer portals.” This data is sourced from “30 exposed datasets” that researchers say contains “tens of millions to over 3.5 billion records each.” Researchers say they were able to discover the exposed datasets due to insecure online protections, though they say the exposure was too short-lived for them to figure out who was “controlling” the data. “With over 16 billion login records exposed, cybercriminals now have unprecedented access to personal credentials that can be used for account takeover, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing.” Cyber News's story was picked up by a number of mainstream outlets, including Forbes and Axios. According to critics, Cyber News isn't wrong per se about the number of credentials that have been exposed—and that's horrifying enough news on its own. “To be clear, this is not a new data breach, or a breach at all, and the websites involved were not recently compromised to steal these credentials,” writes Bleeping Computer. Sometimes, collectors of that information will compile very large dossiers of those breaches and post it as something new—which is what researchers are claiming happened here. That said, Cyber News's story seems to contradict the claims being made by security researchers somewhat. It says that the data that has been uncovered is “recent” and “not merely recycled from old breaches.” The Cyber News story also now includes a disclaimer that says: “This story, based on unique Cybernews findings and originally published on the website on June 18, is constantly being updated with clarifications and additional information in response to public discourse.” Gizmodo reached out to Cyber News for comment. A very effective tool, cybercriminals can use the automated tools to swiftly compile large lists of personal information that can be used for compromise operations down the road.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eli Lilly's daily anti-obesity pill orforglipron appears to be as good at spurring weight loss and lowering blood sugar in diabetes patients as popular injectable GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, according to new data from a Phase 3 trial. Eli Lilly is the maker of the blockbuster GLP-1 drug tirzepatide, approved as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for chronic weight management and obstructive sleep apnea. Like Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy, both of Eli Lilly's tirzepatide drugs are injected on a weekly basis. “We think this is a big deal.” The company plans to seek regulatory approval for orforglipron for weight management by the end of this year and for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in 2026. All three doses were effective at lowering blood sugar, while the middle and highest doses showed clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in body weight. Eli Lilly is studying the pill in a longer study in people who are overweight or have obesity to see if the weight loss continues. Those who were randomly assigned to orforglipron started the study at a dose of 1 milligram a day and slowly increased the dose at four-week intervals. Current GLP-1 drugs are gradually stepped up in dose as well to minimize potential side effects. Orforglipron showed similar gastrointestinal side effects as other GLP-1 drugs, with the most common being diarrhea, nausea, indigestion, and constipation. An oral version of semaglutide, sold under the brand name Rybelsus, has been on the market since 2019 but is not approved for weight management and isn't as effective for weight loss as injectable GLP-1s. A GLP-1 pill wouldn't need sophisticated cold-chain distribution and storage, meaning it could be sold in countries that don't have that infrastructure. “With orforglipron offering additional advantages such as the elimination of strict pre-dosing requirements, potential lower cost, and easier storage, it will be important to see whether these features lead to even greater adherence,” says Priya Jaisinghani, a diabetes and obesity medicine specialist at NYU Langone. “Like most chronic therapies, GLP-1s are most effective when used consistently, so a formulation that encourages long-term use could have a meaningful impact on patient outcomes.” There's a very simple pattern to Elon Musk's broken promises Big Story: The epic rise and fall of a dark-web psychedelics kingpin Special Edition: You're not ready for what's coming next WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

But while they use the term 'FPS' to describe the device, this unit is by no means designed for gaming, or rather, human beings. Instead, when paired with an ultra-fast camera, the display system is designed to enable low-power, high-bandwidth machine-to-machine communication at blindingly fast speeds. Each frame contains a chunk of digitally encoded information, though XDC does not disclose how large that chunk is. XDC suggests that continued development of the technology could lead to throughput at 1 Tb/s levels, which exceeds the performance of today's fastest network interfaces, but is still slower than the upcoming 1600G (1.6 Tbps) technology. XDC says that the system dynamically adapts to bandwidth needs and achieves two- or three-times better energy efficiency than 800G optical transceivers. This is particularly valuable in data centers, where energy use for networking and cooling represents a significant share of operational costs. Furthermore, XDC's interconnect architecture does not need physical fiber or copper connections, which could provide much-needed flexibility and ease of maintenance for massive data centers. In addition, XDC states that its system's performance can be dynamically adjusted in real-time in terms of data transmission paths and bandwidth allocations based on current needs, which could further simplify data center operations. However, a widespread change of medium from fiber or copper to air or vacuum might require a major redesign of servers and data centers, which is a hard endeavor for the industry. "The capacity to dynamically transmit data at megahertz speeds through the air, holds transformative promise for cloud infrastructure," said Nikhil Jain, Director of OptoElectronics & Strategic Partnerships at X Display. "We are proud to present the world's fastest display and display-based optical links, enabling the transmission of vast data volumes through free space rather than cumbersome fiber bundles. Looking ahead, with continued innovation, terabit-per-second and beyond bandwidths are within reach — facilitating scalable, modular, and energy-efficient optical communication, and paving the way for pioneering applications such as optical computing." Without any doubt, XDC's technology looks promising on paper. However, it remains to be seen whether it will find use beyond niche applications or use cases in actual data centers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This story originally appeared on Vox and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. It can trap up to 84 times as much heat as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, though it breaks down much faster. Nearly a third of the increase in global average temperatures since the Industrial Revolution is due to methane, and about two-thirds of those methane emissions comes from human activity like energy production and cattle farming. But the flip side of that math is that cutting methane emissions is one of the most effective ways to limit climate change. But some of the largest methane emitters like Russia and China still haven't signed on, and according to a new report from the International Energy Agency, global methane emissions from energy production are still rising. “This is a major issue because measured emissions tend to be higher than reported emissions.” It's also hard to trace methane to specific sources—whether from natural sources like swamps, or from human activities like fossil fuel extraction, farming, or deforestation. It turns out a lot of methane is coming from underappreciated sources, including coal mines and small oil and gas production facilities. The report also notes that while there are plenty of low-cost tools available to halt much of this methane from reaching the atmosphere, they're largely going unused. However, the Trump administration is pushing for more fossil fuel development while rolling back some of the best bang-for-buck programs for mitigating climate change, which will likely lead to even more methane reaching the atmosphere if left unchecked. The oil and gas industry says that methane is a salable product, so they have a built-in incentive to track it, capture it, and limit its leaks. As a result, researchers and environmental activists say the industry is likely releasing far more than official government estimates show. The short version is that methane is embedded in coal deposits, and as miners dig to expose coal seams, the gas escapes, and continues to do so long after a coal mine reaches the end of its operating life. Since coal miners are focused on extracting coal, they don't often keep track of how much methane they're letting out, nor do regulators pay much attention. According to Ember, methane emissions from coal mines could be 60 percent higher than official tallies. Alarmed by the gaps in the data, some nonprofits have taken it upon themselves to try to get a better picture of methane emissions at a global scale using ground-based sensors, aerial monitors, and even satellites. In 2024, the Environmental Defense Fund launched MethaneSAT, which carries instruments that can measure methane output from small, discrete sources over a wide area. Since launching, MethaneSAT has found that in the US, the bulk of methane emissions doesn't just come from a few big oil and gas drilling sites, but from many small wells that emit less than 100 kilograms per hour. “Marginal wells only produce 6 to 7 percent of [oil and gas] in the US, but they disproportionately account for almost 50 percent of the US oil and gas production-related emissions,” Gautam said. “These facilities only produce less than 15 barrels of oil equivalent per day, but then there are more than half a million of these just scattered around the US.” “Around 70 percent of methane emissions from the fossil fuel sector could be avoided with existing technologies, often at a low cost,” according to the IEA methane report. For the oil and gas industry, that could mean something as simple as using better fittings in pipelines to limit leaks and installing methane capture systems. Capturing or destroying methane from coal mines isn't so straightforward. Common techniques to separate methane from other gases require heating air, which is not exactly the safest thing to do around a coal mine—it can increase the risk of fire or explosion. “There are catalytic and other approaches available today that don't require such high temperatures,” said Robert Jackson, a professor of earth system science at Stanford University, in an email. However, these methods to limit methane from fossil fuels are vastly underused. Only about 5 percent of active oil and gas production facilities around the world deploy systems to zero out their methane pollution. In the US, there are also millions of oil and gas wells and tens of thousands of abandoned coal mines whose operators have long since vanished, leaving no one accountable for their continued methane emissions. “If there isn't a regulatory mandate to treat the methane, or put a price on it, many companies continue to do nothing,” Jackson said. And while recovering methane is ultimately profitable over time, the margins aren't often big enough to make the up-front investment of better pipes, monitoring equipment, or scrubbers worthwhile for them. And rather than getting stronger, regulations on methane are poised to get weaker. The Trump administration has approved more than $119 million to help communities reclaim abandoned coal mines. However, the White House has also halted funding for plugging abandoned oil and gas wells and is limiting environmental reviews for new fossil fuel projects. Congressional Republicans are also working to undo a fee on methane emissions that was part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. That will push the world further off course from climate goals and contribute to a hotter planet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gigabyte's leaking thermal gel problem still affects early adopters. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Gigabyte's leaky thermal gel problem finally hit a prominent system integrator. According to VideoCardz, PowerGPU founder and CEO Jese Martinez discovered that his Gigabyte RTX 50-Series Master GPU, which he had owned since February, had been leaking its thermal putty after he switched to an RTX 50 Founders Edition graphics card. Martinez had already warned his customers about the issue, but didn't expect the problem to impact his personal system. Welp I got the Gigabyte gel leaking issue. I reported on this a few months back. The GPU maker has already addressed the thermal gel leak on its RTX 50-series and RX 9000-series GPUs, saying that the problem stemmed from "a slightly higher volume of gel" applied on only early production batches of its GPUs. "While the appearance of extra gel might be concerning, this cosmetic variance does not affect the card's performance, reliability, or lifespan." Despite this claim, users are saying that the dripping thermal gel might cause problems. One Reddit user documented the dripping, melted putty, where they shared pictures of the progress of the putty creeping until nothing was left on what seems to be their GPU's VRAM chips. You likely don't need to worry about your Gigabyte GPU leaking its thermal gel if you weren't among the first to buy them, as the company has reportedly already adjusted its processes and solved the problem. But if you're concerned that your GPU's performance will be affected, Gigabyte recommends contacting your regional customer service center for support.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new cleanup strategy won't be a one-time deal; it'll be a regular occurrence with more driver types involved in future driver sweeps. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A Microsoft blog post reports that the trillion-dollar giant will be removing legacy and expiring drivers that are "no longer associated with an audience in Windows Update" on a regular basis. Microsoft's goal is to reduce security and compatibility risks, as well as improve driver quality for Windows users with its new driver cleanup strategy. Future cleanups will target more categories of drivers that Microsoft "deems fit to be expired from Windows Update." For Microsoft, cleaning up these drivers means removing all of its audience assignments in the Hardware Development Center, preventing Windows Update from offering affected drivers to any devices. Microsoft will provide a 6-month window for partners to provide any feedback surrounding expired drivers, and whether or not the driver should stay in the Windows Update catalog. If nothing happens, the drivers will be permanently removed for good. However, Microsoft partners will still be allowed to republish expired drivers if needed. Furthermore, Microsoft expects partners to review their current driver suite in its Hardware Program and proactively remove their unwanted or legacy drivers. In the future, Microsoft will allegedly prepare new publishing guidelines that will "help all Windows users keep their systems in a secure and reliable state". Sometimes, these accusations are legitimate, where a buggy driver gets installed that wrecks the user's computer. Worse, these faulty drivers can reinstall themselves automatically, making them a nightmare to deal with if the user tries to uninstall them manually. However, it could be a double-edged sword for older devices. Depending on how many driver updates get deprecated, older machines and older devices, say a 10-year-old printer, might lose functionality if there are no 3rd party drivers to rely on. Only time will tell if this becomes a problem. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.
