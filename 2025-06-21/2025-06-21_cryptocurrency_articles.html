                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices have suffered significant losses over the last day, sparking a bearish outlook for these altcoins. This comes following the US Supreme Court's denial of a motion to expedite the consideration of a motion on whether the Trump tariffs are legal or not. Meanwhile, a second Federal Court also ruled against the tariffs. The tariffs are bearish for the Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices, which explains why these altcoins witnessed a sharp decline. The tariffs have already raised concerns of inflation, with the Federal Reserve holding off on rate cuts. Fed Jerome Powell has indicated that the committee is well prepared to wait and see how the tariffs impact the economy rather than rush to cut rates. Rate cuts are typically bullish for the Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices because they inject more liquidity into these assets. However, these rate cuts could remain on hold if the tariffs persist. Another reason the Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices declined is because of the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict, which has gone on for over one week now. Both countries launched fresh strikes on each other in the last 24 hours, a move that is likely to further escalate the war. Meanwhile, the US is reportedly considering joining the war, which is also bearish for these altcoin prices. Amid this decline, a positive for the Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices is Fed Governor Christopher Waller's statement that rate cuts  could happen as early as next month. In a CNBC interview, he opined that they need to move slowly but that he thinks that they can start easing monetary policies from next month. US President Donald Trump has also called on the Fed to cut rates several times. In one of his most recent Truth Social post, he raised the possibility of firing Jerome Powell if the Fed Chair continues to delay on rate cuts. A potential rate cut would be bullish for the Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's AVIV ratio and power law model point to a $330,000 cycle top for BTC price. Over-the-counter Bitcoin holdings are down significantly in 2025, pointing to strategic accumulation by Strategy, Metaplanet, BlackRock and others. Technical analyst Gert van Lagen's X post highlights the AVIV Ratio, a metric that compares Bitcoin's active capitalization (money in motion) to its total invested capitalization (realized capital, excluding miner rewards). Historically, when the AVIV Ratio crosses its +3σ mean deviation, it has signaled a cycle top. Currently, the AVIV Ratio's level remains below these past peaks, suggesting Bitcoin could climb to at least $330,000 this cycle, before the +3σ mean deviation condition is met. The AVIV Ratio offers a unique lens on market dynamics, reflecting investor activity versus locked-in value. A spike indicates heightened trading or profit-taking, often preceding major price movements. Van Lagen's analysis ties this to Bitcoin's cyclical nature, where post-ATH rallies have historically delivered significant gains. However, its predictive accuracy lacks validation in varying market conditions, and volatility remains a wildcard. This decline suggests large investors are moving holdings off exchanges, potentially signaling reduced selling pressure or a shift toward long-term storage. The declining balances at OTC desks this year stem from strategic accumulation by institutional investors, led by Strategy's aggressive buying, and new entrants like Metaplanet, which has amassed 10,000 BTC, alongside robust net inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which total $128.18 billion in net value. 📊MARKET UPDATE: #BlackRock added another $250 million in #Bitcoin on June 17 — marking six straight days of buying, now totaling $1.4 billion. Related: 25% Bitcoin price rally set to follow today's correction if history repeats Similar to Van Lagen's $330,000 price target, another study by Bitcoin researcher Sminston With outlined a comparable cycle top for BTC. Currently trading around $104,000, BTC would need a 100% to 200% surge to hit these levels, consistent with historical peaks where prices doubled or tripled above the power law trendline. With's model challenges assumptions of diminishing volatility, showing Bitcoin's price cycles retain significant swings, as evidenced by steady deviations from the trendline. Likewise, Cointelegraph reported that a list of 30 bull market peak indicators from CoinGlass suggests Bitcoin could climb to $230,000, with none signaling a cycle top despite BTC reaching $112,000. Metrics like Pi Cycle Top and MVRV show the bull market has room to run, supporting With's optimistic outlook.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Savvy bitcoin BTC$102,623.27 and ether ETH$2,397.90 traders are shoring up their defenses as the broader market continues to foresee bullish price action over the summer. That's the message from an options-based strategy called 25-delta risk reversal, which involves the simultaneous purchase of a put option and sale of a call, or vice versa. At the time of writing, risk reversals based on Deribit-listed bitcoin and ether options indicated that investors were positioning for downside volatility over the summer. BTC's 25-delta risk reversals for June, July, and August tenors were negative, indicating a preference for put options, which offer downside protection, over calls or bullish bets, according to data source Amberdata. In ETH's case, puts were pricier out to the July end expiry. Traders typically buy put options to hedge their long positions in the spot and futures markets, protecting themselves from potential price declines. This suggests that long holders are actively hedging spot exposure and preparing for potential drawdowns," Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market note. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has spent over 40 days trading back and forth above $100,000, according to CoinDesk data. According to analysts, profit-taking by long-term holders and miner selling have counteracted the strong uptake for spot ETFs, leaving prices directionless. "Bitcoin has recently tracked sideways, suggesting its current price may be too high for many retail investors. Open interest in BTC options has risen, with a positive and rising 25 delta put-call skew on 30-day contracts, which may imply that market participants are seeking short-term protection through put options," Coinbase Institutional's weekly report noted. The breakdown may lead to more chart-driven selling, potentially resulting in a drop below $100,000. Omkar holds small amounts of bitcoin, ether, BitTorrent, tron and dot.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As van de Poppe explained in a recent post, ETH has been accumulating liquidity at multiple price points. To him, this trend is typically an indication that the asset is accumulating some pressure towards a reversal, and this time, the asset's price could be going up. Van de Poppe also noted that Ethereum has been trading sideways within a tight range over the last month. It appears to have stabilized and strengthened in an otherwise volatile market. Van de Poppe also stressed that these patterns are likely to cause explosive price action, particularly when it is accompanied by good fundamentals and mounting interest. It implies that institutional interest in Ethereum is on the rise. Also Read: Ethereum Price Prediction 2025: Can ETH Reach New Highs or Is a Pullback Coming? The chart displays that Ethereum trades right below a significant resistance zone at the moment where it has made attempts to break through it a couple of times. All these are coupled with the fact that the price is establishing a pattern of higher lows as noted by Van de Poppe, which is usually a precursor of an upward trend.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From Free NFT Mint to Drinks at 7-Eleven: Rekt Is Reaching the Masses The brand, which weathered a brutal crypto bear market thanks in part to the strength of its fervent community, has now sold more than 600,000 cans of Rekt Drinks, a non-alcoholic, flavored sparkling water that comes in a variety of different flavors. And this week, the brand earned placement at 7-Eleven, starting with a trio of stores in Southern California. Rekt Brands co-founder Ovie Faruq (aka OSF) told Decrypt that it's “kind of funny” that the original Rektguy NFT offering didn't mint out. The project, which started as an art collection and a “side quest” for Faruq, has since morphed its way into a leading Web3 brand, with beverages helping it expand beyond the blockchain. (Disclosure: Ovie Faruq's Canary Labs is an investor in DASTAN, the parent company of Rug Radio and Decrypt.) We didn't really promise anything, there was no roadmap, no promises made—it was really just meant to be an art collection,” he said of Rektguy. “But over the next two years, we seemed to just have this really super sticky, tight-knit community that stuck around.” It was during the summer of 2023 when ideas started to blossom about potential expansions. We had put the logo on a few things, and it sort of felt like this Rekt thing could be a brand,” Faruq said, adding that the goal became getting the logo in as many places as possible. “Considering we had no experience in drinks, we just kind of like made up this drink to fuck around and find out, so to speak. From there, the team decided to try to manufacture a bigger batch and sell them, leading to its first major sale of Liquidated Lime drinks last October—a collection of 222,000 drinks that it sold out in 48 hours. “I was really inspired by the Solana phone,” said Faruq about the Solana Saga, an Android smartphone that initially faced weak demand, but then sold out once the Bonk meme coin offered to buyers surged in value. “No one touched it, tons of supply left—but as soon as people could claim a $500 BONK airdrop, the phone sold out in like 24 hours.” After its initial success, the brand teamed up with Ethereum layer-2 network Abstract for a drop of Abstract Apple, a new flavor of its sparkling water, selling out even faster than before. “After that, we just had tons of people reaching out to us for collaborations,” said Faruq, whose brand also dropped drinks via collabs with NFT marketplace OpenSea and Solana decentralized exchange aggregator, Jupiter. We did the first sale, and people are sort of wondering if this is a one-hit wonder sort of thing,” he said, adding that the brand's crypto origins initially led to some skepticism, as well. “You tell people the story, they expressed some interest, but there wasn't really a ton of movement,” he added. “With 7-Eleven, I just think we had a very strong pitch to them,” said Faruq. “This is the perfect product for a 7-Eleven store, and we can get a ton of people out to the stores when we launch it and make it some really big thing and a really good launch. Another event took place Friday, with the last set for Saturday. And early 4-pack buyers each day will earn an allotment of REKT tokens, as well. "​​[You] never really know if people will turn up to stuff when it's not a crypto event," Faruq told Decrypt of the initial Thursday event. "But we had a good turnout, and all the drinks selling out was obviously nice." The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto and blockchain stocks are putting altcoins to shame. Since its June 5 debut, $CRCL has now surged 677%, benefiting significantly from pro-stablecoin legislation in the United States and strong institutional demand. Meanwhile, Coinbase (COIN) is also showing considerable bullish strength, up by nearly 28% this week and 116% since its April bottom. Besides COIN and CRCL, crypto treasury stocks have emerged as attractive bets. Wall Street giant Cantor Fitzgerald has identified Solana treasury firm Sol Strategies (CYFRF) as an “overweight” stock. The ongoing crypto bull market, stablecoin legislation in the US and the strong institutional demand have established Coinbase and Circle as two excellent bets in a boring stock market. TradFi investors appear to be viewing $COIN, $CRCL, and crypto treasury plays as better investments than large-cap altcoins, many of which continue to undershoot expectations. Coinbase $COIN and Circle $CRCL since GENIUS Act passed.Identical Market Making. US President Donald Trump has already signalled his intent to sign the bill. However, sidelined investors should avoid FOMO buying at current levels. The stock's explosive rally has been fueled largely by speculative 0DTE flows and sky-high implied volatility, rather than fundamentals. Meanwhile, $COIN is another excellent stablecoin play, especially considering Coinbase has a minority stake in the company. In addition to that equity exposure, Coinbase earns 50% of the interest income generated from USDC reserves, making it a direct beneficiary of USDC's growth. Coinbase's growth also isn't entirely dependent on the stablecoin sector. However, $COIN is also nearing key resistance levels at $312 and $350, the latter of which is a multi-year resistance. Sidelined investors should therefore wait for a better entry point at lower prices or buy at a clear breakout above these levels. Wall Street giant Cantor Fitzgerald suggests that Solana treasury companies could outpace Bitcoin and Ethereum treasuries in asset-per-share growth, owing to SOL's staking capabilities, which can compound returns without relying on external capital. Cantor has identified Sol Strategies (CYFRF) as one of the best blockchain stocks, initiating coverage and labelling it “overweight”. Their analysts have initiated coverage and anticipate a 65% rally in CYFRF in the coming weeks, which has already rallied 15x over the past year. It recently secured a $500 million convertible note facility and filed a $1 billion shelf prospectus to support its ongoing SOL accumulation and validator expansion. More importantly, Sol Strategies is now eyeing a US market entry, filing for a Nasdaq listing with the SEC, which would make it one of the top blockchain stocks to invest in. 🚨 LATEST: Canadian Stock Exchange-listed firm Sol Strategies files with SEC to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker "STKE".The company has been accumulating $SOL as a treasury asset and running Solana validators. New Solana utility coins are also in high demand. For instance, a prominent SOL Layer-2 coin, Solaxy (SOLX), is being viewed as the next 10x crypto. Besides its cutting-edge layer-2 architecture, Solaxy is also building a full-stack ecosystem within Solana, including a meme coin launchpad and its own decentralized exchange. Whales continue to pour six-figure investments into SOLX just days ahead of its June 23rd launch. It has now raised over $56 million in its presale.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ZachXBT claims over 80% of Garden Finance's fees are tied to crypto laundering, challenging the project's decentralization narrative. In a June 21 post on X, ZachXBT claimed that over 80% of Garden's recent fee revenue stemmed from illicit transactions allegedly tied to the North Korean Lazarus Group. The allegation came in response to an earlier post by Jaz Gulati, a co-founder of Garden Finance, who had recently touted the platform's success, citing 38.86 Bitcoin (BTC) in collected fees — $300,000 of which was earned over the 12 days ending June 2. Related: Hong Kong to develop crypto tracking tool for money laundering ZachXBT further alleged that that a single actor continuously topped up cbBTC liquidity from Coinbase, effectively fueling illicit flows while Garden claimed to operate a trustless and decentralized model. “Explain how it is ‘decentralized' when I watched in real time for multiple days as a single entity kept topping up cbBTC liquidity from Coinbase,” ZachXBT wrote, questioning the project's claims of decentralization. In response, Garden Finance founder Jaz Gulati denied the allegations, pointing out that 30 BTC in fees were collected prior to the Bybit incident. Garden Finance claims to enable crosschain swaps within 30 seconds while offering zero-custody risk. According to its Dune Analytics dashboard, the project has facilitated over 24,984 BTC in total volume, equivalent to more than $1.5 billion, across 40,571 atomic swaps. Cointelegraph reached out to Jaz for comment via X but had not received a response by publication. Related: Crypto scammers plead guilty to $37M scheme targeting Americans Last week, Iurii Gugnin, the founder of crypto payments firm Evita Pay, was arrested in New York. He faces 22 federal charges tied to a sprawling money laundering scheme allegedly involving over $530 million. Prosecutors say the operation ran from June 2023 through January 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It will split that money across XRP, Solana (SOL), SUI, Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Bittensor (TAO). Everything Blockchain says it will turn its reserve into a yield‑producing portfolio. Network staking rates vary, so returns could rise or fall over time. Nasdaq News $EBZT Everything Blockchain Plans $10M Strategic Acquisition of SOL, XRP, SUI, TAO https://t.co/TF8kC7WtgC @MrSamuelPowers @Nasdaq $BTC $ETH #XRP #SOL #SUI #HYPE $COIN pic.twitter.com/Xa2BUqa0h8 The five assets range from established tokens to new projects. XRP faces legal uncertainty after its long SEC battle but enjoys strong support among public holders. SOL has a large ecosystem and solid staking yields today. SUI and Hyperliquid are newer networks chasing growth, while Bittensor ties rewards to AI‑driven workloads. Putting millions into just five tokens keeps the portfolio focused, but it also means bigger swings if any one network stumbles. Reports disclose that retail traders can tap into staking rewards simply by owning EBZT shares. Everything Blockchain says it will pass on a large chunk of its staking income directly to stock‑holders. Details on timing and payout mechanics will appear in future shareholder updates. For many investors who don't run wallets or node validators, EBZT could offer a simpler way to participate. Public firms are increasingly staking crypto to turn idle assets into yield streams. Trident Digital Tech Holdings plans a $500 million XRP treasury. Webus International filed to back $300 million in XRP. Everything Blockchain's early entry into multi‑token staking may set the pace for others on Wall Street and beyond. Looking ahead, execution will decide if this playbook holds up. If Everything Blockchain can track yields accurately, manage network hiccups and distribute rewards smoothly, it may carve out a new model for corporate crypto treasuries.</p>
