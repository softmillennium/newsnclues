                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The relationship between former True Detective co-stars Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey might still be going strong, years after they wrapped filming on the HBO show's legendary first season—but their new Apple TV+ comedy series, not so much. Deadline reports that filming on the untitled series, in which the pair would play fictionalized versions of their real-life selves, living together with their families in Texas, has been suspended, and its cast sent home, with showrunner David West Read having departed the series after filming eight of its ten episodes. Read apparently ditched out on/was encouraged to ditch out on the project—which is co-owned by Harrelson and McConaughey, and inspired by their real-life relationship—over concerns about how to end the series. Deadline notes that Lessons In Chemistry creator Lee Eisenberg is being courted to come in and showrun the last two episodes of the series, as well as likely reshoot some of what's come before. The series co-stars Holland Taylor, Natalie Martinez, Brittany Ishibashi, Oona Yaffe, Highdee Kuan, Nolan Almeida, Ella Grace Helton, and Noah Carganilla, all of whom have apparently been sent home while its leadership and creative direction is rejiggered. The show was originally announced back in 2023, and, honestly, sounded even at the time like a thing you'd just say to get some attention—”Hey, Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey are making a show for us where they play a fake version of their real friendship, and also they're living together, doesn't that sound fun?”—and not actually spend a lot of time and energy to, y'know, make. But here we are, at least nearly: Apple is apparently still committed to getting the show finished, at least in part because nobody likes paying to make eight whole episodes of a ten-episode show, and then having to throw the whole thing out because your producer-stars couldn't agree with the writer on an ending.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Though Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital has seen its fair share of shocks and surprises, including character returns, there's one fan-favorite physician that isn't likely to grace the ABC medical procedural again. During a recent Tribeca Film Festival live event with The New York Times‘ Interview, the Emmy-winning Sandra Oh spoke with co-host Lulu Garcia-Navarro (per People) about whether or not she would return as Dr. Cristina Yang. A 'Grey's Anatomy' Wedding Brings Levi Back & Has Link Singing As EP Meg Marinis Teases Season 21 Finale With 2 Couples Facing Breakups Ellen Pompeo On Why She Hasn't Left 'Grey's Anatomy' Completely: "That Would Make No Sense, Emotionally Or Financially" Oh's tenure on Grey's spanned the show's inception through 2014, with the actress garnering five Emmy nods and a Golden Globe for her role as the driven cardiothoracic surgeon and dear friend of Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). Since her departure, the character has been referenced onscreen, whether through phone calls or other correspondence. The Quiz Lady actress has been asked about her stance on returning numerous times throughout the years, with her answers ranging from “never say never” to, later on, a resounding “no.” Having recently concluded its 21st season, Grey's Anatomy remains the longest-running primetime medical drama in TV history, and it will soon gear up for its 22nd installment, releasing this fall. As for Oh, she will next be seen in Aziz Ansari's debut feature Good Fortune, starring alongside Seth Rogen, Keanu Reeves, Keke Palmer and Ansari.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's not every day that someone as admired and adored as Catherine, Princess of Wales, gracefully steps back from one of the most glamorous and anticipated events on the royal calendar. So when Kate Middleton's name was quietly removed from the official Royal Ascot carriage procession list just 20 minutes before the festivities kicked off, fans and royal watchers alike were left both puzzled and concerned. It continued its tradition as one of the most prestigious and high-status social gatherings in Britain. The 43-year-old Princess may not have appeared dressed in high fashion in her usual head-turning bold fashion, but she certainly didn't sit the week out. She used her platform to shine light on families navigating unimaginable circumstances. As Patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices and Tŷ Hafan Children's Hospice, the Princess has long been very vocal about her support for pediatric palliative care. Her statement continued with a powerful reminder of what these organizations offer. “This Children's Hospice Week,” she added, “I hope you will join me in celebrating the life-changing work they do and thanking them for the vital care they provide to children and families experiencing the most challenging times.” Her words follow a January visit to Tŷ Hafan in Wales. There, she spent time with young patients and their parents. A post shared by The Prince and Princess of Wales (@princeandprincessofwales) Middleton's absence at Royal Ascot also comes as she continues to recover from cancer. In March 2024, she shared a personal video message revealing her diagnosis. Understandably, she revealed she was taking a step back from public life to focus on treatment, her health, and her family. Earlier this year, a statement from Kensington Palace confirmed that she was in remission and slowly. Her most recent public appearance was at Trooping the Colour on June 14. A post shared by The Prince and Princess of Wales (@princeandprincessofwales) But as many know, healing isn't a straight path. A spokesperson from the Palace noted that while the Princess remains committed to her royal work, she is “taking each day as it comes” and prioritizing her well-being. She didn't issue a specific comment on missing Ascot, but her actions, as always, spoke volumes. According to Queen Elizabeth II's former spokeswoman, Ailsa Anderson, Middleton is taking her time with grace and care. Speaking to People, Anderson said, “She's being sensible, listening to what her body is telling her and easing back into public life. In true Kate fashion, her quiet strength, compassion, and commitment to others continue to shine, even when she isn't in the spotlight.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amy Poehler reflected on the culture of comedy at Saturday Night Live during her time at the late-night show, saying that some sketches have aged poorly. During a recent episode on her Good Hang with Amy Poehler podcast alongside guest and friend Will Forte, whose time on SNL intersected with Poehler's, the two discussed how much comedy has evolved since their time on the Lorne Michaels-helmed series. The topic came up when the two comics recalled an instance at a table read during a sexual harassment seminar, where they were “drawing pictures of dicks or something,” Forte remembered. 'SNL' Cast Unpacks Season 50 Including Miss Eggy, Chloe Fineman's Big Dumb Line, Straight Bowen Yang & Sarah Sherman Nearly Getting "Jacked" “We were consensually and appropriately, just with each other, I believe, drawing pictures of penises and giving them back and forth to each other,” Poehler said, adding that she then accidentally handed that paper to the seminar leader. Forte then commented that as a young comedian, “it's all about getting the laughs,” implying that considerations of taste and appropriateness come later. “Agree, and that's the part about getting older and being in comedy is you have to, like, figure out, ‘Oh, it's like everything has an expiration date,'” Poehler said. Countless members of the SNL family taken from us way too soon. I'm speaking, of course, about SNL characters and sketches that have aged horribly.” “Even on the 50th, when they had that segment which was like, ‘Here's all the ways we got things wrong,' and they showed way inappropriate casting for people,” Poehler stated.

Lena Dunham and husband Luis Felber's new Netflix series “Too Much,” starring Megan Stalter, is set to drop July 10, and while the series' trailer promised laughs, Dunham said she also felt a responsibility to use the show to make a stand on women's rights. “As an artist, I'm proud … that we get to be part of showing people all over the world a healthy woman making a super self actualized choice to get reproductive care [from] a really true, loving abortion provider, because those people are heroes,” Dunham said.

Dunham has partnered with and advocated for Planned Parenthood in the past, including in 2017 when she released a star-studded animated tribute to the organization with participants like Meryl Streep, Mindy Kaling, Jennifer Lawrence, and America Ferrera. “We've been working on the film for over a year in an attempt to shed light on Planned Parenthood's remarkable history and ongoing battle to keep serving the people who show up to their health centers every day of the year,” Dunham told THR at the time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doncaster, England-born Dominic Harrison — has become an anti-pop hero. Yungblud's voice — a piercing yelp that exists somewhere between Gerard Way's wail and Brian Molko's sneer — slotted him in the alt-rock world, but his aspirations seemed to stretch far beyond that categorization. With his fourth album Idols Yungblud harnesses those hopes and takes a very big swing. The 12 songs released this week are the first half of what he's calling a double-album project, with part two slated for release at some point in the future, and this installment's opening track “Hello Heaven, Hello” doubles as a leadoff statement of Yungblud's revitalized ambition. Mutating from a dreamy greeting into a muscular, shape-shifting rock song before taking a hairpin turn into fuzz-shrouded acoustic balladry, the nine-minute cut finds Yungblud reintroducing himself to his audience with equal parts bravado and humility: “All the hopes and dreams I may have borrowed/Just know, my friend, I leave them all to you,” he wails near the song's end before disappearing into a cloud of strings and feedback. Dr. Demento, Madcap Radio DJ Who Launched Weird Al's Career, Announces Retirement Bonnaroo Pivots to Full Refunds for Canceled Festival, 'Not Announcing Future Dates' Treasured Public Lands on the Auction Block in Trump's ‘Big Beautiful Bill' Yungblud told Rolling Stone Australia that Idols comes “from [my] heart and not from [my] head… it came from within me, and I made this for me.” Its broad scope shows how deep his passion for taking music in unexpected directions can run. Idols also shows how Yungblud's bellow is tailor-made for cathartic ballads. “Zombie,” where he exposes his self-loathing (“Would you even want me, looking like a zombie?”) over midtempo riffing, and “War,” which tackles the conflicted feelings dredged up by the demands of stardom — particularly ones made by the people surrounding him whose motivations he can't quite trust. On Idols, Yungblud doesn't entirely ignore the hangers-on and “helpful” outsiders, but he does barrel past them with a hungry bravado that shows why so many have become passionate about his music.</p>

One co-worker even told Zimmerman to burn thrifted sweaters from a garage sale because they had probably belonged to “somebody that died of AIDS.” But the writer — who later worked on “Gilmore Girls” — said that was just “the climate then.” “I know you see all these progressive scenes and you think, ‘Oh, it was one big gay party there,' but we couldn't be who we really were,” Zimmerman explained during a Pride LIVE!

She wasn't gay, but she was probably the first ally ever.” Getty was already deeply entrenched in the queer community, having played Harvey Fierstein's mother in Broadway's “Torch Song Trilogy,” the landmark play (and later film) about a gay, Jewish drag performer. Bea Arthur, too, seemed to have a finely tuned queer radar. Script supervisor Isabel Omero would later come out as transgender decades later, and at one point during the show's long run Arthur offered Omero a sari she had received on a trip to India. “In my closeted, panicked, paranoid brain, all I knew is that at that moment Bea Arthur was offering me a dress to wear around the house, and I wish I had been in a place where I could have said something, to even accept the gift without ever using it, just so I could express something to someone,” Omero said during the panel. Several episodes addressed queer issues, including a two-episode arc where Blanche's (Rue McClanahan) brother came out and — in an especially progressive moment — married his partner. “The Golden Girls” is currently streaming on Hulu and Disney+.

[Editor's note: The following article contains major spoilers for “28 Years Later,” which is in theaters now.] In “28 Years Later,” the aptly named sequel that comes 28 years after the rage virus ravaged England in “28 Days Later,” we find the lucky humans who survived now in a throwback communal life centered on farming, hunting, tools, customs, and gender roles ripped from a century ago. While on this week's episode of IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast (in full below), director Danny Boyle discussed the contradiction between these humans, protected from the zombie-like infected by life on an island, and the rage virus itself. Related Stories What Could Happen to ‘The Matrix,' ‘Wonka,' and ‘Mad Max' Franchises Now That They Have New Owners? All 29 Pixar Movies Ranked, from ‘Toy Story' to ‘Elio' They've kind of regressed, [going] back to a 1950s-type subsistence living,” Boyle said on the podcast. As Boyle explained, the ability to adapt by securing food has resulted in three distinct variants of zombies. “They're much more passive, but dangerous if provoked or alarmed.” As Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) demonstrates to his 12-year-old son Spike (Alfie Williams), the common Slow-Lows are easy to kill, and with the proper precautions, they don't pose a real threat to humans armed with a bow and arrow. It's a sharp contrast to the rarer, and far more frightening, variants known as “Alphas.” It's a natural human instinct that we organize as a pack, which can then hunt together and eat together. The principal threat in “28 Years Later” is the Alpha known as Samson, who is played by 6-foot-8-inch actor Chi Lewis-Parry (pictured below), an MMA fighter and bodyguard. As muscular as Lewis-Parry already is, special makeup effects supervisor John Nolan added even more muscles on top of his massive frame, especially to his back. Noted Boyle of the Alpha villain, who runs around pretty much naked (and quite well-endowed) for most of the film: “He had a few supplements added to him.” “Like these big guys often are, he's a gentle giant,” Boyle said of Lewis-Parry. “That was very much scripted,” said Boyle, crediting screenwriter Alex Garland with the Alphas' disturbing way of finishing off their prey. In “28 Years Later,” we also see an extremely thin, almost skin-and-bones zombie variant (pictured at the top of this page), a slight throwback to the first victims of the rage virus in “28 Days Later.” Boyle cryptically offered little explanation of this third variant: “There's a very thin man who clearly, for some reason, he's not capable of [hunting or gathering food like the others].” The second film, “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,” has already been shot by director Nia DaCosta and is slated to come out next January. Pointing to the future, Boyle warned audiences that we don't know everything just yet about the adorable and very normal-looking (and seemingly non-infected) baby that Spike and Isla (Jodie Comer) watch a pregnant zombie give birth to before she dies. “There's a fourth [variant], of course, which is even more complicated, which is that the baby arrives from an infected,” said Boyle. “The question which we don't answer deliberately is, ‘Was this woman a survivor who became infected while she was pregnant, or are the infected breeding? Are they having sex and [this is] the natural consequences of that?' So it's kind of multiple evolutions happening, probably, in reality.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It unfolds when you'd open up the CD booklet of Sueño Stereo, Soda Stereo's seminal album, released on June 21, 1995, 30 years ago. The photo, taken by Cecilia Amenábar, depicts the iconic Argentine trio — singer/guitarist Gustavo Cerati, bassist Zeta Bosio, drummer Charly Alberti — at work in their private Buenos Aires studio, surrounded by a beautiful mess of guitars, keyboards, amplifiers, a drum kit, and a computer monitor that looks prehistoric by today's standards. Decades later, the picture remains evocative, encapsulating the idealized mystique of everything a rock & roll session is supposed to look like. A visionary blend of Beatles-esque hooks, thorny psychedelia, Nineties ambient, and South American existentialism, Sueño Stereo is, beyond any reasonable doubt, Soda's tour de force, but also one of Latin rock's most baffling, otherworldly masterpieces — a record that never ceases to surprise and delight. “It was an amazing time,” says Bosio from his home in Miami. “At that stage, we were completely in sync. Many of the Sueño Stereo songs stemmed from us improvising together at Supersónico, an old, now demolished  home in the Belgrano neighborhood of Buenos Aires that we turned into a studio. We recorded jam sessions in DAT, and they quickly developed into completed songs.” Why don't we make it a point to sound like ourselves for once?” In retrospect, Soda never really sounded like Soda, as the trio's restless identity kept morphing from album to album since the release of its new wave inflected 1984 debut. And because the band quickly became the official ambassador of stadium-sized rock en español throughout Latin America, every stylistic shift, every reinvention was scrutinized by fans and critics alike. But once they were done touring behind it, everything went south. On July 4, 1994, a car transporting Bosio's two young children was rammed by a colectivo — the Buenos Aires public buses, often manned by notoriously aggressive drivers. Even though Cerati had already released a solo album — 1993's esoteric Amor Amarillo — and harbored the desire to dismantle Soda, he pushed for the trio to reconvene, thinking perhaps that making music would provide a modicum of healing. “His son was only three years old and died in the most horrific way. On top of that, even though it wasn't verbalized, there was a sense that this would be the band's last album. As could be expected, those feelings seeped into the record.” These Fans Won't Rest Until Their Favorite Latin Band Is Inducted Into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Soda Stereo Says An Unreleased Song Is on the Way Soda Stereo, Ana Torroja Among Latin Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Honorees Argentine Electronic Music Pioneer Flavio Etcheto Dead at 52 For a band that rehearsed furiously and relished the chance to generate songs out of spontaneous jams, employing electronica had a liberating effect. Having switched labels, from Sony to the more controlling Ariola/BMG, Soda considered kick-starting their new record deal with a double album. “It was named Sueño Stereo because the original conceit was to do a bit of mischief and have two separate records,” says Bosio with a grin. Sadly, the label would have none of that experimental nonsense. Eager to recoup the initial investment, they pushed for a more commercial release. Sony had given us more freedom in that respect.” “We went back to the studio, started playing a chorus, and just like that, we wrote ‘Ella Usó Mi Cabeza Como Un Revólver' in a single session,” says the bassist. With its strains of Cerati's guitar, echoey electronic textures and an imperial keyboard line that evoked an aura of cinematic decadence, “Ella Usó Mi Cabeza Como Un Revólver” was not only Sueño's triumphant opening cut, but also a clear indication of how sophisticated and articulate the trio's vision had become. Flaunting their Beatles influences like never before, it was as powerful and finely crafted as anything by Radiohead or Massive Attack. “Gustavo was incredibly brave in his aesthetic choices,” says Alejandro Terán, who contributed string arrangements and played viola on the album. “Even though I didn't play on it, I have a soft spot for Sueño Stereo,” says González, who missed the sessions because he was busy working on Fito Páez's Circo Beat. ‘Ella Usó Mi Cabeza' is so epic, like a miniature rock opera. In reality, the zenith of Sueño Stereo — and, arguably, of the entire Argentine rock movement — arrives at the tail end of the album, when Soda bids farewell to the world and fades into oblivion in a suite of three interconnected songs inspired by Cerati's experiences with psychotropic substances: “Planta,” an orchestral rocker with Floydian undertones; “X-Playo,” the only surviving fragment of the shipwrecked ambient record; and “Moirè,” a delicate, hallucinogenic slice of folktronica with abstract lyrics (“cerrá la escotilla, nena, que no hay gravedad,”) and Cerati's voice sounding even more regal than usual. “It's meant to be the perfect goodbye,” explains Bosio. “Inspired by those Seventies records that ended with a medley, like Pink Floyd, or Paul McCartney and Wings. The trio traveled to London, where Cerati refined his vocal tracks, and the album was mixed by recording engineer Clive Goddard. “Gustavo didn't care for hi-hats, and the English happen to love them,” Alberti adds. “The finished album sounds so incredibly well balanced because it was mixed by someone who clearly knew what he was doing.” In his book Algún tiempo atrás — La vida de Gustavo Cerati, veteran journalist Sergio Marchi describes Cerati lunging at Alberti and grabbing him by the throat on a bus ride in Tegucigalpa during the Sueño tour. “Musically, we were in a moment of glory and could have continued making great records,” says Bosio. This wasn't about Zeta or Charly not being good enough musicians. “His creative leadership had become increasingly huge,” González agrees. Cerati's solo career vindicated him as one of the most transcendent artists in Latin music. Eventually, he reconciled with Bosio and Alberti for a successful comeback tour in 2007. There were even rumors of a new studio album.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paul T. Riddle knows that he's prone to shed a tear or two when the right moment strikes. He's the first to admit he gets choked up during soft-hearted TV advertisements or when “Silent Night” comes across grocery store speakers during the holiday season. “Mine and Toy's thing was the music,” says Riddle, a soft-spoken 71-year-old who shares stories in a steady drawl adopted from his South Carolina upbringing. And who could blame Riddle for showing a little emotion? For nearly a decade-and-a-half, he's simmered on a way to celebrate the country, soul, and Southern rock stew once brewed by his late friend on songs like “Take the Highway,” “Heard It in a Love Song” and, of course, “Can't You See.” This weekend, Riddle finally delivers a steaming plate of Caldwell-inspired melodies at Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Colorado, where his newly formed supergroup — Toy Factory Project — plays the tastemaking four-night event alongside Jason Isbell & the 400 Unit, Greensky Bluegrass, and Alison Krauss & Union Station. Toy Factory Project includes ace guitarman Marcus King, Dead & Co. bassist Oteil Burbridge, Blackberry Smoke frontman-guitarist Charlie Starr, and sought-after Nashville keys player Josh Shilling. We know what to keep – those great hooks and everything. Outside of that, I want us to put our stamp on it.” The project arrives after 13 years of start-and-stop planning from Riddle and a rotating cast of friends (Caldwell died in 1993; singer Doug Gray continued to front a touring version of the Marshall Tucker Band after Caldwell and Riddle left the group in 1984). Still, it wasn't until he saw a YouTube video of King belting “Can't You See” (“Ripping the neck off his grandaddy's 335,” Riddle says) that he knew it was time. He wrangled the band, including Burbridge, a supporter since the beginning, and decamped to Peter Frampton's studio in Nashville's Berry Hill neighborhood to lay down a few songs. Burbridge stuck with the project for years “100 percent because of Paul,” he says. Today, those songs are synonymous with a Southern sound that inspired a generation of players raised on rock & roll storytelling, honky-tonk riffs, and blues showmanship in equal measure. “[My grandfather would] have me on a pretty heavy regimen of Waylon Jennings, Marshall Tucker Band, George Jones and Merle Haggard,” King says. Marshall Tucker Band, JJ Grey & Mofro Team Up for Southern Rock Tour Marcus King Pays Tribute to Marshall Tucker Band With 'Can't You See' The Best of SXSW Day Two: Allegra Krieger, Bar Italia, Gary Clark Jr., and More And some of King's earliest guitar riffs were Caldwell covers. “The first time I got an overdrive pedal and I wanted to test it out, the go-to was ‘Can't You See,' he says. Toy Caldwell would turn over in his grave if he heard that. King's come a long way since testing out that pedal. Last month, he invited Starr, Shilling, and Riddle to crash a Grand Ole Opry performance. They teased Toy Factory Project with a rollicking rendition of “This Ol' Cowboy.” In the studio, band members approached the songs with fresh ears, swapping flute for fiddle or adding Hammond B3 organ for touches of warmth. Listeners shouldn't expect a carbon-copy of past hits with polished production. “It was the biggest sound — still is the biggest sound — I've heard in my headphones, and I've been a session player since I was young… We were just in there having a ball, and the record feels that way because of that.” Dr. Demento, Madcap Radio DJ Who Launched Weird Al's Career, Announces Retirement Bonnaroo Pivots to Full Refunds for Canceled Festival, 'Not Announcing Future Dates' Treasured Public Lands on the Auction Block in Trump's ‘Big Beautiful Bill' And when Toy Factory Project hits the stage for the first time this weekend, Riddle's likely to hear a few folks singing along to his friend's sweet melodies. When he does, it may be hard for him not to tear up at the sound.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum Teddi Mellencamp continues treatment for stage four cancer,  she is savoring quality time with the people she cares about most, including the mystery man she's been dating for nearly a month. On June 20, 2025, Mellencamp, 43, opened up on the latest episode of her “Diamonds in the Rough: Dear Diamonds” podcast to friend and RHOBH star Erika Jayne about the man she's been dating while navigating her divorce from husband Edwin Arroyave. The former couple, who share three children, announced their split in November before her stage four diagnosis and brain surgery in February. Although Arroyave has been supportive and even moved back in to help care for Mellencamp, they're moving forward with an amicable split. During her podcast, Mellencamp confirmed she's still dating the unidentified man that the Daily Mail photographed her with in early June, telling Jayne, 53, that her new beau is “really sweet and kind” and that she's been very honest about her complicated situation with him. A post shared by Diamonds in the Rough (@diamondsintherough.pod) While navigating her divorce and coping with learning her skin cancer, which she'd been battling since 2022, had metastasized to stage four, Mellencamp said she's had to be very intentional and direct as she explored dating. If it's not enough for you, I understand. “I mean, yes, my feelings will probably be hurting,” Mellencamp admitted, “but like, this is all I've got to give. When Jayne asked if she was “still dating the same guy,” Mellencamp replied, “I am still dating the same guy. And I haven't had to say any of those things. As an example, Mellencamp, who regularly rides horses with her 12-year-old daughter Slate, shared that earlier in the week, her beau “could, like, tell that I was down.” She said he didn't mind sitting with her and watching “like one million hours of horse show rounds. “Listen, you so deserve that,” Jayne told her, to which Mellencamp replied, “One, I know I deserve it and it's really nice. But, two, I'm like, ‘If for some reason you realize you need somebody that doesn't have three kids, one million activities to do, 87 podcasts, like (if) you want more time than I'm able to give, I would not be mad at you for not even a second.' Jayne, who clashed with Mellencamp when they were co-stars on RHOBH, said that she has met the entrepreneur's mystery man and witnessed how “sweet” he can be. She recalled on the podcast, “Do you know what he said to me in the driveway when I first met him and he had to move his car? I mean, he has a very sweet spirit about him.” Because you know, I felt whatit feels like to maybe never have another.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The boy band puts fans front & center for fun, escapist Vegas debut. LAS VEGAS — While New Kids on the Block might seem like a perfect fit for Las Vegas, the veteran boy band had somehow never found themselves with a Sin City residency — until Friday night (June 20). The Right Stuff residency kicked off night 1 at Dolby Live at Park MGM, with NKOTB gracing a stage previously headlined by Usher, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga, Mariah Carey and more superstars. But when the Boston boys were getting started 40 years ago, they had a different perception of Vegas than the entertainment destination it's become. “And if somebody said, ‘You guys are going to be doing Vegas in your 50s,' my thought probably back then would be like, ‘Oh no, no. But us doing this right now, I feel like we're being true to ourselves, really. I think we're just being really true to ourselves. There were definitely bells and whistles — like the high-flying moment that saw all five members hoisted up among the rafters in individual telephone booths to get as close as possible to every fan in the 5,000-capacity venue — but at its core, this was the New Kids show that their Blockhead superfans have come to expect. That is, the once-teenybopper pop stars (now ranging in age from 52 to 56) left every drop of energy, enthusiasm and love they had on the stage to put on a fun, escapist show in their new home of Vegas, with dates through February. For his part, Jonathan Knight is finding that he's able to enjoy things at this stage of the band's career more than those chaotic early days. “I think when we look back at that, nobody prepares you for this. To keep Friday night's show from becoming a blur, Billboard has rounded up the five best moments from New Kids' nonstop fun opening night. All these touches made it clear this was a special concert. The night's first aerial moment came when Jordan Knight performed his Billboard Hot 100 top 10 solo hit “Give It to You” and, inspired by the song's carnival-themed music video, he buckled himself into a Ferris wheel gondola that floated high across the stage. At first, it looked like they were only going to make it above the 100 and 200 sections — but then they kept elevating until they were eye to eye with the ecstatic fans in the balcony. (Though Wahlberg pointed out that his wife Jenny McCarthy was not among the posts: “She thought she would marry one of the Mötley Crüe,” he laughed.) “Do you, New Kids, take these Blockheads to be your forever fans, so long as we both shall live?” Wahlberg asked his bandmates, to which they all responded: “I do.” “Do you, Blockheads, take these New Kids to be your forever boy band, forsaking all other boy bands — that means *NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, O-Town, One Direction, all of them — so long as we both shall live?” Wahlberg cheekily asked the screaming crowd, who apparently had no trouble abandoning all those other groups to commit to New Kids on the Block once and for all. In addition to the quickie wedding, some other Vegas-specific touches included the boys' Rat Pack-inspired second act, with coordinated suits and a classic New Kids on the Block casino sign, plus a mash-up of Britney Spears' “Toxic” with Elvis Presley's “Viva Las Vegas” during their infamous quick change backstage camera segment. Speaking of those fans, they were front and center quite a few times throughout the concert. (As McIntyre told us ahead of the show: “We're gonna take care of our high rollers, you know what I'm saying? We gotta take care of our die-hards first.”) And nowhere was that love clearer than when Wahlberg got choked up reflecting on the four decades this fandom has stuck by their sides. “It's been forty years [as a band], 37 since we all found each other on various radio stations and MTV,” Wahlberg said, wiping away tears. A lot was made throughout the night of the boy band's longevity, and it doesn't seem like they have any plans to slow down soon. “We've been hanging tough for 40 years,” Wahlberg said before the final performance of (you guessed it) “Hangin' Tough,” the Hot 100-topping title track from their 1988 breakthrough album. Judging by the opening night crowd's enthusiasm, that shouldn't be a problem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two-hour concert spanned all four decades of their time as a band. LAS VEGAS — For New Kids on the Block‘s first-ever Las Vegas residency — which kicked off Friday night (June 20) at Dolby Live at Park MGM — the veteran boy band had a lot of ground to cover in their night 1 setlist. So how do you cover four decades of music in one two-hour concert? When Billboard caught up with the Kids on Friday ahead of their Sin City debut, they explained that they were trying to serve their Blockhead fanbase with the song selection while not alienating the casual Vegas fans just looking for a show while they're in town. “We want to keep it moving fast so they're entertained as well.” McIntyre made it clear that their superfans are always their main priority — putting it in terms Las Vegas can definitely understand. “We're gonna take care of our high rollers, you know what I'm saying?

Tom and Jerry: Forbidden Compass follows the iconic cat-and-mouse duo as they accidentally travel through time in a museum. Along their journey, they meet a group of intriguing new companions and become involved in a final showdown with mysterious forces. Produced by Warner Bros. Pictures in China, Tom and Jerry: Forbidden Compass will be distributed in the country by Wu Zhou Film Distribution Co. Ltd. 'Legend of Mecha Scholars' Gets Global Distribution In Ad Astra, DRock Cultural Exchange Initiative Bruce Lee & Jackie Chan Films Among Kung Fu Classics Set For AI Restorations Chinese director Zhang Gang helmed the project, after previously co-directing Kuiba 3. This is not the first time that Warner Bros. has adapted the Tom and Jerry IP into a localized version for an Asian market. This premiered as a series of shorts on Cartoon Network and HBO Go across various Asian territories, before a global rollout. Another series of Tom and Jerry shorts was also made for Japanese audiences. This year marks the 85th anniversary of Tom and Jerry, after the duo was first created in 1940 as an animated cartoon series by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It looks like drama is already bubbling in the “Real Housewives” world, again! Lisa Rinna, longtime star of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” is spilling some seriously hot tea about what really goes on behind the cameras. In a new interview, Rinna claimed there is significant “pre-planning” involved in the show, specifically orchestrated by producers. She even revealed that during filming, “an editor sits in the back room and writes down everything.” The actress-turned-reality-star, who spent eight seasons lighting up RHOBH with chaotic fashion and iconic one-liners, is finally confirming what fans have long suspected. Known for her bold looks, catchphrases, and never being far from the drama (hello, wine glass toss), Rinna was one of RHOBH's most talked-about figures. “There's a lot of people behind the scenes—a lot of people that make a show like that work,” Rinna said while on the “Don't Talk About The Husbands” podcast. You see us, say, at a lunch scene. It's set up before—everybody gets an email saying that it's coming up on Saturday, maybe in two weeks… You know that you're going to someone's house; you're going to show up at this time. She continued, “There's usually three cameras around you. There's a lot of pre-planning that goes on. Though Rinna announced her exit from RHOBH in early 2023, after years of stirring the pot and dividing the fanbase, she's not quite done with reality TV. With Season 14 of “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” bringing in new cast members and reigniting old feuds, fans are already questioning just how “real” reality TV is. So there's planning in that kind of stuff. There was waiting in the car a lot of times,” Rinna revealed. “Then they come out to your car, they mic you in your car—they have to put a mic on your back—and then they wait for something to happen.” Even her husband, actor Harry Hamlin, chimed in with a behind-the-scenes tidbit: “The amount of film that is actually run through those cameras relative to the amount that shows up on the TV screen… the editors go through hundreds and hundreds of hours of footage to find 42 minutes of film.” And speaking of editors, Rinna had even more to say. They literally have somebody in a back room. So let's say we're filming at someone's house — they would take a little back room and set up a monitor. So while the glitz, glam, and tears may look spontaneous, it turns out much of it is mapped out long before the first sip of rosé. If you're already missing Rinna's signature sass (and frankly, who isn't? ), you'll be happy to know she's stepping into another reality space. The new season is serving a spicy cocktail of Bravo-lebs, reality stars, Olympians, and our favorite contestant already, the best Kelce out there. With that stacked cast, expect nothing short of high-stakes deception, drama, and, of course, Lisa Rinna's signature smirk.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Details about Brand New Day, the fourth Tom Holland/MCU Spider-Man movie, have been basically nil ever since the project went from “thing Tom Holland was constantly getting asked about maybe happening” to “thing Tom Holland now constantly gets asked about definitely happening.” We know Holland's in it; we known that Spidey co-stars Zendaya and Jacob Batalon would pop up in it somewhere; we knew Stranger Things‘ Sadie Sink was somehow on board—and that was pretty much it. Now, though, THR has a new piece of casting information, and it is, as they say, a doozy: Turns out Jon Bernthal will also be appearing in the film, suggesting somebody in this movie's definitely getting punished. Bernthal made his formal entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe earlier this year, when he appeared as Frank “The Punisher” Castle in Disney+ series Daredevil: Born Again. That version of the character appeared to have been imported pretty much wholesale from Bernthal's earlier Netflix turns as the character, completely with no compunctions at all about killing anyone he deemed in need of punishment. Which is going to make for some interesting contrasts, when he runs into whatever's going on with Holland's Peter Parker in this latest film. The two characters have bumped heads frequently in comics, of course: Frank debuted, back in 1974, as a Spider-Man villain, his ruthlessness contrasting with Peter's baked-in idealism. (Things should presumably be more copacetic on set; Bernthal and Holland are reportedly old friends, having each helped the other rehearse for their auditions for their respective superhero roles.) Brand New Day is currently sitting on the Marvel calendar with a July 31, 2026 release date; Bernthal, meanwhile, is expected to also reprise his role as Castle for Born Again‘s second season, as well as a standalone Punisher feature.

Tetris Kelly: Tyla is hosting the Kids Choice Awards, and before the big show, we got her to talk about new music and so much more. Tyla: This is my first time not trying to think about it too much. Like, I'm literally just gonna be my vibe. Fun, I love partying, so this is a warehouse party, so it's my lane, so I'm just gonna have fun with the kids. Like, a while ago, I was shooting for Vogue, and they came to me, and they're like, “Hi, we are new group, KATSEYE,” and they wanted to sing “Water” for me. Like, especially the second week, I was vibing, yeah, and now I have some more in Europe and everything. I literally love The Smurfs and Rihanna being Smurfette.
