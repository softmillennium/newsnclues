                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology have discovered a key connection between high levels of iron in the brain and increased cell damage in people who have both Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. In the study, researchers found that the brains of people diagnosed with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease (DSAD) had twice as much iron and more signs of oxidative damage in cell membranes compared to the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease alone or those with neither diagnosis. The results point to a specific cellular death process that is mediated by iron, and the findings may help explain why Alzheimer's symptoms often appear earlier and more severely in individuals with Down syndrome. "We've known for a long time that people with Down syndrome are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease, but now we're beginning to understand how increased iron in the brain might be making things worse." Down syndrome is caused by having an extra third copy, or trisomy, of chromosome 21. The research team studied donated brain tissue from individuals with Alzheimer's, DSAD, and those without either diagnosis. They focused on the prefrontal cortex -- an area of the brain involved in thinking, planning, and memory -- and made several important discoveries: Together, these findings indicate increased ferroptosis, a type of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, Thorwald explained: "Essentially, iron builds up, drives the oxidation that damages cell membranes, and overwhelms the cell's ability to protect itself." The researchers paid close attention to lipid rafts -- tiny parts of the brain cell membrane that play crucial roles in cell signaling and regulate how proteins like APP are processed. They found that in DSAD brains, lipid rafts had much more oxidative damage and fewer protective enzymes compared to Alzheimer's or healthy brains. Notably, these lipid rafts also showed increased activity of the enzyme β-secretase, which interacts with APP to produce Aβ proteins. The combination of more damage and more Aβ production may promote the growth of amyloid plaques, thus speeding up Alzheimer's progression in people with Down syndrome, Finch explained. The team says their findings could help guide future treatments, especially for people with Down syndrome who are at high risk of Alzheimer's. Early research in mice suggests that iron-chelating treatments, in which medicine binds to the metal ions and allows them to leave the body, may reduce indicators of Alzheimer's pathology, Thorwald noted. "Medications that remove iron from the brain or help strengthen antioxidant systems might offer new hope," Thorwald said. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The idea seems futuristic: At ETH Zurich, various disciplines are working together to combine conventional materials with bacteria, algae and fungi. The common goal: to create living materials that acquire useful properties thanks to the metabolism of microorganisms -- "such as the ability to bind CO2 from the air by means of photosynthesis," says Mark Tibbitt, Professor of Macromolecular Engineering at ETH Zurich. An interdisciplinary research team led by Tibbitt has now turned this vision into reality: it has stably incorporated photosynthetic bacteria -- known as cyanobacteria -- into a printable gel and developed a material that is alive, grows and actively removes carbon from the air. The material can be shaped using 3D printing and only requires sunlight and artificial seawater with readily available nutrients in addition to CO2 to grow. "As a building material, it could help to store CO2 directly in buildings in the future," says Tibbitt, who co-initiated the research into living materials at ETH Zurich. "This is because the material can store carbon not only in biomass, but also in the form of minerals -- a special property of these cyanobacteria," reveals Tibbitt. They are highly efficient at photosynthesis and can utilize even the weakest light to produce biomass from CO2 and water." "We utilize this ability specifically in our material," says Cui, who is a doctoral student in Tibbitt's research group. This is significantly more than many biological approaches and comparable to the chemical mineralization of recycled concrete (around 7 mg CO2 per gram). Co-first author Dalia Dranseike: "In this way, we created structures that enable light penetration and passively distribute nutrient fluid throughout the body by capillary forces." Thanks to this design, the encapsulated cyanobacteria lived productively for more than a year, the materials researcher in Tibbitt's team is pleased to report. The researchers see their living material as a low-energy and environmentally friendly approach that can bind CO2 from the atmosphere and supplement existing chemical processes for carbon sequestration. "In the future, we want to investigate how the material can be used as a coating for building façades to bind CO2 throughout the entire life cycle of a building," Tibbitt looks ahead. There is still a long way to go -- but colleagues from the field of architecture have already taken up the concept and realised initial interpretations in an experimental way. "It was particularly challenging to scale up the production process from laboratory format to room dimensions," says the architect and bio-designer, who is also involved in this study. Ling is doing her doctorate at ETH Professor Benjamin Dillenburger's Chair of Digital Building Technologies. In her dissertation, she developed a platform for biofabrication that can print living structures containing functional cyanobacteria on an architectural scale. Thanks to the cyanobacteria, these can each bind up to 18 kg of CO2 per year -- about as much as a 20-year-old pine tree in the temperate zone. "The installation is an experiment -- we have adapted the Canada Pavilion so that it provides enough light, humidity and warmth for the cyanobacteria to thrive and then we watch how they behave," says Ling. On a structure covered with wooden shingles, microorganisms form a deep green patina that changes the wood over time: A sign of decay becomes an active design element that binds CO2 and emphasises the aesthetics of microbial processes. Dafne's Skin is a collaboration between MAEID Studio and Dalia Dranseike. The photosynthetic living material was created thanks to an interdisciplinary collaboration within the framework of ALIVE (Advanced Engineering with Living Materials). The ETH Zurich initiative promotes collaboration between researchers from different disciplines in order to develop new living materials for a wide range of applications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The deep ocean can often look like a real-life snow globe. As organic particles from plant and animal matter on the surface sink downward, they combine with dust and other material to create "marine snow," a beautiful display of ocean weather that plays a crucial role in cycling carbon and other nutrients through the world's oceans. Now, researchers from Brown University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have found surprising new insights into how particles sink in stratified fluids like oceans, where the density of the fluid changes with depth. In a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they show that the speed at which particles sink is determined not only by resistive drag forces from the fluid, but by the rate at which they can absorb salt relative to their volume. "It basically means that smaller particles can sink faster than bigger ones," said Robert Hunt, a postdoctoral researcher in Brown's School of Engineering who led the work. "There's value in having predictive power that's readily accessible." The study grew out of prior work by Hunt and Harris investigating neutrally buoyant particles -- those that sink to a certain depth and then stop. "We were testing a theory under the assumption that these particles would remain neutrally buoyant," Hunt said. "But when we observed them, they kept sinking, which was actually kind of frustrating." That led to a new theoretical model of how porosity -- specifically, the ability to absorb salt -- would affect the rate at which they sunk. Using 3D-printed molds, the team then created particles of varying shapes and sizes made from agar, a gelatinous material derived from seaweed. For spherical particles, smaller ones tended to sink faster. The results are surprising, the researchers said, and could provide important insights into how particles settle in more complex ecological settings -- either for understanding natural carbon cycling or for engineering ways of speeding up carbon capture in large bodies of water. "We're not trying to replicate full oceanic conditions," Harris said. "The approach in our lab is to boil things down to their simplest form and think about the fundamental physics involved in these complex phenomena. Then we can work back and forth with people measuring these things in the field to understand where these fundamentals are relevant." Harris says he hopes to connect with oceanographers and climate scientists to see what insights these new findings might provide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colorado State University researchers have published a paper in Science that describes a new and more efficient light-based process for transforming fossil fuels into useful modern chemicals. In it, they report that their organic photoredox catalysis system is effective even at room temperatures. That advantage could lower energy demands around chemical manufacturing in a variety of instances and could also reduce associated pollution, among other benefits. Their system - inspired by photosynthesis - uses visible light to gently alter the properties of chemical compounds. A single photon does not normally carry enough energy for these processes, said Miyake. By combining energy from two light particles, the team's system can perform super-reducing reactions - chemical changes that require a lot of energy to break tough bonds or add electrons - easily. Miyake said their system was tested on a group of chemical compounds called aromatic hydrocarbons - otherwise known as arenes. "Usually generating these reactions is difficult and energy intensive because the original bonds are so strong." Miyake is the director of that multi-institution research effort to transform chemical synthesis processes across many uses. "Photoredox catalysis has become indispensable for pharmaceutical development and other industries," said Covert. "Through the NSF Center for Sustainable Photoredox Catalysis, synthetic and computational chemists have teamed up to understand the fundamental chemical nature of how those catalysts function and, in so doing, found a new path that requires less heat and energy." "We built an all-star team of chemists to address these challenges and make a more sustainable future for this world," Miyake said. "The world has a timeclock that is expiring, and we must meet the urgent need for developing sustainable technologies before our current ways of doing things puts us to a place that we can't recover from."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In combination with renewable energy sources, this method offers a sustainable way to produce hydrogen and can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases. Unfortunately, large-scale production of hydrogen using this method is currently unfeasible due to the need for catalysts made from expensive rare earth metals. Consequently, researchers are exploring more affordable electrocatalysts, such as those made from diverse transition metals and compounds. Among these, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have attracted considerable attention as catalysts for the hydrogen generating side of the process, known as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), due to their favorable properties. However, they perform poorly in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which reduces overall efficiency. Previous studies suggest that Boron (B)-doping into TMPs can enhance both HER and OER performance, but until now, making such materials has been a challenge. In a recent breakthrough, a research team led by Professor Seunghyun Lee, including Mr. Dun Chan Cha, from the Hanyang University ERICA campus in South Korea, has developed a new type of tunable electrocatalyst using B-doped cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanosheets. Prof. Lee explains, "We have successfully developed cobalt phosphides-based nanomaterials by adjusting boron doping and phosphorus content using metal-organic frameworks. These materials have better performance and lower cost than conventional electrocatalysts, making them suitable for large-scale hydrogen production." Their study was published in the journal Small on March 19, 2025. The researchers used an innovative strategy to create these materials, using cobalt (Co) based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). They then subjected this material to a post-synthesis modification (PSM) reaction with sodium borohydride (NaBH4), resulting in the integration of B. An alkaline electrolyzer developed using the B-CoP0.5@NC/NF electrodes showed a cell potential of just 1.59 V at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, lower than many recent electrolyzers. Additionally, at high current densities above 50 mA cm-2, it even outperformed the state-of-the-art RuO2/NF(+) and 20% Pt-C/NF(−) electrolyzer, while also demonstrating long-term stability, maintaining its performance for over 100 hours. "Our findings offer a blueprint for designing and synthesizing next-generation high-efficiency catalysts that can drastically reduce hydrogen production costs," says Prof. Lee. "This is an important step towards making large-scale green hydrogen production a reality, which will ultimately help in reducing global carbon emissions and mitigating climate change.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study unexpectedly reveals that cells thrive on chaos. Across the sciences, rules and laws help us make sense of the world around us, whether applied to cosmic scales or subatomic ones. However, in the biological world, things are a bit more complicated. That's because nature is often full of biological exceptions, and so “rules of biology” are also considered broad generalizations rather than absolute facts that explain and govern all known life. Some of these broad generalizations include things like Allen's Law, which dictates that body shapes in endotherms (warm-blooded animals) adapt to climatic conditions—short and stocky helps retain heat in cold climates, while tall and lanky helps dissipate heat in warmer ones. Another “law,” known as Bergmann's rule, states that species of a broadly distributed clade tend to be larger in colder climates and smaller in warmer ones (though of course, as with most biological rules, exceptions apply). At first glance, this new rule—called “selectively advantageous instability,” or SAI—seems to defy the underpinning assumptions of life in general, and pushes against the current assumption that life craves stability and a conservation of resources. While nature does tend toward stability (it's one reason why we see so many hexagonal shapes in the wild, including honeycombs and insect eyes), USC molecular biologist John Towers argues that instability in biological components like proteins and genes can actually be helpful to cells. These states allow for greater genetic diversity, which in turn can make organisms more adaptable. This indicates that SAI in these components is a necessary biological function. This energy-requiring process of mutation instability can introduce deleterious cells that contribute to aging, while also inducing other types of damage and dysfunction. “Aging has proven to be difficult to define, but most definitions include an increased chance of death with age, and decreased reproductive fitness with age,” the paper reads. “SAI can create a cost for the replicator in terms of energy and/or materials, and this cost might be interpreted in terms of promoting aging.” Dinos Had Cancer, Too, According to a New Study</p>
