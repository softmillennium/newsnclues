                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Austin Metcalf, a 17-year-old football player from Frisco, Texas, tragically passed away in the arms of his twin brother last week (April 2) after being stabbed at a high school track meet. Karmelo Anthony, a 17-year-old fellow student, was apprehended and charged with first-degree murder. Conspiracy theories soon started to emerge, with the most notable being one that claimed that the attack was motivated by revenge, with Anthony retaliating against Metcalf's supposed bullying. Speaking at a press conference last Tuesday (April 8), Alexander directly addressed the online rumors. According to the representative—who works with Next Generation Action Network (NGAN), a social justice advocacy organization—the narrative of Metcalf having bullied Anthony before the stabbing has not only derailed public perception of the case but has led to graphic threats against Anthony's family. “They've received racist messages, including images of Black children with knives stuck in their heads.” The narrative, initially put forth by Anthony's online supporters without evidence, was spread in an attempt to help the teenager with his upcoming trial, however, according to Alexander, it ended up having the opposite effect. The stabbing took place at Kuykendall Stadium in Frisco, where the two students—each from a different high school—were attending a match between their schools. An arrest report later revealed that the fatal altercation began over something trivial: a chair. Police say Metcalf told Anthony he was sitting under his team's tent and asked him to move. According to a witness, Anthony then reached into his backpack and threatened Metcalf, saying, “Touch me and see what happens.” At that point, Anthony took a knife out of his backpack, stabbed his rival in the chest, and ran away. “I did it,” Anthony said after being apprehended and coming to his senses, asking officers if Metcalf was going to be ok and if his actions constituted self-defense. Anthony's attorney, Deric Walpole, confirmed that they intend to pursue a self-defense argument. “I don't have any reason to think it wasn't self-defense at this time,” he said in an interview with local media. With two weeks to go until Karmelo Anthony's bond hearing, supporters on each side have started an unlikely GoFundMe battle, with two donation pages being created, highlighting the stark division the case has created. God will take care of us till we meet again.” Karmelo Anthony's fundraiser, on the other hand, was reported to have collected at least $280,000 for his defense. However, it has since been taken down for unknown reasons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every year, dozens of bills reach the governor's desk in New Hampshire. But as happens every year, some more unique bills were considered too. In New Hampshire, legislative rules require each bill to be granted a hearing, a committee vote, and a vote on the House or Senate floor, meaning ones that would be swiftly killed if filed in other states will at least get some airtime in New Hampshire. “It's always been put to me as this kind of unique thing we do here,” Southern New Hampshire University civic scholar Dean Spiliotes said in an interview with Seacoastonline in 2024. “Basically anybody can get a hearing for some issue of concern to them.” It's still illegal to keep animals like squirrels and raccoons as pets in New Hampshire, despite an effort by some Republican lawmakers. Rep. James Spillane, R-Deerfield, sponsored HB 251, which would've allowed rehabilitated raccoons and gray squirrels to be kept as pets without a permit if a wildlife rehabilitation facility determined that the animal could not survive in the wild. Eight Republican representatives and two senators also sponsored the bill. During the bill's hearing, representatives from the Humane Society and New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said that keeping these animals as pets come with risks like physical harm from unpredictable behavior and the spread of diseases like rabies. Both the proposal for a new state flag and state animated film were both killed with little fanfare when they made it to the House floor. But a bid for a new state marsupial, sponsored by Sen. Donovan Fenton, D-Keene, made it almost all the way to Gov. Rep. James Spillane, R-Deerfield, was back again with a bill to repeal the ban on black jacks, slung shots and metallic knuckles in New Hampshire for the third year in a row. Rep. Juliet Harvey-Bolia, R-Tilton, sponsored this year's bill to make gold and silver recognized as a legal form of currency and be accepted as payment for any transaction in the state if the buyer and seller agree on its value. New Hampshire kept with its tradition of refusing to name state holidays this year by shooting down a bill to honor Daniel Webster with a state holiday. It would have also “encouraged” schools to commemorate the day with educational activities. While representatives who supported the bill said it would help teach students about Webster, opponents said it would add more work for teachers and was just more “clutter.” “I am against creating more days that are nice, they're always of someone important and interesting but they don't do anything,” said Rep. Carol McGuire, R-Epsom. One bill, filed by Rep. Aidan Ankarberg, R-Rochester, would've set up a state commission to take testimony and reports about instances of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) within the “skies and territory” of New Hampshire. According to NASA, UAPs are “observations of events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena.” UAP is the new name for objects formerly known as UFOs and the term is supposed to encompass objects seen in the water as well. Rep. John Cloutier, R-Claremont, said at a committee hearing in January that the purpose of the commission would be to seek out people who witnessed things they couldn't explain. "Now we have citizens, be it one or a thousand, who have come before us with things in the sky, we had New Jersey of late, of mystery drones flying around, and there's no one right now who can take testimony or evidence, whatever it may be.” However, some representatives didn't think it was necessary. “What does this got to do with the function of the state of New Hampshire and our authority, to go after UFOs? I just think this is a total waste of time and effort,” said Rep. Michael Harrington, R-Strafford. “Just because someone comes up with an idea doesn't mean we should even be considering it as a bill.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American artist, filmmaker and a ‘ufologist celebrity' Jeremy Corbell has been publicly sharing the video that left him stunned over the ‘implications'. He has previously leaked footage from the US forces and shared this latest clip on his social media earlier this week. The clip does appear to show a huge disc weaving in and out of the clouds with co-ordinates indicating it was filmed somewhere over Afghanistan and Pakistan. Corbell claims the video captures unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and that officials have admitted it's a ‘disc'. Corbell claims US officials said the craft ‘displayed abrupt movement and intelligent control', with it seeming to suddenly change directions in footage. It's believed the object is somewhere between 200 and 400 metres in diameter but the exact size is apparently still being debated. There's no heat signature in the video, and nothing you'd expect ‘for a normal aircraft'. And Corbell says it's ‘astonishing' that a UFO with a shape like this could move about without emitting heat signatures. “You do not see plumes of heat coming off this disc-shaped object,” he explained. “This was captured on a thermal sensor - it should have detected heat if any traditional propulsion was present. During an episode of their podcast Weaponised, his cohost George Knapp said the source is ‘legit'. “It was not supposed to be made public. The pair say they spent over two years validating the clips with a number of sources – apparently including people who work in official US government UFO programmes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mumbai— The trailer for Jenn Osborne's upcoming supernatural thriller Holy Ghost has just dropped, offering a chilling glimpse into a story that's as emotionally resonant as it is terrifying. Far from being just another haunted tale, Holy Ghost explores themes of redemption, buried secrets, and spiritual reckoning, set against the backdrop of a remote American town steeped in mystery. The film marks a departure from standard jump-scare fare, opting instead for psychological depth and emotional stakes. But her account of the rescue raises chilling questions—she claims she was saved by a police officer who had been dead for years. The trailer teases a dark unraveling of truth, layered with paranormal tension and emotional introspection. Osborne delivers a compelling performance as the determined detective grappling with forces she can't fully explain. Holy Ghost is an exploration of how the past refuses to die—both literally and metaphorically.” Directed by Shravan Tiwari, best known for Murshid, Holy Ghost is set to release in theatres across India on August 1, 2025, with distribution by Cinépolis India. With its chilling premise, strong performances, and layered storytelling, Holy Ghost is poised to leave a haunting mark on the horror genre.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For how great Supernatural is, it's a classic example of a TV series that might have stretched its story a little too far, as the fan-consensus best episode should have been the true finale for the show. Running for 15 seasons, Supernatural is largely placed near the top of the best CW shows as it explores the various exploits of Sam and Dean Winchester as they hunt monsters, demons, biblical forces, and other supernatural entities. Still, there came a time when Supernatural felt like it had run its course, extending way beyond the initial ending that creator Eric Kripke had in mind. Supernatural's series finale ended the show on relatively strong terms, though it was somewhat controversial. Of course, there is no objective answer to what episode can be someone's favorite. One of the most significant aspects of "Swan Song" was the original plan Erik Kripke had for it when creating Supernatural, which could have been perfect. While he likely didn't have the concrete details planned out for where exactly the narrative would go, Kripke intended to hit 100 episodes, so Supernatural could go into syndication, which would allow the series to keep bringing in a hefty revenue stream long after it ended. Eric Kripke ended up stepping down as showrunner following season 5, with long-time Supernatural writer Sera Gamble taking over for seasons 6 and 7. Supernatural garnered four other showrunners (including Sera Gamble) over the show's remaining ten seasons. In an interview with EW, Kripke explained his reasoning for leaving Supernatural: I knew that we were closing this chapter and opening a new one. It felt like it was the right time to take a step back and focus on new projects, but still keep my grubby little mitts in the show. I really think after five years of all of my crap, to have someone who has a fresh perspective and a fresh energy on these characters and this universe is healthy for the show. We try really hard not to do the same thing. Eric Kripke's idea for five seasons is seen throughout Supernatural, as much of what the show had been building towards had finally been realized by the time "Swan Song" aired. It's hard to justify ending a show when it is arguably the most popular series airing on a given network, and that is exactly what happened with Supernatural. It makes sense on The CW's part: Sam, Dean, and Castiel had grown to be extremely beloved by fans who were willing to see their various shenanigans for as long as the show was willing to run. While there have been spectacular moments during Supernatural's latter 10 seasons, it's entirely justified to think the show shouldn't have continued past the originally planned five seasons. Supernatural is a TV show well known for following a procedural formula in many cases, but these episodes broke the mold in unforgettable ways. There are a variety of reasons why Supernatural should have ended with season 5. Sam ended up sacrificing himself to save humanity, while Dean ended up choosing his own path following Sam's sacrifice, something he had struggled to do since he was a child. On top of that, it's hard to get more epic than ending in a showdown between Lucifer and the archangel Michael. Supernatural had evolved into a biblical epic by the time season 5 came to an end, and it was jaw-dropping. A lot of the best TV shows know when to end their story. A tightly-written, five-season thrill ride that Supernatural could have been if it had ended with "Swan Song" would have elevated the show's legend. Supernatural newcomers should definitely watch every episode at least once, but some episodes are more worthy of a rewatch than others. That didn't happen, and Supernatural ended up telling stories for 15 years, with Sam, Dean, Castiel, and the rest of the recurring cast finding new monsters to fight and new world-ending scenarios to deal with. Supernatural will always have a lasting legacy in television history, and being able to span 15 seasons without any massive dips in quality is impressive on its own. Seeing Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki playing Dean and Sam for 15 years was special in its own way, and the show never outright tarnished its legacy, but some part of Supernatural will always feel like "Swan Song" should have been the end of its story. Supernatural is a television series that follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who were raised by their father to hunt and combat supernatural entities after losing their mother to a demonic force. Traversing the American landscape in their '67 Chevy Impala, they face numerous paranormal threats. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. There were many great writers who worked on The Twilight Zone, but the show's original creator Rod Serling penned a lot of its best episodes. Even though 2025's How to Train Your Dragon didn't feature David Tennant reprising his original role, there are ways for him to appear in the sequels. Nicolas Cage has played plenty of eccentric and unhinged characters throughout his career, but none have been weirder than his fake real-life writer. Neve Campbell's upcoming return as Maggie in The Lincoln Lawyer season 4 makes her breaking a 25-year TV career record much more likely. Bradley Whitford's character in The Diplomat season 3 creates an exciting reunion and serves as a reminder to watch one of the greatest dramas ever.</p>

These are the three I recommend most to family and friends Testing robot vacuums is always a fun experience, but many of them, excluding the Roborock Saros Z70, have gotten somewhat stagnant on their innovations. The Matic completely redefines the robot vacuum and does it so well that it outperforms many other, more expensive competitors. It's shaped more like a robot than a robot vacuum, with a rectangular brush roller and mop housing at the front and an 8-inch tall body that contains the robot's debris bag and water tank. This robot is intelligent enough to see stubborn messes and go over them accordingly. To do this, the Matic is equipped with five RGB cameras that continuously monitor its surroundings. Inside, an Nvidia GPU powers its AI capabilities, including 3D mapping, image recognition, and real-time decision-making. Also: 10 ways to maximize your robot vacuum's cleaning efficiency and battery life During testing, I tossed many obstacles on my floors and was rewarded with an efficient, intelligent robot vacuum unlike anything I've ever seen. The Matic recognizes the obstacles even if they appear after it begins cleaning, and it doesn't hiccup to redirect itself like other robots do. The Matic returns to charge sporadically during a cleaning session. On a day when my kids left a mess of art supplies in a room while the Matic was cleaning, I watched it return to charge and weave around various objects on the floor that hadn't been there minutes prior, including the glue gun's cord. Also: I tested the new Dreame X50 Ultra for months, and here's my buying advice This robot always knows where it is in your home. And it can also make decisions according to its location, like taking another route to its dock when something temporarily blocks the shorter one. But a robot scanning your entire house like this begs the question of how secure it is. Also: The top 10 robot vacuums ZDNET readers are buying in 2025 If you do, the robot transmits data through an encrypted cloud connection. Instead of a hard plastic dustbin, this robot has a soft, clear bag that holds all the waste -- even the dirty water. Each bag lasts about a week, though your mileage may vary, and costs around $2. But never having to throw out a robot vacuum's dirty water tank after it's seemingly curdled at the dock is priceless. As a result, the robot is efficient and follows a unique checkerboard cleaning pattern to cover areas, followed by edge cleaning. Also: The latest robot vacuum innovation will leave clean freaks drooling This is the fastest-moving robot vacuum I've tested, but it's meant to be more of a household companion that can clean and maintain your floors. An area of my home that takes other robots about 90 minutes to vacuum and mop takes Matic about five hours. As a redesigned robot vacuum, the Matic looks more inviting for kids and pets, and even comes with stickers to decorate it. The Matic's future is perhaps its most outstanding feature. It is a household robot that can vacuum and mop, equipped with an Nvidia GPU to power its computational capabilities. The Matic team continuously improves its software, adding features like edge cleaning, the new Android app, and future promises like voice and gesture control.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's a sense throughout the book that these people are modern versions of saints, that they're performing something sacred in our increasingly secular world. It is a really compelling argument, made by historian Darrin McMahon in his Divine Fury: A History of Genius, that during the Enlightenment, when people became more rationalist, less religious, we still craved this sense of the divine. Where you might once have thought that a miracle was attributable to the Virgin Mary, now the miracle is: how did Van Gogh's paintings happen? There is this  deep hunger within all of us for the world not to be mundane, for there to be things that are still extraordinary within it. In classical times, you were possessed by “a genius”. The muse of poetry or whatever spoke through you. The argument in the book really is about this category of special people and what that does to us and to them. Part of that is these enablers who made sure the folios weren't destroyed and forgotten. Because there is something extraordinary going on in those plays, but then there's a whole other process that involves lots of people. There's a bad version of this book that is falsely egalitarian and implies that there is no such thing as extraordinary achievement. You're hard-pressed to look at the plays of Shakespeare and think that. So, yeah, I'm not trying to argue that great achievement doesn't exist, but I think which achievements we choose to praise and flag up often has a political dimension to it too, which is worth exploring. The outsider who burns brightly and sputters out early. I find that really interesting because it isn't at all the idea of the artist that you have before then, If you take someone like a Rembrandt, he was painting portraits of rich Dutch people. There was no sense that in order to market himself, he needed to be wasting away in a cupboard somewhere. It's only when you get to the Romantics that we get so into the idea that great art has this terrible cost to people. Susan Sontag wrote about tuberculosis being part of that story. Tuberculosis, which spiked as people moved into cities, has a lot of symptoms that are quite similar to all the things that people used to say about Romantic poets. And that's hard to separate out from the rise of capitalism. The idea that artists don't rely on patronage any more. One of the things that's really interesting is the hunger for people who achieve things to have had interesting biographies and the slight sense of disappointment when they don't, as if we feel like we've been cheated. The book is also very much about science and also about pseudoscience – when science gets too big for its boots. Someone like Francis Galton, who used to be very famous but has been airbrushed out of history by embarrassed institutions. He was an incredible 19th-century polymath, a half-cousin of Charles Darwin from the same very talented family. He came to be interested in the idea of genius. And that gets him to eugenics, which is the idea that you can “improve a population” by only letting the smart people have babies. I used to work for the New Statesman magazine, which was founded by Beatrice and Sidney Webb, who were Fabian socialists. I wrote in my last book, Difficult Women, about Marie Stopes, the great contraceptive pioneer, who was also madly interested,  until the [19]30s, it was a respectable scientific endeavour. Because people hadn't yet had the vivid proof about what happened when this ideology was put into practice. When you put them all together, you begin to realise that we have these very deep ideas about human worth and that we're always fighting over them. [ Difficult Women book review: Whirlwind tour of feminismOpens in new window ] One of the other themes is that just because somebody is good at something, it doesn't mean they're necessarily good at anything else. But that seems to be a common fallacy. Yes, the book ends with Elon Musk, who I think is a great demonstration of this. It's hard for people on the left to acknowledge that he did have great success in business because of personal qualities. He's not purely a lucky idiot who wandered into his success with Tesla and SpaceX. However, the last six months have shown that he isn't good at everything. If I may say something controversial, maybe he also is quite gullible. He seems to fall for a lot of conspiracy theories. Just because you've had great success in one area, you should still be humble about all the other areas. Humility doesn't seem to come with most of these characters. You can take two people of absolutely equal achievements and the bigger narcissist will probably get called a genius more. I think that there are these people who have those magnetic qualities to them. You can't be a genius on your own. It's something that gets conferred on you by other people. You're a writer with the Atlantic magazine and often cover politics. Some of these themes feed into what's happening right now, such as the assault on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). I have my own reservations about some aspects of DEI, but the crudeness of that assault uses language about excellence being damped down by it. Is there a resurgence of the genius myth happening right now? One of the things I argue in the book is that every age has its own different template of genius, which tells you a lot about that society. Our current one is the tech superman, these brilliant start-up founders who have an insight that no one else does. So, yeah, the dynamism of the private sector contributed enormously to its success, but taxpayers' money was ultimately also part of the story of what allowed it to thrive. It's really tempting for people to believe that they made it all on their own, whereas what you usually need is talent, plus luck, plus society that lets you achieve stuff. [ Elon Musk sees humanity's purpose as a facilitator of superintelligent AI. As you point out, there are millions of people who never got that opportunity. Things like the implicit bias test don't really seem to predict very well who is actually racist in real life. But go back and look at someone as brilliant a scientist as George Washington Carver, who was black and therefore never got to go to school. So for all that we are now in this period of backlash, I think you have to say that the small efforts that we've made towards allowing more people to realise their potential come against this background of a huge amount through human history of wasted talent. I'm thinking about all the children who died in war or  starved to death. There's a quote from Stephen Jay Gould about people who got very into preserving bits of Einstein's brain. He said he was less interested in the exact form of Einstein's brain than in the people who were just as brilliant but who died working in sweatshops or cotton fields.</p>
