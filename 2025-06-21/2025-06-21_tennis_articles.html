                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu took a trip down to Queen's Club on Saturday to watch her US Open mixed doubles partner Carlos Alcaraz. The British No1 withdrew from the Berlin Open this week as she continues to manage back pain after a spasm. She is due to compete in Eastbourne next week but before that was spotted on the Queen's Club balcony with Myah Petchey, the daughter of her coach Mark, watching her friend Alcaraz beat fellow Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-4 to reach the HSBC Championships final. Among the more eye-catching pairings was one featuring two former US Open singles champions. 'I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma,' said Alcaraz earlier this week. ‘I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. But it wasn't a minute, so...' I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament. 'I've known Emma since a really long time ago, so we know each other. I have a really good relationship with her. 'We are going to enjoy it for sure. I will try to put my doubles skill on it. Raducanu has been drawn to face American Ann Li in the first round at Eastbourne, with a possible second-round clash with two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In March, Draper won his first career Masters 1000 title on the hard courts at Indian Wells, taking down Denmark's Holger Rune in the final. Looking to complete the set and reach a grass-court ATP final, Draper took on Czechia's Jiri Lehecka in the Queen's semi-finals. Reacting to Draper's defeat, Queen's tournament director Jamie Murray gave his verdict on the Brit's Wimbledon chances. Talking to Claire Balding on BBC Sport after the match, Murray suggested whether the defeat would affect Draper's chances of winning Wimbledon. “There's absolutely no reason to stress or panic about what might happen at Wimbledon,” he said. Not only does Murray think there's no reason to panic, but he still considers Draper to be one of the favorites for the title. “He will be absolutely one of the favorites behind [Jannik] Sinner and [Carlos] Alcaraz heading into that tournament. Reaching the Queen's semi-finals, Draper guaranteed himself a top-four seeding at Wimbledon. Keen to play down the top-four seeding after winning his quarterfinal match on Friday, Draper chose not to get ahead of himself. “I keep being asked by journalists about the top four seeding. Draper will now rest up ahead of Wimbledon, a tournament one ex-British star thinks he will tackle with ‘a lot of confidence'. 1977 Australian Open finalist John Lloyd weighed in with his thoughts on Draper's performance against Lehecka, highlighting the shot that let him down. “It's difficult to be critical of him, the first few rounds he wasn't playing at his best, but he was getting through it,” said Lloyd. “Today, his serve just disappeared a little bit during the crucial periods, and at this level, if you're playing someone who's playing as well as Lehecka, you can be in trouble, but it can happen to anybody.” There's no question that Draper will have the crowd on side once more when he makes his fourth Wimbledon appearance later this month. He has yet to reach the third round at Wimbledon, statistically his worst-performing Grand Slam event. Draper will certainly be hoping to make a deep run this time around, heading to SW19 as the number four seed. The 2025 Wimbledon tournament is scheduled to begin on Monday, June 30.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tennis star, who pulled out of the recent French Open, won by Carlos Alcaraz in a thrilling final against Jannik Sinner, and is also set to miss Wimbledon, is alleged to have been having a lengthy affair with model Azuki Oguchi, with their relationship having been recently reported on by Japanese tabloid Shukan Bunshun. The 35-year-old, who climbed as high as fourth in the world back in 2015, said: "I deeply apologize for causing discomfort to everyone who supports me: tennis fans, associations, sponsors, and other related parties, and for their concern and inconvenience due to my dishonest behavior." "Additionally, I deeply regret making my wife and children feel hurt. He continued: "Moving forward, in order to fulfill my role as a responsible member of society, I will focus solely on tennis competitions and achieving results. "We will do everything possible to regain their trust." Nishikori, who has two children with Yamauchi, was pictured visiting Oguchi's apartment recently, with photos published by Shukan Bunshun also showing them leaving the building together. While their relationship ended in 2023, they later resumed it in 2024, with Nishikori reportedly telling Oguchi he no longer loved his wife, and that they were only together for their two children. The first Asian player to reach a Grand Slam final, the 2014 U.S. Open he lost to Marin Cilic, Nishikori was forced into pulling out of the French Open earlier this month due to injury. He will also miss Wimbledon too, which is set to get underway at the end of June. Nishikori is currently ranked 66th in the world, with his most recent showing him have to retire against Karen Khachanov during the Geneva Open last month. However, he was forced to retire from the event, which led to him pulling out of the French Open, and now Wimbledon. Peacock has your favorite sports, shows, and more all in one place.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jiri Lehecka reached his first grass-court final Saturday at the HSBC Championships, where he put an end to British No. The 23-year-old Lehecka weathered a passionate west London crowd and an inspired fightback from Draper to triumph 6-4, 4-6, 7-5. After dropping his first set of the week at the ATP 500 at Queen's Club, Lehecka dug into a nervy deciding-set tussle before powering into the fifth and biggest final of his career. With his two-hour, seven-minute victory, Lehecka is the first Czech man to reach a tour-level final on grass since Tomas Berdych at Wimbledon in 2010. He faces top seed and former Queen's champion Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday's final. The second-seeded Draper was aiming to join record five-time champion Andy Murray as the only British male singles winners at the event, but he was unable to draw on his explosive arsenal. The 23-year-old will, however, return to a career-high No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday, having secured a Top 4 seeding at Wimbledon. “I've really felt the home support all week, it's a real advantage and it helps drive me on,” said Draper.

Yet Lehecka regrouped with the consistent form that he has displayed all week to record his second Top 10 win of the season and level his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Draper at 2-2. Lehecka, who earned his 100th tour-level victory by defeating Briton Jacob Fearnley in the quarter-finals, missed last year's grass swing due to a back injury. After reaching the quarter-finals in Stuttgart last week, Lehecka became the only semi-finalist at Queen's not to have dropped a set en route. The two-time ATP Tour champion, Lehecka is up five spots to No. 25 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, just three spots from his career high.

She will face first-time singles finalist Wang Xinyu for the title. Marketa Vondrousova has recovered some grass-court magic at Berlin Tennis Open by HYLO. 1 Aryna Sabalenka 6-2, 6-4 in their semifinal meeting at Berlin on Saturday. The Czech Vondrousova needed 1 hour and 21 minutes to level their head-to-head at four wins apiece. "When I saw the field here, I was like, ‘OK, let's just try to win the first round,' and then, you know, now this is happening." Vondrousova is into her first final since she won the Wimbledon title nearly two years ago. Her opponent on Sunday will be a fellow unseeded player: Chinese qualifier Wang Xinyu. In the later semifinal, Wang took down 2021 Berlin champion Liudmila Samsonova 6-4, 6-1 to make her first WTA singles final. It will be the first meeting between Vondrousova and Wang. Top win: Despite her previous successes against Sabalenka, this is the first time Vondrousova has beaten her while Sabalenka was ranked World No. In fact, it is the Czech's first career win over any reigning World No. Vondrousova had previously been 0-3 against players who were ranked No. Another grass-court stunner: Vondrousova had only won two tour-level matches on grass at the start of the 2023 season, but that did not stop her from peaking at that year's Wimbledon, where she carved her way to the title ranked World No. But this week, the Czech once again summoned her best on grass. Match moments: Sabalenka came into Saturday's showdown 7-0 in semifinals this year, but Vondrousova was prepared to upend that stat. Taking returns early, Vondrousova raced through the opening set without losing serve. Sabalenka found a backhand winner off of a drop shot to take an quick 2-0 lead in the second set, but Vondrousova broke back at love straight away. The Czech then found some incredible forehand winners to break for 5-4. Serving for the match, Vondrousova quickly fell behind 0-40 and it appeared a twist was in store. She surpasses Samsonova, who won this title as a 106th-ranked qualifier in 2021. "This week has been a dream for me," Wang told Andrea Petkovic on court. For me, it was really just to enjoy the stage." Wang is a Grand Slam doubles champion (2023 Roland Garros with Hsieh Su-wei) and also won the Berlin doubles title last year (with Zheng Saisai), but she had gone 0-6 in her first six Hologic WTA Tour singles semifinals. That all changed when Wang dismissed Samsonova in 76 minutes for her fourth straight Top 20 win this week. Marketa Vondrousova defeated top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka in the Berlin Tennis Open semifinals on Saturday, reaching her first final since she won the 2023 Wimbledon championship. She will face first-time singles finalist Wang Xinyu for the title.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There wasn't much that worked in Holger Rune's favor in the quarter-final of the Queen's tournament in London, which serves a s a warm-up tournament for Wimbledon which which starts 30 June. The 22-year-old Dane lost 2-1 in sets (7-6, 6-7, 6-2) to Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut and never even had a single chance to break the Spaniard's serve during the game. A frustrated Rune therefore sought advice and guidance from his box, where Lars Christensen sat without an answer on a thoroughly bad day at the office for the Danish tennis star. "What's wrong with my forehand?, asked Holger Rune I have made five unforced errors. "Okay, so what are you here for? Rune also vented his frustration at Lars Christensen with the words: "It's not about you, its about me. Rune has had a host of coaches throughout his career with Lars Christensen, Patrick Mouratoglou, Kenneth Carlsen, Boris Becker and Severin Lüthi having had the responsibility of coaching the Dane at different times of his career. Lars Christensen has a reputation of being an extremely calm coach but it seems clear that during times, when Rune seems to be struggling mentally, the Danish star needs somebody to pump him up, bring advice and someone who is a little bit more proactive from the box. Rune will now see if he can get the balance right at Wimbledon, which will be the next big challenge for him in a week's time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The college tennis season may be over, but two Tar Heels are still racking up wins. The UNC women's tennis duo of Reese Brantmeier and Alanis Hamilton were one of the most dominant collegiate doubles teams in the country last season. Now they will see how they stack up against some of the best in the world. Brantmeier and Hamilton came from behind in two straight matches to clinch a berth in the US Open Tennis Championships. They were competing in the American Collegiate Wildcard playoffs, and the winners are granted a main draw wild-card entry into the prestigious tournament. Brantmeier and Hamilton lost the first set of their semi-finals match against the UCLA duo 6-4 before winning sets two and three both by 6-4 scores. They narrowly won the second set 7-6 (4) before taking a hard fought third match 7-6 (10-5). Brantmeier and Hamilton won six straight points to win the tiebreaker and ultimately the match. The match lasted for over three and a half hours. Brantmeier and Hamilton were a dominant pairing for the Heels last year. The duo were a big part of UNC's ACC championship and run to the national championship semi-finals. The US Open will take place on August 25th - September 7th. It will be held at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York. 21+ (18+ D.C.) and present in select states (for KS, in affiliation with Kansas Star Casino).</p>

I was in a rush all the time. “So it was kind of I can't approach the next point in an appropriate way. But yeah, I mean, they have to know where to put the clock, you know, right after the point or wait a little bit. “Because after long points, long rallies, I finish the point at the net, I should have a little bit more time just to approach the next point in a proper way. Novak Djokovic leaves former ATP star ‘more than surprised' with motivation claims Alcaraz's latest win was his 15th-consecutive victory, after lifting the trophy in both Rome and Roland-Garros – and was asked how he manages to ‘dig deep' so regularly. “Yeah, it's really important to think positive all the time,” analysed the four-time Grand Slam champion. “Today there were a few moments that I didn't think positive at all. So I think that's the most important thing. So probably negative thoughts come to your mind in a few moments, but the most important thing is you don't give up. You just have to keep playing and know that the opponent was going to give you chances to put yourself into the match again. Just keep fighting and show the opponent that if he wants to beat you, he has to play at his best level. Alcaraz will next play veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in the last four.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a $1 million prize pool and 16 high-profile ATP-WTA pairings set to compete during Fan Week, the United States Tennis Association (USTA) is swinging big, and Connors believes it's a clear signal that tennis is trying to modernize to stay competitive in an evolving sports and entertainment landscape. The draw will feature some of the sport's most recognizable names teaming up in combinations rarely seen in elite play. The final match will adopt a slightly extended structure with sets to six games but will retain the no-ad and 10-point tiebreak format if sets are split. In a recent episode of his ‘Advantage Connors' podcast, which he co-hosts with his son Brett, the 72-year-old Hall of Famer offered candid thoughts on the initiative. “Yeah, I mean, it seems like they've changed the scoring a bit to bring in the big names and try to fill the stadium for another four or five days, maybe,” Connors said. While acknowledging that drawing star players and shortening matches could generate attention, Connors expressed concern about the long-term direction of tennis and its place among other fast-growing racquet sports. Pickleball and Padel, this new sport coming in, are starting to wedge their way into the tennis conversation. They're easier to pick up, and you get better at them faster than you do with tennis,” he noted. 1 emphasized that these recent changes point to a deeper concern of sustaining tennis's relevance among younger generations. “How do we get them back out on public courts, in high schools, and on college teams, like it was in the '70s and '80s? At this rate, pretty soon they might say you can't hit more than four balls in a point. Maybe that's the next step, even for singles. Maybe that's what it's going to take,” Connors joked.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu once dreamed of being a Wimbledon ball girl - not knowing the role is the enemy of being a British No.1. Raducanu has emulated Tim Henman in taking ownership of Aorangi Terrace and nearly mirrored his most famous rule break at Queen's. The 22-year-old kept herself warm during her 6-2, 6-4 defeat to Qinwen Zheng during a break of play by smashing a practice serve down the court - and fortunately didn't strike any ball girls. At Wimbledon, her fans will pack out 'Raducanu Ridge', which is still commonly known as 'Henman Hill'. However, it all could have been so different for the 50-year-old, who was once thrown out of SW19 for hitting a ball girl. At just age 20, two years younger than Raducanu, Henman became the first player in the Open era to get defaulted at Wimbledon. Hours after losing to defending champion Pete Sampras in the singles, the ex-Brit No.1 was involved in a first-round doubles match. Henman and partner Jeremy Bates were leading Henrik Holm of Sweden and Jeff Tarango of the United States 7-6, 2-6, 6-3, while locked in a tie break to decide the 4th set, when tempers flared. “If I had hit the girl in such an incident, I would have been thrown out of tennis,” Tarango said afterwards. Following a delay, Henman was defaulted by umpire Wayne McKewan for unsportsmanlike conduct, but the worst was still to come. Tournament referee Alan Mills was called to Court 14 and incurred the ire of a 1,800-strong crowd by officially defaulting the Brit pair. Henman, close to tears, held a press conference later where he insisted that the shot was completely accidental. “It was a complete accident,” he added, “but I'm responsible for my actions.” A statement from the referee's office revealed that the ball-girl, Hall, was taken home to undergo a thorough medical examination. She had initially fallen to the ground following Henman's strike, but then ran to her usual position in tears before a doctor was called. “I didn't think any more of it until Bates came over, then all of a sudden the tournament referee, Alan Mills, was on court and it was chaos. “I was sat down and got an ice pack on my face. Apparently the ball was clocked at 92mph, and it did hurt a bit, but I'd have carried on if I could. “Nothing was meant by it at all, it was just bad timing that meant the ball hit my head instead of going into the net. Alan Mills was really quite angry with him, which didn't seem very fair. “Henman was supposed to come to my house the next day to say sorry, but there were loads of photographers outside, so we did a press conference at Wimbledon instead, and he gave me some flowers. “I was back on court the next day. “I'd played matches at Wimbledon before then, but that was the first time I made an impact and it was for all the wrong reasons,” he admitted in 2010. “In hindsight, it was a very steep learning curve regarding the media. It was a nightmare for 36 or 48 hours after that. “It was another motivation to make sure I played well at Wimbledon. I was lucky enough to play a lot of my best tennis on centre court. 20 years later, it could be Henman giving Raducanu her flowers at Wimbledon - but hopefully this time, with tears of joy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis's great disruptor speaks on his highs and lows on Centre Court and the BBC's ‘very strange' decision to leave him out of the commentary box Wimbledon runs through Nick Kyrgios's tumultuous career with a mysterious force full of pain, glory and controversy. It is a tournament defined by history and restraint but, for Kyrgios the disruptor, it is also a place pitted with dark despair and sunlit magic. The Australian has spent a night in a psychiatric ward while playing at Wimbledon and also been served with court orders and lawsuits during and after the 2022 championship that ended in him pushing Novak Djokovic so hard in a memorable final. Kyrgios returns for a live performance of his podcast, Good Trouble, at the New Wimbledon Theatre on 24 June. But he pauses when asked what this strange and beautiful place means to him: “Wimbledon holds special memories for me. But I don't always feel so comfortable there either because I don't act like the normal tennis player. Kyrgios cackles when I ask if he expects a few hecklers to join his secret guests at his Wimbledon show. If they want to come and heckle, I'm all for it. Kyrgios starts each episode by asking his guests what “good trouble” means to them. The one thing that stands out for me, being a tennis player in a Roger Federer-esque sport where you fit into a mould, is that I've gone against the grain my whole career. I've definitely shaken things up and done it my way”. If you play Wimbledon multiple times you're playing in front of the Royal Box on a court where every blade of grass is the same length. Kyrgios was given a wildcard that year and he played sublime tennis to beat Rafael Nadal in the fourth round. Nadal made only 18 unforced errors over four sets, but he couldn't contain the fire and brilliance of the Canberra teenager. Kyrgios hit 37 aces and 70 winners, including a between-the-legs flick that almost brought Centre Court down with delirium. John McEnroe said: “We have a new star on our hands.” Five years later he played Nadal in the second round. It was another engrossing match studded with acrimony. He lost in four sets but attention focused afterwards on the fact he had tried to hit Nadal with a ball. “I think he can take a ball to the chest, bro. He spoke of how, in the aftermath of losing to Nadal, he was admitted to a psychiatric ward in London. But Kyrgios says something subtly different now when I ask if he can take us back to his time under psychiatric care: “I had to go and play Nadal the next day. I am so surprised that I ask Kyrgios if he really had been on the psychiatric ward the night before he faced Nadal? In 2019 people assumed that I had an incredible year. When I finally opened up that's when people started realising that, yes, I haven't always been perfect or always done things right, but I'm willing to speak about it. How did he play against Nadal in such a fragile state? I can't just run away.” Kyrgios adds: “Playing Nadal at Wimbledon and losing in a tight four-set battle? “I was in a dark place and it didn't get better after that moment. But I've been able to navigate that and help others.” For Kyrgios, “anyone who doesn't say I'm a role model doesn't know what I go through on a day-to-day basis. They don't have kids messaging them for advice and saying: ‘I've had suicidal thoughts and you're the only reason why I'm trying to find my way.' Andy Murray saw the signs of self-harm and, as Kyrgios confirms appreciatively, “he was one of the first to notice and tell me, if I needed any help, I could always talk to him.” “It's something I'll be able to share with my kids and grandkids and show them that anything is possible. The courts around my house [in Canberra] are generally concrete with cracks in them so the fact I made a grand slam final is pretty crazy.” Earlier in that tournament Kyrgios received a summons to appear in a Canberra court on a charge of common assault after he had allegedly pushed his former girlfriend Chiara Passari during an argument in January 2021. In a written statement Kyrgios expressed his contrition. Kyrgios was also sued after the 2022 final because he had asked the umpire to eject a spectator, Anna Palus, who shouted just before he served. He said that Palus “looks like she's had about 700 drinks, bro” but, after legal action was instigated against him, Kyrgios accepted she had not been drinking excessively: “I was mistaken, and I apologise. But there's no shame in losing to the greatest of all time. Two months later Kyrgios should have played Casper Ruud in the US Open semi-final but he lost a five-set match in the quarters to Karen Khachanov. “I should have won and I genuinely thought that was one of my biggest chances to win a slam. I can't say that losing a tennis match is catastrophic.” Can he come back and play in more grand slams? But there's a lot of wear on these tyres. Meanwhile, as they showed during their exhilarating French Open final, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are playing, in Kyrgios's words, “incredible tennis. They pushed each other to a level that not many have played before. Sinner is incredibly powerful but Alcaraz will be up there with those greats.” Kyrgios and Djokovic are friends now, so was he wrong to once say the Serb had “a sick obsession with wanting to be liked”? He's way more comfortable in his own skin now. He's the greatest tennis player of all time so he wouldn't care as much what people think now. Kyrgios has been a revelation in the commentary box. “All I've done for 20 years is play, study and breathe this sport. I also think tennis needs commentators who say things that not everyone says.” Yet the BBC has not signed him up for this year's Wimbledon. “I understand they've got Chris Eubanks [the American currently ranked world No 108] but he hasn't beaten the greatest of all time multiple times. When someone's beaten Federer, Nadal, Murray and Djokovic and has incredible insights, it's very strange you wouldn't want that person adding knowledge to tennis fans.” Kyrgios sounds more conciliatory towards the BBC when he says: “I'm sure our paths will cross again. As he prepares to return to Wimbledon, and the scene of so many tangled memories, Kyrgios says: “Life's too short for regrets. I think if you take one little block out, it all falls down.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner, who came within a few points of capturing his first Roland Garros title, was leading two sets to one and held three championship points at 40-0 before Alcaraz rallied to claim his fifth Grand Slam title. “The truth is that after the defeat in Paris, it wasn't easy to be competitive here,” Sinner said in his post-match press conference. Alcaraz, now into the semifinals at Queen's Club, was asked about Sinner's comments and expressed his support for his rival, acknowledging the emotional weight of certain losses. 1 says Alcaraz and Sinner are on ‘another level,' but not yet above Big Three “There were a few matches, really long matches that I have lost, and yeah, I just left the court by myself with the head up, and I didn't need too much time to recover from that,” Alcaraz said. “Then there were other matches that it was really tough to deal with”. From my experience, some matches that I have lost, I took three, four days just to recover mentally,” he continued. So two or three days minimum just to recover from a really tough loss”. While Sinner regroups ahead of Wimbledon, Alcaraz continues to build momentum on grass. With wins over Jaume Munar and Arthur Rinderknech, the Spaniard has extended his career-long winning streak to 16 matches. He surpassed his previous best of 14 consecutive wins, first set in 2022 before being stopped by Alexander Zverev in the French Open quarterfinals. Alcaraz matched that number again in 2023 when he won Wimbledon by defeating Novak Djokovic, before falling to Tommy Paul in the Canadian Open quarterfinals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Open ball crew lead Neal Kitson speaks to ball crew try outs at the Chase Center in Queens on Friday. Jittery nerves were in abundance at the Billie Jean King USTA National Tennis Center in Flushing Friday, as hundreds of prospective ball crew members attempted to secure one of 80 highly sought-after positions for the U.S. Open Championships. The tryouts, which were split between a Friday session and a Sunday session, saw about 460 applicants, ages 14 and up, compete to join the 240 retained ball crew members from last year. "They're transitioning from point to point; it's like a seamless transition that allows play to move smoothly," he said in an interview. He said that they received 1,600 applications from people all over the world, which was then whittled down to a list less than a third long. They had to get no more than two [questions wrong on it]", Kitson explained. "Then after that, we looked at those who had experience at another ball crew tournament ...[and we also] looked at current high school athletes of all sports in the tristate area," he added. Jamison Hershman, 15, from Port Washington does a ball crew drill at U.S. Open ball crew try outs at the Chase Center in Queens on Friday. "I think it went well," he said. I fell over and I looked straight up at the person adjudicating, sort of smiled and got on with it." She applied because she likes watching tennis and playing with her grandparents, and was inspired after seeing the ball crew at last year's Open, and seeing an ad for it on Instagram. "I feel like you have to be fast, you have to be into the game, and I think you just have to know what's going on," she said, describing herself as "excited, but a little nervous." Her father, Fabian Melendez, described how excited she was after being picked to try out in person. While he said it was "a little nerve-wracking" watching her, he added that "as long as she's having fun and doing her best, I have no issues." A similar sentiment was echoed by Kitson, who told the first group of tryouts to not let their nerves take over, and enjoy the experience. "One thing that I love to have on my team are people who are showing their teeth. They're smiling [and] having a good time," he told them.
