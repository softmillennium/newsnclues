Police say Arturo Gamboa was carrying a rifle when safety volunteer fired on him and accidentally killed bystander

A man jailed on suspicion of murder for allegedly brandishing a rifle at a “No Kings” rally in Utah before an armed safety volunteer fired and inadvertently killed a protester has been released from custody.

Local district attorney Sim Gill's office said on Friday that it was unable to make a decision on charges against Arturo Gamboa after the 14 June shooting that killed demonstrator Arthur Folasa Ah Loo – but that the investigation into the slaying continues.

Salt Lake City police had said Gamboa brought an assault-style rifle to the rally and was allegedly moving toward the crowd with the weapon raised when a safety volunteer for the event fired three shots, wounding Gamboa and killing Ah Loo nearby.

Gamboa did not fire his rifle, and it is unclear what he intended to do with it. His father, Albert Gamboa, told the Associated Press since the shooting that his son was “an innocent guy” who was “in the wrong place at the wrong time”.

Utah is an open-carry state, meaning people who can legally own a firearm are generally allowed to carry it on a public street. The volunteer has not been publicly identified as investigators work to determine who was at fault.

Judge James Blanch said in the release order that Gamboa must live with his father and is forbidden from possessing firearms. The conditions terminate after two months or if criminal charges against him are pursued, Blanch wrote.

Gamboa's attorney, Greg Skordas, did not immediately respond to a telephone message left for him seeking comment.

Police said the day after the shooting that witnesses reported seeing Gamboa lift the rifle when he was ordered to drop it – and that instead he began running toward the crowd. He fled but was arrested nearby, accused of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo's death.

Salt Lake City police said in a statement the next day that Gamboa “knowingly engaged in conduct … that ultimately caused the death of an innocent community member”.

But three days after Gamboa was booked into jail, with no formal charges filed, police acknowledged that the circumstances surrounding the shooting remained uncertain. They issued a public appeal for any video footage related to the shooting or Gamboa and said detectives were still trying “to piece together exactly what happened”.

The volunteer who confronted Gamboa was described by event organizers as a military veteran whose role as a safety volunteer was to maintain order.

Experts say it's extremely rare for such individuals, often called safety marshals, to be armed. They typically rely on calm demeanor, communication, and relationships with police and protesters to help keep order, said Edward Maguire, an Arizona State University criminology and criminal justice professor.

Police said the permit for the protest did not specify that there would be armed security.

Protest organizers have not said whether or how the safety volunteer who shot Ah Loo was trained or explained why he was armed. All attendees, including those in safety roles, were asked not to bring weapons, according to Sarah Parker, a national coordinator for the 50501 Movement. Parker's organization on Thursday said it was dissociating itself from a local chapter of the group that helped organize the Utah protest.

The demonstration involving about 18,000 people was otherwise peaceful. It was one of hundreds nationwide against Donald Trump's military parade in Washington, which marked the US army's 250th anniversary and coincided with the president's birthday.

Leaving an immigration detention center in Jena, Louisiana, after being imprisoned for 104 days for protesting Israel's U.S.-backed bombardment of Gaza, former Columbia University organizer Mahmoud Khalil said Friday evening that he will continue fighting against the Trump administration's targeting of him and immigrants across the country.

“They chose the wrong person for this,” said Khalil outside the facility where he'd been detained since being abducted by immigration agents outside his New York City apartment in March. “That doesn't mean that there is a right person for this. There is no right person who should be detained for actually protesting a genocide, for protesting their university.”

Khalil told reporters his top priority as he was released was being reunited with his wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, and their two-month-old son, whom he was able to meet only briefly after a judge ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials to allow the family to attend a meeting together with Khalil's legal team in May.

“Now I can actually hug him and Noor, my wife, without looking at the clock,” said Khalil.

He also acknowledged the “incredible men” he met while he was detained with other immigrants for more than three months.

“The hundreds of men who I left behind me shouldn't be there in the first place,” said Khalil. “The Trump administration is doing their best to dehumanize everyone here. Whether you are a U.S. citizen, an immigrant, or just a person on this land, doesn't mean that you are less of a human.”

“No human is illegal,” he added. “Justice will prevail no matter what this administration may try to portray.”

The administration acknowledged after Khalil was detained that he was not accused of a crime, but of being a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests because he helped lead protests and negotiations with Columbia administrators, calling on the university to divest from companies that benefit from Israel's assault on Gaza. The war has killed more than 55,000 Palestinians and is widely considered a genocide by human rights groups and experts.

The State Department has claimed it had a right to revoke Khalil's green card and pursue his deportation — and that of other international students who have protested U.S. policy in Israel and Gaza — under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Officials have also accused Khalil of lying about his background on his immigration paperwork — failing to disclose his work with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which aids Palestinians in Gaza, and with a British government agency after 2022.

Khalil's lawyers have pointed out that his work with UNRWA was part of his coursework at Columbia and have rejected claims that he lied about his work with the British agency.

Federal judges have ordered the release of several student protesters in recent weeks. U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz said on Friday that the administration's efforts to continue detaining Khalil were “highly, highly unusual” and required officials to allow him to reunite with his family.

Farbiarz previously ruled that Khalil could not be detained or deported under the Immigration and Nationality Act — rejecting immigration Judge Jamee Comans' ruling that the deportation effort could proceed.

After Khalil's release, the administration said it would appeal Farbiarz's ruling, with Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin saying that on Friday Comans had denied Khalil asylum and a bail hearing in her court. Comans ruled again that Khalil could be deported.

“On the same day an immigration judge denied Khalil bond and ordered him removed, one rogue district judge ordered him released,” McLaughlin said. “This is yet another example of how out-of-control members of the judicial branch are undermining national security.”

Farbiarz's message to the government regarding his decision to release Khalil was straightforward: “He is not a danger to the community, period, full stop.”

In his initial statement to the press, Khalil said his ordeal thus far had opened his eyes to “a different reality about this country that supposedly champions human rights and and liberty and justice.”

“The moment you enter this facility, your rights leave you behind,” said Khalil. “Once you cross literally that door, you see the opposite side of what is actually happening in this country under the eyes of everyone.”

An ancient ethical maxim, traditionally ascribed to Chilon of Sparta — one of the illustrious Seven Sages of Greece — and transmitted through the revered writings of Diogenes Laërtius, counsels that no reproach be cast upon the departed, enjoining a solemn silence where calumny might otherwise find voice. This august injunction was enshrined for posterity in the hallowed Latin adage: De mortuis nil nisi bonum dicendum est — “Of the deceased, naught but good is to be pronounced.” 

But shall we shy away from the truth simply because the subject has journeyed home? On the contrary — within the noble pursuit of leadership inquiry, it is not only appropriate but essential to cast an unflinching gaze upon the darker contours and missteps of those once revered.

Such clear-eyed scrutiny is not to be mistaken for condemnation but must be understood as an exercise in principled discernment: a means of lifting the veil, exposing the insidious patterns which — far from being modern aberrations — have emerged, reappeared, and entrenched themselves down the annals of human history. Echoing through time, Ecclesiastes' memento rings clear: “There is nothing new under the sun.”

In apprehending these recurring faults, we equip ourselves to fortify the foundations and elevate the standards of leadership, thereby drawing nearer to breaking the cycles that have long impaired our collective progress.

One such enduring pattern resides in the very act of writing history. Creative revisionism — subtle in form, yet often deliberate in intent — persistently serves as a narrative mechanism by which the memory of the past is sculpted, recast, or repurposed to sanctify the present and pave the path for future control.

This theoretically grounded and empirically observed tendency invites a sobering reflection: that historical writing, in its most rigorous conception, discloses not the objective facticity nor the veritable substance of the actual events it purports to recount, but rather the power, perspectives and prevailing interests of the ruling elite at the moment of its composition. Against this backdrop, George Orwell's trenchant insight retains its instructive force: “Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.” 

Likewise, particularly within the spheres of religion and ideology, the full gestalt and profound richness of traditional teachings are seldom faithfully conveyed in their entirety. Rather, the intellectual patrimony is frequently fragmented and reshaped to conform to strategic aims of legitimization. The deleterious ramifications of such curated transmission poignantly echo the timeless parable of the blind men and the elephant — each apprehending but a portion and thus forging a distorted conception of the whole. 

The late Pope Francis, though hailed by many as an inclusive reformer, did not escape the perils of selective moral emphasis and partial judgment. Conspicuously, in his earthly ministry, he sought to embody the mercy of Christ, but his actions betrayed a troubling incompleteness and imbalance. A critical yet fair evaluation of his papacy reveals deficiencies that extend well beyond superficial and incidental missteps and need to be juxtaposed with his strengths.

This kind of vigilant examination assumes greater urgency beneath the prevailing progressive refrain of self-appointed narrative shapers, tastemaker, and gatekeepers who tirelessly exalt his supposed abundance of virtues — often echoed uncritically with near-liturgical zeal by an enthused and ecstatic throng within both popular and ecclesial discourse. 

Many erudite and discerning minds falter in reconciling this fervent dithyramb — one that smothers sober reflection and muffles measured dissent — with the ledger of history, a dissonance so strident that it warrants a reassessment, both searching and unsparing, in light of mounting countervailing evidence and truths long eclipsed.

The initial focus here centers on the pope's foremost failing: to appease sin by diverting attention from repentance and redemption — favoring synods over spiritual surgery, and dialogue over doctrine. Metaphorically, the shepherd's relinquishment of his crook, substituting conviction with compromise, bespeaks, as critics may assert, a grievous dereliction: not merely a forfeiture of authority, but a profound breach of the Holy Father's solemn duty to cleanse his flock — not merely a failure of governance, but a profound betrayal of the Church's prophetic and pastoral mandate.

Drawing upon Rembrandt's chef-d'oeuvre “The Return of the Prodigal Son” as both a visual scorecard and hermeneutic key (see Figure 1), the ensuing contention advanced here stands on firm ground and thereby warrants due acknowledgment: Pope Francis has, at minimum, fallen short in directing the gaze of mainstream journalists towards the quintessential, transformative message embodied by the genuine movens of the Lukan parable of quest — the prodigal son himself. That figure's epic penitential journey animates the entire tale of moral and relational renewal and propels the progression of the plot. Narrated with exquisite economy — wherein, as in the grand drama of salvation, no detail is superfluous — it reaches its consummate fulfillment in a redemptive nostos (homecoming).

Put in a nutshell, the Vicar of Christ extolled mercy yet understated the urgent salvific necessity of restorative justice. Though he envisioned the Church as a field hospital in the aftermath of battle, he surrendered his vital post and sacred duty as surgeon general, dispensing comfort without cure. He failed to consistently lay bare and confront the abhorrent nature and existential threat of sin and to insist on repentance as the thorned but ineluctable path to the mystery of redemption.

Called to be the Church's chief healer of souls, Pope Francis ought to have discerned that a physician does not aid the gravely afflicted by neglecting to diagnose the condition — be it bodily, mental, or spiritual — nor by concealing its severity. To placate while suppressing truth, to assure wellness where there is disease, and to deny treatment at the hour of necessity, is to abandon the art of healing itself.

Sacred Scripture — complimentarily elucidating the narrative antecedent to the luminous instant immortalized by the renowned seventeenth-century Dutch master of chiaroscuro (the artful contrast of light and shadow) — serves simultaneously as both witness and corrective, casting penetrating light upon the pope's doctrinal and pastoral lapse, thereby exposing what silence conceals.

The prodigal son, in the unfolding parsimonious trajectory of the eponymous Gospel parable, willfully sunders communion with his father — himself a figura Dei, an allegorical referent of God — by boldly and brashly demanding his inheritance ante mortem, as though preempting paternal death itself. In this hubristic move, he enacts a symbolic patricide, pronouncing his progenitor dead in his own heart as a precondition for asserting existential autarkeia (autonomy).

Mistaking rupture — a symbolic schism without institutional breach — for liberation, the son is ensnared in the illusion that severance constitutes selfhood. In this emblematic gesture of disrespect and estrangement, he presumptuously reenacts the primordial rebellion of man against God — an archetype of pride, autonomy, and fall, wherein sin manifests itself as an audacious self-willed rupturing of the covenantal filial bond with God. In the parable, the father — alive yet forsaken — bears the disunion with patient endurance, mirroring divine reverence for human freedom.

In forsaking the sacred demands of pietas — that classical foundational virtue of sacred devotion to both the divine and societal order — the son precipitates not mere geographical estrangement, but an abyssal spiritual fall — a dark, self-imposed exile and willful banishment from the grace that once sustained him. Unmoored from home, he embarks upon a peregrination of dissipation — at once truly epic and dramatic —squandering the unmerited bounty in a far-off land, and in true katabasis echoing the somber depths of classical Attic tragedy descends into spiritual and material destitution.

At the harrowing moment of peripeteia — the sudden reversal of fortune — the destitute son is seized by ravenous hunger, a visceral symbolic representation and allegorical reference to the spiritual barrenness wrought by sin. Famished and forsaken, he awakens to the stark and unvarnished reality of his transgressions: that in casting away not mere gold but grace, he has severed himself from the very source of life and love, and thus reaped the desolation that inevitably follows such a ruthless and cataclysmic rupture.

In that critical juncture of spiritual awakening, he steels his heart and vows to mend what was broken: With resolute heart and solemn intent, he turns his weary steps toward the hearth of home.

His protracted and arduous odyssey, marked by errant wanderings, cathartic trials, anagnoristic self-reckoning and metanoia (change of mind), finds its denouement and reaches its telos (end) in a humble and remorseful return to the paternal figure. Though compelled initially by fleshly urge rather than lofty virtue, his contrite confession in this pivotal soteriological and eschatological moment bears witness to genuine repentance.

What lends the parable profound poignancy is the delicate, elegant interlacing between the narratological fulcrum of focalization and agency — the perspective from which the story is seen and the power of a character to effect change — and the semiotic concept of structural dynamic — the interplay of opposing elements through patterns of tension and release, which generates meaning.

Crucially, it is the contrite and penitent sinner — through whose perspective the entire transformative journey is beheld — who, as the primary actant, ventures the initial, hesitant and fraught step toward conversion after his fateful, fathomless fall. Such initiative is the indispensable prerequisite for the precious, pivotal moment in which tension is released — when the son is met by his merciful father, who has watched him from afar. Overwhelmed by compassion, the earthly sire bursts forth in a swift sprint to embrace and kiss his returning offspring — seemingly unable to wait even a moment longer for the restoration of his beloved one.

Within this distinctive framing, it is noteworthy that the pericope is conventionally referred to as “The Parable of the Prodigal Son,” rather than “The Parable of the Merciful Father.” This conscious and conspicuous choice of focal point reflects a salient interest — indeed, a keen and definitive preference, almost Aristotelian — for the tragic arc of fall and catharsis, underscoring the thematic emphasis on rebellion and return, sin and repentance.

This nomenclature underscores that the actantial son's waywardness carries substantial hermeneutic weight, even if it is, precisely against this backdrop of brokenness and the metanoia it elicits, in the final act that the true telos is revealed: In a genuinely felicitous conclusion, the nostic journey — transcending mere physical passage to encompass a profound spiritual, moral, and existential quest — ultimately culminates in the transformative and restorative return to the self and home, embodying both repentance and renewal.

This climactic consummation — God's final, life-bestowing word to the contrite soul yearning for home — eschews retribution in favor of redemption in a divine reunion with what is truly essential: the paternal embracing of the penitent son, who still bears the vestiges of abject poverty wrought by sin — all fully and faithfully canonized in sacred oil by Rembrandt.

In a parallel vein, the oft-told Johannine narrative of the woman caught in adultery (John 8:1-11) — the iconic confrontation between law and mercy — depicts Jesus as literally disarming the incensed crowd with a piercing challenge: “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her” (John 8:7, KJV). Yet mercy is not license, but bears a charge — not to be squandered. Once the accusers have vanished, the Savior issues a final, stern and uncompromising injunction to the marital interloper: “Go, and sin no more” (John 8:11, KJV).

This laconic yet succinct command reveals mercy as but a prelude to profound personal and redemptive transformation in harmony with God's sacred design, not a carte blanche to persist in licentiousness. Consequently, this pivotal moment — etched indelibly into the Gospel narrative — may be regarded as the true climax and crowning point of the episode, transcending and shining forth beyond even Christ's terse rebuke of hypocritical judgment: a critical oversight by the progressive faction, which, in a self-serving manner that engenders interpretative bias, dwells exclusively on the suspension of both judgment and condemnation while minimizing, or altogether neglecting, the gravity of sin.

Cast your gaze once more upon those hauntingly poignant gospel scenes, rich in both sacred and secular resonance. When the father sees his wayward son in the distance, does he convene a family council? Does he weigh opinions before embracing his offspring? When Christ stands before the adulteress, does he open the floor for negotiation?

Of course not. Instead, a consistent theological and pastoral pattern emerges: In both cases, truth is not debated — it is declared. It breaks forth with clarity, with authority, and without compromise. These are not moments of democratic dialogue; they are swift revelations — of celestial wisdom and moral certainty. 

Jesus, the rabbi par excellence, functions not as a facilitator of value-neutral, error-prone democratic discourse, but as prophet, priest and king — an infallible divine pedagogue whose authority derives from true and unassailable heavenly commission. He speaks not as a broker of compromise but as the Logos incarnate, whose majesty admits neither confusion nor contradiction. He does not offer terms but absolute, unambiguous and eternal truth — impervious to dissent.

In like fashion, as Pastor Bonus — the Good Shepherd, not elected by the vote of the flock but sent by the will of the Father — Christ does not follow but leads with sovereign purpose, regal resolve and unwavering command. For a true herdsman does not linger and trail behind his sheep; he goes before them as sure-footed guide. He does not parley with his fold, neither as to the road nor its reward — stooping to inquire where it imagines the pasture lies and deferring to it in choosing which ravine to brave or which cliff to scale. Left to their own devices, sheep scatter, stumble, and are lost.

A shepherd who surrenders his sacred charge to the caprice of the flock is not merely unfaithful or negligent; his dereliction surpasses administrative deficiency and rises to the level of moral collapse. In abdicating his duty, he becomes not a guardian but a hazard — an agent of peril, rightly subject to removal. The ramifications for ecclesial ministry are nothing short of dire.

Crucially, the image of Christ as the Good Shepherd stands as the definitive paradigm and authoritative model for priestly identity and conduct. The priest, as alter Christus — a living icon cast in His likeness — participates in this divine pastoral mandate, not as a hireling, but as one called to lead, guard, and lay down his life for the sheep.

Just as a true shepherd does not confer with his flock, soliciting its counsel on the path to green pastures, so too the spiritual tender of the fold is tasked with guiding, not yielding. To invert this hierarchical dynamic would be to court pastoral dysfunction; congregations left to their own devices are prone to peril, and a priest who defers leadership forfeits both vocation and credibility.

Such definite and resolute divine authoritarianism and heteronomy — externally imposed norms which, in this particular instance, nonetheless resonate with the natural law engraved upon the human heart — stands in marked contrast to Pope Francis' emphasis on what I term pastoral synodality.

The Bishop of Rome's increasing deference to democratic modalities within ecclesial governance risks fostering a theologically erroneous and pastorally perilous impression. It may suggest that the Ecclesia is to be shaped in an adaptive manner by the transient values and shifting norms prevailing in secular society. This stands in glaring and haunting contrast to the Church's true vocation as a transcendent spiritual and moral authority, prophetically calling the world to repentance and conformity to the divine will. Succinctly put, the Church is to stand as mater et magistra — Mother and Teacher — not a mirror to the age, but its corrective lodestar.

This inversion of ecclesial mission — where the Church imitates the world rather than sanctifying it — bears striking resemblance to the distinctive Protestant proclivity for doctrinal malleability and unquestioned conformity with the mutable, and at times calamitous, zeitgeist. Historically, such a treacherous trajectory has borne spiritually and politically deleterious fruit. The Protestant endemic susceptibility to ideological capture was starkly revealed with apocalyptic effect when völkisch nationalism — arguably irreconcilable with the universalism of Christianity — spread like wildfire across Europe.

It remains a little-known yet well-documented fact that during the ascent of National Socialism, Protestant communities in Germany — frequently aligned with the political, social and cultural mainstream — were markedly more inclined than their Catholic counterparts to embrace Adolf Hitler, his creed, and his cause. By contrast, Catholics — fortified by the steadfast guidance of the Church hierarchy, buttressed by the unifying force of Catholic social institutions, and anchored in authoritative magisterial teachings such as the encyclical Mit brennender Sorge — mounted a more resolute resistance to Hitler and the broader neopagan, chthonic ambitions of the era.

The ballot box bore witness to the stark confessional cleavage: while the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) thrived in staunchly Protestant regions —

routinely garnering over 60% of the vote — its electoral traction proved markedly weaker in Catholic strongholds, where its popular support rarely rose above 20 to 30 percent at the polls.[i] Moreover, as evidenced by party membership records, Protestants were overrepresented within the ranks of the NSDAP relative to their share of the general population.

As if such displays of docile accommodation had not already proven abundant, the 1933 Protestant church elections delivered a staggering verdict: two-thirds of voters cast their lot with the nationalist “German Christians” — a Protestant faction closely aligned with the NSDAP, zealously promoting unwavering submission to the party's ideological line, including the expulsion of baptized Jews. Its aim was nothing less than the institutionalization of “Positive Christianity” — that vague, pliable creed enshrined in the party program — within the official Protestant churches of Germany, which were to be recast as racially purified vessels of an Aryan faith.

The Protestant pursuit of ideological conformity — where fads trump facts, and meek docility slips into outright complicity — lays bare the hazardous repercussions of forsaking theological orthodoxy and moral constancy in favor of cultural assimilation.

One unprecedented papal experiment in collegial governance and ecclesial deliberation — evocative of Protestant practices — stands out as a landmark embodiment of the piercing maxim, Scalpel shelved, sinners spared.

On 7 March 2020, Pope Francis formally convoked the Synod on Synodality — a visionary initiative conceived to reimagine the Catholic Church as a more participatory, inclusive, and mission-oriented communion, animated by the guiding principle of “journeying together.”

This ecclesial initiative endeavored to engage the entire People of God in far-reaching discernment concerning the Church's mission and its unfolding destiny. It aspired to transcend the traditional confines of hierarchical decision-making in favor of cultivating a more participatory and inclusive ecclesial ethos.

Central to its vision were the interwoven themes of communion, participation, and mission — each enunciated not merely as ideals, but as imperatives for the Church's renewal in the modern age. 

The multi-year process unfolded in carefully delineated phases, ascending from the grassroots upward: commencing with local consultations at the parish and diocesan levels, it advanced through national and continental assemblies, ultimately culminating in a convocation of bishops and ecclesial delegates in Rome.

Framed in the aspirational rhetoric of structured dialogue and shared responsibility, the methodical schema encompassed parish assemblies, diocesan surveys, and global listening sessions — each designed to draw forth input from every stratum of the Church.

The Synod's vast scope and lofty aspirations reflected Pope Francis's vision of a Church that listens with attentiveness and walks in communion. Yet as the process unfolded, it gave rise to profound and still-unsettled questions touching the very nature of reform — penetrating inquiries that transcend superficial considerations of formal and stylistic veneers and modalities, implicating substantial matters central to the foundational pillars of magisterial authority, ecclesial unity, and the integral coherence of doctrine.

Central to the operational-procedural critique of this synod resides the observation that, over time, it appreciably assumed the semblance of a meticulously choreographed ecclesial outreach campaign — a theatrical pageant, some may deem a charade, marked by consultation bereft of true compass. More often than not, it bore the hallmarks of a managed descent from theological abstraction to pastoral anecdote, all under the guise of inclusivity. Notably, the initiative deployed mechanisms more apt for the curated harvesting of sentiment than to authentic theological discernment. Particular solicitude was granted to those styled as “marginalized voices,” whose indeterminate status only heightened the process's ambient vagueness.

Perspicacious and judicious detractors might espy therein a curious spectacle: a hierarchy of herdsmen consulting the flock not for veritas (truth), but for vibes — a dynamic tension evident in some tenderly phrased and gently meandering yet pastorally skewed lines of inquiry. For instance, the wise in spirit may find illustrative sample questions — such as “What experiences of Church life bring you joy?” — bathetic in their earnest and reductionist simplicity, casting a faintly sentimental hue over a process ostensibly aimed at serious and momentous structural reform. 

At times, the effect bordered on the parodic and profane, with the ecclesial initiative taking on the character of administering a trivial and mundane wellness survey rather than representing a solemn act of sober-minded ecclesial discernment and erudite theological self-examination bearing on the Church's identity and mission.

This dynamic pattern reveals the disjunction between the Synod's liberal approach — marked by relativist and affective, some might say emotive, consultation, which crowdsources consensus and reduces both engagement and discernment to the mere solicitation of sentiment unmoored from objective value — and the Church's sacred vocation to proclaim the truth with doctrinal fidelity and unequivocal clarity.

At a higher, strategic level, unity through division seems to have become the Church's disquieting new logic and latest innovation — epitomized by the tautologically termed ecclesial consultation process. Though commended for transparency and participatory ethos, the unfolding synodal endeavor exacts a grave toll: ecclesial fragmentation and a profound erosion of episcopal authority — as the crozier slips from grasp, the crowd usurps the altar, and the multitude overshadows the wise and prudent. Most pointedly, the papal venture dilutes the bishops' magisterial role by dispersing responsibility through decentralized, quasi-democratic lay-driven processes, often buoyed by ersatz spirituality.

In its zealous pursuit of pastoral responsiveness, the unparalleled venture risks subverting, some may say obliterating, the very foundations of the Church. Principally, it jeopardizes doctrinal integrity and clarity, fostering corrosive relativism by supplanting immutable divine truths with ephemeral secular opinions. Such shades of thought are warped by virulent and insidious progressive political ideology and liberal social agendas rather than grounded in rigorous and authentic theological and spiritual discernment. This raises a pressing question: can a house of truth truly stand on the shifting sand of opinion?

To revisit Pope Francis' guiding metaphor of a field hospital is to witness a perplexing paradox: the papal surgeon general appears to have stepped away from the operating table of his faltering ecclesial infirmary, abundant in compassion yet deficient in cure, leaving the wounded to wait and bleed without the blade — untended by the very hand ordained to minister restoration.

It is fitting to acknowledge that the Vicar of Christ may arguably have exercised wise and prudent pastoral caution and discretion in eschewing the heavy and blunt sledgehammer of harsh public censure against sinners exiled to the moral edges of society. Yet in his overwrought, some might say affected, gentleness, he let fall into disuse, of all things, the very scalpel entrusted to him — both archetype and apex of his vocation — that precise, exacting and incisive implement of definitive, primal and pure truth, whose keen edge wounds not to harm, but to heal.

Though outwardly cast as a cordial exercise in dialogue and participation, the synodal experiment progressively and perilously assumed the contours of an aggressive populist powerplay and calculated and methodical mobilization of the masses. Over the arc of this insidious crusade, Pope Francis's emphasis on inclusion seeded instability, while the rhetoric of empowerment, at length, ushered in tangible upheaval and uncertainty.

The unvarnished gravity of this trajectory grows ever more apparent under closer scrutiny, inasmuch as what once passed for a mere reform of ecclesiastical governance upon reflection unveils its true countenance, its full dimension, and its far graver stakes: far from constituting a solely surface-level administrative adjustment, the synodal offensive has been quietly and deftly interwoven with the threads of a Vatican-style color revolution.

Editor's note: This item has been expanded with additional details.

Belarusian opposition leader and political prisoner Siarhei Tsikhanouski was released on June 21, shortly after dictator Alexander Lukashenko met in Minsk with U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg.

Tsikhanouski , a popular blogger who planned to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, was arrested shortly before the vote and later sentenced to 18 years in prison on politically motivated charges. Amnesty International recognized Tsikhanouski as a prisoner of conscience.

His wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, stepped in and became the main opposition candidate against Lukashenko. 

At least 13 political detainees, including prominent blogger Ihar Losik, were also released on June 21, Belarusian independent outlet Nasha Niva reported.

In a post on social media, Tsikhanouskaya welcomed the news but highlighted that "1,150 political prisoners remain behind bars."

My husband Siarhei is free! It's hard to describe the joy in my heart.Thank you, 🇺🇸 @POTUS, @SPE_Kellogg, @JohnPCoale, DAS Christopher W. Smith, @StateDept & our 🇪🇺 allies, for all your efforts.We're not done. 1150 political prisoners remain behind bars. All must be released. pic.twitter.com/MhngqBHFq3

Kellogg's deputy, John Coale, said the released political prisoners had been transferred to Vilnius and expressed gratitude to the Lithuanian government for facilitating their relocation.

"President Trump's strong leadership led to the release of 14 prisoners from Belarus today. Thanks to the Lithuanian government for its cooperation and assistance — they remain a true friend and ally," Coale wrote on X. 

According to official results of the 2020 election, Lukashenko won with 80% of the vote, while Tsikhanouskaya received just 10%. Evidence indicates that the election was heavily rigged, and Tsikhanouskaya could have realistically won the vote.

As a result, hundreds of thousands took to the streets in Belarus in 2020 to demand a fair election. Thousands were arrested, and many were beaten and tortured. At least seven demonstrators were killed during the protests.

Minsk has faced repeated Western sanctions since the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests.

Lukashenko, in power since 1994, is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has allowed Russia to use Belarusian territory for military operations against Ukraine.

"You have caused quite a stir in the world with your arrival," Lukashenko told Kellogg during their meeting at the Palace of Independence, according to state-run outlet Belta.

"But I wonder why. Can't we have a normal dialogue and talk about our affairs – about relations between Belarus and the United States of America?"

Kellogg is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Belarus in recent years, following former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's 2020 trip under Trump's first term.

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Lukashenko's regime has played a key logistical role in supporting Moscow's campaign, offering its territory for troop deployments and weapons stockpiles.

The Los Angeles Dodgers said on Friday that it has committed $1 million in financial aid to support illegal immigrant families affected by recent federal immigration operations in Los Angeles.

The Dodgers has refrained from directly referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in its statement, instead expressing its intent to help illegal immigrants affected by “recent events” in the city.

DUBAI, June 21. /TASS/. The Israel Defense Forces said its fighter jets are currently attacking military infrastructure in southwestern Iran.

According to the Fars news agency, explosions were heard in the city of Ahvaz and the port of Mahshahr. Air defenses are working to eliminate the threat.

Overnight into June 13, Israel started Operation Rising Lion against the Iranian nuclear program. Less than a day later, Iran carried out a retaliatory attack. Over the following days, Israel and Iran traded blows again. Both sides reported fatalities and other casualties in the attacks, acknowledged that some targets on their territory were hit. Mutual strikes are ongoing.

Other countries have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients, which allow for more advanced sunscreens 

Many dermatologists and experts say US sunscreens are still not as effective as many available overseas when it comes to protecting against ultraviolet radiation linked to skin cancer and premature ageing – despite years of research.

The concern comes as a brutal heatwave, with a suffocating “heat dome”, is arriving for more than 200 million people across vast swaths of the US this weekend, bringing extreme heat and humidity . Studies have shown that the global climate crisis is making heatwaves more severe, frequent and long lasting.

As fierce sun  beats down on parts of the US this weekend, people are urged to try to stay out of the direct sun, stay hydrated and apply lots of sunscreen if outdoors – but people will probably have to rely on sunscreens that are less effective at fending off the ultraviolet rays than sunscreen available in some other countries.

While American sunscreens generally do a good job at blocking UVB rays, which cause sunburn, experts and studies have noted in recent years that they often provide weaker protection against ultraviolet radiation in the form of UVA rays, compared to products available in places like Europe and South Korea.

A 2017 study found only around half of US sunscreens tested met the European standards for UVA protection.

Experts attribute this gap largely to regulatory differences.

In the US, sunscreen is classified and regulated as an over-the-counter drug, rather than a cosmetic product like in other countries. This means that each active ingredient must undergo an often lengthy regulatory approval process with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are subject to rigorous safety requirements and animal testing.

Experts often point out that the FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in more than 20 years.

“The issue for me isn't the safety of the sunscreens we have,” dermatologist Adewole Adamson told NPR. “It's that some of the chemical sunscreens aren't as broad spectrum as they could be, meaning they do not block UVA as well. This could be alleviated by the FDA allowing new ingredients.”

Meanwhile, in countries like France, South Korea, the UK and Japan, governments have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients, which experts say allow for more advanced sunscreens.

One of the ingredients is bemotrizinol, which is considered one of the safest and most vetted chemicals on the global market.

It remains unapproved by the FDA, but Swiss sunscreen company, DSM-Firmenich, is seeking FDA approval for it.

But, dermatologist Dr Nazanin Saedi told Axios that a decision is not expected before 2026.

“So do not delay in stocking up on your sunscreen for this summer!” she said.

In a statement to the Guardian, a spokesperson for the FDA said that “many currently marketed and widely available sunscreen products in the US provide excellent broad-spectrum coverage and are effective in preventing sunburn and reducing the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun, when used as directed with other sun protection measures”.

“The fact that sunscreen ingredients are available in other countries does not mean that the important safety questions about these ingredients are well understood, or that they provide greater efficacy or safety than sunscreens lawfully sold in the US,” the spokesperson added. “In many other countries, sunscreens are regulated differently and may not be required to have the data that FDA, and other experts, consider necessary to fully evaluate the safety of sunscreen ingredients.”

In 2023, representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat representing New York, spoke out about the quality of US sunscreens compared to elsewhere and urged Americans to contact their member of Congress to draw attention to this issue.

“US sunscreens are far behind the rest of the world and our regulations aren't necessarily making our sunscreens better or safer – but it doesn't have to be this way!” Ocasio-Cortez said.

Republican senator Mike Lee agreed with the New York representative, and in a post on social media, wrote: “There is no left or right when it comes to UV light.”

A bipartisan bill introduced in Congress aims to modernize sunscreen regulations and allow non-animal testing alternatives for regulatory approval.

Still, dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen, and Dr Robert Kirsner, a dermatologist with the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami, told CBS that the sunscreens available in the US are still considered safe and effective as long as they are used properly.

Expert suggest wearing a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and advise wearing it every day, even on cloudy days.

For those seeking the safest products in the US market, experts told the Guardian last year that people should look for physical, also known as “mineral”, sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.

Leonard Leo, the right-wing operative who picked Trump's Supreme Court appointees, has long been the president's ally.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

The Supreme Court has intervened repeatedly over the past four months to overturn temporary restraining orders (TROs) issued by lower court judges against an array of reckless edicts from Donald Trump and his agents — including the dictates of his then-resident billionaire, Elon Musk. These interventions have allowed a number of press releases dressed up as executive orders to take effect while the litigation against them proceeds.

This is a reversal of the way TROs are supposed to function — to preserve the status quo from irreparable harm while litigation against a new rule or edict is proceeding. In a nutshell, several lower courts have found that plaintiffs suing the Trump administration have proven that they would face irreparable harm if the action were not halted and that they have a substantial likelihood of success under the law, in addition to showing that issuing an injunction or restraining order is in the public interest. While lower courts have made such detailed findings, the Republican-appointed judges on the Roberts Court have set several of them aside.

This Supreme Court majority was made possible by Leonard Leo, the unelected right-wing operative Trump delegated judicial selection to during his first term. Leo handpicked the three people Trump appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Together, those three along with three other men Leo helped get confirmed to the Supreme Court — John Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas — have been on a binge of reversing legal precedents, accomplishing Leo's long-term agenda and the Republican Party's goal of overturning Roe v. Wade. The Roberts Court has advanced the legal policy agenda of his billionaire benefactors, including Charles Koch and Barre Seid, by weakening the power of federal agencies to regulate corporations through invented legal “doctrines” like the “major questions” theory and reversing the Chevron deference precedent that prevented judges from easily displacing agency rules. Most significantly, as I detail in my forthcoming book Without Precedent, these Republican appointees to the Supreme Court blocked the criminal prosecution of Trump, paving the way for his return to the White House through Chief Justice John Roberts' machinations to give the president unprecedented and counterconstitutional immunity from prosecution.

So why has Trump called Leo a “sleazebag”?

Trump is upset that in the lower courts his administration has lost 96 percent of the time so far, according to one analysis. The president's apologists have asserted that this shows that the courts are biased against Trump. In reality it is the law that is biased against actions that defy the web of statutes, regulations, rules, contracts, and case law that have long been part of our legal system. Trump has even suggested that he may not be bound by the oath he swore on January 20 to uphold the Constitution, which commands the president (twice!) to “faithfully execute” the law — not to kill it, but to effectuate it. Roberts, who administered the oath, had denuded it of much of its power through his orchestration of the outrageous immunity ruling. So much for bias!

Trump, upset that he cannot just act like a king and defy the law at his whim, attacked Leo for not choosing judges who would put loyalty to him above the Constitution. The president wants the courts to resemble his cabinet, peopled with loyalists like Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem who have repeatedly defended assaults on the rule of law and common sense.

However, Trump is far from done doing Leo's bidding.

In the same week that Trump assailed Leo's judicial picks, the Trump-controlled Justice Department announced that it would no longer allow judicial nominees to fill out the merit selection evaluation forms of the American Bar Association (ABA) — a long-standing goal of Leo.

One of Leo's first jobs with the Federalist Society was at a program called “ABA Watch,” set up in 1996 to critique the association. For decades, the ABA has rated federal judicial nominees by evaluating whether in the view of fellow members of the legal bar they have the reputation, skills, devotion to fairness, and temperament to be entrusted with a powerful position as a federal judge. The ABA had given Leo's buddy, Clarence Thomas, a partial “Not Qualified” rating when he was nominated to the Supreme Court, an evaluation that came well before Anita Hill's damning testimony that Thomas had engaged in sexual harassment, testimony he hotly denied. That ABA rating was appeared to be based in part on the fact that Thomas had never argued a case before the Supreme Court, had only briefly worked as a judge, and his primary work in the past decade had not been as a litigator in federal or state courts.

After Thomas was confirmed despite the controversy surrounding his nomination, Leo reportedly became the Federalist Society's first full-time employee since it was launched with the aid of Antonin Scalia and Robert Bork back in 1982 as a student group building a pipeline to power for “conservative and libertarian” lawyers. Leo's ABA Watch assailed the bar and its role in evaluating judicial nominees while Bill Clinton was president. Then, in 2001, after George W. Bush became president, Leo and his cohorts in the Senate seemingly succeeded in getting the ABA out of the role it had for many years of evaluating judicial candidates before they were nominated — rating their experience and reputation before the bar. That 30-day prenomination evaluation process, which I was a liaison to when I worked on judicial nominations in the Clinton administration, weeded out judicial candidates whom the ABA advised would get a “Not Qualified” (NQ) or partially NQ rating, if they were nominated, because of their lack of experience, poor temperament, or bias. In that administration, we considered the ABA to be an important part of the merit evaluation of candidates for judgeships who were recommended by Democratic and Republican senators and members of Congress, to help ensure they had good reputations and not just good connections.

In 2001, instead of the ABA screening judicial candidates before they were nominated, Leo and the Federalist Society began screening George W. Bush's potential judicial candidates for their ties to the group and alignment. That screening was so successful for Leo that, when I was the chief counsel for nominations for the chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, I started drafting statements for the Congressional Record documenting how many of Bush's appellate nominees were tied to the Federalist Society. Kicking the ABA out of the prenomination process, in my view, inflated the ABA's ratings in some instances for Bush nominees because some people were fearful of being candid about their concerns with someone already nominated by the president and thus likely to be confirmed. Meanwhile, in the early 2000s, Leo also began targeting state merit selection systems for destruction, as Evan Vorpahl and I documented last year in a special report and previously. Leo has been an opponent of merit selection and merit evaluation for more than two decades now. Why would he want anyone other than himself screening people in or out of the bench based on their alignment with his agenda for the law?

Fast forward to 2016 and, as Trump White House Counsel Don McGahn later said, the administration “in-sourced” the Federalist Society to choose Trump's slate of judges, some of whom have proven to be independent and willing to defend the rule of law and some of whom (like Aileen Cannon, James Ho, and Matthew Kacsmaryk) have seemingly chosen loyalty or advancing an extreme political agenda over the law. Trump 2.0 seems determined to choose more judges of that ilk, evidenced by Trump's nomination of his criminal defense lawyer Emil Bove and anti-abortion zealot Joshua Divine. In the first Trump term, the ABA continued to give post-nomination ratings and some of Trump's nominees were so unqualified — including some who were essentially just MAGA bloggers — that they received NQ votes even though the Republican-controlled Senate was unlikely to be critical of Trump nominees.

But this past month, in the midst of Trump's personal attacks on Leo, Leo got one of his early wishes: The administration announced that the American Bar Association would no longer have any role in the evaluation and Trump judicial candidates would be told not to meet with the ABA or respond to their questions or questionnaires.

That's certainly a signal that Trump 2.0 nominees will be even more unqualified to be federal judges — and unworthy to be trusted to act with allegiance to the law and fairness rather than loyalty to Trump — as my partner at Court Accountability, Alex Aronson, wrote about recently.

That's a win for Leo and a loss for the rest of us — because the U.S. needs fair judges, now more than ever.

Polls recorded shifts in NYC residents' priorities following mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's campaigning on housing.

Democrats claim that they are looking for candidates to fix their electoral losses following Donald Trump's victory. The data shows that Democrats lost ground among young men, urban communities of color, and among voters who cared about affordability issues. Much of the Democratic Party's leadership is so old that three Democratic Congressional Caucus members died while still in office in 2025, allowing for Trump's so-called “big, beautiful bill” to pass the House. Currently, in the New York City mayor's race, the current front-runners are Zohran Mamdani (a 33-year-old democratic socialist State Assemblymember) and Andrew Cuomo (a 67-year-old scandal-plagued former governor pushing fearmongering anti-crime rhetoric that repeats right-wing talking points about New York City). The Democratic leadership class's consolidation of support for Cuomo, including many who called for his resignation in 2021, shows that they are continuing to pursue the sort of poll-driven, consultant-class strategy that has previously doomed the Democratic Party to defeats.

Following the 2024 general election, pundits and commentators began a circular firing squad to find the problems in the Democratic Party's electoral strategy. The dominant narrative that seemed to emerge among a set of establishment-aligned Democrats was that Trump won the national election because the party had shifted too far to the left. New York Congressman Ritchie Torres blamed the “far left” and its ivory tower. Mayoral incumbents associated with criminal justice reforms were ousted by moderate challengers in San Francisco and Portland, who claimed that crime and homelessness had ruined cities. Even left-liberal publications like The Nation argued that “blanket progressive appeals to an ideological diverse base” might not be effective to turn out the Democratic base. A February 2025 Gallup survey found that of the Democrats polled, 45 percent wanted the party to become “more moderate” and only 29 percent more liberal; in 2021, only 34 percent wanted the party to become more moderate, while 34 percent wanted the party to become more liberal. The Democratic Party, pundits declared, was out of touch with an increasingly conservative general public, and especially with young people.

Even though there was electoral evidence that the country had not swung fully toward the right, this narrative has held a powerful grip on Democratic strategy. Democratic strategist James Carville suggested that Democrats should let the Trump administration destroy the federal government. “Allow the Republicans to crumble beneath their own weight and make the American people miss us,” Carville wrote in The New York Times in February, calling for the party to not act until Trump's approval ratings dropped — a move that Carville called a “tactical pause.” Fearful Democratic leadership, such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, has largely capitulated to Trump's demands; Schumer himself supported a spending bill in March to avoid a government shutdown, and then attempted to evade the liberal backlash that followed to protect his own political position. A May article in The New York Times reported that Democratic Party leadership felt lost and confused about the erosion in their historic social and geographic basis of support, as they dealt with a historically low approval rating of 27 percent among registered voters.

But the Democratic Party leadership, especially elected leaders in Congress, continue to flounder and refuse to act as a unified opposition party. Following the June protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in downtown Los Angeles, 75 House Democrats voted with Republicans on a resolution to show gratitude to ICE. Eleven House Democrats later voted to overturn Washington, D.C.'s status as a sanctuary city and demand that D.C. police collaborate with ICE over the wishes of their city council. These moves come despite polling data that shows Democratic voters prefer that the party fight rather than compromise; 65 percent of Democrats want Congress to hold the line against Republicans on key issues, even if it leads to gridlock in D.C. — a reversal from 2017, the first year of Trump's first term, when 59 percent of Democrats wanted their leadership to compromise with the Trump administration.

Democrats are floundering, and they continue to lack imagination on how to move forward. An example of this can be seen in New York Gov. Kathy Hochul. Hochul, who won by a narrow margin over MAGA Republican candidate Lee Zeldin in 2022, has followed polls and tacked to the center in an attempt to deal with falling approval rates and credible challenges from Republicans like Rep. Elise Stefanik or Rep. Mike Lawler in the upcoming 2026 general election.

After polls showed Republicans taking advantage of narratives around “crime waves,” Hochul chose to heavily focus her 2025 executive budget on rolling back reforms to the criminal legal system. New York's state constitution mandates that the state's budget be passed by April 1. However, this deadline came and went because Hochul could not get buy in from the Democratic-majority State Senate and Assembly chambers, largely over her proposed rollbacks to criminal legal reforms, which included weakening discovery reform, criminalizing the use of masks in public spaces to discourage protest, and giving police greater latitude to involuntarily commit people. The final budget compromised on some of Hochul's goals, allowing only some rollbacks to discovery reform, a very limited mask criminalization, and some greater discretion on involuntary psychological commitment. Despite these changes, Stefanik still slammed Hochul's budget for failing to address New York's “out of control crime.”

Yet all this conservative, reactionary poll-following is not doing Democrats favors. Governor Hochul's approval ratings remained low in May following the budget fight, rather than seeing an increase. A Siena College poll in late May, for example, found most New Yorkers would prefer to support another candidate over Hochul in 2026. Instead of solidifying her support among Democrats and independents concerned about crime, Hochul seems to have alienated some of her base.

However, another story about polls has emerged in the New York City mayoral race. New York City, with a primary election for mayoral candidates scheduled for June 24, has two front-runner candidates: former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo, who resigned in disgrace in 2021 after a spate of sexual harassment allegations, is running on his past record as governor and accusing his opponents of moving too far to the left on crime. (Incidentally, during his tenure as governor, Cuomo signed into law a handful of reforms to the criminal legal system, such as ending cash bail, police transparency reform, and discovery reform.) In contrast, Cuomo's run for mayor has been very heavy on law and order language, as he pledges to “fix” the subways (which he characterized as unsafe and full of homeless people) and hire many more police.

This appeal to the right makes a lot of sense if candidates seek to follow polls. In February, just before Cuomo announced his candidacy, the Manhattan Institute polled likely voters to rank their top issues. Forty-nine percent of respondents ranked crime as their first concern, followed by housing costs (29 percent), closely followed by jobs and economy (28 percent). While more Republicans (65 percent) chose crime than Democrats, crime was still a top issue for 47 percent of poll respondents.

But Mamdani has taken a different path towards his candidacy. While addressing public safety concerns with a public safety plan that would expand violence interrupter and mental health programs, Mamdani has stayed focused on a message of an affordable New York, emphasizing his plan for free buses, free child care, and rent freezes. Combined with slick television ads and a noteworthy social media machine, the campaign has had a wide reach throughout the five boroughs. With a field-oriented campaign and strong public-financed fundraising, Mamdani's campaign has created new priorities among New Yorkers, rather than reacting to them. In a recent poll from May, Emerson College found that key issues had shifted. Now, 30 percent of New Yorkers prioritized housing, as opposed to 19 percent who prioritized crime. In a Data for Progress poll released in early June, similar shifts had occurred, with 28 percent of respondents prioritizing housing, and 18 percent listing crime as their topline issue.

While the New York City mayoral race may have some unique conditions, the rapid shift in priorities among voters demonstrates that leaders have the ability to shape what voters care about. For example, Democrats do not need to follow polls when reacting to the brutality committed by ICE officers. Democrats have many resources, including earned media and other platforms, to create their own narrative condemning these practices and joining the thousands of Americans protesting ICE raids. Voters do not have fixed preferences but rather make their decisions about their key issues based on a variety of sources, such as political television ads, earned media, official statements from elected officials, friends and family, and social media. Democrats do not have to follow the polls to resist Trump or gain electoral victories, but rather need a clear, progressive vision and message that speaks to the affordability issues that so many Americans face today. Only by engaging in brave leadership and helping to lead voters' preferences, not follow them, can we expect changes in this most challenging period of American politics.

Some time in late May, a young male grizzly made an improbable journey to Texada Island, one of the few rural communities in British Columbia that is considered bear-free. His most likely path involved a challenging but not impossible swim of about five kilometres across the Malaspina Strait from the mainland. 

The bear who has been dubbed “Tex” is believed to be four years old – a teenager who would have been chased from his home by bigger grizzlies, including his mother.

While the Texada Island community is divided between fear of the bear and concern for its welfare, both sides agree that Tex can't stay. But the provincial government doesn't want to move him.

“People are on edge,” said Katrin Glenn-Bittner, a long-time resident of Texada, the largest of the Gulf Islands. The bear has visited her remote farm at least twice, but that's not what scares her. She feels like the bear, labelled aggressive by the provincial government, has been set up for conflict that will likely end badly for him. 

Black bears are found in most non-urban areas of the province, but B.C.'s estimated 15,000 grizzlies almost all live on the mainland. They have been listed as extirpated on Vancouver Island and the smaller coastal islands for more than a century. For this youngster, Texada would seem like a haven, without dominant bears around to threaten him.

He was first spotted on the island on May 25, and likely swam from Powell River, where he had been seen a week earlier.

If he had remained on the Sunshine Coast, he might have found a warmer reception. Conservationists there are building bear dens out of old growth stumps to help bears reclaim habitat that has been damaged by commercial logging.

On Texada Island, however, residents have not learned to live alongside large predators. Texada Elementary's principal announced that because of the bear's presence, the school bus would not drop off students unless there was someone on hand to meet them.

“There's no future here for him on Texada Island, because he's targeted, and if he makes a mistake – which may very well happen – he will be instantly destroyed,” said Ms. Glenn-Bittner, who has organized the funds to pay for the bear to be relocated to a remote section of the B.C. central coast.

The Mamalilikulla First Nation wants to bring the grizzly to their traditional territories on the central coast, where they are working to restore grizzly populations. The nation established an Indigenous Protected and Conserved Area (IPCA) in the Lull Bay/Hoeya Sound watershed in Knight Inlet four years ago.

“When they said there was a bear in trouble, I said, that's one of our brothers, bring it up here,” Chief John Powell said in an interview. But the government spurned his offer.

“The unfortunate thing is, it leaves the bear in a place where a chance encounter is going to end up ending in a bad way. It doesn't make sense to me to leave it where it is,” he said.

The Mamalilikulla have been working on watershed restoration in their ICPA and salmon are starting to return. At this time of year, Tex would also find plenty of protein-rich sedges for sustenance in the Lull-Hoeya estuary.

But the bear cannot be moved without the approval and participation of the B.C. Conservation Officer Service.

Ecotour grizzlies less likely to encounter conflict with humans, B.C. study suggests

The COS knows this bear: Tex was relocated twice last year after he was found wandering near schools and downtown areas in Gibsons and Sechelt. But they didn't move him far enough, and the bear returned to populated areas. Because of that, they say he is not a candidate to be moved again.

The COS released a statement saying the bear is displaying aggressive behaviour to both people and livestock, but it does not have plans to either kill or relocate the bear from Texada at this time. Officials did not respond to interview requests.

Neither Randene Neill, Minister of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship, nor Tamara Davidson, Minister of Environment and Parks, would agree to an interview.

The two issued a joint statement saying there is “no ‘kill order' on this bear.” “However, it is also our responsibility to keep people safe and if further behaviour by the grizzly bear occurs that threatens public safety, Conservation Officers will respond to those situations. These are difficult decisions, but again, people's safety is always the top priority. It is our hope that it will not come to this, and the bear will move on independently.”

Bear biologist Wayne McCrory, a leading expert on grizzly bear hazard assessments, said Tex's travels are not so unusual: There is increasing evidence of grizzlies returning to the islands. But he said the population remains fragile, and his efforts to broker the bear's move to Mamalilikulla territory is justified.

“It would be an ideal place to attempt another translocation,” he said. He estimates there is a 30-per-cent chance the bear will stay put if it is relocated. But he is certain the bear will end up dead if it remains where it is. 

“We need to step out of the box of the Conservation Officer Services, and go the extra mile to try and keep these bears alive, instead of leaving them wandering around quite an inhabited island.”

Tex has another ally. Ellie Lamb has spent 28 years as a bear guide, specializing in grizzlies. She reviewed the reports of his behaviour and maintains the COS is unfairly characterizing a young and playful bear as aggressive. 

“This bear has shown no aggression with humans – none – and no level of food conditioning either. So why this bear is not given the opportunity to stay alive is inconceivable.” 

Grizzlies are listed as a species of special concern under Canada's Species At Risk Act. Populations are declining because they are vulnerable to human disturbance and they suffer unsustainable mortality rates in some parts of the country.

Ms. Lamb, who has spent countless hours in the wilderness with grizzlies, believes people have been conditioned to respond with fear because grizzlies are widely misunderstood. People can co-exist with bears, if they understand how.

“I've been taught by the bears, and I am just teaching people, that when a bear is in front of them, it doesn't mean that their life flashes before their eyes, but they actually can peacefully move away from the bear and give them space,” she said. 

“Different bears have different personalities, but as a general rule, they're evolved to get along with others.”

            A panel of three federal appellate judges has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in each of the state's public school classrooms is unconstitutional.
    


            The ruling Friday marked a major win for civil liberties groups who say the mandate violates the separation of church and state, and that the poster-sized displays would isolate students — especially those who are not Christian.
    


            The mandate has been touted by Republicans, including President Donald Trump, and marks one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms. Backers of the law argue the Ten Commandments belong in classrooms because they are historical and part of the foundation of US law.
    


            “This is a resounding victory for the separation of church and state and public education,” said Heather L. Weaver, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. “With today's ruling, the Fifth Circuit has held Louisiana accountable to a core constitutional promise: Public schools are not Sunday schools, and they must welcome all students, regardless of faith.”

            The plaintiffs' attorneys and Louisiana disagreed on whether the appeals court's decision applied to every public school district in the state or only the districts party to the lawsuit.
    


            “All school districts in the state are bound to comply with the US Constitution,” said Liz Hayes, a spokesperson for Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which served as co-counsel for the plaintiffs.
    


            The appeals court's rulings “interpret the law for all of Louisiana,” Hayes added. “Thus, all school districts must abide by this decision and should not post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms.”
    


            Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said she disagreed and believed the ruling only applied to school districts in the five parishes that were party to the lawsuit. Murrill added that she would appeal the ruling, including taking it to the US Supreme Court if necessary.
    


            The panel of judges reviewing the case was unusually liberal for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In a court with more than twice as many Republican-appointed judges, two of the three judges involved in the ruling were appointed by Democratic presidents.
    


            The court's ruling stems from a lawsuit filed last year by parents of Louisiana school children from various religious backgrounds, who said the law violates First Amendment language guaranteeing religious liberty and forbidding government establishment of religion.
    


            The ruling also backs an order issued last fall by US District Judge John deGravelles, who declared the mandate unconstitutional and ordered state education officials not to enforce it and to notify all local school boards in the state of his decision.
    


            Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the mandate into law last June.
    


            Landry said in a statement Friday that he supports the attorney general's plans to appeal.
    


            “The Ten Commandments are the foundation of our laws — serving both an educational and historical purpose in our classrooms,” Landry said.
    


            Law experts have long said they expect the Louisiana case to make its way to the US Supreme Court, testing the court on the issue of religion and government.
    


            Similar laws have been challenged in court.
    


            A group of Arkansas families filed a federal lawsuit earlier this month challenging a near-identical law passed in their state. And comparable legislation in Texas currently awaits Gov. Greg Abbott's signature.
    


            In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a Kentucky law violated the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.
    


            And in 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.

Hoping to avoid a repeat snub after failing to meet U.S. President Donald Trump at the G7 in Kananaskis, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he hasn't decided whether he'll attend next week's NATO summit in the Netherlands.

Mr. Zelensky has been formally invited to the NATO summit that begins Tuesday in The Hague but hasn't yet confirmed he'll attend. Speaking Friday, Mr. Zelensky said there were several factors that would decide whether he makes the trip – including whether he could secure a “very important” meeting with Mr. Trump.

“I am not sure that I will go, but still the probability is high. In fact, I will decide the day before,” Mr. Zelensky told journalists in Kyiv, including The Globe and Mail. The remarks were approved for publication by the President's Office on Saturday.

If he gets a chance to speak face-to-face with the U.S. President, Mr. Zelensky plans to ask Mr. Trump to authorize the sale of 10 U.S-made Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine – systems he indicated that Ukraine was willing to pay for with the help of its other allies. Mr. Zelensky said he also wanted to discuss new sanctions against Russia, as well as how to breathe “a new breath of air into the diplomatic track,” referring to Mr. Trump's stalled efforts to push Russia and Ukraine toward a peace deal.

“We need more certainty and more pressure from the world on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin – this is necessary for the sake of diplomacy. I would like to talk about these formats with him,” Mr. Zelensky said late Friday, speaking inside the fortified Presidential Administration complex in Kyiv. 

“For us, it is a priority to maintain America's support,” he added, saying that having to fight the Russian invasion without U.S. support would be “the most difficult situation” for Ukraine. “Putin really wants us to be without America.”

Opinion: The good old-fashioned reason that the G7 still matters

Ukraine received US$64.6-billion in military assistance from the U.S. under former president Joe Biden following the start of the Russian invasion in February, 2022, but no new weapons shipments since Mr. Trump took office in January. 

Mr. Zelensky called on Ukraine's other partners to allocate 0.25 per cent of their GDP to helping Kyiv ramp-up domestic weapons production and said the country plans to sign agreements this summer to start exporting weapon production technologies. He said his office was in talks with Canada, Britain, Germany, Norway, Denmark and Lithuania to begin joint weapons production.

Mr. Trump caught the Kananaskis gathering off-guard when he left the two-day meeting after less than 24 hours, saying he needed to return to Washington to deal with the escalating Israel-Iran war. His departure came before an expected meeting with Mr. Zelensky, who said it was evident that “for President Trump, the Israel-Iran issue is certainly a higher priority” than the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

One of the things Mr. Trump did do in Kananaskis was lobby for Russia to be restored as a member of what used to be called the G8. Russia was expelled from the club in 2014 after it illegally seized and annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine.

Mr. Zelensky also left Canada early, cancelling a planned press conference, to return to Kyiv after Russia launched one of the heaviest drone-and-missile bombardments of the Ukrainian capital in more than 1,200 days of war. At least 28 people were killed in the nine-hour attack.

Mr. Zelensky repeatedly praised the job Prime Minister Mark Carney did in preserving unity among the G7 leaders, despite the fact the joint statement issued at the conclusion of the meeting made no mention of Ukraine or the Russian invasion. 

The communiqué issued at the end of the 2024 summit in Italy mentioned Ukraine 53 times, with leaders vowing “our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes” and saying “Russia must end its illegal war of aggression and pay for the damage it has caused to Ukraine.”

Those words were absent from the 2025 declaration, as U.S. officials reportedly pushed for more neutral language towards the conflict that Canada and the other member countries – France, Britain, Germany, Italy and Japan – wouldn't accept.

What the G7 statements released by world leaders say and don't say

The same problem is expected to arise again at this week's summit of the 32 leaders of the NATO military alliance, with U.S. officials again seeking to limit references to Ukraine in the final statement. A year ago, the alliance declared “Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has shattered peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area and gravely undermined global security” and pledged to “bolster our long-term support to Ukraine so it can prevail in its fight for freedom.”

Mr. Zelensky was careful not to criticize the G7 communiqué, saying only “this is the solution they were able to find.” A separate statement issued by Mr. Carney, as the G7 chair, said the leaders “expressed support for President Trump's efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.”

Mr. Zelensky said Russia was “dragging out” ceasefire negotiations in Istanbul, agreeing to occasional exchanges of prisoners of war, and the return of some of the dead bodies of combatants, hoping to show enough progress to convince Mr. Trump to ease sanctions. 

Mr. Zelensky said the Russian side had actually sent 20 bodies of their own soldiers to Ukraine in the last exchange, which Mr. Zelensky said revealed the Kremlin's disdain for the entire process. “They threw the corpses of their citizens at us. This is their attitude towards war, towards their soldiers.”

On Friday, Mr. Putin sounded far less interested in peace than in continuing his war of conquest.

“I consider Russians and Ukrainians to be one people. In that sense, all of Ukraine is ours,” he said in a speech to the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. “There is a saying: wherever a Russian soldier sets foot, that is ours.”

Robert Kubica is a name which engenders strong emotion amongst all motorsport fans.
    


            Seen as one of car racing's most prodigious talents in the early 2000s, the Polish driver burst onto the Formula One circuit with BMW-Sauber in 2006.
    


            Having claimed a first career win in 2008 at the Canadian Grand Prix and signing a contract to join F1's most coveted team, Ferrari, Kubica's world was turned upside down in 2011 following a serious and near-fatal crash.
    


            Competing at the Ronde di Andora rally championship, the Pole was left trapped in his car for over an hour after colliding with a metal barrier at high speed.
    


            Suffering from significant blood loss, the then-26-year-old underwent a life-saving seven-hour operation in which he had a partial amputation of his forearm. Further operations followed, with Kubica also suffering severe injuries to his right elbow, shoulder and leg.
    


            Lucky to escape with his life, his motorsport career was seemingly over.
    


            However, this past weekend and more than 14 years later, Kubica completed what is perceived by many to be the greatest motorsport comeback of all time, winning the iconic 24 hours of Le Mans endurance race.
    


            In doing so, he became just the second driver this century to win both an F1 grand prix and Le Mans, joining Fernando Alonso.
    


            “As an endurance racer, this is the highest goal you can achieve. It is the Olympic Games of motorsport, so I am honoured to have won such an event,” Kubica, who was driving for AF Corse alongside Great Britain's Phil Hanson and China's Yifei Ye, told CNN Sports.
    


            “I was a bit surprised by all the attention I got after winning it. From fans, from media – I didn't know so many people had my phone number.
    


            “Even people who aren't into racing text(ed) me, which shows the regard Le Mans is held in. I think we can compare it to the biggest events in sport, and certainly motorsport.”
    


            On social media, some fans have likened Kubica's ascent back to the top of racing to a Hollywood movie.
    


            “This makes sense to me that people on the outside would think that,” he said. “But what they don't see is all the difficult moments and tough times.
    


            “After my accident, I had hard weeks, months, even years, where I struggled to adapt and come to terms with what had happened. Those were very difficult periods in my life and I'm fortunate to have been able to work my way through them.”
    


            Reflecting on those periods where he struggled to come to terms with losing out on his dream F1 move to Ferrari, Kubica believes that his strong will power guided him through.
    


            “There were many moments where I could have cracked,” he said.
    


            “But the key for me was that I always had a very strong character. Sometimes before the accident this was probably an obstacle in my life, but during those tough and difficult periods, it certainly helped me.”
    


            It is this attitude which Kubica feels helped him so much with his clearly successful transition into the world of endurance racing from F1.
    


            Having battled back following his initial rehab and working his way up through the racing circuit, Kubica ultimately managed to reclaim an F1 seat in 2019 for Williams Racing.
    


            After what he described himself as a “tricky return, to put it kindly,” he felt he had other challenges in motorsport to conquer, therefore beginning his shift towards the endurance world.
    


            “The strength of character certainly helped me when joining endurance racing', Kubica said.
    


            The 99-race veteran added that the requirement to compete as part of a team unit often proves too much of an obstacle for many F1 drivers looking to enter endurance racing.
    


            “As drivers in F1 or F2 or even as early as karting as a kid, we are told that our biggest enemy is our teammate, that we need to beat them no matter what,” said Kubica. “But racing in endurance, there is a need to work as a team and not be the star.”
    


            With races ranging from six to 24 hours long, Kubica has shared the driving responsibilities in AF Corse's Porsche Hypercar this season with Hanson and Ye.
    


            “My teammates will probably tell you that I can be a little hard on them sometimes but that just comes from my will to win. We actually all get on really well,” he said.
    


            “The biggest thing for me is that I already feel fulfilled as a driver. I have raced in F1 already and don't have that urge to act in my own self-interest to try and impress a manufacturer.
    


            “It's not that I don't want to perform well, of course I'm doing everything I can to do that. But I don't have to do it at the cost of my teammates.
    


            “For younger drivers, there is a risk that you lose focus of what is the most important thing. In endurance, that is to put your teammates in the best possible position, and sometimes you need to sacrifice yourself in order to do that.”
    


            On Thursday, Kubica returned to Poland to a hero's welcome. Already a national favourite for his exploits in F1, he cemented his legacy as one of the nation's sporting greats by becoming its first Le Mans champion.
    


            “I had people coming up to me and telling me how they had no interest in racing at all but that they sat and watched the final moments of the race with family and friends,” Kubica explained.
    


            “I even had one woman come up to me and tell me how she burst into tears as I crossed the finish line. It really seems to have been a moment which has gone far beyond sport for not only motorsport fans, but Polish people in general.”
    


            As for what comes next for the man once described by Lewis Hamilton as one of the top five drivers in the world, Kubica said that whatever the venture is, it will be fuelled by passion.
    


            “This morning I woke up and I'm already thinking about what is next, about what is possible and what I'd like to do,” the 40-year-old said.
    


            “What is possible? I don't know. But one thing that is for sure is that I will do whatever I would like to do, and not what pays me most money in my pocket or what will bring me the most fame.”
    


            He added: “Knowing myself, the next thing will not be easy. It must be a challenge and an adventure for me.
    


            “That might be trying to come back and win Le Mans again but we'll see. I just want to try and continue to chase my passion and enjoy everything that comes with that.”
    


            Many may expect a veteran racer such as Kubica to drive off into the sunset following such a momentous career crescendo.
    


            But for the Pole, as long as that passion for the sport is still burning, he will find it hard to walk away.
    


            “My passion has brought me to where I am today. I don't know if I'd have made it back from the accident if it weren't for the drive it gives me,” Kubica said.
    


            “It would have been easy to just say to myself, ‘OK, I made it to F1 already so I won't risk driving again.'
    


            “But in the end, my passion was too great to let that happen and even now, I can still feel it there at the same levels it was at when I first started karting as a small kid.”
    


            For the time being, before the ultimate decision on his racing future is made, Kubica still has half a season of the World Endurance Championship to complete.
    


            “I always say we have no control over the future and can just influence what is happening now,” he said. “So for the next few months, I am solely thinking about each race as it comes.
    


            “Hopefully, one day, there will be a time where I can look back on all that I've done, and there will be a lot of emotions when I do. But for now, I am focusing on making more of these moments which can last forever'.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has issued layoff notices to over 600 employees of Voice of America (VOA), dramatically reducing the outlet's staff to fewer than 200, the New York Times (NYT) reported on June 20.

VOA, launched in 1942 to counter wartime propaganda, has long been a central pillar of U.S. public diplomacy, broadcasting in 49 languages to more than 360 million people worldwide.

Trump's crackdown against Voice of America has been celebrated by Russian propagandists, who welcomed the cuts to the network.

The dismissals, described as reductions in force, affect both journalists and support staff, who will remain on paid leave until Sept. 1. The cuts are the biggest rollback of the federally funded broadcaster in decades, reducing its staff to one-seventh of what it was at the start of 2025.

The Trump administration's move follows months of attrition at the agency. In February, the outlet employed approximately 1,300 staff. Since then, programming has been slashed, with broadcasts now limited to just four languages.

The decision to dismantle VOA has met legal challenges. 

On April 22, a U.S. federal judge ordered the administration to reinstate all employees and contractors, ruling that the mass dismissal likely violated U.S. law. However, a federal appeals court overturned that order, allowing the layoffs to proceed.

The Trump administration temporarily reinstated several staff members from VOA's Persian-language service amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. But at least two of those individuals also received layoff notices on June 20, according to the NYT.

Trump has repeatedly attacked U.S.-funded media outlets over their coverage, often referring to them as "fake news." His administration has framed the VOA cuts as a cost-saving measure and a response to what it views as politically biased reporting.

President Vladimir Putin claimed on June 20 that Russia's economy is strong despite war and sanctions, brushing off mounting warnings from his own officials about stagnation and looming recession.

Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin was asked about reports that the ongoing war in Ukraine was "killing" the Russian economy.

"Rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated," he replied, quoting American writer Mark Twain.

The president claimed that Russia has outpaced global economic growth over the past two years, allegedly expanding by over 4% annually.

"Our most important task is to ensure the economy's transition to a balanced growth trajectory," Putin said. "At the same time, some specialists and experts point to the risks of stagnation and even recession. This should not be allowed under any circumstances."

The statement came just a day after Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina warned on that Russia's wartime economic momentum is fading fast. She said the economy is approaching the limits of its growth potential, adding that previously effective tools are now exhausted.

Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov echoed the concerns, telling a separate forum audience on June 19 that Russia is "on the verge of a transition to recession." He emphasized that recession is not inevitable and that "everything depends on our decisions." 

Moscow has experienced rapid inflation and historically high interest rates amid its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The central bank raised rates repeatedly to combat inflation, but on June 6, it made its first cut in nearly two years, from 21% to 20%.

Putin has criticized the central bank's tight monetary policy for choking off private investment, especially in non-defense sectors.

Despite Putin's optimistic rhetoric, analysts attribute Russia's economic slowdown to sustained international sanctions, falling oil prices, rising wartime spending, and supply disruptions.

Russia's ever-mounting losses on the battlefield which recently passed the 1 million mark are also likely contrbuting to the economic turmoil as the Kremlin is having to pay people to sign up to fight rather than introduce what would be a hugely unpopular mass mobilization.

According to an analysis by economist Janis Kluge, Russia's daily bill just for sign-up bonuses is $24 million.

The ballooning bills come at a time when Russia's economy is already under huge strain from Western sanctions and falling oil and gas revenues.

"The implications for Russia are grave," energy security analyst Wojciech Jakobik wrote in an op-ed for the Kyiv Independent this week.

US President Donald Trump believes a negotiated agreement between Russia and Ukraine is the only viable path to ending the conflict between the two countries, according to State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce.

Trump's efforts to mediate a truce between Russia and Ukraine contributed to the countries restarting direct negotiations in Türkiye last month – talks that Kiev abandoned in 2022 to focus on its military efforts.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that while Moscow is not seeking an unconditional surrender, Kiev must acknowledge the “realities on the ground,” and that its negotiating position worsens with each passing day.

In a press briefing on Friday, Bruce was asked whether those remarks mean that Moscow is not serious about the talks, and how Washington would respond.

“As I've mentioned before, during negotiations, things sometimes progress, things change. That's the whole point of negotiations and conversations: You signal how long you're generally willing to wait, but you also know if someone is serious,” she said, noting, “At the same time, we've heard some very blunt comments by President Trump about President Putin.”

That's where we've landed at this point in comments from both the president and secretary of state – that the only way this is going to end is for the two parties to meet and come to a conclusion and a decision, and some kind of an agreement.

She added that while the US remains Ukraine's “biggest supporter,” the process of peace negotiations is complex and constantly evolving. “We are clearly making our presence and our care about the situation known... but this is not about reacting to a single quote or online statement,” she said.

Asked about Putin's assertion that Russia now holds a “strategic advantage” in the conflict, Bruce declined to comment on potential punitive measures or sanctions, reiterating: “We're not going to listen to what [Russia] says – we're going to watch what they do.”

“Only the president can make the decision about how to proceed. Only he knows all the elements about what's important and how we're going to make a difference,” she said. “As I term it… there is one guiding hand to the choices that we make. And that would include Russia, Ukraine, and every conflict he's trying to stop.”

The spokeswoman added that direct engagement between Moscow and Washington continues behind the scenes, involving “months now of dealing with the parties directly,” and argued that Trump, as “the most powerful leader in the world right now,” is better positioned than the public or press to assess the situation.

There are some 700,000 Americans in Israel, many of them dual nationals, according to estimates.Mahmoud Illean/The Associated Press

The U.S. evacuated 79 staff and families from the U.S. Embassy in Israel on Friday as the conflict between Israel and Iran intensifies and growing numbers of private American citizens seek information on how to leave Israel and Iran.

An internal State Department memo says the military flight, the second known to have occurred this week, left Tel Aviv for Sofia, Bulgaria, where some or all of the passengers were to get a connecting charter flight to Washington.

The document, which was obtained by The Associated Press, also said that more than 6,400 U.S. citizens in Israel had filled out an online form on Friday alone asking for information about when and if the U.S. government would organize evacuation flights. An additional 3,265 people, some of whom may also have competed the form, called an emergency number seeking assistance.

The document estimated that between 300 and 500 people per day could need evacuation assistance should the U.S. decide to offer flights or ships to get Americans out, as the U.S. ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said is being considered.

For Iranian-Americans, a potential U.S. attack on the regime brings complex feelings

There are some 700,000 Americans in Israel, many of them dual nationals, according to estimates, although the exact number at any given time is unclear because U.S. citizens are not required to notify the embassy if they are there or when they might leave.

Earlier Friday, before the memo was distributed, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters that more than 25,000 Americans had reached out for information on leaving Israel, the West Bank and Iran.

She told reporters that those people had sought “information and support” and were “seeking guidance” on departing. She would not give a breakdown of where the queries had come from and would not comment on embassy evacuations.

In Iran, the document said that at least 84 U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, or Green Card holders, had crossed into neighboring Azerbaijan by land since the conflict began and that an additional 774 had been granted permission to enter as of Friday.

Nearly 200 American citizens and Green Card holders are awaiting permission to travel overland from Iran to neighboring Turkmenistan, it said.

UNITED NATIONS, June 21. /TASS/. Only an immediate start of constructive negotiations with Russia can save Ukraine from total disaster, Russian Permanent Representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzya said.

"The only thing that can save Ukraine from total disaster is the immediate start of constructive and realistic negotiations," he said. "We suggest holding the next round in Istanbul after June 22."

He thanked the United States for supporting the direct dialogue between Moscow and Kiev.

MOSCOW, June 21. /TASS/. Iraq has extended the ban on civil aviation flights in the country's airspace for another day, the dispatch service of the Baghdad flight information dispatch service, which is responsible for air traffic over the country, told TASS.

"The airspace is still closed. The ban on civil aircraft flights is in force until 7:00 p.m. GMT," the agency said.

This will be the ninth day of ban on civilian air traffic in the region.

Iranian missiles were intercepted over Jerusalem in the early hours of Saturday. A week into their war, Israel and Iran have exchanged more strikes, while diplomatic efforts led by the Europeans took place in Geneva.

Iran's response to Israeli strikes on its territory was “legitimate and legal,” while condemning Israel's actions as “banditry,” says Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

A spokesperson for the Fire Department in Northern Israel said on Saturday that an Iranian drone hit a building in northern Israel causing damage but no injuries.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel ‘s military said Saturday it was preparing for the possibility of a lengthy war, and announced it struck an Iranian nuclear research facility overnight and killed three senior Iranian commanders in targeted attacks.

The prospect of a wider war threatened, too. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen said they would resume attacks on U.S. vessels and warships in the Red Sea if the Trump administration joins Israel's military campaign against Iran. The Houthis paused such attacks in May under a deal with the U.S.

The U.S. ambassador to Israel announced the U.S. has begun “assisted departure flights,” the first such flights from Israel since the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza.

Inside Iran, smoke rose from an area near a mountain in Isfahan, where the province's deputy governor for security affairs, Akbar Salehi, confirmed the Israeli strikes damaged the facility but caused no casualties.

The target was a centrifuge production site, Israel's military said. Isfahan was also hit in the first 24 hours of the war as part of Israel's goal to destroy Iran's nuclear program. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed the latest attack.

Iran again launched drones and missiles at Israel but there were no immediate reports of significant damage.

An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity under army guidelines to brief reporters, called it a “small barrage” that was largely intercepted by Israel's defenses. The official estimated that Israel's military has taken out more than 50% of Iran's launchers.




“We're making it harder for them to fire toward Israel,” he said. “Having said all that, I want to say the Iranian regime obviously still has capabilities.”

The Israeli military's chief spokesman, Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, later said Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir told the army to prepare for a “prolonged campaign.”

U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing active U.S. military involvement in the war. On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said “I think that it would be very, very dangerous for everyone.” He spoke on the sidelines of an Organization of Islamic Cooperation meeting in Turkey.

Barring a commando raid or even a nuclear strike, Iran's underground Fordo uranium enrichment facility is considered out of reach to all but America's “bunker-buster” bombs. Trump said he would put off his decision on military involvement for up to two weeks.

The war erupted June 13, with Israeli airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear and military sites, top generals and nuclear scientists. At least 722 people, including 285 civilians, have been killed in Iran and more than 2,500 wounded, according to a Washington-based Iranian human rights group.

One Tehran resident, Nasrin, writhed in her hospital bed as she described how a blast threw her against a wall in her apartment. “I've had five surgeries. I think I have nothing right here that is intact,” she said Saturday. Another patient, Shahram Nourmohammadi, said he had been making deliveries when “something blew up right in front of me” at an intersection.

A number of Iranians fled the country. “Everyone is leaving Tehran right now,” said one who did not give his name after crossing into Armenia.

Iran has retaliated by firing more than 450 missiles and 1,000 drones at Israel, according to Israeli army estimates. Israel's multitiered air defenses have shot down most of them, but at least 24 people in Israel have been killed and hundreds wounded.

Iran has long maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but it is the only non-nuclear-weapon state to enrich uranium up to 60% — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Israel is widely believed to be the only Middle Eastern country with a nuclear weapons program but has never acknowledged it.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel's military operation will continue “for as long as it takes” to eliminate what he called the existential threat of Iran's nuclear program and ballistic missile arsenal.

While talks in Geneva on Friday failed to produce a breakthrough, Iran's foreign minister said he was open to further dialogue. He emphasized that Tehran had no interest in negotiating with the U.S. while Israel continues to attack.

No date was set for a new round of talks.

For many Iranians, updates remained difficult. Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org said Saturday that limited internet access had again “collapsed.” A nationwide internet shutdown has been in place for several days.

Israel's defense minister said the military killed a paramilitary Revolutionary Guard commander who financed and armed Hamas in preparation for the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the ongoing 20-month war in Gaza.

Iranian officials did not immediately confirm Saeed Izadi's death, but the Qom governor's office said there had been an attack on a four-story apartment building and local media reported two people had been killed.

Israel also said it killed the commander of the Quds Force's weapons transfer unit, who it said was responsible for providing weapons to Hezbollah and Hamas. Behnam Shahriyari was killed while traveling in western Iran, the military said.

Iranian leaders say IAEA chief Rafael Grossi's statements about the status of Iran's nuclear program prompted Israel's attack. On Saturday, a senior adviser for Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamanei, Ali Larijani, said on social media, without elaboration, that Iran would make Grossi “pay” once the war is over.

Grossi, the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog, on Friday warned against attacks on Iran's nuclear reactors, particularly its only commercial nuclear power plant in the southern city of Bushehr.

“In case of an attack on the Bushehr nuclear power plant, a direct hit would result in a very high release of radioactivity,” Grossi said, adding: “This is the nuclear site in Iran where the consequences could be most serious.”

Israel has not targeted Iran's nuclear reactors, instead focusing strikes on the main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, centrifuge workshops near Tehran, laboratories in Isfahan and the country's Arak heavy water reactor southwest of the capital.

Iran previously agreed to limit its uranium enrichment and allow international inspectors access to its nuclear sites under a 2015 deal in exchange for sanctions relief. But after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal during his first term, Iran began enriching uranium up to 60% and restricting access to its nuclear facilities.

Iran has insisted on its right to enrich uranium — at lower levels — in recent talks over its nuclear program. But Trump, like Israel, has demanded Iran end its enrichment program altogether.

"You guys know me — I'm a calm-demeanor type of person," Santana said through an interpreter after the game. "I've never had any issues for any of the teams I've played for. This guy crossed the line a few times."

The incident played out during the seventh inning of the second game near the visitor's bullpen. Santana was seen approaching the wall with a security guard or officer and pointing in the direction of a fan.

That's when the reliever leaped up and took a swing at the fan.

"He crossed the line, and I'd like to leave it at that. I've never had anything like this happen in my eight years in baseball," Santana added. 

Santana will still appear for the Pirates as his appeal of the suspension is reviewed by the league.

After nearly two years of stark divisions over the war in Gaza and support for Israel, Democrats are now finding themselves at odds over U.S. policy toward Iran as progressives demand unified opposition to President Donald Trump's consideration of a strike against Tehran's nuclear program while party leaders tread more cautiously. 

U.S. leaders of all stripes have found common ground for two decades on the position that Iran cannot be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. The longtime U.S. foe has supported groups that have killed Americans across the Mideast and threatens to destroy Israel. But Trump's public flirtation with joining Israel's offensive against Iran may become the Democratic Party's latest schism, just as it is sharply dividing Trump's isolationist “Make America Great Again” base from more hawkish conservatives.

While progressives have staked out clear opposition to Trump's potential actions, the party leadership is playing the safer ground of demanding a role for Congress before Trump could use force against Iran. Many prominent Democrats with 2028 presidential aspirations are staying silent, so far, on the Israel-Iran war.

“They are sort of hedging their bets,” said Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who served under Democratic President Barack Obama and is now a strategist on foreign policy. “The beasts of the Democratic Party's constituencies right now are so hostile to Israel's war in Gaza that it's really difficult to come out looking like one would corroborate an unauthorized war that supports Israel without blowback.”

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., has called Trump's consideration of an attack “a defining moment for our party” and has introduced legislation with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., that calls on the Republican president to “terminate” the use of U.S. armed forces against Iran unless “explicitly authorized” by a declaration of war from Congress. 

Khanna used Trump's own campaign arguments of putting American interests first when the congressman spoke to Theo Von, a comedian who has been supportive of the president and is popular in the “manosphere.”

“That's going to cost this country a lot of money that should be being spent here at home,” said Khanna, who is said to be among the many Democrats eyeing the party's 2028 primary.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who twice sought the Democratic presidential nomination, pointed to Trump's stated goal during his inaugural speech of being known as “a peacemaker and a unifier.”

“Very fine words. Trump should remember them today. Supporting Netanyahu's war against Iran would be a catastrophic mistake,” Sanders said about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Sanders has reintroduced legislation prohibiting the use of federal money for force against Iran, insisted that U.S. military intervention would be unwise and illegal and accused Israel of striking unprovoked. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York signed on to a similar bill from Sanders in 2020, but he is so far holding off this time.

Some believe the party should stake out a clear anti-war stance as Trump weighs whether to launch a military offensive that is seemingly counter to the anti-interventionism he promised during his 2024 campaign. 

“The leaders of the Democratic Party need to step up and loudly oppose war with Iran and demand a vote in Congress,” said Tommy Vietor, a former Obama aide, on X. 

The staunch support from the Democratic administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for Israel's war against Hamas loomed over the party's White House ticket in 2024, even with the criticism of Israel's handling of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Trump exploited the divisions to make inroads with Arab American voters and Orthodox Jews on his way back to the White House.

Today, the Israel-Iran war is the latest test for a party struggling to repair its coalition before next year's midterm elections and the quick-to-follow kickoff to the 2028 presidential race. Bridging the divide between an activist base that is skeptical of foreign interventions and already critical of U.S. support for Israel and more traditional Democrats and independents who make up a sizable, if not always vocal, voting bloc. 

In a statement after Israel's first strikes, Schumer said Israel has a right to defend itself and “the United States' commitment to Israel's security and defense must be ironclad as they prepare for Iran's response.” 

Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., was also cautious in responding to the Israeli action and said “the U.S. must continue to stand with Israel, as it has for decades, at this dangerous moment.” 

“It really seems like the Trump and Iran war track is kind of going along like a Formula 1 racetrack, and then the Democrats are in some sort of tricycle or something trying to keep up,” said Ryan Costello, a policy director for the Washington-based National Iranian American Council, which advocates for diplomatic engagement between U.S. and Iran. 

Other Democrats have condemned Israel's strikes and accused Netanyahu of sabotaging nuclear talks with Iran. They are reminding the public that Trump withdrew in 2018 from a nuclear agreement that limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions negotiated during the Obama administration. 

“Trump created the problem,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., on X. “The single reason Iran was so close to obtaining a nuclear weapon is that Trump destroyed the diplomatic agreement that put major, verifiable constraints on their nuclear program.”

A Pearson Institute/Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from September 2024  found that about half of Democrats said the U.S. was being “too supportive” of Israel and about 4 in 10 said their level support was “about right.” Democrats were more likely than independents and Republicans to say the Israeli government had “a lot” of responsibility for the continuation of the war between Israel and Hamas. 

About 6 in 10 Democrats and half of Republicans felt Iran was an adversary with whom the U.S. was in conflict.

Democratic Rep. Yassamin Ansari, an Iranian American from Arizona, said Iranians are unwitting victims in the conflict because there aren't shelters or infrastructure to protect civilians from targeted missiles as there are in Israel. 

“The Iranian people are not the regime, and they should not be punished for its actions,” Ansari posted on X, while criticizing Trump for fomenting fear among the Iranian population. “The Iranian people deserve freedom from the barbaric regime, and Israelis deserve security.”

Rita Benson LeBlanc, the granddaughter of late New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson, was arrested in South Carolina this week following an alleged dispute with a parking enforcement officer. 

LeBlanc, 48, was arrested by the Charleston Police Department on Monday evening at around 6:30 p.m. and charged with "Assault/Resist/Hinder/Oppose/Interfere with Officer/City Employee," a spokesperson with the department told Fox News Digital.  

She was released early Tuesday morning on a personal recognizance bond.

LeBlanc's arrest stemmed from an incident involving a parking enforcement officer. Police responded to reports that the former heiress had pushed an officer in downtown Charleston. 

A spokesperson for the department told Fox News Digital that LeBlanc had, at one point during the interaction, also taken the officer's parking boot locking tool while the officer was applying a boot to a vehicle.

It was not clear whether the officer was attempting to place a boot on LeBlanc's car. 

LeBlanc was in line to take over the Saints and the New Orleans Pelicans, but following her firing by her grandfather and the subsequent public falling out, Benson's wife, Gayle Benson, became the team's principal owner following his death in 2018.

LeBlanc was an executive and co-owner of the two organizations for just two years before she was fired in 2014, The New Orleans Advocate reported. 

She is due back in court next month.

David is one win away from taking down Goliath.

The Indiana Pacers have scratched and clawed their way to forcing a Game 7 against the heavily favored Oklahoma City Thunder.

Game 7 on Sunday night may be in Oklahoma City, but former Pacers star Jalen Rose has a (rather not surprising) bold prediction.

"All Indy all day," he told Fox News Digital at Fanatics Fest in New York on Friday.

Rose raved about Tyrese Haliburton, who has had his fair share of memorable playoff moments this year. In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he mimicked Pacers legend Reggie Miller with a choke signal. In Game 1 of this series, he hit a game-winner with 0.3 seconds left.

Haliburton played 23 minutes in Game 6 as he deals with a reported calf strain, but if he gets even better by Sunday, Rose thinks his prediction is even more obvious.

"I just wish Haliburton is healthy for Game 7. If he's ready to go, Indiana's gonna win it," he claimed.

"He can dribble, pass and shoot, he makes people around him better, he has an infectious smile. I'm really rooting for him, I'm really rooting for the team, and he's going to keep getting better."

INDIANA PACERS BLOW OUT THUNDER TO SET UP FIRST NBA FINALS GAME 7 SINCE 2016

The Pacers won Game 1 because of Haliburton, and even took a 2-1 series lead after winning the third game of the series. The Thunder then began to show why they won 68 games in the regular season, winning each of the next two.

But with the Pacers' 108-91 win on Thursday, Oklahoma City has outscored Indiana by just seven total points in the entire series.

A win for the Pacers on Sunday would give them their first NBA championship. They won three ABA titles in the early 1970s.

As for Oklahoma City, it would be their first championship since 1979 when they were the Seattle SuperSonics.

Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson reports the latest on the movement of U.S. military assets as tension in the Middle East continues to escalate.

Amid a week of daily attacks between Middle Eastern juggernauts Israel and Iran, President Donald Trump has repeatedly drilled home a key point.

"IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON," the president wrote on social media.

And speaking with reporters in the Oval Office at the White House, Trump highlighted, "I've been saying for 20 years, maybe longer, that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon."

It's a stance U.S. presidents have taken for a couple of decades. And it appears most Americans agree with Trump and his presidential predecessors when it comes to the possibility of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS THINK IRAN POSES REAL THREAT TO U.S. SECURITY

Nearly three-quarters (73%) of registered voters questioned in a new Fox News national survey said they think Iran poses a real security threat to the U.S. That's a 13-point boost since Fox News last asked the question six years ago.

And the poll, conducted June 13-16, indicates wide support across the partisan spectrum. Majorities of Republicans (82%), Democrats (69%) and Independents (62%) agreed that Iran poses a threat.

The survey also showed that 78% of those questioned said they were very or extremely concerned about Iran obtaining a nuclear bomb. And eight in 10 said what happens in the Middle East does matter in the U.S.

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST POLLING FROM FOX NEWS 

Daron Shaw, a veteran GOP pollster and the Republican partner on the Fox News poll, said that "the increased sense that Iran constitutes a threat is real, but it also reflects the unique timing and circumstances surrounding this poll."

"The poll was in the field as images of Iranian missiles falling on Tel Aviv dominated television and the internet -- the immediacy and clarity of the conflict undoubtedly contributes to how voters gauge what is at risk," noted Shaw, who is also a politics professor and chair at the University of Texas.

There was a similar response regarding the threat from Iran in a Ronald Reagan Institute national survey conducted earlier this month, before Israel's initial attack last week sparked the daily bombardments by both nations.

Eighty-four percent of those questioned in the poll, which was shared first with Fox News, said preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons matters to U.S. security and prosperity. 

FOX NEWS LIVE UPDATES ON THE ISRAEL-IRAN ATTACKS

Trump is weighing whether the U.S. should join Israel in striking Iran to cripple its nuclear program and prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

"President Trump doesn't often get a political softball sent his way. His decision to support Israel's attacks on the Islamic Republic of Iran and the prospective decision to deal a limited but decisive blow to Iran's nuclear ambitions by striking the Fordow facility can prove to be political mana from heaven," veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance said.

Lesperance, president of New England College, noted that "If the President makes the case clearly and firmly to the American people, polling data suggests he would enjoy support from his own party, Democrats and Independents. What's more, Trump's decision and subsequent action would crowd out any of the issues or coverage like immigration, the budget, or tariffs in the near term. Politically, a decision to act against Iran is smart politics."

But Lesperance cautioned that "this all assumes that the attacks are successful. It also assumes Americans are tolerant of the repercussions of backlash over the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran."

Six B-2 stealth bombers from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri appear to be en route to a U.S. Air Force base in Guam, U.S. officials confirmed to Fox News. However, it is not immediately clear whether this is related to escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The bombers apparently refueled after launching from Missouri, suggesting they launched without full fuel tanks due to a heavy onboard payload, which could be bunker-buster bombs.

The B-2 can carry two 15-ton bunker-buster bombs—which only the U.S. possesses. Experts say the bombs could be critical to targeting Iran's most heavily fortified nuclear site: Fordow.

HOW BUNKER BUSTER BOMBS WORK AND HOW THEY COULD DESTROY IRAN'S FORDOW NUCLEAR SITE

Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that "destroying [Fordow] from the air is a job only the U.S. can do." 

According to Jonathan Ruhe, Director of Foreign Policy for JINSA, the bunker-busters are designed to use the force of gravity to "penetrate through any mixture of earth, rock, and concrete before the bomb itself then explodes" underground. The explosion that ensues could take out the target fully or "collapse the structure" around the target "without necessarily obliterating it," he explained.

US TROOPS IN THE MIDDLE EAST COULD FACE INCREASED THREATS AMID IRAN CONFLICT: ‘IRREPARABLE DAMAGE'

President Donald Trump, who has said he will make a decision on U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, is expected to return to the White House on Saturday afternoon. The president is expected to receive intelligence briefings with the National Security Council on Saturday and Sunday as he considers possible actions against Iran.

Recently, the president appeared to publicly disagree with Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, stating she was "wrong" when she testified in March that there is "no evidence" Iran is building a nuclear weapon. Gabbard later responded to the apparent controversy, saying that "the dishonest media is intentionally taking my testimony out of context and spreading fake news as a way to manufacture division."

"America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly. President Trump has been clear that can't happen, and I agree," Gabbard added in her post on X.

While the U.S. has not taken direct action in the conflict, the State Department on Friday announced sanctions on Tehran despite Secretary of State Marco Rubio initially putting distance between Jerusalem and Iran. The sanctions were imposed on eight entities and one individual "for their involvement in the procurement and shipment of proliferation-sensitive machinery from China for Iran's defense industry."

The Pentagon did not respond to FOX News' request for comment.

 Fox News national correspondent Jeff Paul reports on an appeals court siding with President Donald Trump on his move to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles on ‘Special Report.'

A federal judge on Friday asked if the Trump administration's military deployment in Los Angeles violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits troops from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil.

This comes as California's challenge to President Donald Trump's deployment of troops to respond to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles returned to a federal courtroom in San Francisco on Friday for a brief hearing. That followed an appeals court handing the Trump administration a victory in the case, with the 9th Circuit appellate panel allowing the president to keep control of National Guard troops he sent to quell riots.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer did not issue any additional rulings but asked for briefings from both sides by noon Monday on whether the federal department violated the Posse Comitatus Act.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in his complaint that "violation of the Posse Comitatus Act is imminent, if not already underway" but last week, Breyer delayed considering that allegation.

Vice President JD Vance, who traveled to Los Angeles on Friday to meet with deployed troops, argued that the court said Trump's reason for sending in federal troops "was legitimate" and that he would do it again if needed.

"The president has a very simple proposal to everybody in every city, every community, every town whether big or small, if you enforce your own laws and if you protect federal law enforcement, we're not going to send in the National Guard because it's unnecessary," Vance told reporters.

National Guard troops have been accompanying federal agents on some immigration raids over the anti-ICE demonstrations, and Marines briefly detained a man on the first day they deployed to protect a federal building, marking the first time federal troops have detained a civilian since deploying to Los Angeles.

Breyer found Trump acted illegally when Trump deployed troops despite opposition from Newsom. But the appellate ruling halted the judge's temporary restraining order.

On Friday, Breyer asked the lawyers to address whether he or the appellate court retains primary jurisdiction to grant an injunction under the Posse Comitatus Act.

California has requested a preliminary injunction returning the control of troops in Los Angeles, where protests have calmed down in recent days, back to Newsom.

Trump argued that the troops are needed to restore order, while Newsom said their presence on the streets escalated tensions and wasted resources.

Breyer said Trump had overstepped his legal authority, which he noted allows presidents to control state National Guard troops only during times of "rebellion or danger of a rebellion."

"The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of 'rebellion,'" Breyer said.

The administration argued that courts cannot second-guess the president's decisions. The appellate panel ruled that presidents do not have unchecked power to seize control of a state's National Guard, but also said that by pointing to violent acts by protesters in this case, the administration had presented enough evidence to show it had reason for federalizing the troops.

The California National Guard will stay under federal control, at least for now, as the lawsuit proceeds.

This is the first federal deployment of a state National Guard without the governor's permission since troops were sent to protect Civil Rights Movement marchers in 1965.

HONG KONG (AP) — A top Beijing official overseeing Hong Kong affairs on Saturday warned of persisting threats in the city as a China-imposed national security law approaches its fifth anniversary, while seeking to allay concerns about the law's impact on the financial hub's openness. 

Speaking at a forum about the law, attended also by the city leader John Lee and other officials, Xia Baolong, the director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Work Office, said various forms of soft resistance continue to emerge in new forms and external forces have never ceased their intervention in Hong Kong.

“Hong Kong has transformed from chaos to order. But just as a tree desires stillness, the wind continues to blow,” Xia said. 

The Beijing and Hong Kong governments deemed the law necessary to maintain the city's stability following anti-government protests in 2019. Under the law, many leading pro-democracy activists, including Jimmy Lai, founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, were prosecuted. Dozens of civil society groups disbanded. 

This month, authorities have stepped up their crackdown, including charging young activist Joshua Wong, who was already sentenced last year over a subversion case, under the law for the second time and targeting a mobile game app. Last week, China's national security authorities in Hong Kong and the city's police launched their first publicly known joint operation, raiding the homes of six people on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security.

Critics say the political changes indicate that the Western-style civil liberties Beijing promised to keep intact when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 are shrinking.

But Xia said the law only targeted an extremely small number of people who severely endanger national security. He also sought to allay concerns about Hong Kong's openness and international position. 

He insisted that normal international exchanges do not violate Hong Kong's national security law but rather are protected by it.

            She doesn't eat, sleep or breathe. But she remembers you, desires you and never logs off.
    


            Her name is Jordan – the AI-powered “digital twin” of former British glamor model Katie Price – and people can pay her to act out their “uncensored dreams.”
    


            “You couldn't get any more human. It's like looking at me years ago,” Price, who shot to fame in the late 1990s as a peroxide-blonde tabloid model and Playboy cover star, told CNN. “It's my voice. It's literally me. It's me.”
    


            On June 9, she joined the ranks of creators, celebrities and AI-generated avatars to be digitally immortalized by OhChat, an eight-month-old startup that uses artificial intelligence to build lifelike digital doubles of public figures. Its patrons can live out their “spicy fantasies” through these AI avatars, OhChat's Instagram page states. The platform has attracted 200,000 users, most of which are based in the United States.
    


            OhChat sits at the provocative intersection of AI, fame and fantasy – where intimacy is simulated and connection is monetized. It goes a step further than platforms such as OnlyFans, where users pay to gain access to adult content from content creators.
    


            It also comes amid growing ethical concerns around AI – from its role in how people earn a living to how they form intimate connections – underscoring questions about whether AI companies are doing enough to ensure the technology isn't being misused.
    


            “This creates exactly the right environment for the human to be left behind completely - while still being exploited,” Eleanor Drage, a senior research fellow at the University of Cambridge's Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence, told CNN.
    


            OhChat CEO Nic Young described the platform as the “lovechild between OnlyFans and OpenAI,” in an exclusive interview with CNN. Once activated, the avatars run autonomously, offering “infinite personalized content” for subscribers. Jordan, for example, is marketed on the platform as “the ultimate British bombshell.”
    


            The tiered subscription model allows users to pay $4.99 per month for unlimited texts on demand, $9.99 for capped access to voice notes and images, or $29.99 for unlimited VIP interaction.
    


            Price, like other creators on the platform, receives an 80% cut from the revenue her AI avatar generates, according to Young. OhChat will keep the remaining 20%.
    


            “You have literally unlimited passive income without having to do anything again,” Young told CNN.
    


            The platform “is an incredibly powerful tool, and tools can be used however the human behind it wants to be used,” he added. “We could use this in a really scary way, but we're using it in a really, I think, good, exciting way.”
    


            Since launching OhChat in October 2024, the company has signed 20 creators – including “Baywatch” actress Carmen Electra. Some of the creators are already earning thousands of dollars per month, Young said.
    


            “It takes away the opportunity cost of time,” he told CNN. “Just don't touch it at all and receive money into your bank account.”
    


            To build a digital twin, OhChat asks creators to submit 30 images of themselves and speak to a bot for 30 minutes. The platform can then generate the digital replica “within hours” using Meta's large language model, according to Young.
    


            Price's AI avatar is trained to mimic her voice, appearance and mannerisms. Jordan can “sext” users, send voice notes and images, and provide on-demand intimacy at scale – all without Price lifting a finger.
    


            “They had to get my movements, my characteristics, my personality,” said Price, who described her digital twin as “scarily fascinating.”
    


            Price's avatar is categorized as “level two” out of four on the platform's internal scale, which ranks the intensity and explicitness of their interactions. “Level two” means sexualized chats and topless imagery, but not full nudity or simulated sex acts. Creators contributing to the platform decide which level their avatar will be.
    


            Price told CNN that creating a digital version of herself has left her feeling “empowered.” The digital twin offers a round-the-clock connection that even her subscription-based OnlyFans account cannot match, she said.
    


            “Obviously, I sleep, whereas she doesn't go to sleep; she's available,” she said.
    


            The rise of AI avatars like Jordan invites deeper scrutiny into a new frontier of digital labor and desire – where creators risk being replaced by their own likeness, fans may be vulnerable to forming emotional attachments to simulations, and platforms profit from interactions that feel real but remain one-sided.
    


            Sandra Wachter, professor of technology and regulation at the University of Oxford, questioned whether it is “socially beneficial to incentivize and monetize human-computer interaction masquerading as emotional discourse.”
    


            Her remarks reflect concerns around emotional dependence on AI companions. While OhChat is for adults, it enters an ecosystem already grappling with the consequences of synthetic intimacy.
    


            Last year, a lawsuit involving Character.AI drew global attention after the mother of a teenager alleged that her son died by suicide following a relationship with the platform's chatbot. Elsewhere, social media users have gone viral describing ChatGPT “boyfriends” and emotional bonds with such digital entities designed to mimic human affection.
    


            “It's all algorithmic theatre: an illusion of reciprocal relationship where none actually exists,” said Toby Walsh, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.
    


            OhChat strikes what Young called a “balance between immersion and transparency,” when asked whether users are informed that they are speaking with AI instead of a real person.
    


            OhChat is “clearly not presenting itself as an in-person or real experience,” he said. “It isn't in the users' interest to be reminded overtly that this is all AI, but we're very clear about that upfront and in the entire experience and offering of the platform.”
    


            But it's in Young's interests to keep users hooked on the platform with personalities like “Jordan,” even if she isn't real, says Walsh.
    


            “These platforms profit from engagement,” he told CNN, “which means the AI is optimized to keep users coming back, spending more time and likely more money.”
    


            Éamon Chawke, a partner at the intellectual property law firm Briffa, notes that there are risks for creators' reputations as well, especially for high-profile figures like Price and Electra.
    


            “Vulnerable fan users may become overly attached to avatars of their heroes and become addicted,” Chawke told CNN. “And if their avatar is hacked or hallucinates and says something offensive, reputational harm to the public figure is likely.”
    


            While Young says ethics “can be a hard thing to define in this industry,” he said the platform operates within “a hell of a lot of strong boundaries.”
    


            Young said OhChat uses safeguards that build on those used by Meta's Facebook – which has struggled to control content on its own platform in the past. Each creator signs an agreement outlining the exact behavioral rules for their digital twin, he said, including the level of sexual content permitted. Avatars can also be revoked or deleted at any time, he added.
    


            “It's within their control and at their sole discretion whether or when to ever stop their digital twin, or delete it,” he told CNN.
    


            But Young is prepared to face the tough questions; in his vision of the future, digital duplicates will be the norm.
    


            “I can't imagine a future where every creator doesn't have a digital twin,” he said. “I think it just will be the case, with absolute certainty, that every single creator and celebrity will have an AI version of themselves, and we want to be the layer that makes that happen.”

Madeline Murphy remembers the instructions she was given on the set of “Jumanji” when she was an extra some 30 years ago: “Pretend you're frightened and you're screaming because an elephant's coming after you.”

So, that's what she did in the Central Square of Keene, New Hampshire, running back and forth, over and over, on a long day in November 1994.

“I was pretty tired by the end of the day, and it was cold,” said Murphy, 61. She got a check for $60.47 — and several seconds of screen time. 

Murphy was one of about 125 extras cast in the classic Robin Williams film, which is marking its 30th anniversary. It's spawned several sequels, including one planned for next year. The city of about 23,000 people in the southwestern corner of the state is celebrating its ties to “Jumanji” this weekend.

A featured event is a “Rhino Rumble Road Race” saluting the film's stampede scenes of elephants, rhinos and zebras on Saturday. Runners in inflatable animal costumes are sprinting about a quarter mile (less than half a kilometer) around the square. 

There's also a cast party, a parade, and a scavenger hunt, among other events.




Based on the 1981 children's book by Chris Van Allsburg about a mysterious jungle adventure board game, the movie version of “Jumanji” is set in the fictional small town of Brantford, New Hampshire.

Veteran location manager Dow Griffith was crisscrossing New England in search of the right spot. A coffee lover who grew up in Seattle, he recalled feeling desperate one day for a good brew. He was a bit east of Keene at the time, and someone suggested a shop that was near the square. 

“I took my cherished cup of double dry cappuccino out to the front porch, took a sip, looked to my left — and by God — there was the place I had been looking for!” he told The Associated Press. “So really, we have coffee to thank for the whole thing.” 

Scenes were filmed at the square that fall and the following spring. The fall scenes show a present-day town that had declined. Extras played homeless people and looters, in addition to panicked runners fleeing from the jungle animals.

Joanne Hof, now 78, had needed her son's help to spot herself behind the elephants, running with her hands up. Hof, a reading specialist, bought a videotape of “Jumanji” and showed it to the kids she worked with. 

“They were very impressed that I was in the movie,” she said. 

The spring scenes, appearing early in the film, depict the town in 1969. Extras drove classic cars around the pristine-looking square and others walked around, dressed for that time period. 

“I told the makeup person, ‘Do you know how to do a French twist?'” recalled Kate Beetle, 74, of Alstead, who said she can be seen for “a micro-second” crossing a street. “They just found me the right lady's suit and right flat shoes, and then the hair is kind of what I suspect did it.” 

The “Jumanji” crews worked well with the city in getting the permits to transform Central Square into a dilapidated, neglected piece of public property, recalled Patty Little, who recently retired as Keene's clerk. 

“They brought in old, dead shrubbery and threw it around and made the paint peel on the gazebo,” she said. Items such as parking meters and lilac bushes were removed and a large Civil War-era statue was brought in to cover a fountain. Graffiti was on the walls and crumpled vehicles in the stampede scene were anchored in place. 

Everything was restored, and fresh flowers were brought in the following spring, she said. 

Crews spent a total of about a week in the city for both settings. 

Little, whose classic 1961 Ambassador is caught on camera, could see everything happening from her office window.

“Did I get a lot of work done? I don't know during those days,” she said. 

A crowd turned out to watch a long-haired, bearded Williams run down the street in a leaf-adorned tunic. In the movie, he had just been freed from the game that had trapped him as a boy for years. 

“He's shorter than I thought he was!” one viewer said, according to local chronicler Susan MacNeil's book, “When Jumanji Came to Keene.” Others said, “He has great legs — muscular, isn't he? But so hairy!” and “Isn't he freezing dressed like that?”

The mayor honored him with a key to the city. Williams, noticing the mayor was a bit shorter, suddenly announced at the presentation, “‘I am the mayor of Munchkinland,'” with a voice to match, City Councilor Randy Filiault recalled. 

He stayed in character for 15 to 20 minutes, “just bouncing off the walls,” approaching people in the audience and pulling their hats over their eyes. Eventually, he stopped, ending with a solemn “Thank you,” Filiault said.

“I am really seeing something cool here,” Filiault remembered thinking. “How fortunate we were.”

When Williams died by suicide in 2014, people left flowers and photos beneath a painted “Parrish Shoes” wall sign advertising a fictional business left over from “Jumanji.” 

Former Keene police officer Joe Collins, who was assigned to watch over then-child actors Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce, also died by suicide, last year. Festival organizers planned a discussion about mental health and suicide prevention to pay tribute to Williams and Collins.

“I think Robin would have been impressed with that,” said Murphy, who met Williams and shook his hand.

            Diplomacy with Iran can “easily” be started again if US President Donald Trump orders Israel's leadership to stop its strikes on Iran, Majid Farahani, an official with the Iranian presidency told CNN on Friday.
    


            “Iran believes in civilian dialogue,” he said. “Directly or indirectly is not important.”
    


            “President Trump can easily stop the war by only one telephone (call) to (the) Israelis,” he said, repeating the Iranian position that talks were impossible while Israeli bombs were striking Iran.
    


            Farahani said that Iran would not countenance halting nuclear enrichment – which Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes - but added that concessions were possible.
    

French president Emmanuel Macron says "moving towards zero enrichment" should be a priority in European talks with Iran in Geneva. CNN's Becky Anderson speaks to French Foreign Ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine about the diplomatic efforts to stop the Israel-Iran conflict.

            “Maybe it can be lower but we don't stop it,” he said.
    


            In recent days, European powers have joined American and Israeli calls for a ban on enrichment, hardening their positions on the key issue, with France putting forward “a clear position on zero enrichment,” France's foreign ministry spokesperson Christophe Lemoine told CNN Friday.
    


            Iran says it needs enriched uranium for peaceful purposes, while also manufacturing large quantities of near-weapons-grade material.
    


            Trump's decision to open a two-week negotiating window before deciding on striking Iran has offered a slim – if improbable – path to a peace deal between Iran and Israel.
    


            Talks took place in Geneva on Friday between the foreign ministers from Iran, Britain, France, and Germany, along with the European Union's foreign policy chief, the first confirmed face-to-face meeting of its kind since the conflict began.
    


            After days of increasingly aggressive messages from the Trump administration, it has opened the possibility that military action can be averted.
    


            Indeed, Trump's own camp appears to be starkly divided on whether to pursue direct strikes against Iran.
    


            “If America gets involved in the war,” Farahani said, “there are so many options and all (of) those options are on the table.”
    


            Pro-government protests Friday on the streets of Tehran saw an outpouring of anger at both Israel and the United States.
    


            A CNN team in Tehran witnessed massive crowds, with protesters waving Iranian, Hezbollah and Palestinian flags and burning US and Israeli flags.
    


            Chants of “death to Israel, death to America” – a staple at such events – rang out, while Iranians spoke of their fury at the bombing campaign.
    


            “Trump, you are threatening my leader,” one woman told CNN, “Don't you know that my nation believes death is sweeter than honey?”

A federal judge on Friday granted a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration's efforts to keep Harvard University from hosting international students.

The order from U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs preserves the ability of Harvard to host foreign students while the case is decided. It marks another victory for the Ivy League school as it challenges multiple government sanctions amid a battle with the White House.

Vice President JD Vance referred to Sen. Alex Padilla as “Jose Padilla,” eight days after the California Democrat was forcefully removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference and handcuffed as he tried to speak about immigration raids. 

“I was hoping Jose Padilla would be here to ask a question,” Vance said, in an apparent reference to that altercation. “I guess he decided not to show up because there wasn't a theater. And that's all it is.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a post on the social platform X that it was “not an accident” that Vance referred to Sen. Padilla that way. And Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said, “How dare you disrespect him and call him Jose.”

Jose Padilla is the name of a convicted al-Qaida terrorism plotter who was sentenced to two decades in prison.

He was arrested in 2002 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport during the tense months after 9/11 and accused of a “dirty bomb” mission. It later emerged through interrogation of other al-Qaida suspects that the “mission” was only a sketchy idea, and those claims never surfaced in the South Florida terrorism case.

Responding to the outrage, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk said: “He must have mixed up two people who have broken the law.”

The evacuations came Friday as the conflict between Israel and Iran intensifies and growing numbers of American citizens seek information on how to leave those countries.

An internal State Department memo obtained by AP said the military flight, the second known to have occurred this week, left Tel Aviv for Sofia, Bulgaria, where some or all of the passengers were to catch a charter flight to Washington.

The document also said more than 6,400 U.S. citizens in Israel filled out an online form on Friday alone asking for information about when and if the government would organize evacuation flights. And 3,265 people called an emergency number seeking assistance.

According to the document, an estimated 300 to 500 people per day could need evacuation assistance should the U.S. decide to offer flights or ships to get Americans out. Officials have said that is being considered. 

He said his time in the detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, showed him “a different reality about this country that supposedly champions human rights and justice.” 

“No human is illegal,” Khalil said when asked what message he would like to send the public. “The message is: Justice will prevail, no mater what this administration may try to portray, portraying that immigrants are criminals.” 

The president and his administration have tried several tactics to block its enrollment of international students, part of an effort to secure policy changes at the private Ivy League college.

The block on international enrollment, which accounts for a quarter of Harvard's students and much of its global allure, strikes at the core of the identity of the nation's oldest and wealthiest college. Courts have stopped some of the government's actions, at least for now, but not all.

In the latest court order, a federal judge put one of those efforts on hold Friday until a lawsuit is resolved. But the fate of Harvard's international students — and its broader standoff with the Trump administration — remain in limbo.

“This shouldn't have taken three months,” Khalil said, speaking outside the immigration detention center in remote Louisiana following his release. 

The government filed notice in the evening that it is appealing Khalil's release.

The team also said it intends to form partnerships with the California Community Foundation, the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and other organizations to continue providing aid to immigrant families.

“What's happening in Los Angeles has reverberated among thousands upon thousands of people, and we have heard the calls for us to take a leading role on behalf of those affected,” Dodgers president Stan Kasten said. “We believe that by committing resources and taking action, we will continue to support and uplift the communities of Greater Los Angeles.”

The Dodgers announced the steps in a five-paragraph statement that was delicately worded to avoid potentially inflammatory political terms and which stopped short of an explicit condemnation of federal policy. The team said only that the aid would be “for families of immigrants impacted by recent events in the region.”

Team manager Dave Roberts praised the decision, saying “it's certainly the right thing to do.”

The Palestinian activist was released Friday by a judge's ruling after becoming a symbol of the president's clampdown on campus protests.

The former Columbia University graduate student left a federal facility in Louisiana and was expected to head to New York to reunite with his U.S. citizen wife and newborn son.

Held for over three months while the Trump administration sought to deport him for his role in pro-Palestinian protests, Khalil was released after U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz said it would be “highly, highly unusual” for the government to continue detaining a legal U.S. resident who was unlikely to flee and hadn't been accused of any violence.

“Petitioner is not a flight risk and the evidence presented is that he is not a danger to the community,” he said. “Period, full stop.” 

Later in the hourlong hearing, which took place by phone, the judge said the government had “clearly not met” the standards for detention. 

Speaking at a news conference in Los Angeles, Vice President JD Vance said, “I was hoping Jose Padilla would be here to ask a question.” 

“I guess he decided not to show up because there wasn't a theater. And that's all it is,” Vance said. 

It was an apparent reference to an altercation eight days earlier in which Padilla, a California Democrat, was forcefully removed from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference in LA and handcuffed by officers as he tried to speak up about immigration raids.

It was not clear if the vice president made an accidental slip with the senator's name or was trying to disparage Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrants. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Vance and Padilla served in the Senate together.

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein vetoed his first bills Friday, blocking for now Republican legislation that would let adults carry concealed handguns without a permit and make state agencies and local sheriffs more active in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

The vetoed measures now return to the legislature, where Republicans are one House seat shy of holding a veto-proof majority. Its leaders will decide whether to attempt overrides as early as next week.

Voting so far followed party lines for one of the immigration measures, which in part would direct heads of several state law enforcement agencies, like the State Highway Patrol and State Bureau of Investigation, to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But one House Democrat ended up voting for the other immigration bill that Stein vetoed. It would toughen a 2024 law that required sheriffs to help federal agents seeking criminal defendants. 

Pakistan said in a post on the social platform X that the president should get it in 2026 “in recognition of his decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership during the recent India-Pakistan crisis.”

Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for playing a substantial role in easing the conflict — despite Indian authorities disputing that.

The nomination came after Trump was asked Friday about the Nobel and said he should be awarded it for a variety of reasons, including his work on India and Pakistan and arranging a treaty he said would be signed on Monday to end hostilities between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda.

“I should have gotten it four or five times,” the president said. “They won't give me a Nobel Peace Prize because they only give it to liberals.”

Tensions surfaced Friday when the president said Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, was “wrong” when she previously said that the U.S. believed Iran was not building a nuclear weapon.

Hours later Gabbard posted on the social media platform X a clip of her testimony in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing where she said that though Iran was not currently constructing a nuclear weapon, its “enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons.”

She said in the post that intelligence shows Iran can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months “if they decide to finalize the assembly.”

Vice President JD Vance is in Los Angeles to tour federal immigration enforcement operations. 

In a post on the social platform X, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said Vance should visit victims of the deadly January wildfires while in town and also talk with Trump. Earlier this week the president suggested that his feud with Newsom might influence his consideration of $40 billion in federal wildfire aid for California. 

“I hope we get that back on track” Newsom said. “We are counting on you, Mr. Vice President.” 

The president is kicking off this year's celebrations with a “major event” at the Iowa State Fair.

In an e-mail to supporters, Trump said he will give a speech July 3 at the annual fair, one of the most popular events in the state and long a magnet for political candidates.

Trump narrowly lost the 2016 Iowa presidential caucuses to Ted Cruz but overwhelmingly defeated Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley in 2024.

About a dozen religious leaders paid the visit Friday to serve as witnesses to “what goes down” as some cases arising from the Trump administration's migration crackdown are heard, an organizer said.

Some migrants have been arrested at the court by federal immigration officers. The Rev. Scott Santarosa, a Jesuit priest who was lead organizer of the group, said the purpose of the visit “is more than anything just to provide some sense of presence.”

“People are longing for people of faith to walk with vulnerable migrants,” added Santarosa, pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. “Our goal is not trying to prevent arrests — but we can witness it.”

The visit was preceded by a Mass at San Diego's Catholic Cathedral with bishops and other clergy — including Bishop Michael Pham, the top-ranking official in the group and one of the first bishops appointed by Pope Leo XIV — offering prayers for refugees and migrants on World Refugee Day. 

Republicans suffered a sizable setback Friday on one key aspect of the president's big bill after their plans to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other provisions from the Senate Banking Committee ran into procedural violations with the parliamentarian.

Republicans proposed zeroing out funding for the CFPB, the landmark agency set up in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, to save $6.4 billion. The bureau was designed as a way to better protect Americans from financial fraud but has been opposed by many GOP lawmakers since its inception. The Trump administration has targeted it as an example of government over-regulation and overreach.

The findings by the parliamentarian's office, which is working overtime scrubbing Trump's overall bill to ensure it aligns with the chamber's strict “Byrd Rule” processes, signal a tough road ahead. The most daunting questions are still to come as GOP leadership rushes to muscle the package to the floor by July 4.

Coming to court this week, Erin Smith wanted to prove that a man assaulted her husband during the attack on Jan. 6, 2021, and ultimately was responsible for his suicide nine days later. 

On Friday an eight-member jury held a 69-year-old chiropractor, David Walls-Kaufman, liable for assaulting Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith. The panel will hear more testimony before deciding whether to award Erin Smith any monetary damages.

But the judge presiding over the civil trial dismissed her wrongful-death claim before jurors began deliberating, saying no reasonable juror could conclude that Walls-Kaufman's actions were capable of causing a traumatic brain injury leading to Smith's death.

U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes divided the trial into two stages: one on the merits of Smith's claims and another on damages. Closing arguments for the latter are expected Monday.

The judge urged the parties to discuss a possible settlement over the weekend.

The family of Robert Levinson, who vanished in Iran 18 years ago, is calling for any deal between the United States and Iran to include the return of his remains.

Levinson disappeared March 9, 2007, when he was scheduled to meet a source on the Iranian island of Kish. For years U.S. officials would say only that he was working independently on a private investigation. But a 2013 Associated Press investigation revealed that he had been sent on a mission by CIA analysts who had no authority to run such an operation.

In 2020 the U.S. government said it concluded that Levinson died while in Iranian custody. The family said then that it did not know when or if his body would be returned but vowed that those responsible would face justice.

“We want to make sure that our dad is not forgotten,” son Daniel Levinson told AP on Friday.

The president is again suggesting that he doesn't want his hard-line immigration policies to hurt American farmers — seemingly flip-flopping anew on the issue.

The Department of Homeland Security said this week that immigration raids at farms hotels and restaurants would continue despite Trump suggesting that longtime employees in such jobs were difficult to replace.

On Friday he again suggested that exemptions might be made for agricultural workers. “I'm never going to do anything to hurt our farmers,” he said.

The president defended getting “the criminals out of our country” but said that in cases of “good, reputable farmers, they can take responsibility for the people they hire” and “you can't put farms out of business.”

“We don't want to hurt people that aren't criminals,” Trump said, adding, “I never want to hurt our farmers are great people. They keep us happy and healthy and fat.”

The panel of three federal appellate judges ruled that the law is unconstitutional.

Friday's ruling is a major win for civil liberties groups who say the mandate violates the separation of church and state and that the poster-size displays would isolate students — especially those who are not Christian.

The mandate has been touted by Republicans including Trump and is one of the latest pushes by conservatives to incorporate religion into classrooms. Backers of the law say the Ten Commandments belong because they are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' order stems from a lawsuit filed last year by parents of Louisiana students from various religious backgrounds who said the law violates First Amendment language guaranteeing religious liberty and forbidding government establishment of religion.

The mandate was signed into law last June by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry. 

The high court denied the motion from Learning Resources Inc., which was asking for a speedy decision on the legality of the tariffs.

The Illinois company wanted the justices to take up the case soon rather than let it continue to play out in lower courts. It argues that the tariffs and uncertainty are having a “massive impact” on businesses around the country and the issue needs swift attention from the Supreme Court.

The Trump administration has defended the tariffs by arguing that the emergency powers law gives the president the authority to regulate imports during national emergencies and the country's longtime trade deficit qualifies as such an emergency.

The justices did not explain their reasoning in a brief order rebuffing the motion, but the court is typically reluctant to take up cases before lower courts have decided.

An appeals court is set to hear the case in late July.

The notices were sent Friday to 639 employees of Voice of America and the U.S. agency that oversees it, effectively shutting down an outlet that has provided news to countries around the world since World War II.

They included employees at VOA's Persian-language service who were suddenly called off administrative leave last week to broadcast reports to Iran following Israel's attack. Three journalists working for the Persian service Friday who left their office for a cigarette break had their badges confiscated and were not allowed back in, according to one fired employee.

In total some 1,400 people at Voice of America and the U.S. Agency for Global Media, or 85% of its workforce, have lost their jobs since March, said Kari Lake, Trump's senior advisor to the agency.

Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, told lawmakers in March that U.S. spy agencies believed that Iran hadn't made a decision to build a nuclear weapon.

Speaking to reporters after touching down in New Jersey, Trump was asked about that assessment and responded, “Then my intelligence community was wrong.”

When told it was Gabbard who had said that he responded, “She's wrong.”

Members of the NATO alliance will meet next week with hopes of finalizing a pledge for all countries to pledge to spend more on defense.

But the U.S. shouldn't have to do that, according to Trump.

The NATO pledge would entail all members spending 5% of their gross domestic product on defense.

Asked about it Friday, Trump said, “I don't think we should, but I think they should.”

“We've been supporting NATO so long,” he told reporters.

He also called Spain, a NATO member that has rejected the 5% spending pledge, a “very low payer.”

“They were either good negotiators or they weren't doing the right thing,” Trump told reporters in northern New Jersey, where he is spending part of the weekend. “I think Spain has to pay what everybody else has to pay.”

“They're sitting on top of one of the largest piles of oil in the world. I just don't know why they'd need that for civilian purposes,” Trump told reporters after landing in New Jersey on Friday, when asked about Iran developing nuclear capabilities for use to generate power and other civilian pursuits.

“You're sitting on one of the largest oil piles anywhere in the world,” the president added. “It's a little bit hard to see why you'd need that.”

A federal judge held a brief hearing on California's challenge of the Trump administration's military deployment in Los Angeles.

The hearing followed Trump's key procedural win Thursday in which an appellate court said he can continue deploying the troops while the case plays out.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer put off any more rulings Friday. Instead, he asked for briefings from both sides on whether the Posse Comitatus Act is being violated.

That act prohibits troops from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil.

Breyer also asked the attorneys to address whether he or the appellate court retains primary jurisdiction to grant an injunction.

The president stopped to chat with workers who are busy piling gravel around the Rose Garden outside the White House, where grass has been removed.

The exact conversation couldn't be heard, but Trump spoke to a crew of workers for several minutes.

The exchange came as Trump was heading to Marine One, which was parked on the South Lawn, part of the journey to his Bedminster club in New Jersey where the president will host a Friday evening event for his Maga Inc. super PAC.

Crews began working earlier this month to pave over the once grassy areas near the Rose Garden, just off the Oval Office. Trump also had two towering flagpoles erected outside the White House.

California's challenge of the Trump administration's military deployment on the streets of Los Angeles is back before a federal judge.

Friday's hearing in San Francisco comes after an appeals court handed Trump a key procedural win. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said that for now, Trump can keep control of the California National Guard troops he deployed in response to protests over immigration raids.

Despite the appellate setback, California's attorneys are expected to ask a judge Friday for a preliminary injunction returning control of the troops in Los Angeles, where protests have calmed down in recent days.

Judge Michael Farbiarz made the ruling from the bench in federal court in New Jersey on Friday. Lawyers for the Palestinian activist had asked a federal judge to immediately release him on bail from a Louisiana jail, or else transfer him to New Jersey, where he can be closer to his wife and newborn son.

The same judge had ruled earlier that the government can continue to detain the legal U.S. resident based on allegations that he lied on his green card application. Khalil disputes the accusations that he wasn't forthcoming on the application. The judge previously determined that Khalil couldn't continue being held based on the U.S. secretary of state's determination that he could harm American foreign policy.

Hi Sharon, thanks for your question. This lawsuit over whether Trump can deploy California's National Guard without the approval of California Gov. Gavin Newsom has worked its way through the courts, and, on Thursday, an appellate court ruled in the president's favor. It is the last court before the lawsuit can be appealed to the Supreme Court. Here's some of our reporting from yesterday:

In its decision, a three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded it was likely Trump lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the guard.

It said that while presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's guard, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for doing so, citing violent acts by protesters.

“The undisputed facts demonstrate that before the deployment of the National Guard, protesters ‘pinned down' several federal officers and threw ‘concrete chunks, bottles of liquid, and other objects' at the officers. Protesters also damaged federal buildings and caused the closure of at least one federal building. And a federal van was attacked by protesters who smashed in the van's windows,” the court wrote. “The federal government's interest in preventing incidents like these is significant.”

It also found that even if the federal government failed to notify the governor of California before federalizing the National Guard as required by law, Newsom had no power to veto the president's order.

The court case could have wider implications on the president's power to deploy soldiers within the United States after Trump directed immigration officials to prioritize deportations from other Democratic-run cities.

The justices released six opinions on Friday on everything from California emission standards to a lawsuit filed by victims of terrorism attacks. That leaves 10 cases still to decide, including Trump's executive order denying birthright citizenship to U.S.-born children of parents who are in the country illegally. The order has been blocked by lower courts.

The issue before the justices is whether to limit the authority of judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have plagued both Republican and Democratic administrations in the past 10 years. These nationwide court orders have emerged as an important check on Trump's efforts and a source of mounting frustration to the Republican president and his allies.

The Supreme Court is in the homestretch of a term dominated by the Trump administration's emergency appeals of lower court orders seeking to slow the president's efforts to remake the federal government.

A three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded that Trump can likely show that he lawfully exercised his authority in federalizing control of the California National Guard — and that even if the federal government failed to notify the governor of California in advance as required by law, Newsom had no power to veto the president's order.

Trump celebrated the decision on his Truth Social platform, calling it a “BIG WIN.”

He wrote that “all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done.”

The U.S. vice president is traveling to Los Angeles on Friday to meet with Marines and to visit various federal command centers. 

Vance's office did not release a topic of discussion for his visit. But Los Angeles has been the epicenter of protests against the Trump administration's mass deportation operations.

Trump deployed National Guard troops to downtown LA this month in response to the protests. The state sued for a temporary injunction to stop the deployment, but a federal appeals court ruled in Trump's favor Thursday night while that legal challenge continues.

“The 2020 election was a total FRAUD! The evidence is MASSIVE,” Trump posted Friday on his social media site. He added, “A Special Prosecutor must be appointed. This cannot be allowed to happen again in the United States of America! Let the work begin!”

Trump has for years claimed, without evidence, that Democrat Joe Biden only won the 2020 election because of widespread voter fraud.

Evidence presented in courts showed this didn't happen — judges, including some appointed by Trump, rejected nearly every claim of widespread fraud as false or frivolous. 

A special prosecutor in Biden's Justice Department investigated Trump's efforts to undermine the 2020 election, but that probe ended when Trump won back the White House in 2024.

U.S. stocks are drifting higher following the Juneteenth holiday. Treasury yields also edged higher in the bond market after Trump said he will decide within two weeks whether the U.S. military will get directly involved in Israel's fighting with Iran. 

World shares are mostly higher and crude oil prices have rebounded — U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 52 cents to $75.66 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard added 31 cents to $77.01 per barrel. Oil prices have been gyrating as fears rise and ebb that war could disrupt the global flow of crude. 

“The stock market's risk premium isn't just rising — it's recalibrating for a world where every macro lever now doubles as a tripwire,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management wrote in a commentary, adding that traders are bracing for what comes next.

Trump's tariffs agenda may have been eclipsed by the conflict in the Middle East, but it remains another major factor weighing on markets, Innes said: “A delayed fuse is still a fuse.”

Trump on Thursday signed an executive order to keep TikTok running in the U.S. for an additional 90 days, giving his administration more time to broker a deal that would bring the social media platform under American ownership.

The first extension was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban — approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court — took effect. The second was in April when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump's tariff announcement.

It is not clear how many times Trump can — or will — keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far there have been no legal challenges to fight them.

We'll answer a few each day during our live coverage.

Vice President JD Vance is in Los Angeles to tour federal immigration enforcement operations.

The Los Angeles Dodgers organization said Thursday that it asked federal immigration agents to leave the Dodger Stadium grounds after they arrived at a parking lot near one of the gates. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agents were with Customs and Border Protection and that they were not trying to enter the stadium.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — California's challenge of the Trump administration's military deployment in Los Angeles returned to a federal courtroom in San Francisco on Friday for a brief hearing after an appeals court handed President Donald Trump a key procedural win.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer put off issuing any additional rulings and instead asked for briefings from both sides by noon Monday on whether the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits troops from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil, is being violated in Los Angeles. 

The hearing happened the day after the 9th Circuit appellate panel allowed the president to keep control of National Guard troops he deployed in response to protests over immigration raids. 

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in his complaint that “violation of the Posse Comitatus Act is imminent, if not already underway” but Breyer last week postponed considering that allegation.

Vice President JD Vance, a Marine veteran, traveled to Los Angeles on Friday and met with troops, including U.S. Marines who have been deployed to protect federal buildings.

According to Vance, the court determined Trump's determination to send in federal troops “was legitimate” and he will do it again if necessary.

“The president has a very simple proposal to everybody in every city, every community, every town whether big or small, if you enforce your own laws and if you protect federal law enforcement, we're not going to send in the National Guard because it's unnecessary,” Vance told journalists after touring a federal complex in Los Angeles.




Vance's tour of a multiagency Federal Joint Operations Center and a mobile command center came as demonstrations have calmed after sometimes-violent clashes between protesters and police and outbreaks of vandalism and break-ins that followed immigration raids across Southern California earlier this month. Tens of thousands have also marched peacefully in Los Angeles since June 8.

National Guard troops have been accompanying federal agents on some immigration raids, and Marines briefly detained a man on the first day they deployed to protect a federal building. The marked the first time federal troops detained a civilian since deploying to the nation's second-largest city.

Breyer found Trump acted illegally when, over opposition from California's governor, the president activated the soldiers. However, the appellate decision halted the judge's temporary restraining order. Breyer asked the lawyers on Friday to address whether he or the appellate court retains primary jurisdiction to grant an injunction under the Posse Comitatus Act.

California has sought a preliminary injunction giving Newsom back control of the troops in Los Angeles, where protests have calmed down in recent days.

Trump, a Republican, argued that the troops have been necessary to restore order. Newsom, a Democrat, said their presence on the streets of a U.S. city inflamed tensions, usurped local authority and wasted resources. 

The demonstrations appear to be winding down, although dozens of protesters showed up Thursday at Dodger Stadium, where a group of federal agents gathered at a parking lot with their faces covered, traveling in SUVs and cargo vans. The Los Angeles Dodgers organization asked them to leave, and they did.

On Tuesday, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass lifted a downtown curfew that was first imposed in response to vandalism and clashes with police after crowds gathered in opposition to agents taking migrants into detention.

Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under an authority known as Title 10.

Title 10 allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United States.”

Breyer found that Trump had overstepped his legal authority, which he said allows presidents to control state National Guard troops only during times of “rebellion or danger of a rebellion.” 

“The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of ‘rebellion,' ” wrote Breyer, a Watergate prosecutor who was appointed by President Bill Clinton and is the brother of retired Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.

The Trump administration argued that courts can't second-guess the president's decisions. The appellate panel ruled otherwise, saying presidents don't have unfettered power to seize control of a state's guard, but the panel said that by citing violent acts by protesters in this case, the Trump administration had presented enough evidence to show it had a defensible rationale for federalizing the troops. 

For now, the California National Guard will stay in federal hands as the lawsuit proceeds. It is the first deployment by a president of a state National Guard without the governor's permission since troops were sent to protect Civil Rights Movement marchers in 1965.

Trump celebrated the appellate ruling in a social media post, calling it a “BIG WIN” and hinting at more potential deployments. 

Newsom, for his part, has also warned that California won't be the last state to see troops in the streets if Trump gets his way.

In another blow to the Republicans' tax and spending cut bill, the Senate parliamentarian has advised that a proposal to shift some food stamps costs from the federal government to states — a centerpiece of GOP savings efforts — would violate the chamber's rules.

While the parliamentarian's rulings are advisory, they are rarely, if ever, ignored. The Republican leadership scrambled on Saturday, days before voting is expected to begin on President Donald Trump's package that he wants to be passed into law by the Fourth of July.

The loss is expected to be costly to Republicans. They have been counting on some tens of billions of potential savings from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to help offset the costs of the $4.5 trillion tax breaks plan. The parliamentarian let stand for now a provision that would impose new work requirements for older Americans, up to age 65, to receive food stamp aid.

"We will keep fighting to protect families in need," said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, which handles the SNAP program.

"The Parliamentarian has made clear that Senate Republicans cannot use their partisan budget to shift major nutrition assistance costs to the states that would have inevitably led to major cuts," she said.

The parliamentarian's ruling is the latest in a series of setbacks as staff works through the weekend, often toward midnight, to assess the 1,000-page proposal. It all points to serious trouble ahead for the bill, which was approved by the House on a party-line vote last month over unified opposition from Democrats and is now undergoing revisions in the Senate.

At its core, the goal of the multitrillion-dollar package is to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term that would otherwise expire if Congress fails to act. It also adds new ones, including no taxes on tips and or overtime pay. To help offset the costs of lost tax revenue, the Republicans are proposing cutbacks to federal Medicaid, health care and food programs — some $1 trillion. Additionally, the package boosts national security spending by about $350 billion, including to pay for Trump's mass deportations, which are running into protests nationwide.

Trump has implored Republicans, who have the majority in Congress, to deliver on his top domestic priority, but the details of the package, with its hodge-podge of priorities, are drawing deeper scrutiny.

All told, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the package, as approved by the House, would add at least $2.4 trillion to the nation's red ink over the decade and leave 10.9 million more people without health care coverage. Additionally, it would reduce or eliminate food stamps for more than 3 million people.

The parliamentarian's office is tasked with scrutinizing the bill to ensure it complies with the so-called Byrd Rule, which is named after the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., and bars many policy matters in the budget reconciliation process now being used.

Late Friday, the parliamentarian issued its latest findings. It determined that Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee's proposal to have the states pick up more of the tab for covering food stamps — what Republicans call a new cost-sharing arrangement — would violate the Byrd Rule.

Many lawmakers said the states would not be able to absorb the new requirement on food aid, which the federal government has long provided. They warned many would lose access to SNAP benefits used by more than 40 million people.

Initially, the CBO estimated savings of about $128 billion under the House's proposal to shift SNAP food aid costs to the states. Cost estimates for the Senate's version, which made changes to the House approach, have not been publicly available.

The parliamentarian's office rulings leave GOP leaders with several options. They can revise the proposals to try to comply with Senate rules or strip them from the package altogether. They can also risk a challenge during floor voting, which would require the 60-vote threshold to overcome. That would be unlikely in the split chamber with Democrats opposing the overall package.

The parliamentarian's latest advice also said the committee's provision to make certain immigrants ineligible for food stamps would violate the rule. It found several provisions from the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which is led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to be in violation. They include one to provide $250 million to Coast Guard stations damaged by fire in 2025, namely one on South Padre Island in Texas.

Some of the most critical rulings from parliamentarians are still to come. One will assess the GOP's approach that relies on "current policy" rather than "current law" as the baseline for determining whether the bill will add to the nation's deficits.

Already, the parliamentarian delivered a serious setback Thursday, finding that the GOP plan to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was a core proposal coming from the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, would violate the Byrd Rule.

The parliamentarian has also advised of violations over provisions from the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that would roll back Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards on certain vehicles and from the Senate Armed Services Committee to require the Defense secretary to provide a plan on how the Pentagon intends to spend the tens of billions of new funds.

The new work requirements in the package would require many of those receiving SNAP or Medicaid benefits to work 80 hours a month or engage in other community or educational services.

Walmart has agreed to pay $10 million to settle a U.S. Federal Trade Commission civil lawsuit accusing the world's largest retailer of ignoring warning signs that fraudsters used its money transfer services to fleece consumers out of hundreds of millions of dollars.

The settlement was filed on Friday in Chicago federal court, and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Manish Shah.

Walmart also agreed not to process money transfers it suspects are fraudulent, or help sellers and telemarketers it believes are using its services to commit fraud.

"Electronic money transfers are one of the most common ways that scammers tell consumers to send them money, because once it's sent, it's gone for good," said Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC consumer protection bureau. "Companies that provide these services must train their employees to comply with the law and work to protect consumers."

The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer did not admit or deny wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Walmart did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In its June 2022 complaint, the FTC accused Walmart of turning a blind eye to fraudsters who used its money transfer services to cash out at its stores.

Walmart acts as an agent for money transfers by companies such as MoneyGram, Ria and Western Union. Money can be hard to trace once delivered.

The FTC said fraudsters used many schemes that included impersonating Internal Revenue Service agents, impersonating family members who needed money from grandparents to avoid jail, and telling victims they won lotteries or sweepstakes but owed fees to collect their winnings.

Shah dismissed part of the FTC case last July but let the regulator pursue the remainder. Walmart appealed from that decision. Friday's settlement would end the appeal.

The case is Federal Trade Commission v Walmart Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 22-03372.

Returns on Amazon are free and easy for shoppers, but they're risky and expensive for the small businesses that sell a majority of the goods on the world's biggest e-commerce site. Returns have driven some sellers to exit the popular Fulfillment by Amazon program, while others told CNBC they'd like to leave the platform altogether.

At the heart of the problem is a big rise in returns fraud, which has led to customers mistakenly receiving used products when they ordered something new. In two particularly egregious examples involving baby products described to CNBC, Amazon sent customers used diapers and a chiller with someone else's rotten breastmilk inside.

"I really don't think that consumers understand how many small businesses are on Amazon and how their return habits affect small businesses and families like mine," said Rachelle Baron, owner of Beau and Belle Littles, which sells reusable swim diapers on Amazon.

Baron said her business tanked after a return incident with Amazon. The e-commerce platform shipped soiled swim diapers to customers after the used baby products had been returned to Amazon, Baron said.

"There was actually two diapers that were sent out that were poopy," she said.

In 2024, nearly 14% of all U.S. retail returns were fraudulent, up from 5% in 2018, according to a report by the National Retail Federation. In total, the report found that returns cost retailers $890 billion in 2024.

Amazon started charging sellers in its fulfillment program (FBA) a new fee in June 2024 for items that exceed certain return rate thresholds. Sellers who sign up for FBA rely on Amazon for logistics, including shipping, packing and returns.

In September, a couple months after the fee went into effect, e-commerce group Helium 10 saw return rates for U.S. Amazon sellers drop nearly 5%.

"It's forcing the seller to have higher quality listings and higher quality products," said Helium 10 General Manager Zoe Lu.

Amazon has also started adding a warning label to some "frequently returned items," which could be contributing to the dip.

However, the new fee may also be leading to rising prices.

One survey by e-commerce analysis company SmartScout found that 65% of sellers said they raised prices in 2024 directly because of Amazon fee changes. Other sellers told CNBC returns fraud is the reason they've raised prices.

In total, CNBC talked to seven Amazon sellers to find out how they're handling the rising cost of returns.

"We're running at about just over 1% net profit on Amazon, totally due to fraud and return abuse," said Lorie Corlett, who sells Sterling Spectrum protective cases for hot wheels. She said her return rate is 4% on Amazon and only 1% on other marketplaces like Walmart. "It's really Amazon that's accountable at the end of the day. People would stop doing it if Amazon held them accountable."

Amazon told CNBC it has no tolerance for fraudulent returns and that it takes action against some scammers. Those measures include denying refunds and requiring customer identity verification.

Mike Jelliff sells professional music gear through his GeekStands brand on Amazon and eight other marketplaces. He said his return rate on Amazon is three times higher than the average he sees elsewhere. 

"On eBay, we're allowed to block specific customers out," Jelliff said. "But on Amazon, that customer is still allowed to repurchase from us."

Jelliff showed CNBC the system of about 40 cameras he's installed in his Tyler, Texas, warehouse to track every outgoing item, incoming return and unboxing. He uses the images when filing appeals with Amazon, including when customers request refunds claiming they never receive an item. He keeps a blacklist of repeat offenders who commit this kind of fraud and those who return used and damaged items, which become a total loss for him.

Amazon has made some improvements to its returns process, said Jelliff, who doesn't rely on FBA. This includes Amazon allowing small businesses to make multiple appeals when fighting a fraudulent return. Amazon has also let Jelliff opt-out of automatic return labels for items above $100 starting in 2023, and his return rate has been dropping since.

Figuring out which returns are fraudulent and which are ready for re-sale is labor-intensive and item specific, experts said. That creates plenty of room for error.

"Because it's such a large operation, things are missed," said Lu of Helium 10. "I think they're probably missed on the margins, but these stories are very impactful because it is such a reckoning for the brand."

Ceres Chill founder Lisa Myers, who once relied on Amazon to handle returns for her business as part of FBA, has one of these stories.

In 2023, Amazon sent one of Ceres Chill's products to a customer with someone else's rotten breastmilk inside, said Myers, adding that the customer wrote a review saying, "she will never forget that smell." 

"To have something, and I don't mean to be dramatic, but dangerous, somebody else's bodily fluids in your kitchen rotting in something that you had intended to use for your child is unacceptable," Myers said. "That's the moment I broke down crying and just sat down and thought, I have no idea how this could have happened."

Myers said she left FBA after the incident, leaving behind benefits like having her products labeled with Amazon's Prime badge.

"It hurts our business to not participate in Fulfilled by Amazon," Myers said. "It's just we're not willing to, we will never put profit over the safety and, frankly, mental health of our customers."

Instead, Myers outsources all her returns to baby resell specialist Goodbuy Gear, which is on track to re-sell 200,000 returned baby products this year.

Kristin Langenfeld started GoodBuy Gear when she was a new mom struggling to find a good quality, used jogging stroller. 

"We've spent the last nine years building out a database that has all of the products and the variations, the common issues, the recalls," Langenfeld said. "For some of these, there's 40 points that we inspect on the item itself, and it's really complicated."

Langenfeld showed CNBC the process at her warehouse in Malvern, Pennsylvania, where each item is inspected for about 15 minutes and is typically handled by at least four employees. The resource intensive process is paying off. She says 33 new sellers signed up in 2024, three times more than the previous year. And with business growing 50% year-over-year, she's upgrading to a bigger warehouse in Columbus, Ohio.

She was inspired to handle returns after visiting a major retailer's returns warehouse five years ago.

"Taped on the floor were signs that said 'incinerate,' 'destroy,'" she said.

Returns generated an estimated 29 million metric tons of carbon emissions in 2024, and 9.8 billion pounds of returns ended up in landfills, according to reverse logistics software provider Optoro.

Amazon has faced criticism for destroying millions of pounds of unused products. In 2022, Amazon told CNBC it was "working towards a goal of zero product disposal," but wouldn't give a timeline for that ambition. Three years later, that goal is still in the works, with Amazon telling CNBC in a statement, "The vast majority of returns are resold as new or used, returned to selling partners, liquidated, or donated."

In 2020, Amazon added two new options for sellers to re-home returns. "Grade and Resell" allows all U.S. FBA sellers to have Amazon rate the return and mark it as "used" before re-selling it. FBA Liquidation allows sellers to recoup some losses by offloading palettes of goods for re-sale on the secondary market through liquidation partners like Liquidity Services.

There's also an FBA Donations program that's been around since 2019, allowing sellers to automatically offer eligible overstock and returns to charity groups through the non-profit Good360. Amazon told CNBC these seller programs give a second life to more than 300 million items a year.

For shoppers wanting to keep returns from incineration or landfills, Amazon also has options.

Amazon Resale has used and open-box goods, Amazon Renewed sells refurbished items and Amazon Outlet sells overstock. Daily deal site Woot!, bought by Amazon for $110 million in 2010, also sells scratched and dented items. Customers can also trade in certain electronics, like Amazon devices, phones and tablets, for Amazon gift cards or send them to the company's certified recycler.

"I hope the change that we're able to make as a country is that we stop making crap," Langenfeld said. "We should make high quality products that are meant for resale."

Most people in the early stages of a new romance look for evidence that confirms their compatibility. Not my husband and me.

Despite having chemistry, we started with the hypothesis that we weren't a good match. We would discover a deal-breaker down the road — something big like how much money we wanted to give our aging parents or something small like what temperature room we like to sleep in — that would lead to our demise.

At the time, we were both tenured professors in the same academic department at the same university. If things went bust, it would be very uncomfortable to go to work each day. Academic jobs are hard to come by, which meant we might be stuck in that awkward situation for life. 

So we created a list of questions, guided by basic principles of relationship science, that are critical for couples to openly communicate about if they want to know whether they're really compatible. Unlike the questions you find on dating apps, they don't apply to everyone. We tailored our list to us. If you're making a list with your current or prospective partner, I'd suggest you do the same.

But to help you build your questionnaire, here are the main themes you should focus on, with a few examples to get you started: 

Conflict over money is a big driver of divorce. Couples fight over big money issues but also small ones, like whether they should spend money on a house cleaner. These issues can lead to a pattern of conflict that is tough to get out of. 

Ask questions like:

The stress we feel at work has an outsized effect on our interpersonal relationships, even influencing sexual function, like the ability to reach orgasm.  

Ask questions like:

Money and career are must-discuss topics, and, depending on your circumstances, so are other big categories like kids, parents, and religion. 

Ask questions like:

When we have chemistry with someone and feel aligned with them on big things like values and goals, we assume the daily things will fall into place. But they can be real relationship deal-breakers.  

Sleep is a must on this list; it's one the strongest predictors of health outcomes and relationship satisfaction. But I also suggest touching on food, pets, humor, and time alone. 

Ask questions like:

When I think about the importance of physical intimacy, I'm reminded of a scene from "Annie Hall." Annie and her partner Alvy are both in therapy, shown on a split screen. Their respective therapists ask them, "Do you have sex often?" Alvy laments, "Hardly ever, maybe three times a week," whereas Annie responds in an exasperated, annoyed tone, "Constantly, I'd say three times a week." 

Despite its outsized effect on relationship longevity and physical health, we don't have good social scripts for talking about sex. 

Ask questions like:

What we're "allowed" to talk about in relationships is based on norms, and when it comes to relationships, these norms are often morally tinged. There's a category of taboo questions where even thinking them — let alone asking them out loud — violates social norms. 

In some cases, you're too embarrassed to ask the question. In others, you worry that caring about the answer will reflect poorly on your character. Ours included questions about family history of mental health problems. 

Here are some others I've encountered in my work: 

We often slide into relationships, rather than making thoughtful, deliberate decisions. Going through this exercise won't make you feel comfortable, but that's not the goal. 

What good will avoiding that temporary discomfort do when you find yourself lying awake next to the love of your life, his cat that you're allergic to at the foot of the bed, feeling all hot and sweaty because he likes it balmy at night and you love the air conditioner?

When Mark Zuckerberg feels the heat, he opens his wallet.

The 41-year-old Facebook founder and Meta CEO is on a spending spree like never before in an effort to position his company at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom and make up for recent costly mistakes in a market that's rapidly revolutionizing the business world.

Following last week's stunning $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, which brought with it Meta's hiring of the startup's founder, Alexandr Wang, and a small group of his top staffers, Meta now plans to hire former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and his business partner, Daniel Gross, who had been CEO of $32 billion AI startup Safe Superintelligence, CNBC reported this week.

Meta previously tried to buy Safe Superintelligence, which was launched a year ago by OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, sources told CNBC. According to other sources, Meta had previously been in talks to buy Perplexity AI, which was valued at $14 billion in a funding round in May. The people who spoke to CNBC about the various dealmaking pursuits asked not to be named due to confidentiality.

Zuckerberg told investors at the top of the most recent earnings call in April, "The major theme right now, of course, is how AI is transforming everything we do." At the same time, Meta upped its capital expenditures range for the year to between $64 billion and $72 billion from between $60 billion and $65 billion to reflect more data center investments in AI and potentially higher hardware costs.

What Zuckerberg didn't say then is that he was about to start shelling out mounds of cash to revamp his AI organization.

"Mark Zuckerberg is in founder mode and he's not going to be stopped," said Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview on Friday with CNBC's "Money Movers." Luria has a buy rating on the stock, but said that to win in AI, Meta needs to be successful with the next round, with the dream team that they're building."

At Meta, AI is being embedded across the company, from its core online advertising unit and Instagram algorithms to its effort to build the metaverse. Better AI models and technology enhance the company's existing business, both by improving ad targeting and by bringing down costs.

However, the building of fundamental models used by the vast community of developers — where the company competes with Google, OpenAI, Anthropic and others — is where Meta is viewed by many as a laggard.

Meta's unique open-source approach is built around the Llama family of models. Its most recent update in April, the Llama 4 AI models, was not well received by developers. At the time, Meta only released two smaller versions of Llama 4 and said it would eventually release a bigger and more powerful "Behemoth" model. 

"On the heels of a successful rollout of Llama 3 a year ago, Llama 4 that came out this year was an absolute failure, almost by his admission," Luria said, referring to Zuckerberg. "Meta can't afford to fail in having the leading AI model. So they're out in the marketplace desperately trying to replace their AI team right now."

Meta didn't respond to a request for comment for this story.

Bringing on Scale AI's Wang was Zuckerberg's most headline-grabbing move yet. While Meta is gaining a 49% stake in the startup, Zuckerberg's real prize in the deal was hiring Wang, a dropout from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who started his company at age 19.

Zuckerberg then turned his attention to Github's Friedman and Gross, who have been investing together at their venture firm NFDG. They will work on products under Wang, one source familiar with the matter told CNBC on Thursday. Meta, meanwhile, will get a stake in NFDG, according to multiple sources.

A Meta spokesperson didn't comment on the planned hires and said the company "will share more about our superintelligence effort and the great people joining this team in the coming weeks."

Not all of Zuckerberg's recruits are costing billions of dollars. Some are in the tens or hundreds of millions. That's according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

Altman said on the latest episode of the "Uncapped" podcast, which his brother hosts, that Meta has tried to lure OpenAI employees by offering signing bonuses as high as $100 million, with even larger annual compensation packages.

"I've heard that Meta thinks of us as their biggest competitor," Altman said on the podcast. "Their current AI efforts have not worked as well as they have hoped and I respect being aggressive and continuing to try new things."

Meta technology chief Andrew Bosworth told CNBC's "Closing Bell Overtime" on Friday that Altman is countering the offers.

"The market is setting a rate here for a level of talent which is really incredible and kind of unprecedented in my 20-year career as a technology executive," said Bosworth, who joined Meta in 2006.

Wall Street is mostly giving Zuckerberg the benefit of the doubt, for now. Meta shares were flat this week after slipping about 2% last week. Shares are still up 17% for the year, outpacing the Nasdaq and all the company's megacap peers.

Analysts at Argus maintained their buy recommendation on the stock this week and lifted their price target to $790 a share from $725 a share. The stock closed on Friday at $682.35.

"The company's ability to capitalize on GenAI advances in advertising targeting is a particularly relevant opportunity to drive advertising spending, which is the company's lifeblood," the Argus analysts wrote.

D.A. Davidson's Luria said that Zuckerberg has put more pressure on himself to turn Meta into a long-term AI leader, but said he won't bet against him.

Luria said: "The last time Mr. Zuckerberg felt like he was under the gun," he snapped up Instagram for $1 billion, a deal that set the stage for Facebook to become a dominant player in mobile.

That was in 2012, just as Facebook was about to hit the public market. Luria also highlighted Zuckerberg's controversial $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp two years later. He sees the Meta CEO making an equally bold wager in AI.

"He's going to rebuild the team and they're going to come back," Luria said.

— CNBC's Kate Rooney and Jonathan Vanian contributed to this report.

After 150 years without minimal innovation, the beehive is getting an upgrade that is making it easier to protect colonies and the crops that rely on them.

Lifting up the hood of a Beewise hive feels more like you're getting ready to examine the engine of a car than visit with a few thousand pollinators. 

The unit — dubbed a BeeHome — is an industrial upgrade from the standard wooden beehives, all clad in white metal and solar panels. Inside sits a high-tech scanner and robotic arm powered by artificial intelligence. Roughly 300,000 of these units are in use across the US, scattered across fields of almond, canola, pistachios and other crops that require pollination to grow.

It's grad season, and Gen Z job seekers are feeling desperate.

Zoomers are staring down a tough hiring market: Economic uncertainty has contributed to employees' wariness to quit and companies' hesitancy to hire. Artificial intelligence is disrupting the entry-level rung of the career ladder in industries like tech. Recent graduates have told Business Insider that they're frustrated by hundreds of rejected applications and being ghosted by prospective employers. Some are settling for whatever work they can find.

It's long been typical for 20-somethings to have a higher unemployment rate than the general population, and the overall US unemployment rate is still relatively low. One relatively new development, however, is that young people with college degrees are being hit hard by the economic slowdown — especially if they're hoping to land a role in traditionally white-collar fields. Many Gen Zers are losing faith in the ROI of higher education and are turning toward blue-collar opportunities.

The following five charts illustrate the tough job market for recent graduates.

Even as the cost of higher education has risen, more people are getting a bachelor's degree at US schools, which means more qualified competition for the available jobs. The National Center for Education Statistics showed there were almost 2 million bachelor's degrees conferred in the 2022-2023 academic year, up from 1.8 million a decade ago.

"​​We are used to thinking about college as being a meal ticket to economic opportunity," said Guy Berger, the workforce economist in residence at Guild and senior fellow at the Burning Glass Institute. Still, he added that having a degree could bring less of a premium in the job market because there are more college graduates than in the past.

The unemployment rate for recent college graduates ages 22 to 27 has soared compared to unemployment for all workers ages 16 to 65 in recent years. This is a new trend: young people with degrees have historically almost always been more likely to be employed than the rest of the labor force.

The unemployment rate gap between the total workforce and recent grads was historically wide this spring, meaning that the job market for 20-somethings with degrees is among the worst the cohort has seen in at least four decades. Those who studied anthropology, physics, or computer engineering had the highest unemployment rates in 2023, per the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's analysis of Census Bureau data.

The pool of jobs available for Gen Z — and the workforce as a whole — to apply for has shrunk. Job openings have cooled from 12 million in March 2022 to 7 million this past April. In what's been dubbed the Big Stay, current employees are holding on to their seats as well, with the monthly quit rate falling from 3% in March 2022 to 2% this past April.

Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said college and high school graduates are entering a job market where people are holding onto their jobs and companies aren't cutting roles or hiring new employees.

"The labor market is frozen, these seats are not necessarily opening up for these workers, and that is disproportionately impacting these younger workers," Stahle said.

Gusto, a payroll and benefits platform for small- and medium-sized businesses, found the rate of primarily white-collar hires aged 20 to 24 at small and midsize employers has fallen from pre-pandemic levels, declining from 9.4% in May 2019 to 2.7% this past March.

Still, Aaron Terrazas, an economist at Gusto, said there are US cities where new grad hiring looks strong, including in the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley. Plus, he said wage growth is accelerating for graduates.

"We all come out of school with grand ambitions and thinking our plan is set," Terrazas said. "Being open to unexpected opportunities is particularly important in an economy like the present."

Even if new graduates have a job, they may be working in a role that doesn't typically require a college degree. While this figure fluctuates over time, the share of 20-somethings who have jobs they're overeducated for is rising in 2025. It coincides with the generation's pivot toward skilled-trades roles such as electricians or plumbers.

Many young people are seeing these opportunities as a safer bet compared to a corporate world hit by layoff waves and hiring freezes. Construction laborers, electricians, and truck drivers are projected to grow faster than the average job-growth rate of 4% from 2023 to 2033, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Israel said on Saturday it had killed a veteran Iranian commander during attacks by both sides in the more than week-long air war, while Tehran said it would not negotiate over its nuclear program while under threat.

Saeed Izadi, who led the Palestine Corps of the Quds Force, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' overseas arm, was killed in a strike on an apartment in the Iranian city of Qom, said Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz.

Calling his killing a "major achievement for Israeli intelligence and the Air Force", Katz said in a statement that Izadi had financed and armed the Palestinian militant group Hamas ahead of its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza.

The Revolutionary Guards said five of its members died in attacks on Khorramabad, according to Iranian media. They did not mention Izadi, who was on U.S. and British sanctions lists.

Iranian media said earlier on Saturday that Israel had attacked a building in Qom, with initial reports of a 16-year-old killed and two people injured.

At least 430 people have been killed and 3,500 injured in Iran since Israel began its attacks on June 13, Iranian state-run Nour News said, citing the health ministry.

In Israel, 24 civilians have been killed by Iranian missile attacks, according to local authorities, in the worst conflict between the longtime enemies.

Israel says Iran was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons, while Iran says its atomic programme is only for peaceful purposes.

Israel is widely assumed to possess nuclear weapons, which it neither confirms nor denies.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Israel's aggression, which he said had indications of U.S. involvement, should stop so Iran can "come back to diplomacy."

"It is obvious that I can't go to negotiations with the U.S. when our people are under bombardments under the support of the U.S," he told reporters in Istanbul where he was attending a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).

On Friday in Geneva, Araqchi met European foreign ministers who were seeking a path back to diplomacy.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said he would take up to two weeks to decide whether the United States should enter the conflict on Israel's side, enough time "to see whether or not people come to their senses," he said.

He said on Friday he thought Iran would be able to have a nuclear weapon "within a matter of weeks, or certainly within a matter of months," adding: "We can't let that happen."

Iran's Fars news agency said Israel had targeted the Isfahan nuclear facility, one of the nation's biggest, but there was no leakage of hazardous materials. Israel said it had launched a wave of attacks against missile storage and launch infrastructure sites.

Ali Shamkhani, a close ally of Iran's supreme leader, said he had survived an Israeli attack. "It was my fate to stay with a wounded body, so I stay to continue to be the reason for the enemy's hostility," he said in a message carried by state media.

Early on Saturday, the Israeli military warned of an incoming barrage from Iran, triggering air raid sirens across parts of central Israel and in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Interceptions were visible in the sky over Tel Aviv, with explosions echoing as Israel's air defense systems responded. There were no reports of casualties.

The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a U.S.-based rights organization that tracks Iran, gave a higher death toll than Tehran, saying Israeli attacks have killed 639 people there.

Those killed in Iran include the military's top echelon and nuclear scientists. Israel said it also killed a second commander of the Guards' overseas arm, whom it identified as Benham Shariyari, during an overnight strike.

Nour News on Saturday named 15 air defense officers and soldiers it said had been killed in the conflict with Israel.

Iran's health minister, Mohammadreza Zafarqandi, said Israel has attacked three hospitals during the conflict, killing two health workers and a child, and has targeted six ambulances, according to Fars.

Asked about such reports, an Israeli military official said that only military targets were being struck, though there may have been collateral damage in some incidents.

An Iranian missile hit a hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba on Thursday.

At the OIC meeting, where the Israel-Iran conflict topped the agenda, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said Israel's attacks on Iran right before a planned new round of nuclear talks with the U.S. aimed to sabotage negotiations and showed Israel did not want to resolve issues through diplomacy.

Turkey, Russia and China have demanded immediate de-escalation.

The Geneva talks produced little signs of progress, and Trump said he doubted negotiators would be able to secure a ceasefire because "Iran doesn't want to speak to Europe. They want to speak to us."

Trump said he was unlikely to press Israel, its close ally, to scale back its air strikes to allow negotiations to continue in part because it was "winning."

"But we're ready, willing and able, and we've been speaking to Iran, and we'll see what happens," he said.

Israel has said it will not stop attacks until it dismantles Iran's nuclear program and ballistic missile capabilities, which it views as an existential threat.

A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Iran was ready to discuss limitations on uranium enrichment but that it would reject any proposal that barred it from enriching uranium completely, "especially now under Israel's strikes."

Activists from "No Space For Bezos" gather in Campo San Giacomo square in Venice on June 13.

The $10 million bash has called attention to whether the city needs to take stronger actions to stop a deluge of visitors. 

When Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former TV presenter Lauren Sanchez get married in Venice next week in a three-day, $10 million bash, they'll be joined not only by fellow celebrities but also by some unwelcome guests: anti-tourism activists determined to disrupt the festivities.

“We will throw ourselves into the water and use inflatables to oppose the event,” said Federica Toninello, a representative of the “No Space for Bezos” movement, which has announced plans to peacefully block land and water access to the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, which is among the rumored wedding party venues. The protest, she added, would be open to anybody “who wants to join us to take back our city.”

China's real estate sector has grappled with a deepening downturn for years. Now a shrinking population is casting another shadow over the stagnant property market.

Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in Chinese urban cities will remain suppressed at under 5 million units per year in the coming years — one fourth of the peak of 20 million units in 2017.

"Falling population and slowing urbanization suggest decreasing demographic demand for housing" in the coming years, Goldman Sachs economists said in a note Monday.

The country's population is estimated to fall to below 1.39 billion by 2035 from 1.41 billion, according to World Bank's latest data, said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at Economist Intelligence Unit, citing a combination of fewer newborns and more deaths from an ageing population.

China's population has been declining for the past three years, with the latest government data for 2024 showing it fell by 1.39 million from the prior year, as birth rates drop.

Shrinking population will cripple home demand by 0.5 million units every year in the 2020s and a lead to a bigger dent of 1.4 million units annually in the 2030s, Goldman Sachs estimates, compared to the positive contribution of 1.5 million units in the 2010s when population was on a steady rise.

Fertility rate in the country has continued to fall even after Beijing relaxed its one-child policy in 2016, and despite Beijing's efforts to incentivize child-bearing via cash incentives. Stagnant incomes, instability over job prospects and a poor social security system have dissuaded Chinese young people from having more babies.

Beijing's pronatalist policies will likely have "limited effect" as they do not address the deep-rooted issues, Xu said, such as high economic costs for child-bearing and people's tendency to postpone marriage for career progression and "an embrace of individuality."

Underscoring the declining birth rates, nearly 36,000 kindergartens across the country closed down over the past two years, with the number of students in preschools falling by over 10 million. That's according to CNBC's calculation of the official data released the Ministry of Education. Similarly, the number of elementary schools dropped by nearly 13,000 between 2022 and 2024.

That is rippling through school-adjacent housing markets that once saw inflated prices on the back of strong demand for better public schools.

The once-sizable premium was fueled by access to elite schools and expectations of rising property values. But with a shrinking population and local governments scaling back district-based enrollment policies, the added value of these homes has started diminishing, according to William Wu, China property analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets.

A mother of a 7-year-old boy in Beijing told CNBC that the price of her apartment had fallen by about 20% from over two years ago when she bought it. It cost her roughly twice the average price for an apartment in the city, so that her son could attend a good elementary school.

The number of children entering primary school in 2023 reached the highest level in over two decades, according to Wind Information, before dropping in 2024, the year her son enrolled.

That demographic shift is an additional overhang to the property market, which has struggled to emerge from a painful downturn since late 2020. Despite a raft of central and local government measures since last September, the real estate slump has shown little sign of abating.

New home prices fell at their fastest pace in seven months in May, according to Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie, extending a two-year stagnation, despite the government efforts aimed at arresting the decline.

New home sales in 30 major cities fell by 11% year on year in the first half of this month, worsening from the 3% drop in May, Hu said.

"Holders of investment properties are likely to be net sellers (to owner-occupiers) for the foreseeable future," over expectations that home prices will continue to fall, Goldman Sachs estimates.

While Goldman expects the rise in China's urbanization rate to temper in the coming years, hurting urban housing demand, Wu said demographic drag on the property market was not yet "imminent" and may take decades to play out.

In the nearer term, "some of this decline will be offset by continued urbanization, and housing upgrade demand," Wu said, as the latter would account for an increasing share of China's total housing demand.

Andreessen Horowitz led a $15 million funding round for an artificial intelligence startup called Cluely Inc., famous on social platforms like X for controversial viral marketing stunts and the slogan “cheat on everything.” 

The startup was co-founded by 21-year-old Roy Lee, who was booted from Columbia University earlier this year for creating a tool called Interview Coder that helped technical job candidates cheat on interviews using AI. At the time, he wrote on LinkedIn, “I'm completely kicked out from school. LOL!”

The Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices have suffered significant losses over the last day, sparking a bearish outlook for these altcoins. This price crash comes amid the US Supreme Court decision, which keeps the Trump tariffs in place, and the lingering Israel-Iran conflict.

CoinMarketCap data shows that the Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices have crashed in the last 24 hours. ETH is down almost 4% while DOGE and XRP are down almost 2% and 3%, respectively. This comes following the US Supreme Court's denial of a motion to expedite the consideration of a motion on whether the Trump tariffs are legal or not. 

This means that the Trump tariffs remain in place while the appeal cases continue. Trump's administration had earlier appealed a Federal Trade Court's ruling that the tariffs were beyond the president's authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Meanwhile, a second Federal Court also ruled against the tariffs. 

However, the latest Supreme Court decision presents a setback for the crypto market, seeing as the Trump tariffs will remain in place at least for now. The tariffs are bearish for the Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices, which explains why these altcoins witnessed a sharp decline. The tariffs have already raised concerns of inflation, with the Federal Reserve holding off on rate cuts. 

Fed Jerome Powell has indicated that the committee is well prepared to wait and see how the tariffs impact the economy rather than rush to cut rates. Rate cuts are typically bullish for the Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices because they inject more liquidity into these assets. However, these rate cuts could remain on hold if the tariffs persist. 

 

Another reason the Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices declined is because of the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict, which has gone on for over one week now. Both countries launched fresh strikes on each other in the last 24 hours, a move that is likely to further escalate the war. Meanwhile, the US is reportedly considering joining the war, which is also bearish for these altcoin prices. 

The White House stated that Donald Trump would decide on whether the US will join the war within two weeks. The US consideration has sparked fear among investors, which could have also contributed to the decline for the Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices.

Amid this decline, a positive for the Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices is Fed Governor Christopher Waller's statement that rate cuts  could happen as early as next month. In a CNBC interview, he opined that they need to move slowly but that he thinks that they can start easing monetary policies from next month. 

US President Donald Trump has also called on the Fed to cut rates several times. In one of his most recent Truth Social post, he raised the possibility of firing Jerome Powell if the Fed Chair continues to delay on rate cuts. A potential rate cut would be bullish for the Ethereum, Dogecoin, and XRP prices.

 Bitcoin's AVIV ratio and power law model point to a $330,000 cycle top for BTC price. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin AVIV Ratio remains below historical peak levels, indicating a potential climb above $330,000 before a cycle top is confirmed.

Over-the-counter Bitcoin holdings are down significantly in 2025, pointing to strategic accumulation by Strategy, Metaplanet, BlackRock and others.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has had a rocky month, but recent analysis indicates that BTC could surge another 300% this cycle. Technical analyst Gert van Lagen's X post highlights the AVIV Ratio, a metric that compares Bitcoin's active capitalization (money in motion) to its total invested capitalization (realized capital, excluding miner rewards). 

Historically, when the AVIV Ratio crosses its +3σ mean deviation, it has signaled a cycle top. For example, BTC was $1,200 in 2013, near $20,000 in 2017, and around $69,000 in 2021. Currently, the AVIV Ratio's level remains below these past peaks, suggesting Bitcoin could climb to at least $330,000 this cycle, before the +3σ mean deviation condition is met. 

The AVIV Ratio offers a unique lens on market dynamics, reflecting investor activity versus locked-in value. A spike indicates heightened trading or profit-taking, often preceding major price movements. Van Lagen's analysis ties this to Bitcoin's cyclical nature, where post-ATH rallies have historically delivered significant gains. However, its predictive accuracy lacks validation in varying market conditions, and volatility remains a wildcard.

Adding to the narrative, data from CryptoQuant reveals a notable shift: Bitcoin holdings on over-the-counter (OTC) desks have dropped from 166,500 to 137,400 in 2025. This decline suggests large investors are moving holdings off exchanges, potentially signaling reduced selling pressure or a shift toward long-term storage.

The declining balances at OTC desks this year stem from strategic accumulation by institutional investors, led by Strategy's aggressive buying, and new entrants like Metaplanet, which has amassed 10,000 BTC, alongside robust net inflows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which total $128.18 billion in net value. BlackRock's crypto portfolio also holds more than $70 billion in BTC, which sums up the current intent of major investors in the market. 

📊MARKET UPDATE: #BlackRock added another $250 million in #Bitcoin on June 17 — marking six straight days of buying, now totaling $1.4 billion. Its current $BTC holding is valued at over $70 billion. 🤯 (h/t: @arkham) pic.twitter.com/JmjNAu2kDY

Similar to Van Lagen's $330,000 price target, another study by Bitcoin researcher Sminston With outlined a comparable cycle top for BTC. With's analysis leverages a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96), projecting Bitcoin's price could reach $220,000 to $330,000 in this cycle. 

Currently trading around $104,000, BTC would need a 100% to 200% surge to hit these levels, consistent with historical peaks where prices doubled or tripled above the power law trendline.

With's model challenges assumptions of diminishing volatility, showing Bitcoin's price cycles retain significant swings, as evidenced by steady deviations from the trendline. While optimistic, the researcher cautions that the analysis draws from only four market cycles, urging skepticism. 

Likewise, Cointelegraph reported that a list of 30 bull market peak indicators from CoinGlass suggests Bitcoin could climb to $230,000, with none signaling a cycle top despite BTC reaching $112,000. Metrics like Pi Cycle Top and MVRV show the bull market has room to run, supporting With's optimistic outlook.

Savvy bitcoin BTC$102,623.27 and ether ETH$2,397.90 traders are shoring up their defenses as the broader market continues to foresee bullish price action over the summer.

That's the message from an options-based strategy called 25-delta risk reversal, which involves the simultaneous purchase of a put option and sale of a call, or vice versa.

At the time of writing, risk reversals based on Deribit-listed bitcoin and ether options indicated that investors were positioning for downside volatility over the summer.

BTC's 25-delta risk reversals for June, July, and August tenors were negative, indicating a preference for put options, which offer downside protection, over calls or bullish bets, according to data source Amberdata. In ETH's case, puts were pricier out to the July end expiry.

Traders typically buy put options to hedge their long positions in the spot and futures markets, protecting themselves from potential price declines.

"Risk reversals in both BTC and ETH continue to show a preference for downside protection across June and September tenors. This suggests that long holders are actively hedging spot exposure and preparing for potential drawdowns," Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market note.

The nervousness is evident from the over-the-counter liquidity platform Paradigm, where the top five BTC trades for the week include a put spread and a bearish risk reversal. Meanwhile, in ETH's case, a long position in the $2,450 put crossed the tape alongside a short strangle (volatility) trade.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has spent over 40 days trading back and forth above $100,000, according to CoinDesk data. According to analysts, profit-taking by long-term holders and miner selling have counteracted the strong uptake for spot ETFs, leaving prices directionless.

"Bitcoin has recently tracked sideways, suggesting its current price may be too high for many retail investors. Open interest in BTC options has risen, with a positive and rising 25 delta put-call skew on 30-day contracts, which may imply that market participants are seeking short-term protection through put options," Coinbase Institutional's weekly report noted.

On Friday, BTC closed (UTC) below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) to trade below the key support for the first time since mid-April. The breakdown may lead to more chart-driven selling, potentially resulting in a drop below $100,000.

Some observers, however, expect a rally to new record highs. According to market observer Cas Abbé, BTC's on-balance volume continues to indicate strong buying pressure, suggesting that prices could rise to $130,000-$135,000 by the end of the third quarter.

Cryptocurrency markets have been under a microscope recently, especially with the latest trends making waves across the digital finance market. As major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to capture global attention, a new player is quietly but steadily making its way to the forefront. With blockchain technology maturing and decentralized finance becoming more integrated into daily business operations, many are seeking the best crypto to buy right now. In particular, a rising star-Qubetics ($TICS)-has been making a name for itself by addressing real-world issues that other blockchain projects have yet to solve.



As the market continues to shift, new projects like Qubetics have emerged with groundbreaking features designed to offer tangible solutions. These advancements, combined with the growing demand for more accessible and decentralized systems, have made certain coins, including Qubetics, top contenders in the race for the best crypto to buy right now. With many predicting that the future of blockchain will look very different from today, those who identify the best crypto to buy right now stand to benefit from potentially lucrative rewards.

Qubetics is a project that has quickly risen to prominence, drawing considerable interest. With its unique approach to tokenization and a clearly defined roadmap, it has already made an indelible mark on the blockchain ecosystem.



Qubetics has attracted widespread attention, especially in the context of its ongoing crypto presale. As of now, the crypto presale is in its 37th stage, and the project has already sold over 516 million tokens, raising more than $18 million from over 28,100 holders. Putting $3,500 at $0.3370, and  it will give 10,386 $TICS. A post-launch pop to $1 triples the money. If Qubetics gains momentum to $5, that grows 15x to $51,930. And if the next cycle pushes it to $10 or $15, it will grow to $103,860 or $155,790 from the same entry point.

With only 10 million $TICS tokens left in this phase, the limited supply is generating increasing excitement among blockchain enthusiasts. The scarcity created by reducing the total supply from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion tokens has already spurred predictions of an immediate post-listing surge in price, potentially reaching $5 to $10 in the coming market cycle. This move has created a unique dynamic of scarcity that drives demand, making it one of the best crypto to buy right now.

Qubetics has redefined blockchain dynamics by introducing the concept of Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace (RWATM). This visionary idea is solving significant pain points that other blockchain projects have struggled to address. The integration of real-world assets into the blockchain ecosystem opens a new horizon for decentralized solutions, addressing real-world issues related to asset ownership, fractionalization, and liquidity.

Central Asia has seen a rapid increase in blockchain adoption, especially in the areas of digital finance and asset management. The Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace by Qubetics fits perfectly within this growing trend. The project offers tangible solutions, disrupting traditional industries and aligning with the growing digital-first economies of this region.

Key Benefits of Qubetics for Central Asian Businesses:

Crypto World News

June 22, 2025 by Paul Adedoyin 

Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has cited a positive picture on the Ethereum (ETH) chart, saying that the cryptocurrency is inching to the conclusion of a significant period of consolidation and is building up to a heavy rally period. 

As van de Poppe explained in a recent post, ETH has been accumulating liquidity at multiple price points. To him, this trend is typically an indication that the asset is accumulating some pressure towards a reversal, and this time, the asset's price could be going up.

Van de Poppe also noted that Ethereum has been trading sideways within a tight range over the last month. It appears to have stabilized and strengthened in an otherwise volatile market. 

This protracted period of consolidation is regarded as an accumulation period, during which the price is ready to jump significantly. Van de Poppe also stressed that these patterns are likely to cause explosive price action, particularly when it is accompanied by good fundamentals and mounting interest.

Adding to the optimism, the spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have experienced inflow of more than $1 billion in June. It implies that institutional interest in Ethereum is on the rise. 

Van de Poppe thinks that this type of inflow will be another contribution to the probability of the price breakout towards the upside.

In a chart the analyst provided in his post, Ethereum has displayed an apparent support region, with prices rebounding following every dip in that region. The target region in the chart also has a breakout above the existing level of resistance. 

This is a key area that the analyst tags as having the potential of causing a very sharp rally in ETH in the event that it is breached. The chart displays that Ethereum trades right below a significant resistance zone at the moment where it has made attempts to break through it a couple of times.

All these are coupled with the fact that the price is establishing a pattern of higher lows as noted by Van de Poppe, which is usually a precursor of an upward trend.

From Free NFT Mint to Drinks at 7-Eleven: Rekt Is Reaching the Masses

brands

Rektguy didn't mint out its free NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain in 2022—but three years later, the brand has become incredibly familiar with the phrase “sold out,” with the Rekt Drinks brand clearing out successive drops and reaching more and more consumers along the way.

The brand, which weathered a brutal crypto bear market thanks in part to the strength of its fervent community, has now sold more than 600,000 cans of Rekt Drinks, a non-alcoholic, flavored sparkling water that comes in a variety of different flavors. And this week, the brand earned placement at 7-Eleven, starting with a trio of stores in Southern California. 

Rekt Brands co-founder Ovie Faruq (aka OSF) told Decrypt that it's “kind of funny” that the original Rektguy NFT offering didn't mint out. The project, which started as an art collection and a “side quest” for Faruq, has since morphed its way into a leading Web3 brand, with beverages helping it expand beyond the blockchain.

Rekt is going mainstream.

(Disclosure: Ovie Faruq's Canary Labs is an investor in DASTAN, the parent company of Rug Radio and Decrypt.)

“We sort of had a decision to make. We didn't really promise anything, there was no roadmap, no promises made—it was really just meant to be an art collection,” he said of Rektguy. “But over the next two years, we seemed to just have this really super sticky, tight-knit community that stuck around.” 

It was during the summer of 2023 when ideas started to blossom about potential expansions.

“We spoke a while about Rektguy versus Rekt as a concept. We had put the logo on a few things, and it sort of felt like this Rekt thing could be a brand,” Faruq said, adding that the goal became getting the logo in as many places as possible. 

Drinks felt like a natural connection, according to Faruq, thanks in part to the ability to manufacture them cheaply—plus the connection to Rektguy's imagery, which features a hooded skeleton holding a drinking bottle.

With no experience in drinks, the team brought on an advisor who had started a drinks company in the UK. Through trial and error, they got cans of Rekt into the hands of attendees at NFT Paris in 2024—and they liked it. 

“The feedback was really good. It was surprisingly good,” said Faruq. “Considering we had no experience in drinks, we just kind of like made up this drink to fuck around and find out, so to speak. It was really, really good feedback.” 

From there, the team decided to try to manufacture a bigger batch and sell them, leading to its first major sale of Liquidated Lime drinks last October—a collection of 222,000 drinks that it sold out in 48 hours.

Prior to the sale, Rekt built out a rewards program to incentivize users to engage with the brand, rewarding Drank Points to those who participated in social quests and drink purchasers as well. By earning points, users were later eligible to claim Rekt Coin (REKT), an Ethereum-based token tied to the brand. 

“I was really inspired by the Solana phone,” said Faruq about the Solana Saga, an Android smartphone that initially faced weak demand, but then sold out once the Bonk meme coin offered to buyers surged in value. “No one touched it, tons of supply left—but as soon as people could claim a $500 BONK airdrop, the phone sold out in like 24 hours.” 

After its initial success, the brand teamed up with Ethereum layer-2 network Abstract for a drop of Abstract Apple, a new flavor of its sparkling water, selling out even faster than before.

“After that, we just had tons of people reaching out to us for collaborations,” said Faruq, whose brand also dropped drinks via collabs with NFT marketplace OpenSea and Solana decentralized exchange aggregator, Jupiter. 

But beyond the crypto walls, the connections didn't always come easily.

“No one's really heard of us outside of crypto. We did the first sale, and people are sort of wondering if this is a one-hit wonder sort of thing,” he said, adding that the brand's crypto origins initially led to some skepticism, as well. “You tell people the story, they expressed some interest, but there wasn't really a ton of movement,” he added.

But after the Abstract and OpenSea drops, the brand started to pick up some momentum that has carried into its placements in 7-Eleven stores, placing Rekt alongside giants of the beverage industry.

“With 7-Eleven, I just think we had a very strong pitch to them,” said Faruq. “This is the perfect product for a 7-Eleven store, and we can get a ton of people out to the stores when we launch it and make it some really big thing and a really good launch. They were onboard.” 

The brand carried out its first 7-Eleven activation on Thursday, overselling its initial planned supply of 600 cans in the process. The cans were priced at $2.80 a pop, or $10 for a 4-pack. Another event took place Friday, with the last set for Saturday. And early 4-pack buyers each day will earn an allotment of REKT tokens, as well.

"​​[You] never really know if people will turn up to stuff when it's not a crypto event," Faruq told Decrypt of the initial Thursday event. "But we had a good turnout, and all the drinks selling out was obviously nice."

Cardano's ADA ADA$0.57262 token came under pressure Saturday, falling to $0.5818 and extending its weekly losses despite renewed focus on the network's Leios upgrade. ADA declined 3.77% over the past 24 hours, with volume spiking 38.39% above the 7-day average, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. 

On Thirsday, Input Output Global (IOG), the research arm behind Cardano, reiterated its vision for the upcoming Leios upgrade via a thread on X. The team explained that Leios is designed to optimize transaction processing and resource utilization, especially during peak block activity. The design introduces new mechanisms like endorsements to maintain security and data availability while boosting overall throughput.

Leios was first introduced in November 2022 as a new family variant of Cardano's Ouroboros consensus protocol. At the time, IOG highlighted that existing designs such as Praos and Genesis faced fundamental scalability limits — not due to bandwidth or CPU, but due to algorithmic dependencies that constrained throughput. Leios seeks to address these limits with a major architectural overhaul, including faster chain sync, tiered transaction fees, and greater service prioritization.

The upgrade is not just a tweak to the existing system but a substantial redesign. While implementation will demand considerable changes, its benefits could be transformative. IOG Co-Founder and CEO Charles Hoskinson said on X on May 10 that he expects Leios to go live on the Cardano mainnet in 2026, a timeline that was reportedly accelerated from an initial 2028 projection.

Meanwhile, long-term holders continue to withdraw ADA from centralized exchanges, signaling conviction in the asset's future.

Crypto and blockchain stocks are putting altcoins to shame. 

The Circle ($CRCL) stock price has appreciated by another 20% on Friday, closing the week at $240. Since its June 5 debut, $CRCL has now surged 677%, benefiting significantly from pro-stablecoin legislation in the United States and strong institutional demand. 

Meanwhile, Coinbase (COIN) is also showing considerable bullish strength, up by nearly 28% this week and 116% since its April bottom. 

The COIN stock price surged by 4.43% on Friday on the news that Coinbase has received the MiCA license from Luxembourg to provide crypto services in the European Union. 

Besides COIN and CRCL, crypto treasury stocks have emerged as attractive bets. Wall Street giant Cantor Fitzgerald has identified Solana treasury firm Sol Strategies (CYFRF) as an “overweight” stock. 

The Canadian firm is looking to enter the US markets with a Nasdaq listing, which could make it one of the best blockchain stocks to buy. 

Summary

The ongoing crypto bull market, stablecoin legislation in the US and the strong institutional demand have established Coinbase and Circle as two excellent bets in a boring stock market. 

TradFi investors appear to be viewing $COIN, $CRCL, and crypto treasury plays as better investments than large-cap altcoins, many of which continue to undershoot expectations.

Notably, the GENIUS Act's bipartisan advancement through the Senate has provided added tailwinds to the crypto stock rally.

Pending passage in the House of Representatives and final approval by the President, the Act would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins and open the door for their adoption by banks, financial institutions, and even consumer-facing companies.

US President Donald Trump has already signalled his intent to sign the bill. “Get it to my desk, ASAP — NO DELAYS, NO ADD ONS”. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claims that the stablecoin market capitalization could reach $3.7 trillion by the end of the decade following the passage of the GENIUS Act, which is 15x larger than the sector's current valuation. 

Circle, which is the issuer of the second-largest stablecoin, USDC, has emerged as an excellent stablecoin play. 

However, sidelined investors should avoid FOMO buying at current levels. The stock's explosive rally has been fueled largely by speculative 0DTE flows and sky-high implied volatility, rather than fundamentals. 

With profit-taking risks elevated and bearish bets emerging, a sharp pullback remains a real possibility. 

Meanwhile, $COIN is another excellent stablecoin play, especially considering Coinbase has a minority stake in the company. In addition to that equity exposure, Coinbase earns 50% of the interest income generated from USDC reserves, making it a direct beneficiary of USDC's growth. 

Coinbase's growth also isn't entirely dependent on the stablecoin sector. Already the largest crypto exchange in the US, it has now received the MiCA license from Luxembourg to provide crypto services in the EU. 

However, $COIN is also nearing key resistance levels at $312 and $350, the latter of which is a multi-year resistance. 

Sidelined investors should therefore wait for a better entry point at lower prices or buy at a clear breakout above these levels. 

While stablecoin plays may be running out of steam, crypto treasury plays are just getting started. 

Wall Street giant Cantor Fitzgerald suggests that Solana treasury companies could outpace Bitcoin and Ethereum treasuries in asset-per-share growth, owing to SOL's staking capabilities, which can compound returns without relying on external capital.

Cantor has identified Sol Strategies (CYFRF) as one of the best blockchain stocks, initiating coverage and labelling it “overweight”. Their analysts have initiated coverage and anticipate a 65% rally in CYFRF in the coming weeks, which has already rallied 15x over the past year. 

Sol Strategies is often referred to as the MicroStrategy of Solana, owing to its growing SOL holdings, staking strategy and validator growth to boost long-term returns.

It recently secured a $500 million convertible note facility and filed a $1 billion shelf prospectus to support its ongoing SOL accumulation and validator expansion.

More importantly, Sol Strategies is now eyeing a US market entry, filing for a Nasdaq listing with the SEC, which would make it one of the top blockchain stocks to invest in.

New Solana utility coins are also in high demand. For instance, a prominent SOL Layer-2 coin, Solaxy (SOLX), is being viewed as the next 10x crypto. 

Besides its cutting-edge layer-2 architecture, Solaxy is also building a full-stack ecosystem within Solana, including a meme coin launchpad and its own decentralized exchange. 

Whales continue to pour six-figure investments into SOLX just days ahead of its June 23rd launch. It has now raised over $56 million in its presale.

 ZachXBT claims over 80% of Garden Finance's fees are tied to crypto laundering, challenging the project's decentralization narrative. 

Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT has accused Garden Finance, which brands itself as “the fastest Bitcoin bridge,” of facilitating the laundering of funds linked to major crypto thefts, including the Bybit hack.

In a June 21 post on X, ZachXBT claimed that over 80% of Garden's recent fee revenue stemmed from illicit transactions allegedly tied to the North Korean Lazarus Group.

The allegation came in response to an earlier post by Jaz Gulati, a co-founder of Garden Finance, who had recently touted the platform's success, citing 38.86 Bitcoin (BTC) in collected fees — $300,000 of which was earned over the 12 days ending June 2.

“You conveniently left out >80% of your fees came from Chinese launderers moving Lazarus Group funds from the Bybit hack,” ZachXBT said.

ZachXBT further alleged that that a single actor continuously topped up cbBTC liquidity from Coinbase, effectively fueling illicit flows while Garden claimed to operate a trustless and decentralized model.

“Explain how it is ‘decentralized' when I watched in real time for multiple days as a single entity kept topping up cbBTC liquidity from Coinbase,” ZachXBT wrote, questioning the project's claims of decentralization.

In response, Garden Finance founder Jaz Gulati denied the allegations, pointing out that 30 BTC in fees were collected prior to the Bybit incident. He dismissed the criticism as misinformation, calling the “fake decentralized” label baseless.

Garden Finance claims to enable crosschain swaps within 30 seconds while offering zero-custody risk.

According to its Dune Analytics dashboard, the project has facilitated over 24,984 BTC in total volume, equivalent to more than $1.5 billion, across 40,571 atomic swaps. The platform has collected 40.11 BTC in fees to date, with its largest single swap reaching 10 BTC.

Cointelegraph reached out to Jaz for comment via X but had not received a response by publication.

Last week, Iurii Gugnin, the founder of crypto payments firm Evita Pay, was arrested in New York. He faces 22 federal charges tied to a sprawling money laundering scheme allegedly involving over $530 million.

According to the US Department of Justice, Gugnin facilitated stablecoin transactions that enabled clients connected to sanctioned Russian banks, such as Sberbank and VTB, to bypass restrictions and gain access to sensitive US technologies.

Prosecutors say the operation ran from June 2023 through January 2025. Gugnin is charged with wire fraud, money laundering, and running an unlicensed money transmission business. If found guilty, he could face a life sentence.

Bitcoin (BTC) BTC$103,393.15 continues to struggle for direction amid mounting macroeconomic pressures and a notable deterioration in retail investor sentiment. The asset is hovering near $103,700 following a volatile 24-hour stretch, in which it briefly dropped below $103,400 before staging a modest recovery, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. This price behavior reflects an uneasy market backdrop, shaped by both geopolitical tensions and uncertain monetary policy.

According to an X post by crypto analytics firm Santiment on Thursday, sentiment among retail investors has turned sharply negative. The firm reported that the ratio of bullish to bearish commentary has fallen to just 1.03 to 1 — the lowest since early April, when the President Donald Trump unveiled his so-called Liberation Day tariffs, triggering peak market fear at the time. 

Santiment emphasized that this current wave of retail pessimism is unusually intense and, based on past patterns, may mark a contrarian signal for a price rebound. They specifically noted that back in April, Bitcoin rallied shortly after similar fear levels surfaced, suggesting large investors often use periods of retail capitulation to accumulate at favorable prices.

Adding to the pressure is the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, which has kept btcoin trading in a relatively tight $100,000 to $110,000 range over the past month. Meanwhile, on-chain metrics show declining open interest on Binance, pointing to continued deleveraging among derivatives traders. At the same time, whale wallets have shown steady accumulation since 2023 — an indication that large holders are continuing to build their positions despite the short-term uncertainty.

 Nakamoto Holdings, led by Trump's crypto adviser David Bailey, raises $51.5M in fresh capital to accelerate its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. 

Bitcoin holding company Nakamoto Holdings, founded by US President Donald Trump's crypto adviser, David Bailey, has secured $51.5 million in fresh capital through a private placement in public equity (PIPE) deal, according to a statement from merger partner KindlyMD.

Bailey said that the new funds were raised in less than 72 hours, reflecting growing investor appetite for Nakamoto's Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation strategy.

“Investor demand for Nakamoto is incredibly strong,” Bailey said. “We continue to execute our strategy to raise as much capital as possible to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible.”

The financing, priced at $5.00 per share, brings KindlyMD's total funding to approximately $563 million, and $763 million including convertible notes.

Nakamoto's approach mirrors the playbook used by other corporate entities aiming to leverage BTC as a reserve asset. The company was launched earlier this year with the explicit goal of building a sizable Bitcoin treasury, even as broader market sentiment remains mixed.

Proceeds from the latest round will be used primarily for Bitcoin purchases, along with working capital and general corporate needs. The PIPE financing is set to close alongside the anticipated merger with KindlyMD, which trades under the ticker NAKA on the Nasdaq.

Last month, shareholders of healthcare services firm KindlyMD approved a merger with Nakamoto Holdings. Both companies plan to file information statements with the SEC, with the merger expected to finalize in Q3 2025.

The companies first announced the merger on May 12, saying the merged entity would use equity, debt, and other offerings to develop a slew of Bitcoin-native companies. Additionally, the company will bolster its treasury by accumulating Bitcoin.

At least 27 organizations have added Bitcoin to their treasuries over the past month, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, signaling continued interest in BTC among public companies.

However, some analysts remain skeptical. Fakhul Miah of GoMining Institutional noted that smaller firms may be adopting Bitcoin out of necessity rather than strategy, potentially lacking the proper safeguards.

Standard Chartered has also raised concerns, warning that if BTC drops below $90,000, half of these companies could face liquidation risks, posing reputational challenges for the broader crypto market.

According to an announcement Friday, Everything Blockchain plans to put $10 million into five crypto tokens, including XRP. It will split that money across XRP, Solana (SOL), SUI, Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Bittensor (TAO).

Based on reports, the move makes it the first listed company to run a multi‑token staking treasury. The firm expects to pull in about $1 million each year in staking rewards under current network rates. That's a big bet on making crypto work like an active income stream rather than a passive holding.

Everything Blockchain says it will turn its reserve into a yield‑producing portfolio. By staking each of the five assets, the company hopes to earn up to $1 million annually. Network staking rates vary, so returns could rise or fall over time. The plan is to roll rewards back into staking as well as pay out a share to shareholders.

— CrusaderX (@CrusaderStocks) June 20, 2025



The five assets range from established tokens to new projects. XRP faces legal uncertainty after its long SEC battle but enjoys strong support among public holders.

SOL has a large ecosystem and solid staking yields today. SUI and Hyperliquid are newer networks chasing growth, while Bittensor ties rewards to AI‑driven workloads.

Putting millions into just five tokens keeps the portfolio focused, but it also means bigger swings if any one network stumbles.



Reports disclose that retail traders can tap into staking rewards simply by owning EBZT shares. Everything Blockchain says it will pass on a large chunk of its staking income directly to stock‑holders.

Details on timing and payout mechanics will appear in future shareholder updates. For many investors who don't run wallets or node validators, EBZT could offer a simpler way to participate.

Public firms are increasingly staking crypto to turn idle assets into yield streams. Trident Digital Tech Holdings plans a $500 million XRP treasury. Webus International filed to back $300 million in XRP.

VivoPower, Wellgistics Health and Ault Capital Group aim for $100 million, $50 million and $10 million XRP reserves, respectively. Everything Blockchain's early entry into multi‑token staking may set the pace for others on Wall Street and beyond.

Looking ahead, execution will decide if this playbook holds up. If Everything Blockchain can track yields accurately, manage network hiccups and distribute rewards smoothly, it may carve out a new model for corporate crypto treasuries.

 Eric Semler says he enjoys being the  “lone voice crying in the wilderness” with Bitcoin as most hedge fund executives think Bitcoin is a “fly-by-night concept.” 

Eric Semler, chairman of healthcare tech firm Semler Scientific Inc., says many of his hedge fund peers are skeptical about Bitcoin's future after US President Donald Trump leaves office.

“I think that they think it is a fly-by-night concept and that it is probably going to, after the Trump administration, go back down a lot,” Semler told Coin Stories host Natalie Brunell on Thursday.

Semler, who also founded hedge fund TCS Capital Management in 2001, made his comments amid skepticism within the crypto industry about how long political support for crypto will last after US President Donald Trump's administration ends. While Trump recently signed off on a Bitcoin (BTC) Strategic Reserve, some, like JAN3 founder Samson Mow, are concerned that support may potentially unravel under a future president.

However, it isn't a concern for Semler, who has doubled down on the asset. In May 2024, Semler Scientific became the second US publicly traded company to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy.

On Thursday, Semler Scientific announced plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings by nearly 23 times in the next two-and-a-half years, growing its holdings from 4,449 Bitcoin to 105,000 Bitcoin. Semler is aiming to hold a total of 10,000 Bitcoin by the end of this year.

Semler sees doubt from the traditional finance industry as a bullish signal. 

“When you're making a bet on something that the majority doesn't believe in, and you're right, you make so much more money,” Semler said.

“I think we got great opportunities to show people that basically they're missing out on a great opportunity,” he added.

Semler said he has built a career on going against the grain. “The best investments I've ever made have been in things that I'm kind of the lone voice crying in the wilderness,” he said.

“Those are the types of investments that have the highest returns,” he said. 

In October 2024, the Alternative Investment Management Association and PwC conducted a survey revealing that 47% of hedge fund managers trading in traditional markets are exposed to cryptocurrencies.

Crypto exposure was 29% in 2023, while about 37% of the respondents said they had exposure to crypto in 2022.

Back in June 2021, Intertrust Global surveyed chief financial officers from 100 hedge funds worldwide about their intention to purchase crypto assets. 

About 98% of them responded that they expect their hedge funds to have invested 7.2% of their assets in cryptocurrencies by 2026.

Scientists at the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology have discovered a key connection between high levels of iron in the brain and increased cell damage in people who have both Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.

In the study, researchers found that the brains of people diagnosed with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease (DSAD) had twice as much iron and more signs of oxidative damage in cell membranes compared to the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease alone or those with neither diagnosis. The results point to a specific cellular death process that is mediated by iron, and the findings may help explain why Alzheimer's symptoms often appear earlier and more severely in individuals with Down syndrome.

"This is a major clue that helps explain the unique and early changes we see in the brains of people with Down syndrome who develop Alzheimer's," said Max Thorwald, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of University Professor Emeritus Caleb Finch at the USC Leonard Davis School. "We've known for a long time that people with Down syndrome are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease, but now we're beginning to understand how increased iron in the brain might be making things worse."

Down syndrome and Alzheimer's

Down syndrome is caused by having an extra third copy, or trisomy, of chromosome 21. This chromosome includes the gene for amyloid precursor protein, or APP, which is involved in the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ), the sticky protein that forms telltale plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.

Because people with Down syndrome have three copies of the APP gene instead of two, they tend to produce more of this protein. By the age of 60, about half of all people with Down syndrome show signs of Alzheimer's disease, which is approximately 20 years earlier than in the general population.

"This makes understanding the biology of Down syndrome incredibly important for Alzheimer's research," said Finch, the study's senior author.

Key findings point to ferroptosis

The research team studied donated brain tissue from individuals with Alzheimer's, DSAD, and those without either diagnosis. They focused on the prefrontal cortex -- an area of the brain involved in thinking, planning, and memory -- and made several important discoveries:

Together, these findings indicate increased ferroptosis, a type of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, Thorwald explained: "Essentially, iron builds up, drives the oxidation that damages cell membranes, and overwhelms the cell's ability to protect itself."

Lipid rafts: a hotspot for brain changes

The researchers paid close attention to lipid rafts -- tiny parts of the brain cell membrane that play crucial roles in cell signaling and regulate how proteins like APP are processed. They found that in DSAD brains, lipid rafts had much more oxidative damage and fewer protective enzymes compared to Alzheimer's or healthy brains.

Notably, these lipid rafts also showed increased activity of the enzyme β-secretase, which interacts with APP to produce Aβ proteins. The combination of more damage and more Aβ production may promote the growth of amyloid plaques, thus speeding up Alzheimer's progression in people with Down syndrome, Finch explained.

Rare Down syndrome variants offer insight

The researchers also studied rare cases of individuals with "mosaic" or "partial" Down syndrome, in which the third copy of chromosome 21 is only present in a smaller subset of the body's cells. These individuals had lower levels of APP and iron in their brains and tended to live longer. In contrast, people with full trisomy 21 and DSAD had shorter lifespans and higher levels of brain damage.

"These cases really support the idea that the amount of APP -- and the iron that comes with it -- matters a lot in how the disease progresses," Finch said.

Looking ahead

The team says their findings could help guide future treatments, especially for people with Down syndrome who are at high risk of Alzheimer's. Early research in mice suggests that iron-chelating treatments, in which medicine binds to the metal ions and allows them to leave the body, may reduce indicators of Alzheimer's pathology, Thorwald noted.

"Medications that remove iron from the brain or help strengthen antioxidant systems might offer new hope," Thorwald said. "We're now seeing how important it is to treat not just the amyloid plaques themselves but also the factors that may be hastening the development of those plaques."

The idea seems futuristic: At ETH Zurich, various disciplines are working together to combine conventional materials with bacteria, algae and fungi. The common goal: to create living materials that acquire useful properties thanks to the metabolism of microorganisms -- "such as the ability to bind CO2 from the air by means of photosynthesis," says Mark Tibbitt, Professor of Macromolecular Engineering at ETH Zurich.

An interdisciplinary research team led by Tibbitt has now turned this vision into reality: it has stably incorporated photosynthetic bacteria -- known as cyanobacteria -- into a printable gel and developed a material that is alive, grows and actively removes carbon from the air. The researchers recently presented their "photosynthetic living material" in a study in the journal Nature Communications.

Key characteristic: Dual carbon sequestration

The material can be shaped using 3D printing and only requires sunlight and artificial seawater with readily available nutrients in addition to CO2 to grow. "As a building material, it could help to store CO2 directly in buildings in the future," says Tibbitt, who co-initiated the research into living materials at ETH Zurich.

The special thing about it: the living material absorbs much more CO2 than it binds through organic growth. "This is because the material can store carbon not only in biomass, but also in the form of minerals -- a special property of these cyanobacteria," reveals Tibbitt.

Yifan Cui, one of the two lead authors of the study, explains: "Cyanobacteria are among the oldest life forms in the world. They are highly efficient at photosynthesis and can utilize even the weakest light to produce biomass from CO2 and water."

At the same time, the bacteria change their chemical environment outside the cell as a result of photosynthesis, so that solid carbonates (such as lime) precipitate. These minerals represent an additional carbon sink and -- in contrast to biomass -- store CO2 in a more stable form.

Cyanobacteria as master builders

"We utilize this ability specifically in our material," says Cui, who is a doctoral student in Tibbitt's research group. A practical side effect: the minerals are deposited inside the material and reinforce it mechanically. In this way, the cyanobacteria slowly harden the initially soft structures.

Laboratory tests showed that the material continuously binds CO2 over a period of 400 days, most of it in mineral form -- around 26 milligrams of CO2 per gram of material. This is significantly more than many biological approaches and comparable to the chemical mineralization of recycled concrete (around 7 mg CO2 per gram).

Hydrogel as a habitat

The carrier material that harbours the living cells is a hydrogel -- a gel made of cross-linked polymers with a high water content. Tibbitt's team selected the polymer network so that it can transport light, CO2, water and nutrients and allows the cells to spread evenly inside without leaving the material.

To ensure that the cyanobacteria live as long as possible and remain efficient, the researchers have also optimised the geometry of the structures using 3D printing processes to increase the surface area, increase light penetration and promote the flow of nutrients.

Co-first author Dalia Dranseike: "In this way, we created structures that enable light penetration and passively distribute nutrient fluid throughout the body by capillary forces." Thanks to this design, the encapsulated cyanobacteria lived productively for more than a year, the materials researcher in Tibbitt's team is pleased to report.

Infrastructure as a carbon sink

The researchers see their living material as a low-energy and environmentally friendly approach that can bind CO2 from the atmosphere and supplement existing chemical processes for carbon sequestration. "In the future, we want to investigate how the material can be used as a coating for building façades to bind CO2 throughout the entire life cycle of a building," Tibbitt looks ahead.

There is still a long way to go -- but colleagues from the field of architecture have already taken up the concept and realised initial interpretations in an experimental way.

Two installations in Venice and Milan

Thanks to ETH doctoral student Andrea Shin Ling, basic research from the ETH laboratories has made it onto the big stage at the Architecture Biennale in Venice. "It was particularly challenging to scale up the production process from laboratory format to room dimensions," says the architect and bio-designer, who is also involved in this study.

Ling is doing her doctorate at ETH Professor Benjamin Dillenburger's Chair of Digital Building Technologies. In her dissertation, she developed a platform for biofabrication that can print living structures containing functional cyanobacteria on an architectural scale.

For the Picoplanktonics installation in the Canada Pavilion, the project team used the printed structures as living building blocks to construct two tree-trunk-like objects, the largest around three metres high. Thanks to the cyanobacteria, these can each bind up to 18 kg of CO2 per year -- about as much as a 20-year-old pine tree in the temperate zone.

"The installation is an experiment -- we have adapted the Canada Pavilion so that it provides enough light, humidity and warmth for the cyanobacteria to thrive and then we watch how they behave," says Ling. This is a commitment: The team monitors and maintains the installation on site -- daily. Until November 23.

At the 24th Triennale di Milano, Dafne's Skin is investigating the potential of living materials for future building envelopes. On a structure covered with wooden shingles, microorganisms form a deep green patina that changes the wood over time: A sign of decay becomes an active design element that binds CO2 and emphasises the aesthetics of microbial processes. Dafne's Skin is a collaboration between MAEID Studio and Dalia Dranseike. It is part of the exhibition "We the Bacteria: Notes Toward Biotic Architecture" and runs until November 9.

The photosynthetic living material was created thanks to an interdisciplinary collaboration within the framework of ALIVE (Advanced Engineering with Living Materials). The ETH Zurich initiative promotes collaboration between researchers from different disciplines in order to develop new living materials for a wide range of applications.

The deep ocean can often look like a real-life snow globe. As organic particles from plant and animal matter on the surface sink downward, they combine with dust and other material to create "marine snow," a beautiful display of ocean weather that plays a crucial role in cycling carbon and other nutrients through the world's oceans.

Now, researchers from Brown University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have found surprising new insights into how particles sink in stratified fluids like oceans, where the density of the fluid changes with depth. In a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they show that the speed at which particles sink is determined not only by resistive drag forces from the fluid, but by the rate at which they can absorb salt relative to their volume.

"It basically means that smaller particles can sink faster than bigger ones," said Robert Hunt, a postdoctoral researcher in Brown's School of Engineering who led the work. "That's exactly the opposite of what you'd expect in a fluid that has uniform density."

The researchers hope the new insights could aid in understanding the ocean nutrient cycle, as well as the settling of other porous particulates including microplastics.

"We ended up with a pretty simple formula where you can plug in estimates for different parameters -- the size of the particles or speed at which the liquid density changes -- and get reasonable estimates of the sinking speed," said Daniel Harris, an associate professor of engineering at Brown who oversaw the work. "There's value in having predictive power that's readily accessible."

The study grew out of prior work by Hunt and Harris investigating neutrally buoyant particles -- those that sink to a certain depth and then stop. Hunt noticed some strange behavior that seemed to be related to the porosity of the particles.

"We were testing a theory under the assumption that these particles would remain neutrally buoyant," Hunt said. "But when we observed them, they kept sinking, which was actually kind of frustrating."

That led to a new theoretical model of how porosity -- specifically, the ability to absorb salt -- would affect the rate at which they sunk. The model predicts that the more salt a particle can absorb relative to its size, the faster it sinks. That means, somewhat counterintuitively, that small porous particles sink faster than larger ones.

To test the model, the researchers developed a way to make a linearly stratified body of water in which the density of the liquid increased gradually with depth. To do that, they fed a large tub with water sourced from two smaller tubs, one with fresh water and the other with salt water. Controllable pumps from each tub enabled them to carefully control the density profile of the larger tub.

Using 3D-printed molds, the team then created particles of varying shapes and sizes made from agar, a gelatinous material derived from seaweed. Cameras imaged individual particles as they sank.

The experiments confirmed the predictions of the model. For spherical particles, smaller ones tended to sink faster. For thinner or flatter particles, their settling speed was primarily determined by their smallest dimension. That means that elongated particles actually sink faster than spherical ones of the same volume.

The results are surprising, the researchers said, and could provide important insights into how particles settle in more complex ecological settings -- either for understanding natural carbon cycling or for engineering ways of speeding up carbon capture in large bodies of water.

"We're not trying to replicate full oceanic conditions," Harris said. "The approach in our lab is to boil things down to their simplest form and think about the fundamental physics involved in these complex phenomena. Then we can work back and forth with people measuring these things in the field to understand where these fundamentals are relevant."

Harris says he hopes to connect with oceanographers and climate scientists to see what insights these new findings might provide.

Other co-authors of the research were Roberto Camassa and Richard McLaughlin from UNC Chappel Hill. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation (DMS-1909521, DMS-1910824, DMS-2308063) and the Office of Naval Research (N00014-18-1-2490 and N00014-23-1-2478).

Colorado State University researchers have published a paper in Science that describes a new and more efficient light-based process for transforming fossil fuels into useful modern chemicals. In it, they report that their organic photoredox catalysis system is effective even at room temperatures. That advantage could lower energy demands around chemical manufacturing in a variety of instances and could also reduce associated pollution, among other benefits.

The work is led at CSU by professors Garret Miyake and Robert Paton from the Department of Chemistry and the Center for Sustainable Photoredox Catalysis (SuPRCat). Their system - inspired by photosynthesis - uses visible light to gently alter the properties of chemical compounds. It does this by exposing them to two separate photons (light particles) to generate energy needed for the desired reactions. A single photon does not normally carry enough energy for these processes, said Miyake. By combining energy from two light particles, the team's system can perform super-reducing reactions - chemical changes that require a lot of energy to break tough bonds or add electrons - easily.

Miyake said their system was tested on a group of chemical compounds called aromatic hydrocarbons - otherwise known as arenes. These compounds are usually resistant to change.

"This technology is the most efficient system currently available for reducing arenes - such as benzene in fossil fuels - for the production of chemicals needed for plastics and medicine," Miyake said. "Usually generating these reactions is difficult and energy intensive because the original bonds are so strong."

The research continues work being done through the U.S. National Science Foundation Center for Sustainable Photoredox Catalysis at CSU. Miyake is the director of that multi-institution research effort to transform chemical synthesis processes across many uses.

Katharine Covert, program director for the NSF Centers for Chemical Innovation program, which supported this research, said photoredox catalysis has become indispensable for many industries.

"Photoredox catalysis has become indispensable for pharmaceutical development and other industries," said Covert. "Through the NSF Center for Sustainable Photoredox Catalysis, synthetic and computational chemists have teamed up to understand the fundamental chemical nature of how those catalysts function and, in so doing, found a new path that requires less heat and energy."

Miyake said researchers across the center are developing catalysis systems similar to the one described in this paper to support energy efficient production of ammonia for fertilizers, the breakdown of PFAS forever chemicals, and the upcycling of plastics.

"We built an all-star team of chemists to address these challenges and make a more sustainable future for this world," Miyake said. "The world has a timeclock that is expiring, and we must meet the urgent need for developing sustainable technologies before our current ways of doing things puts us to a place that we can't recover from."

CU Boulder Professor Niels Damrauer is also an author on the paper and member of the center. Other CSU authors include Amreen Bains, Brandon Portela, Alexander Green, Anna Wolff and Ludovic Patin.

To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change, the world urgently needs clean and renewable energy sources. Hydrogen is one such clean energy source that has zero carbon content and stores much more energy by weight than gasoline. One promising method to produce hydrogen is electrochemical water-splitting, a process that uses electricity to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen. In combination with renewable energy sources, this method offers a sustainable way to produce hydrogen and can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases.

Unfortunately, large-scale production of hydrogen using this method is currently unfeasible due to the need for catalysts made from expensive rare earth metals. Consequently, researchers are exploring more affordable electrocatalysts, such as those made from diverse transition metals and compounds. Among these, transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have attracted considerable attention as catalysts for the hydrogen generating side of the process, known as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), due to their favorable properties. However, they perform poorly in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which reduces overall efficiency. Previous studies suggest that Boron (B)-doping into TMPs can enhance both HER and OER performance, but until now, making such materials has been a challenge.

In a recent breakthrough, a research team led by Professor Seunghyun Lee, including Mr. Dun Chan Cha, from the Hanyang University ERICA campus in South Korea, has developed a new type of tunable electrocatalyst using B-doped cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanosheets. Prof. Lee explains, "We have successfully developed cobalt phosphides-based nanomaterials by adjusting boron doping and phosphorus content using metal-organic frameworks. These materials have better performance and lower cost than conventional electrocatalysts, making them suitable for large-scale hydrogen production." Their study was published in the journal Small on March 19, 2025.

The researchers used an innovative strategy to create these materials, using cobalt (Co) based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). "MOFs are excellent precursors for designing and synthesizing nanomaterials with the required composition and structures," notes Mr. Cha. First, they grew Co-MOFs on nickel foam (NF). They then subjected this material to a post-synthesis modification (PSM) reaction with sodium borohydride (NaBH4), resulting in the integration of B. This was followed up by a phosphorization process using different amounts of sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2), resulting in the formation of three different samples of B-doped cobalt phosphide nanosheets (B-CoP@NC/NF).

Experiments revealed that all three samples had a large surface area and a mesoporous structure, key features that improve electrocatalytic activity. As a result, all three samples exhibited excellent OER and HER performance, with the sample made using 0.5 grams of NaH2PO2 (B-CoP0.5@NC/NF) demonstrating the best results. Interestingly, this sample exhibited overpotentials of 248 and 95 mV for OER and HER, respectively, much lower than previously reported electrocatalysts.

An alkaline electrolyzer developed using the B-CoP0.5@NC/NF electrodes showed a cell potential of just 1.59 V at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, lower than many recent electrolyzers. Additionally, at high current densities above 50 mA cm-2, it even outperformed the state-of-the-art RuO2/NF(+) and 20% Pt-C/NF(−) electrolyzer, while also demonstrating long-term stability, maintaining its performance for over 100 hours.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported these findings and clarified the role of B-doping and adjusting P content. Specifically, B-doping and optimal P content led to effective interaction with reaction intermediates, leading to exceptional electrocatalytic performance.

"Our findings offer a blueprint for designing and synthesizing next-generation high-efficiency catalysts that can drastically reduce hydrogen production costs," says Prof. Lee. "This is an important step towards making large-scale green hydrogen production a reality, which will ultimately help in reducing global carbon emissions and mitigating climate change.

A new study unexpectedly reveals that cells thrive on chaos.

Across the sciences, rules and laws help us make sense of the world around us, whether applied to cosmic scales or subatomic ones. However, in the biological world, things are a bit more complicated. That's because nature is often full of biological exceptions, and so “rules of biology” are also considered broad generalizations rather than absolute facts that explain and govern all known life. 

Some of these broad generalizations include things like Allen's Law, which dictates that body shapes in endotherms (warm-blooded animals) adapt to climatic conditions—short and stocky helps retain heat in cold climates, while tall and lanky helps dissipate heat in warmer ones. Another “law,” known as Bergmann's rule, states that species of a broadly distributed clade tend to be larger in colder climates and smaller in warmer ones (though of course, as with most biological rules, exceptions apply). 

Some two dozen or so rules currently exist that describe all kinds of processes of the natural world, and now, researchers as the University of Southern California (USC) hope to add a new rule. At first glance, this new rule—called “selectively advantageous instability,” or SAI—seems to defy the underpinning assumptions of life in general, and pushes against the current assumption that life craves stability and a conservation of resources. 

While nature does tend toward stability (it's one reason why we see so many hexagonal shapes in the wild, including honeycombs and insect eyes), USC molecular biologist John Towers argues that instability in biological components like proteins and genes can actually be helpful to cells. The study was published last week in the journal Frontiers in Aging. 

“Even the simplest cells contain proteases and nucleases and regularly degrade and replace their proteins and RNAs, indicating that SAI is essential for life,” Tower said in a press statement. “This can favor the maintenance of both a normal gene and a gene mutation in the same cell population, if the normal gene is favorable in one cell state and the gene mutation is favorable in the other cell state.”

These states allow for greater genetic diversity, which in turn can make organisms more adaptable. Many cell components also favor a short lifespan, as this actually helps promote cell health. This indicates that SAI in these components is a necessary biological function. 

Of course, there are plenty of downsides to instability. This energy-requiring process of mutation instability can introduce deleterious cells that contribute to aging, while also inducing other types of damage and dysfunction. 

“Aging has proven to be difficult to define, but most definitions include an increased chance of death with age, and decreased reproductive fitness with age,” the paper reads. “SAI can create a cost for the replicator in terms of energy and/or materials, and this cost might be interpreted in terms of promoting aging.”

Another piece of evidence supporting SAI's ubiquity and its candidacy as a new “rule of biology” is that it crops up in other well-known concepts, including chaos theory and ideas of “cellular consciousness.” Because of this—as well as its links to fundamental biological processes like aging—understanding the inner workings of SAI could help biologists explore cellular life in a whole new way.

Companies don't really need non-competes anymore. Some companies take  an extremely broad interpretation of IP confidentiality, where they consider doing any work in the industry during your lifetime an inevitable confidentiality violation. They argue it would be impossible for you to work elsewhere in this industry during your entire career without violating confidentiality with the technical and business instincts you bring to that domain. It doesn't require conscious violation on your part (they argue).So beware and read your employment agreement carefully.More here  https://www.promarket.org/2024/02/08/confidentiality-agreements-can-act-like-noncompetes/And this is the insane legal doctrine behind thishttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inevitable_disclosure

In that case you need to ask for a lifetime worth of salary, including growth from being in position to be put in escrow before you sign the dotted line. Otherwise they can hire you and fire you immediately and you'd never be able to work in your field that you spent years/decades training for.

You are required to hold confidential stuff for life, like business contracts, but you can use your know-how, if it does not violate any patents, in a competing company as you see fit. This knowledge is a part of you and cannot hold you against employment. Even if you do decide within those two years to employ yourself in competing company, this can be held back by your original company only if they give you X% of your pay at them (X can be 80, or as low as 50, as my friends inform me).

From a quick glance, the authors look only at a small (relative to the overall size of the universe) region of space and study the emission from the gas between galaxies (specifically, the WHIM [2]).
It would seem challenging to draw major conclusions based on this study - and the authors themselves conclude higher quality data of the type they are using is needed.Some context:This missing gas or "missing baryons" problem is a very old one [3].
See here [4] for a nice review (Section 4 mentions the missing baryons problem, which really is localized to the cosmologically "recent" universe - we know where the gas was when the universe was older.)
It increasingly seems like the missing baryons problem can be resolved by gas living in the WHIM between galaxies.
This recent paper [5] argues using Fast Radio Burst data that, in principle, this problem can be solved this way.[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14917[2] The charmingly named "Warm-hot intergalactic medium" - https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0007217[3] "Baryons" is cosmology jargon for ordinary matter - gas and plasma.[4] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00086[5] https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16952

You've got a friend in PC—MSI has announced a new collection of Toy Story-themed PC components, sold as a complete prebuilt PC, bringing Pixar's first family to the gaming battle station. From the graphics card to the motherboard's CMOS battery, the DIY PC is plastered in Toy Story branding and will be available only in Taiwan for a very limited time.

The MAG PANO Toy Story Edition PC bundle includes Toy Story versions of the MSI PANO 110R case, RTX 5070 Gaming Trio GPU, Z890 Gaming Plus motherboard, 850W MAG A850GL power supply, and MAG CORELIQUID AIO cooler. The bundle also includes the Intel Core Ultra 5 245K, 32GB of Kingston Fury Beast DDR5 RAM, and MSI's Spatium M450 1TB SSD to complete the PC, though these lack the Toy Story livery.

Each of the five branded components is themed around a different major Toy Story character or object from the first two movies. The Woody-themed Z890 Gaming Plus motherboard is covered in heatsinks in Woody's trademark yellow and cow-print colors, plus Lenny the binoculars hiding out on the CMOS battery. The little green aliens of Pizza Planet make their appearance on the AIO cooler, bringing green, blue, and purple RGB lighting effects to the computer.

The Buzz Lightyear RTX 5070 Gaming Trio was displayed at MSI's Computex 2025 booth, where Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang signed it. Fittingly, Buzz's GPU is powered by the PSU bearing the mark of his father, the Emperor Zurg. Dramatic irony holds that this evil emperor-branded PSU will inevitably attempt to take its revenge on the Buzz Lightyear GPU, making it a very good thing that the build uses the RTX 5070 rather than a cable-melting prone RTX 5090.

MSI's MAG PANO 110R case is the final special component in the collection, designed to resemble the claw machine from the first Toy Story film. It's unclear how clicky and/or movable the joystick on its front panel is, but the case's bright colors and four included fans are a nice consolation prize in the likely event that the joystick is non-functional.

Other goodies included with the 500-unit box set include a set of building blocks spelling out "Toy Story", joined by a set of eight small Toy Story figurines based on characters from the four films, plus an official Disney plaque with a collector's number labelled from 1 to 500 and a set of themed magnets. The PC will ship fully assembled from the factory, with a one-year full warranty over the whole system, and a two-year warranty service for each component.

The brand-new PC will run buyers NT$ 79,900 ($2,700), and is limited to 500 units. It's now available for pre-order from MSI, with the first 50 buyers receiving 2,000 free LINE Pay points, connected to Taiwan's largest payment service. MSI's website leaves the fate of the Toy Story components for individual sale very vague, hinting that more e-tailers may sell the components shortly. The FAQ also shares that the parts are "currently" only available in Taiwan, hopefully hinting at a future international release.

Data breaches are so common these days that, when a new one gets announced, most web users can do little more than yawn and mutter something like “Yeah, no shit” before scrolling up to the next story in their newsfeed. This week, however, a breach was announced that was allegedly so earth-shatteringly huge that it managed to break through the internet's wall of collective cynicism.

Dubbed the “Mother of All Data Breaches,” the breach is said to involve some 16 billion user credentials, and impact a vast number of accounts on platforms like Facebook, Google, and Apple. The breach was initially reported by Cyber News, a site that focuses on web security, and was written by the site's deputy editor and researcher, Vilius Petkauskas. The story, published Wednesday, claims that the breach represents “one of the largest data breaches in history.”

Petkauskas's article describes the discovered breach as “a plethora of supermassive datasets, housing billions upon billions of login credentials” that have been sourced from “social media and corporate platforms to VPNs and developer portals.” This data is sourced from “30 exposed datasets” that researchers say contains “tens of millions to over 3.5 billion records each.” Researchers say they were able to discover the exposed datasets due to insecure online protections, though they say the exposure was too short-lived for them to figure out who was “controlling” the data.

“This is not just a leak – it's a blueprint for mass exploitation,” said researchers interviewed by the site. “With over 16 billion login records exposed, cybercriminals now have unprecedented access to personal credentials that can be used for account takeover, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing.”

Cyber News's story was picked up by a number of mainstream outlets, including Forbes and Axios. However, no sooner had the news begun to circulate the internet than security professionals began to call the article's claims into question. According to critics, Cyber News isn't wrong per se about the number of credentials that have been exposed—and that's horrifying enough news on its own. However, some watchers maintain that this isn't a new breach (nor is it really a breach in the traditional sense), it's just data from a bunch of old breaches that have been stapled together and posted online.

“To be clear, this is not a new data breach, or a breach at all, and the websites involved were not recently compromised to steal these credentials,” writes Bleeping Computer.

Meanwhile, vx-underground, an informational website that posts about malware samples found around the web, tweeted about the story, characterizing it as a “fear mongering 16,000,000,000 password repackage password leak thingy which scared the normies and spread misinformation.”

Unfortunately, large breaches happen all the time and, due to the way that the cybercriminal underworld is structured around the sharing of stolen data, data from many of these breaches is traded and re-traded across websites. Sometimes, collectors of that information will compile very large dossiers of those breaches and post it as something new—which is what researchers are claiming happened here.

That said, Cyber News's story seems to contradict the claims being made by security researchers somewhat. It says that the data that has been uncovered is “recent” and “not merely recycled from old breaches.” The Cyber News story also now includes a disclaimer that says: “This story, based on unique Cybernews findings and originally published on the website on June 18, is constantly being updated with clarifications and additional information in response to public discourse.” Gizmodo reached out to Cyber News for comment.

The breach is still interesting for how it highlights the danger of one particular tool in the dark web cretin's toolkit, which is a malware appropriately known as the “infostealer.” The infostealer—just as it sounds—is software that, once having infected a device, will suck out login credentials that have been saved in the computer's browser. A very effective tool, cybercriminals can use the automated tools to swiftly compile large lists of personal information that can be used for compromise operations down the road.

Regardless of whether this involves freshly leaked credentials or not, it might be a good time to freshen up your logins. Hackers' jobs are getting easier by the day.

Eli Lilly's daily anti-obesity pill orforglipron appears to be as good at spurring weight loss and lowering blood sugar in diabetes patients as popular injectable GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, according to new data from a Phase 3 trial. The results were announced today at the annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Eli Lilly is the maker of the blockbuster GLP-1 drug tirzepatide, approved as Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for chronic weight management and obstructive sleep apnea. Like Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy, both of Eli Lilly's tirzepatide drugs are injected on a weekly basis. But some patients have a fear of needles or would prefer to take a pill out of convenience.

“What we see is that the efficacy, safety, and tolerability are really consistent with the very best injectable GLP-1s,” says Kenneth Custer, president of cariometabolic health at Eli Lilly, of the company's experimental pill. “We think this is a big deal.” The company plans to seek regulatory approval for orforglipron for weight management by the end of this year and for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in 2026.

The 40-week trial tested three doses of orforglipron—3 milligrams, 12 milligrams, and 36 milligrams—against a placebo in 559 patients with type 2 diabetes. All three doses were effective at lowering blood sugar, while the middle and highest doses showed clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in body weight. The highest dose of orforglipron led to an average weight loss of 7.9 percent, or 16 pounds—comparable to the amount of weight loss seen over the same period in trials of semaglutide and tirzepatide. Eli Lilly is studying the pill in a longer study in people who are overweight or have obesity to see if the weight loss continues.

In the current trial, participants took the pill once a day with no food or water restrictions. Those who were randomly assigned to orforglipron started the study at a dose of 1 milligram a day and slowly increased the dose at four-week intervals. Current GLP-1 drugs are gradually stepped up in dose as well to minimize potential side effects.

Orforglipron showed similar gastrointestinal side effects as other GLP-1 drugs, with the most common being diarrhea, nausea, indigestion, and constipation. Between 4 and 8 percent of participants across the different dosing groups dropped out because of side effects, while 1 percent in the placebo group discontinued the study.

An oral version of semaglutide, sold under the brand name Rybelsus, has been on the market since 2019 but is not approved for weight management and isn't as effective for weight loss as injectable GLP-1s. A pill specifically for obesity would give patients more treatment options and potentially make these drugs more accessible.

Pills are typically less expensive to manufacture, and they can be mass-produced more easily, making them less prone to shortage. (Injected GLP-1 drugs were in shortage until recently.) Pills can also be transported more readily. Current GLP-1 injector pens need to be shipped and stored in a refrigerator to maintain their potency. A GLP-1 pill wouldn't need sophisticated cold-chain distribution and storage, meaning it could be sold in countries that don't have that infrastructure.

“With orforglipron offering additional advantages such as the elimination of strict pre-dosing requirements, potential lower cost, and easier storage, it will be important to see whether these features lead to even greater adherence,” says Priya Jaisinghani, a diabetes and obesity medicine specialist at NYU Langone. “Like most chronic therapies, GLP-1s are most effective when used consistently, so a formulation that encourages long-term use could have a meaningful impact on patient outcomes.”

Anyone who has wrestled with a tangle of cables and chargers is familiar with the frustration all too well. Modern living means multiple devices and each one seems to have its own power source. That's why Amazon's latest deal is such a breath of fresh air: the Anker 65W three-port charger is available at an all-time low price and it's a smart buy if you're looking to simplify their power needs.

Right now, the Anker Nano II 65W three-port charger is on sale for just $29, thanks to an extra coupon that brings the price down from its original $55. That's a solid 48% off the original price and it puts this powerful charger within easy reach for most shoppers. It truly is the single charger that most people will ever need for their daily tech.

See at Amazon

The selling point of the Anker Nano II 65W is its combination of speed, versatility, and portability. At full load, a single device plugged into the main USB-C port can receive up to 65W of power—enough to fast charge a 13-inch MacBook Pro at full speed. When several devices are connected, the charger intelligently divides power between the three ports to give each device its optimal charge without throttling. That means you can charge your phone, tablet, and laptop all at the same time.

The Anker charger is about the same size as an AirPods Pro case so you can just slip it in a bag or even a pocket. In spite of the small size, it packs a heavy punch courtesy of innovative GaN II technology. This latest generation of gallium nitride (GaN) technology offers a 100% increase in operating frequency which is an innovative stacked architecture and an enhanced circuit board.

At just $29, it's an absolute bargain especially when you consider the time, space, and frustration it can save you on a daily basis.

HP laptops tend to cost over $1,000 (occasionally much more) so it's not common to come across a offer that grabs the attention. But Amazon just launched a Prime Day preview and this offer is available to everyone – not just Prime members.

The HP 2025 touchscreen laptop (i3, 2TB SSD, 64GB RAM, Windows 11 Pro, Office lifetime + 4-in-1 USB-A adapter) is an amazingly robust bit of kit that would usually send the price well beyond most individuals' budget. Currently available for only $769, this laptop comes at a whopping discount from its normal cost of $2,600. This all-time low makes it one of the most affordable high-spec laptops on the market, especially considering the generous storage and memory included.

See at Amazon

At its core is a 13th gen Intel i3-1315U processor which is capable of turboing up to 4.5GHz and features six cores and eight threads. This setup ensures smooth multitasking and efficient processing of business applications and even light gaming. The integrated Intel UHD Graphics offers smooth 4K streaming and executes graphics-intensive activities like a pro. The 15.6-inch HD touchscreen display with 1366 x 768 resolution and 250 nits brightness offers easy control and responsive use.

It has a massive which is significantly more than what most student or business laptops offer, even at much higher price ranges. This ensures that multitasking is seamless, and you can have multiple heavy-duty programs running simultaneously without lag.

Not for humans, but for devices.

X Display Company (XDC) has introduced an advanced high-speed screen that can display one million frames per second. But while they use the term 'FPS' to describe the device, this unit is by no means designed for gaming, or rather, human beings. Instead, when paired with an ultra-fast camera, the display system is designed to enable low-power, high-bandwidth machine-to-machine communication at blindingly fast speeds.

The 'display system' (or rather a TX-RX system?) is comprised of an ultrafast microLED display that acts like a transmitter and a high-frame-rate camera that acts like a receiver. The display utilizes thousands of emitters operating across multiple wavelengths, flashing structured patterns of light at a rate of up to one million frames per second. Each frame contains a chunk of digitally encoded information, though XDC does not disclose how large that chunk is. A high-speed camera, positioned to face the display, captures these frames and decodes the data, enabling real-time, cable-free communication between the transmitter and receiver. 

XDC suggests that continued development of the technology could lead to throughput at 1 Tb/s levels, which exceeds the performance of today's fastest network interfaces, but is still slower than the upcoming 1600G (1.6 Tbps) technology. 



XDC says that the system dynamically adapts to bandwidth needs and achieves two- or three-times better energy efficiency than 800G optical transceivers. This is particularly valuable in data centers, where energy use for networking and cooling represents a significant share of operational costs. However, it is unclear how much power is required to decode and encode data transmitted in this manner.

Furthermore, XDC's interconnect architecture does not need physical fiber or copper connections, which could provide much-needed flexibility and ease of maintenance for massive data centers. In addition, XDC states that its system's performance can be dynamically adjusted in real-time in terms of data transmission paths and bandwidth allocations based on current needs, which could further simplify data center operations. However, a widespread change of medium from fiber or copper to air or vacuum might require a major redesign of servers and data centers, which is a hard endeavor for the industry. 

"The capacity to dynamically transmit data at megahertz speeds through the air, holds transformative promise for cloud infrastructure," said Nikhil Jain, Director of OptoElectronics & Strategic Partnerships at X Display. "We are proud to present the world's fastest display and display-based optical links, enabling the transmission of vast data volumes through free space rather than cumbersome fiber bundles. Looking ahead, with continued innovation, terabit-per-second and beyond bandwidths are within reach — facilitating scalable, modular, and energy-efficient optical communication, and paving the way for pioneering applications such as optical computing." 

Without any doubt, XDC's technology looks promising on paper. However, it remains to be seen whether it will find use beyond niche applications or use cases in actual data centers.

When it comes to cordless stick vacuums, Dyson is the most prestigious brand on the market. Its reputation for performance, design, and innovation is unmatched and while many competitors try to copy its formula but none of them reach the same level of excellence.

The latest Dyson models like V15 Detect and Gen5detect are well over the $1,000 dollar mark which makes them an expensive investment for most homes. But the Dyson V11 Origin cordless vacuum, now priced at only $469 after a massive 18% reduction from its initial $569 tag, is a great alternative that provides almost as much cleaning ability as its latest brethren.

See at Amazon

The price cut represents an Amazon all-time low for the model and it's a perfect time for those wanting to improve their cleaning game with a high-end device. At this price point, the Dyson V11 Origin becomes cheaper than ever before but it also makes an immense amount of sense considering its latest technology and robust quality build.

The Dyson V11 Origin is engineered to handle all the floors in your home. The cordless battery feature gives the freedom from cord convenience, and the 25.2-volt motor delivers up to 60% more power than its predecessor. The vacuum has up to 60 minutes of run time and three power modes: Auto mode adjusts suction to match the surface automatically and maximizes power and battery life for general cleaning; Eco mode maximizes run time for extended use; and Boost mode provides a boost of suction for cleaning stubborn areas.

You will also love thee LCD screen included in the vacuum that displays real-time information such as power modes, maintenance alerts and runtime left to the second. The Motorbar cleaner head that comes with it is designed specifically for deep cleaning any type of floor and is built to detangle long hair and pet hair as you clean which makes it a great option for pet owners.

It can also seamlessly transform from a full-size stick vacuum to a handheld vacuum and then back again. The Hair screw tool is a specialized tool that quickly lifts long hair and pet hair whereas the anti-tangle conical brush bar simply removes hair from pet beds and other hard-to-reach places. With four Dyson-engineered attachments that come with it, you can reach high, low, and everywhere in between.

Last but not least, it features a whole-machine filtration system that traps 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns so it not only cleans up dirt and debris but also vents cleaner air back out into your home. This is very useful for people with allergies or respiratory sensitivities.

If you're looking for a Dyson vacuum without the high-end price of the newest models, this is a great deal.

This story originally appeared on Vox and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Odorless and colorless, methane is a gas that is easy to miss—but it's one of the most important contributors to global warming. It can trap up to 84 times as much heat as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, though it breaks down much faster. Measured over 100 years, its warming effect is about 30 times that of an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.

That means that over the course of decades, it takes smaller amounts of methane than carbon dioxide to heat up the planet to the same level. Nearly a third of the increase in global average temperatures since the Industrial Revolution is due to methane, and about two-thirds of those methane emissions comes from human activity like energy production and cattle farming. It's one of the biggest and fastest ways that human beings are warming the Earth.

But the flip side of that math is that cutting methane emissions is one of the most effective ways to limit climate change.

In 2021, more than 100 countries including the United States committed to reducing their methane pollution by at least 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. But some of the largest methane emitters like Russia and China still haven't signed on, and according to a new report from the International Energy Agency, global methane emissions from energy production are still rising.

Yet the tracking of exactly how much methane is reaching the atmosphere isn't as precise as it is for carbon dioxide. “Little or no measurement-based data is used to report methane emissions in most parts of the world,” according to the IEA. “This is a major issue because measured emissions tend to be higher than reported emissions.” It's also hard to trace methane to specific sources—whether from natural sources like swamps, or from human activities like fossil fuel extraction, farming, or deforestation.

Researchers are gaining a better understanding of where methane is coming from, surveilling potential sources from the ground, from the sky, and from space. It turns out a lot of methane is coming from underappreciated sources, including coal mines and small oil and gas production facilities.

The report also notes that while there are plenty of low-cost tools available to halt much of this methane from reaching the atmosphere, they're largely going unused.

The United States, the world's third largest methane-emitting country, has seen its methane emissions slowly decline over the past 30 years. However, the Trump administration is pushing for more fossil fuel development while rolling back some of the best bang-for-buck programs for mitigating climate change, which will likely lead to even more methane reaching the atmosphere if left unchecked.

Methane is the dominant component of natural gas, which provides more than a third of US energy. It's also found in oil formations. During the drilling process, it can escape wells and pipelines, but it can also leak as it's transported and at the power plants and furnaces where it's consumed.

The oil and gas industry says that methane is a salable product, so they have a built-in incentive to track it, capture it, and limit its leaks. But oil developers often flare methane, meaning burn it off, because it's not cost-effective to contain it. That burned methane forms carbon dioxide, so the overall climate impact is lower than just letting the methane go free.

And because methane is invisible and odorless, it can be difficult and expensive to monitor it and prevent it from getting out. As a result, researchers and environmental activists say the industry is likely releasing far more than official government estimates show.

Methane also seeps out from coal mines—more methane, actually, than is released during the production of natural gas, which after all is mostly methane. Ember, a clean-energy think tank, put together this great visual interactive showing how this happens.

The short version is that methane is embedded in coal deposits, and as miners dig to expose coal seams, the gas escapes, and continues to do so long after a coal mine reaches the end of its operating life. Since coal miners are focused on extracting coal, they don't often keep track of how much methane they're letting out, nor do regulators pay much attention.

According to Ember, methane emissions from coal mines could be 60 percent higher than official tallies. Abandoned coal mines are especially noxious, emitting more than abandoned oil and gas wells. Added up, methane emitted from coal mines around the world each year has the same warming effect on the climate as the total annual carbon dioxide emissions of India.

Alarmed by the gaps in the data, some nonprofits have taken it upon themselves to try to get a better picture of methane emissions at a global scale using ground-based sensors, aerial monitors, and even satellites. In 2024, the Environmental Defense Fund launched MethaneSAT, which carries instruments that can measure methane output from small, discrete sources over a wide area.

Ritesh Gautam, the lead scientist for MethaneSAT, explained that the project revealed some major overlooked methane emitters. Since launching, MethaneSAT has found that in the US, the bulk of methane emissions doesn't just come from a few big oil and gas drilling sites, but from many small wells that emit less than 100 kilograms per hour.

“Marginal wells only produce 6 to 7 percent of [oil and gas] in the US, but they disproportionately account for almost 50 percent of the US oil and gas production-related emissions,” Gautam said. “These facilities only produce less than 15 barrels of oil equivalent per day, but then there are more than half a million of these just scattered around the US.”

The good news is that many of the tools for containing methane from the energy industry are already available. “Around 70 percent of methane emissions from the fossil fuel sector could be avoided with existing technologies, often at a low cost,” according to the IEA methane report.

For the oil and gas industry, that could mean something as simple as using better fittings in pipelines to limit leaks and installing methane capture systems. And since methane is a fuel, the sale of the saved methane can offset the cost of upgrading hardware. Letting it go into the atmosphere is a waste of money and a contributor to warming.

Capturing or destroying methane from coal mines isn't so straightforward. Common techniques to separate methane from other gases require heating air, which is not exactly the safest thing to do around a coal mine—it can increase the risk of fire or explosion. But safer alternatives have been developed. “There are catalytic and other approaches available today that don't require such high temperatures,” said Robert Jackson, a professor of earth system science at Stanford University, in an email.

However, these methods to limit methane from fossil fuels are vastly underused. Only about 5 percent of active oil and gas production facilities around the world deploy systems to zero out their methane pollution. In the US, there are also millions of oil and gas wells and tens of thousands of abandoned coal mines whose operators have long since vanished, leaving no one accountable for their continued methane emissions.

“If there isn't a regulatory mandate to treat the methane, or put a price on it, many companies continue to do nothing,” Jackson said. And while recovering methane is ultimately profitable over time, the margins aren't often big enough to make the up-front investment of better pipes, monitoring equipment, or scrubbers worthwhile for them. “They want to make 10 to 15 percent on their money (at least), not save a few percent,” he added.

And rather than getting stronger, regulations on methane are poised to get weaker. The Trump administration has approved more than $119 million to help communities reclaim abandoned coal mines. However, the White House has also halted funding for plugging abandoned oil and gas wells and is limiting environmental reviews for new fossil fuel projects. Congressional Republicans are also working to undo a fee on methane emissions that was part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. With weaker incentives to track and limit methane, it's likely emissions will continue to rise in the United States. That will push the world further off course from climate goals and contribute to a hotter planet.

Gigabyte's leaking thermal gel problem still affects early adopters.

Gigabyte's leaky thermal gel problem finally hit a prominent system integrator. According to VideoCardz, PowerGPU founder and CEO Jese Martinez discovered that his Gigabyte RTX 50-Series Master GPU, which he had owned since February, had been leaking its thermal putty after he switched to an RTX 50 Founders Edition graphics card. Martinez had already warned his customers about the issue, but didn't expect the problem to impact his personal system.

Welp I got the Gigabyte gel leaking issue. I reported on this a few months back. pic.twitter.com/79POBtl3JwJune 19, 2025

The GPU maker has already addressed the thermal gel leak on its RTX 50-series and RX 9000-series GPUs, saying that the problem stemmed from "a slightly higher volume of gel" applied on only early production batches of its GPUs. "The overapplication may cause the excessive gel to appear more prominent, extended, and could potentially be separated from the designated area," it said in its press release. "While the appearance of extra gel might be concerning, this cosmetic variance does not affect the card's performance, reliability, or lifespan."

Despite this claim, users are saying that the dripping thermal gel might cause problems. One Reddit user documented the dripping, melted putty, where they shared pictures of the progress of the putty creeping until nothing was left on what seems to be their GPU's VRAM chips. If that is the case, it could potentially impact the graphics card's performance, as it no longer has a conducting material connecting the chips to its heatsink.

A few proactive gamers decided to solve the issue themselves and had the thermal gel replaced with thermal pads. Aside from reducing the risk of having the factory-applied thermal gels to zero, the procedure also improved the card's cooling, lowering VRAM temperatures by around 7C.

You likely don't need to worry about your Gigabyte GPU leaking its thermal gel if you weren't among the first to buy them, as the company has reportedly already adjusted its processes and solved the problem. But if you're concerned that your GPU's performance will be affected, Gigabyte recommends contacting your regional customer service center for support.

The new cleanup strategy won't be a one-time deal; it'll be a regular occurrence with more driver types involved in future driver sweeps.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft is tightening up security for Windows users by removing (potentially vulnerable) legacy drivers from Windows Update. A Microsoft blog post reports that the trillion-dollar giant will be removing legacy and expiring drivers that are "no longer associated with an audience in Windows Update" on a regular basis.

Microsoft's goal is to reduce security and compatibility risks, as well as improve driver quality for Windows users with its new driver cleanup strategy. The first phase of the cleanup will allegedly target legacy drivers that already have newer replacements on Windows Update. Future cleanups will target more categories of drivers that Microsoft "deems fit to be expired from Windows Update."

Expiring drivers are drivers that are no longer being offered to any system. For Microsoft, cleaning up these drivers means removing all of its audience assignments in the Hardware Development Center, preventing Windows Update from offering affected drivers to any devices.

Microsoft will provide a 6-month window for partners to provide any feedback surrounding expired drivers, and whether or not the driver should stay in the Windows Update catalog. If nothing happens, the drivers will be permanently removed for good. However, Microsoft partners will still be allowed to republish expired drivers if needed. (Though Microsoft claims it may require a "business justification" to explain why there was a need to republish an expired driver.)

Furthermore, Microsoft expects partners to review their current driver suite in its Hardware Program and proactively remove their unwanted or legacy drivers. In the future, Microsoft will allegedly prepare new publishing guidelines that will "help all Windows users keep their systems in a secure and reliable state".

Hopefully, this will improve Windows Update's reputation and improve the quality of drivers that are sent to Windows machines. Windows Update often gets accused of providing bad updates and bad drivers. Sometimes, these accusations are legitimate, where a buggy driver gets installed that wrecks the user's computer. Worse, these faulty drivers can reinstall themselves automatically, making them a nightmare to deal with if the user tries to uninstall them manually.

However, it could be a double-edged sword for older devices. Depending on how many driver updates get deprecated, older machines and older devices, say a 10-year-old printer, might lose functionality if there are no 3rd party drivers to rely on. Only time will tell if this becomes a problem.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. The detection rate of nodules has significantly increased with the implementation of health screening using low-dose spiral computed tomography (LDCT), and it is not uncommon that small and multiple pulmonary nodules are frequently detected, demanding advancements in diagnostic technologies for accurate biopsy and precise localization of pulmonary nodules. Various preoperative localization techniques for marking target pulmonary nodules have been developed, CTPLP was the most preoperative localization procedures utilized in clinical practice, including dye marking, radiotracer labeling, hook wire or micro-coil placement, ethiodized oil injection, etc. However, for patients with multiple ipsilateral nodules, CTPLP significantly increases the radiation exposures and the risk of procedure-related complications.

In recent years, ENBDM has been widely utilized and showed reliable outcomes with minimal invasion, high accuracy and few complications. However, as of yet, no literature reports the utilization of ENBDM for preoperative localization of multiple ipsilateral lung nodules.

Totally, 203 patients undergoing preoperative nodules localization were retrospectively collected (ENBDM: n=99, CTPLP: n=104). Patients characteristics were comparable between 2 groups. All patients received videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after localization in the same operative room. In term of the localization time, ENBDM group compared with CTPLP group consumed less time (8.00±4.66 vs. 22.00±8.82 min, P< 0.001). The results also showed that the number of localized nodules increases, the localization time of the ENBDM group is significantly lower than that of the CTPLP group, highlighting the efficacy of ENBDM. ENBDM also achieved comparable localization accuracy with CTPLP (94.9% vs. 97.4%, P = 0.48). Importantly, no related complications occurred in the ENB group, including pleural reaction [0 vs. 8 (7.7%), P=0.01], pneumothorax [0 vs. 36 (34.6%), P<0.001], and hemothorax [0 vs. 15 (14.4%), P<0.001].

ENBDM localization and surgical resection of nodules are performed in the integrated OR, which avoids the patient's transportation from the CT scan room to OR and simplifies the entire treatment process. For patients with multiple ipsilateral pulmonary nodules, ENBDM can achieve the similar localization accuracy as CT-guided lung puncture, with shorter localization time and no complications. ENBDM offers a safer and faster alternative to CTPLP for preoperative localization of multiple pulmonary nodules in the ipsilateral lung.

Liver fibrosis, a pathological condition in which the liver becomes stiff and scarred, commonly develops in the progression of chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Because advanced fibrosis can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer, understanding the underlying mechanisms is critical for developing effective therapies.

A research team led by Dr. Takao Seki (Assistant Professor) and Dr. Hiroyasu Nakano (Specially Appointed Professor) at the Faculty of Medicine, Toho University, has uncovered a previously unknown intercellular network that promotes liver fibrosis. Their findings highlight the critical roles of hepatic stellate cells and two key molecules: the growth factor FGF18 and the pro-fibrotic mediator osteopontin (OPN).

Under normal physiological conditions, hepatic stellate cells remain quiescent and serve to store vitamin A. However, upon liver injury, they transform into myofibroblasts that actively produce collagen and other extracellular matrix components, contributing to fibrosis. This study reveals how these stellate cells influence each other to propagate fibrotic activity.

The researchers first demonstrated that stimulation of activated hepatic stellate cells with FGF18 significantly enhances the production of OPN. They further showed that OPN acts on neighboring quiescent stellate cells to induce their activation, establishing a positive feedback loop. Interestingly, OPN does not act on already activated cells but specifically targets quiescent ones, effectively spreading fibrosis in a stepwise manner from cell to cell. Using a mouse model of liver fibrosis, the team found that OPN transmits signals via a cell surface receptor called integrin, highlighting how molecular communication; among stellate cells drives the fibrotic process.

These findings identify a novel self-amplifying intercellular communication system in liver fibrosis, mediated by FGF18 and OPN. Rather than being a consequence of a single molecule, fibrosis is shown to be a dynamic and coordinated response involving cell–cell signaling and environmental cues. This discovery offers a new perspective on the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis.

The FGF18–OPN axis is also a promising therapeutic target. Because FGF18 selectively acts on hepatic stellate cells, therapies based on this pathway may offer cell-specific interventions that avoid the broad effects of conventional liver-targeted drugs.

This research was published in the international journal iScience in June 2026. The study was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Yuichi Tsuchiya (Associate Professor, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toho University) and Dr. Minoru Tanaka (Division Chief, National Center for Global Health and Medicine Research Institute).

In a follow up investigation into the multibillion dollar drug ticagrelor, The BMJ has uncovered fresh concerns, this time in key platelet studies used in its FDA approval. 

For more than a decade, ticagrelor (Brilinta in the US and Brilique in Europe) has been recommended for patients with acute coronary syndrome - a range of conditions related to sudden reduced blood flow to the heart.

Last December, an investigation by The BMJ found serious data integrity problems in the landmark clinical trial (PLATO) that was used to gain worldwide approval for ticagrelor, calling into question the drug's advantage over cheaper rivals.

Now, as generic versions of the drug prepare to launch this year, The BMJ has expanded its investigation, looking at two key platelet studies that AstraZeneca claimed explained ticagrelor's ability to treat acute coronary syndrome successfully. 

It finds that the "primary endpoint" results (the trial's key measurement) for both clinical trials were inaccurately reported in the leading cardiology journal Circulation, and reveals that more than 60 of 282 readings from platelet machines used in the trials were not present in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) datasets.

What's more, one active trial investigator never became a study author, while one author told The BMJ he was not involved in the trial, and most investigators, including the principal investigator, were unreachable or declined to be interviewed.

Victor Serebruany, an adjunct faculty member at Johns Hopkins University and ticagrelor's most renowned critic, told The BMJ that "there are episodes of skyrocketing rebound and profound platelet inhibition after ticagrelor making patients prone to thrombosis or bleeding. If doctors had known what happened in these trials, they would never have started using ticagrelor."

Circulation and AstraZeneca did not respond to a request for comment.

It's been obvious for years that there is something wrong with the data. That the FDA's leadership could look past all these problems-on top of the many problems their own reviewers identified and are now being discovered by The BMJ-is unconscionable. We all need to know how and why that happened."

CINCINNATI — Borussia Dortmund was gifted an easy goal to start the match and held off a strong response from the Mamelodi Sundowns on a fiercely warm day to win 4-3 in the Club World Cup group stage on Saturday.

Both teams and the crowd of 14,006 at TQL Stadium sweat through high temperatures that forced a heat advisory and cooling breaks, called at the referee's discretion. 

Temperatures approached 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius).

The Sundowns opened the scoring early on an impressive break away that Lucas Ribeiro Costa finished in the 11th minute. 

Dortmund evened the score in the 16th minute when Sundowns goalie Ronwen Williams inadvertently passed to Dortmund's Felix Nmecha right in front of the net. Nmecha easily footed it in.

Dortmund stole all momentum on the play and increased its lead to 3-1 at halftime. 

Serhou Guirassy scored in the 34th minute and Jobe Bellingham in the 45th.

Khuliso Mudau's own goal on an attempt to deflect Daniel Svensson's cross in front of the net made it 4-1 in the 59th before South African Mamelodi centered itself and began putting pressure on the German club.

It wasn't enough to overcome the mistakes.

Group F: Mamelodi Sundowns 3-4 Borrusia Dortmund

Second-half own goal ensures Dortmund go top of group

Borussia Dortmund held off a spirited comeback from Mamelodi Sundowns to secure a 4-3 victory and move closer to the Club World Cup knockout stages. Dortmund were behind after 11 minutes to the South African champions at the TQL Stadium in Cincinnati but rallied to win their second game in Group F and move top of the standings with four points, one more than Sundowns.

Felix Nmecha, Serhou Guirassy and Jobe Bellingham scored for the Bundesliga club, who also profited from an own goal. Lucas Ribeiro had given Sundowns the lead while Iqraam Rayners and Lebo Mothiba scored in the second half as they looked to rally from 4-1 down in blazing hot conditions.

Ribeiro burst through a static Dortmund defence, picking up the ball on the halfway line and gliding past two opponents to score a shock opener. But the lead lasted only five minutes before a calamitous error from Sundowns goalkeeper Ronwen Williams, whose short misplaced pass to Nmecha gave him an easy tap-in for the equaliser.

Dortmund went ahead after a slick set of one-two passes between Julian Brandt and Guirassy, who powered home with his head. Bellingham, in his second appearance for Dortmund, made it 3-1 on the stroke of half-time as Williams parried Brandt's cross straight at him, and he delayed shooting for a split second before wrong-footing the goalkeeper.

Rayners struck the woodwork for Sundowns 10 minutes into the second half but on the hour mark Daniel Svensson's cross from the left took a wicked deflection off Sundowns' full-back Khuliso Mudau as Dortmund extended their lead.

Two minutes later, the South African side pulled one back as Teboho Mokoena's free-kick was floated to Rayners, who struck the foot of the post but the rebound bounced back onto his head and he did not waste the second opportunity.

Mothiba struck in the 90th minute as Sundowns stole away possession and the substitute scored from close range but they could not find an equaliser.

MIAMI (AP) — As kickoff approached it was clear — the fans weren't coming. The Club World Cup, soccer's shiny, new competition, has been billed as the event to breathe new life into the world's most popular sport.

It began a week ago in the United States, where sports stadiums of monumental capacity and steep tickets prices awaited the rowdy crowds seen at grounds across the world.

But rows and rows of empty seats inside Orlando's Inter&Co Stadium on Tuesday told another story.

“It's like playing football during lockdown,” observed one fan on social media.

For days, world governing body FIFA didn't register the attendance for the game between Mamelodi Sundowns and Ulsan HD on its official website. It took until Friday for a figure of 3,412 to be acknowledged on the site, but by rough count, there were less than 1000 fans in the stands as the game got underway.

At the other end of the spectrum, more than 80,000 watched Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain vs. Atletico Madrid at the massive Rose Bowl in Los Angeles.

The opening week for the monthlong tournament across the U.S. has seen some wildly fluctuating attendances.




The Mamelodi Sundowns and Ulsan HD game stands out as the low point so far for FIFA and its president, Gianni Infantino, who is banking on the Club World Cup becoming one of the most popular and valuable competitions in sport.

So sparse was the crowd that the word “ORLANDO” — spelled out in yellow seats on one of the main stands at Inter&Co Stadium — was almost completely unobstructed. Crowd control stewards stood by the sidelines and monitored vast areas of empty spaces in the 25,500-capacity venue.

The home of MLS team Orlando City — among the smallest stadiums chosen to host games for the tournament — was still massively oversized for the match, even with ticket prices falling to $23.

A group game between largely unheralded teams from South Africa and South Korea was never likely to be a big seller. And storms, which forced kickoff to be delayed by more than an hour, may have led to no-shows.

Still, it was an uncomfortably low turnout and one of three games in the opening week that drew less than 10,000 fans.

There were also swathes of empty seats for Chelsea's game against L.A. FC in Atlanta. It was an afternoon kickoff on a weekday, but one of the Premier League's most popular teams vs. an opponent from MLS couldn't manage to fill a third of the 71,000-capacity stadium, with 22,000 fans showing up.

“I think the environment was a bit strange. You know, the stadium was almost empty,” Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca said, and even with Lionel Messi in town for the second game in Atlanta — Inter Miami's win against Porto — the crowd was far from capacity at 31,783.

Uncertainty over ticket sales had been a point of debate in the build up to the tournament, with prices falling dramatically before the opening game between Miami and Al Ahly last Saturday. An impressive crowd of nearly 61,000 watched that game at Hard Rock Stadium, though it is not known how many paid anywhere near the $349 that tickets were being quoted at in December.

As of Tuesday, FIFA said 1.5 million tickets had been sold and more than 340,000 fans had attended the first eight games.

Infantino proudly proclaimed the Club World Cup was growing into “the undisputed pinnacle of global club football.”

Numbers in Miami have been good — nothing lower than 55,000 and topping out at a near-capacity 63,587 for Bayern Munich vs. Boca Juniors. Bayern forward Harry Kane described the atmosphere inside a stadium dominated by Boca fans as “hostile.”

Crowds have still come to Miami in a week when the Florida Panthers were playing in the Stanley Cup Final. Boca and Real Madrid fans queued up for hours in sweltering heat after arriving early for games.

The biggest crowd of the opening week was 80,619 for PSG vs. Atletico Madrid in L.A.

For context, that is just short of the 84,163 who watched the English FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium and well above the 64,327 attendance for the Champions League final — European club soccer's biggest game.

While there was not a sellout game in the opening week, 10 of the first 24 matches have seen crowds in excess of 40,000, for an average of around 36,000.

The average for the Champions League last season was just under 46,000, according to soccer data website Transfermarkt, but like-for-like comparisons are difficult, given this is a totally new format bringing club teams from around the world to the U.S.

At the 2022 men's World Cup in Qatar there was an average attendance of just under 50,000 per game for the opening week. Of the 20 games played over that period, the highest attendance was 88,103 and all but two of those games had crowds in excess of 40,000.

Focus on the Club World Cup has been intense for more than one reason.

There is still uncertainty over how much of an appetite there is among fans for another elite soccer tournament and it was unknown how many would be prepared to follow their team to the U.S. According to FIFA, the biggest take up of tickets from abroad was from Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.

Perhaps more significant is what this tournament says about the men's World Cup, which is largely being staged in the U.S. next year. The Club World Cup could be seen as a gauge of how America's interest in soccer has grown since last hosting the planet's biggest sporting event in 1994.

In that sense, it's not just about statistics, but optics as well. Which is why FIFA will hope to avoid a repeat of the scenes at Mamelodi Sundowns vs. Ulsan HD.

Livvy Dunne had an unfortunate moment at Fanatics Fest.

The former LSU gymnast and influencer was playing in a soccer-themed display at the event and accidentally kicked the ball into the FIFA World Cup trophy. The ball deflected off the trophy and into the net but also broke it.

Dunne knocked the ball off of the trophy, which is handed out every four years at the world championship event. She wasn't the only former athlete to break a trophy at the event as former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers stars Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski accidentally damaged a Lombardi Trophy.

The Fanatics event pits athletes against celebrities and fans as they test their skills. The event began on Friday and runs through Sunday at Hudson Yards in New York City.

Dunne's main event will be on Sunday where she is slated to take photos with fans and sign autographs. While breaking the trophy certainly wasn't in her plans, it did provide a comical moment in a weekend full of them.

With one Gold Cup group stage game remaining, the USMNT players know there's still so much to prove

ARLINGTON, Texas - The permutations for the U.S. men's national team's are straighforward. They've already locked in a spot in the quarterfinals of the Gold Cup, booking that in their 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia on Thursday. A win on Sunday vs Haiti would see them top the group. So, too, would a draw.

Even a narrow loss would probably be fine, given the six-goal difference standing between them and Saudi Arabia. But rest assured that Mauricio Pochettino and the USMNT won't be doing a deep dive into the mathematics of it all.

This is still a prove-it summer, and there's still so much to prove.

That continues on Sunday against Haiti in their Gold Cup group stage finale, kicking off at 7 p.m. ET in Dallas. Having built momentum with consecutive victories over Trinidad and Tobago and Saudi Arabia,  Pochettino's side will have plenty to play for on the macro level, as players continue to establish themselves with many of the team's top stars - Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, et al - not in this pool.

On the micro level, there are spots up for grabs and, after two consecutive games with the same XI, there will likely be different players looking to make their cases. Rotation backfired for Pochettino in the pre-Gold Cup friendly against Switzerland, but Haiti - which lost to Saudi Arabia 1-0 and then drew T&T 1-1 in its first two matches - doesn't present that kind of threat. 

That makes it an opportunity for some potential new starters on Sunday. 

GOAL looks at five keys for the U.S. against Haiti.

Mamelodi Sundowns will face off against Borussia Dortmund on Saturday at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati in an exciting FIFA Club World Cup matchup.

The Sundowns enter the expanded 32-team tournament as underdogs, drawn from the bottom pot. You can never count them out; this is a team known for punching above its weight and playing with flair, grit, and the kind of confidence that makes them a threat against anyone.

On the other side of the pitch, Dortmund enters the tournament as the third-highest ranked UEFA team over the past four years. With Julian Brandt pulling strings and Karim Adeyemi slicing through defenses, the Germans won't be shy about pushing forward early and often. But don't be surprised if Sundowns absorb the pressure and hit back with pace through Rayners and Costa.

Can the Brazilians of Pretoria pull off a shock in Ohio? Or will Dortmund do what they've done to so many before, dominate possession and control the match from the jump?

The moment is now. For sponsors, for investors, for fans...this is the moment to lean into women's soccer. But women's soccer is not just having a moment. It's the present and the future, on course for a meteoric rise. 

A joint report released by Nielsen and PepsiCo stated that with a predicted 38% growth in its global fan base by 2030, women's soccer has the potential to enter the top 5 sports globally, getting cozy with sports like tennis and motorsport (F1) up in the rarified air at the top. 

Women's soccer boasts a unique fan base featuring a nearly 50/50 gender split with women expecting to take over the majority at 60% by 2030.

Fans also skew young and affluent with a knack for social media, a love of entertainment, and a passion for advocacy. For brands looking to sponsor the sport, that's the dream. An audience as invested as they are in growing the sport in new and creative ways, with the tools to make it happen.

Think Gotham FC's Midge Purce making her Broadway debut in Chicago. A surprising but brilliant crossover to pull in a large fan base that shares the joy of entertainment and the financial means to experience that joy. 

Or Angel City FC gifting their fans shirts that read "Immigrant City Football Club" and "Los Angeles is for everyone/Los Ángeles es para todos," marking the club as leaders in the pursuit of social justice and change. A powerful and important statement in today's climate, and one that gets them in front of the media.

In the United States, the national team is increasingly ethnically diverse (more accurately reflecting the makeup of the country), young, and wildly successful. It's the perfect recipe for inspiring the country's youth. 

As Nielsen and PepsiCo point out in their report, if you've played the sport, you're 26% more liekly to become a fan. The more grassroots efforts, the bigger the talent pool of players at the highestt level and the larger the fan base. 

Women supporting women, large companies putting their money where their mouth is, a seismic cultural shift...I'm excited, are you excited?

Group C: Bayern Munich 2-1 Boca Juniors

Merentiel equalises for Argentinians before Olise scores late winner

Harry Kane ended the night in Miami bruised, sweat-soaked and perhaps a little weary from repeatedly picking himself up off the ground. Along the way Kane also scored one, made one and walked off with the Superior Player Of the Match laurels as Bayern Munich edged their way to a relentlessly entertaining 2-1 defeat of Boca Juniors in front of a high-energy full house.

As a result, Bayern are now though to the knockout stage of the Club World Cup. A European team has also finally beaten a South American opponent at this tournament. But defeat still leaves Boca in effect in charge of their own destiny, with the fall-guys of Auckland City to come. They basically need to win by a spectacular margin and rely on Bayern to beat Benfica.

There had been a lot of talk before this game about a night of full-contact combat in store for Bayern's attack and midfield. The central defender Lauturo Di Lollo had been asked ahead of this tournament how he planned to cope with Kane, and replied: “I'm going to kill him.” It was meant as a joke. Probably. But there was an excellent opportunity to test this from kick-off as Di Lollo started in central defence right up against his intended victim.

The opening hour was something of a controlled suffocation as Bayern kept the ball and took the lead. But Boca dragged their way back into this game, blocking shots, hurling themselves into contact and equalising in the second half, before finding ultimately that Bayern just had too much quality in the clinches.

This was a rare 9pm kick-off, a much more sensible piece of scheduling in south Florida, by which time the heat has generally transitioned from Nordic sauna on the surface of the planet Venus levels to merely very hot and humid. It felt like a proper football match from two hours before kick-off as the vast shimmering surrounds of the Hard Rock Stadium were thronged with red, blue and yellow.

This was a meeting of boisterous, alpha clubs, perhaps even distant cousins on Bavaria-La Plata continuum: domestic powerhouses, rousing music, regional meat culture. Although their only previous competitive meeting was the infamous 2001 Intercontinental Cup Final, which Bayern won 1-0. Among Boca fans that game is still remembered as the Robbery of the Century because of an allegedly dubious second yellow card awarded to Chelo Delgado.

It doesn't look like a robbery now, with the benefit of YouTube hindsight. It looks like a stunningly beautiful through pass from Juan Roman Riquelme, followed by a very obvious dive. But there is at least a reassuring universality in the reactions of football supporters to such things.

The Hard Rock Stadium was a Friday night sell-out from the start, packed to the far reaches of the upper tiers beneath the vast steel lattice roof. The ludicrous WWE-style player walk-ons once again ate up four minutes of everyone's life that they'll never get back. This must be stopped. Nobody anywhere in the world needs to hear the words “KONRAD LAIMER!” in a throaty scream across the stadium PA, while an embarrassed-looking Konrad Laimer walks out slowly across a piece of grass towards a lineup of bored-looking teammates.

Bayern kicked off with Michael Olise, Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman behind Kane, and the familiar Goretzka-Kimmich double pivot in midfield. Jonathan Tah, a new addition in central defence, also started here, aged 29 and a well-worn Bundesliga figure.

Not much happened for a while as Bayern kept the ball comfortably. And Kane opened the scoring on 18 minutes, a nice finish after a sightly heavy first touch, easing the ball into the bottom corner, off the studs of his left boot. The ball had fallen to him from a deflection off Coman as he challenged for a cross. Kane was unspectacularly in the right place.

Thomas Tuchel was watching all this from the plush Fifa seats. Kane scoring in America, late June, South American defence, full house. This felt like good optics, a vibe, something packed away.

Bayern had dominated every metric to that point, with 74% possession, 101 passes to 29, three shots and two corners to zero and zero. This has been the way Boca have played here, an attacking plan based on swift collective breaks. It involves a lot of waiting, a lot of singing in the stands while the opposition pass across the face of a low, muscular block.

Boca had their first shot, a veering drive from a free-kick by Kevin Zenon that Manuel Neuer double-fisted away in the Continental Style. And Neuer made a very good save moments later, batting away with his left hand as Zenon shot again from a similar angle.

It was a good game by now. Luis Advincula was booked for the latest in a series of conga-style hip-grabs on Coman as he spun away. Kane was taken out by Costa, left crumpled and clutching his ankle after a hip-swivelling full body block.

Boca began to emerge from their defensive crouch after half-time, although this coincided with a little extra space at the other end. Kane shot just over after good work from Gnabry. Olise, who played inside his own portable pocket of air all night, eased about radiating menace.

But it was Boca who began to wrench at the throttle. And they equalised on 67 minutes with an excellent goal from Miguel Merentiel. It came from a break close to the halfway line. A fine through pass from Alan Velasco inside Tah left Rentier with space in front of him. Tah had no chance, treading through heavy water as Merentiel sniped in on goal then lifted his finish past Neuer.

The Hard Rock Stadium erupted, the bodies tumbling in the stands, drinks thrown, scarves twirled, a vast roar barrelling from one Boca end to the other Boca end. But it was Bayern who managed to rev up through the gears again, despite the worrying sight of Jamal Musiala, a second-half sub, limping off injured once again.

With seven minutes left Olise scored the winner, shooting low into a corner after a really smart little touch from Kane, finding just enough order out of a scramble and a press of bodies to nudge the ball back into Olise's path. So Bayern can rest and tend to their bruises for the final group game against Benfica. The amateurs of Auckland will be bracing themselves for next Tuesday night at Geodis Park in Nashville, Tennessee.

President Donald Trump had some unusual guests at the White House this week: players and staff members of the Italian soccer team Juventus, in town for their opening match of the FIFA Club World Cup. After a reporter asked Trump whether his travel ban on nationals from 19 countries would affect the ongoing tournament or next year's World Cup, Trump turned to another guest in the room: FIFA President Gianni Infantino. “Gianni, tell me what the travel ban is. He doesn't know what it is,” Trump said. “He's largely sold out.”

By “sold out,” Trump was referring to the Club World Cup. In fact, ticket prices plunged in the run-up to the tournament, and thousands of seats have gone unsold. If anything, the sentiment better applies to Infantino himself, who attended the presidential inauguration, joined Trump on his trip to Qatar and more generally has palled around with the president for years. With less than a year to go before the World Cup, which the United States is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico, Trump has turned soccer into a political battleground.

Being from Los Angeles, everything we do, everything we play, everything we eat, this is a city of immigrants.”

— Angel City FC captain Ali Riley

In addition to the president's very public bromance with Infantino, Customs and Border Protection posted and then deleted a message saying its agents would be “suited and booted” for games of this year's Club World Cup. ICE told NBC Miami last week that noncitizens should carry their immigration papers with them to games. Last month, an ICE operation prompted Latino supporters of Major League Soccer club Nashville SC to suspend their gameday events, fearing raids.

But soccer has also been a hub of resistance to Trump's worst actions.

During the Nashville raids, supporters at the Nashville SC game last month unfurled banners in both English and Spanish saying, “We are not all here.” The usually rowdy supporters section for Los Angeles FC protested ICE raids in the city by staying mostly silent, holding up banners saying “immigrants are the heartbeat of Los Angeles” and “Abolish ICE.”

Over in the National Women's Soccer League, the players themselves have been vocal, as well. Last weekend, Los Angeles' team, Angel City FC, handed out shirts to fans with “Immigrant City Football Club” on the front and “Los Angeles is for everyone” in English and Spanish on the back. Players, coaches and team staff members all wore the shirts pregame.

“My mom's parents came here from China, and it wasn't easy for them. They had to find a way to make a life here. My dad is first-generation American,” Angel City captain Ali Riley said postgame. “Being from Los Angeles, everything we do, everything we play, everything we eat, this is a city of immigrants.”

In Portland, Oregon, just hours after federal officers launched tear gas and smoke bombs at people protesting ICE actions, Portland Thorns player Reilyn Turner spoke out after Sunday's game.

“I feel like family's such a big thing to look back on and play for, especially what's going on right now — people being stripped from their families,” Turner said.

While Republicans fearmonger about drag performances, NWSL teams have frequently incorporated drag into their Pride events.

Immigration is not the only issue in which where soccer has been a battleground. The Athletic reported Monday that FIFA scrapped its use of anti-racism and anti-discrimination slogans for Club World Cup events in the United States. The decision (and FIFA's rationale that it was merely staying politically neutral) echoed its ban on players' wearing rainbow items at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar because of the government's harsh anti-LGBTQ+ policies.

But U.S. teams and fans are rejecting FIFA's cowardice and are standing against racism and homophobia. MLS has designated June as its pride month every year since 2016. The NWSL has made Juneteenth a league holiday, with more than half of all clubs hosting Juneteenth theme nights at home games, and all NWSL teams observe Pride nights. 

While Republicans fearmonger about drag performances, NWSL teams have frequently incorporated drag into their Pride events. Bay FC, based in Northern California, featured a pregame performance at its Pride game this month by two San Francisco drag queens, Silvanna Danniels and Cassie Brown, both Mexican immigrants.

“My dad used to be a huge soccer fan, and I was always being pushed to play at school or at home to play soccer and I never liked it. I don't like it,” Danniels said in an interview with MSNBC. “But having the opportunity to share what I'm really passionate about in this scenario, in this environment, it's definitely like a dream come true.”

Brown said she plays soccer and that for her, she appreciated the chance to blend soccer and LGBTQ+ culture.

“I grew up with all the soccer things in Mexico, which is huge and like a very masculine thing. You have to be straight to play soccer, and there's no room for us there,” Brown said. “But we're here, we're changing that. We're fighting against that. And we have results. We have all this crowd supporting us, enjoying our shows.”

Seeing soccer crowds cheer drag queens, wave LGBTQ+ Pride flags and chant “abolish ICE” is a reminder that Americans have a space where they organize and make their voices heard. While usually that comes in the form of wearing the same jersey or rooting for the same team, the Trump administration's push to tie soccer's premier tournament to its own fortunes has pushed soccer fans and players alike to take stands for what's morally right. Trump may be politicizing the sport, but he may not like the outcome.

MIAMI GARDENS, FL – It took six days and 24 matches, but the FIFA Club World Cup finally secured its first sellout of the tournament.

A sea of singing and chanting fans clad in the yellow and blue of Argentine club Boca Juniors serenaded Hard Rock Stadium, while fans of German giants Bayern Munich, wearing red, were scattered among them on Friday night.

The official number: 63,587.  

They got to see the first win by a European club against a South American side in the Club World Cup, too.

Michael Olise broke a deadlock in the 84th minute, English captain Harry Kane also scored (18') and Bayern beat Boca Juniors 2-1.

European soccer fans will wake up Saturday morning breathing a sigh of relief seeing the scoreline. CONMEBOL teams had won six matches with three draws and zero losses against UEFA clubs before the Bayern-Boca match.

“There's still a long way to go, of course,” Kane said after the victory, which pushed Bayern through to the knockout stage. “But I think people looking at us will definitely put us as one of the favorites for the thing this week.”

Bayern leads Group C with six points. Portuguese side Benfica is second with four points. Boca is in third with one point, while Auckland City (New Zealand) will be eliminated with zero points through two matches.

All four clubs play their final group-stage match Tuesday at 3 p.m. ET: Boca will meet Auckland in Nashville, while Bayern will face Benfica in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Boca's Miguel Merentiel tied the match with a breakaway goal in the 66th minute, nearly stealing another result for the South Americans.

The biggest Club World Cup wins against the Europeans were by Brazilian teams. Flamengo beat Chelsea 3-1 in Philadelphia earlier Friday, while the biggest upset was Copa Libertadores winners Botafogo edging Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 in Los Angeles on Thursday.

Lionel Messi and Inter Miami scored the first victory for a North American club against a European side when they beat Portugal's FC Porto 2-1 on Thursday in Atlanta. Al-Hilal also became the first Arab and Asian team to score a point against a European side, when they drew 1-1 with Real Madrid in Miami on Wednesday.

“I think it's great to experience different teams,” Kane said. “I think you've seen in this tournament already, the South American teams, especially, have caused big problems for some of the European teams. It shows how big football is worldwide, and how good some of these players are. I'm loving this tournament so far, and hopefully, we're going to be here for a while.”

Hard Rock Stadium has hosted three of the top four attended Club World Cup matches. The Real Madrid match with Al-Hilal drew 62,415 fans. The tournament opener between Messi's Inter Miami and Egyptian club Al Ahly drew 60,927 fans last Saturday.

The most attended Club World Cup match was Paris Saint-Germain's 4-0 win against Atlético de Madrid at the Rose Bowl Stadium near Los Angeles.

FIFA said in a press release Thursday the first round of the group stage in the tournament (16 matches) yielded 556,369 fans.

FIFA has been criticized for empty seats at Club World Cup matches during the first week of the tournament. There's been debate over whether NFL-sized stadiums were the right choice for games instead of soccer-specific venues with lesser capacities.

Choosing Hard Rock Stadium instead of Inter Miami's Chase Stadium led to 114,412 more fans during the first three games held at the home of the NFL's Miami Dolphins. Three matches at the Rose Bowl near Los Angeles led to 108,629 more fans, than if matches were held at Los Angeles FC's BMO Stadium, FIFA shared with USA TODAY Sports.

It's also a stress test for the venues World Cup matches will be played at next year. Hard Rock Stadium, Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field, Seattle's Lumen Field and MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, are hosting Club World Cup and World Cup matches. SoFi Stadium – home to the NFL's Los Angeles Rams and Chargers – will host World Cup games instead of the Rose Bowl.

The best crowd by far in the tournament have been the Boca Juniors fans, who transformed Hard Rock Stadium into their beloved “La Bombonera” venue in Buenos Aires for two matches this week. They drew 2-2 with Benfica last Monday.

“I'm grateful to all the people who came here to Miami, the United States, who made a huge trip to be with us,” Boca goalkeeper Agustín Marchesín said after the loss. “They always make you feel it on every pitch, and it proves once again that this is the greatest team in Argentina, without a doubt.”

Added Kane: “I love playing in front of these fans. One of the best in my career, for sure. Credit to them, credit to the Bayern fans. The Bayern fans tried to help us as much as possible, but it was hard with all the Boca fans there. So, credit to them. They made it a special night. Of course, they're not going to go home happy, but I think they saw a great game.”

...

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — European soccer's superiority had, throughout the 21st century, become self-evident; inescapable and irreversible; extreme and presumed. It was apparent in the salaries and prices of players, in the exodus of talent from the Americas and Africa, in the prestige of the UEFA Champions League and, twice per year, on the field. At the former Club World Cup, the seven-team version played each winter, since 2007, European teams played 34 games. They lost once.

So they strolled into this expanded version, the 2025 Club World Cup, as heavy favorites. They negotiated outsize appearance fees. Their supporters assumed they'd waltz to the latter stages, untouched.

Instead, halfway through the group stage, they've been humbled.

In six games so far against South American opposition, they've lost two, drawn three, won one (finally, on Friday, thanks to Bayern Munich).

They have also dropped seven points to the Saudi Pro League, MLS and Liga MX.

Their early stumbles have delighted fans from other continents. They've surprised Western pundits. And they've ignited provocative debate around a simple question: Is the supposed supremacy of European clubs a myth?

On one side, there are the raw results and the performances here over the past week. Flamengo didn't just beat Chelsea 3-1 on Friday in Philadelphia; at times, it pummeled the free-spending English Premier League giants. And Fluminense — Brazil's 13th best team last year — didn't just hold Borussia Dortmund to a 0-0 draw; it outplayed what was, a month ago, the hottest team in Germany.

In almost every single match between South American and European foes, there was evidence that the gap is slimmer than most Europeans (and non-Hispanic Americans) realize. Botafogo's upset of PSG was a so-called “smash-and-grab,” but even smash-and-grabs require a certain level of physical, technical and tactical quality. Boca Juniors, similarly, bellied up to Bayern Munich on Friday and snatched a second-half equalizer, before conceding late. It was a “really tough game,” Bayern's Harry Kane said postgame.

There was also Monterrey 1, Inter Milan 1; and Al Hilal 1, Real Madrid 1, “a very balanced match,” as Al Hilal fullback João Cancelo said afterward.

On paper, per Opta, these were games between the 9th best team in the world and the 81st; between No. 15 and No. 238; No. 4 and 132; No. 7 and 131; No. 6 and 130; No. 8 and 77. On the field, though, they looked very different, and begged the question: Is Opta wrong?

Are the assumptions of European preeminence wrong?

Were we all wrong?

For four-and-a-half decades, after all, from 1960 until 2004, when the champions of South America and Europe met in the now-defunct Intercontinental Cup, the South Americans won 22; the Europeans won 21. Europe's subsequent commercialization of the sport has seemingly shifted the balance of power, or at least wealth, but … perhaps the on-field gap never really widened?

At this new-look Club World Cup, which everyone agrees is a better indicator than the old one, “the South American teams have caused big problems for some of the European teams,” Kane said, and perhaps the explanation is simple. As Kane's teammate, Konrad Laimer, said: “Because they are good teams, too. Football is football.”

On the other side of the debate, however, there are excuses — or at least other explanations, some legitimate.

There is the timing of this tournament, which falls at the end of 10-month European seasons, but mid-campaign for clubs from Brazil, Argentina and MLS. Whereas South American teams built up to the Club World Cup, weary European bodies and minds were ready to wind down. Most got a couple weeks off before reconvening with teammates 7-10 days before their Club World Cup openers, or after an international window. “There are many tournaments that they've had to play, and perhaps they'll arrive with some fatigue,” Inter Miami forward Luis Suarez predicted before the competition began. “I think there will be some surprise results.”

There is also the suffocating U.S. summer heat, which has seemed to affect European teams more than others.

“We are used to the heat,” Al Hilal's Brazilian winger Malcom said after his team hung with Real Madrid on a humid 90-degree afternoon in suburban Miami. Atlético Madrid's Spanish midfielder Marcos Llorente, on the other hand, called an 88-degree afternoon in Southern California “impossible.”

There is travel to which the Europeans aren't accustomed. There are distant time zones, and games that kick off after all their friends and family back home are asleep. There are all sorts of confounding variables that preclude the Club World Cup from being an accurate point of comparison.

And most of all, there is the unavoidable sense, or narrative, that the European teams just don't really care.

Many players do, to be clear. But do they care, with every last ounce of their being, like some of their South American counterparts do?

There has undoubtedly been an intensity gap that has neutralized the quality gap, and helped some South American sides show well. To them, these games are among the most significant in recent club history. To the Europeans, the Champions League and, in some cases, their domestic leagues were and are more prestigious.

Public attitudes toward the Club World Cup have also colored this excuse. While European fans have stayed home, and in some cases slept through games, supporters of South American and North African clubs have filled stadiums with balloons, flags, banners and unceasing noise.

“We've all been a part of big moments; this is still something totally different,” Bayern head coach Vincent Kompany said Friday after experiencing the locura of Boca fans.

Kane confirmed: “It felt like an away game out there.”

That, too, is an equalizing factor.

None of that entirely explains the upsets. But there is nuance in the conclusion that the gap between Europe and the rest of the world is somewhat narrower than many thought — because there are also gaps within Europe and within that other broad category.

There is a massive gulf, for example, between Bayern Munich, which ultimately outclassed Boca here on Friday night; and Porto, which finished third in the Portuguese Primeira Liga, closer to fourth-place Braga than to the top two.

There is also a sizable gulf between Palmeiras or Flamengo, the two most powerful teams in South America's richest league, and most of the other non-European challengers at this Club World Cup.

What we probably overestimated was the distance between the Portos and the Inter Miamis; between the Dortmunds and the Fluminenses; between the Benficas and Bocas; between the Chelseas and the Flamengos. Most of the teams Porto and Benfica play, weekend after weekend, are probably worse than the best of MLS — and certainly worse than Boca, River Plate and much of the Brasileirão. Some of the Brasileirão, and certainly the top two, meanwhile, could compete with the top halves of the top flights in Germany, Italy, Spain and France. They have enough money, enough intelligence, enough homegrown talent.

There is still, though, a distance to the tippy-top.

“There is an elite in football that is superior,” Flamengo coach Filipe Luis, who played for Atlético Madrid and Chelsea, admitted Friday. “Brazilian clubs are competitive at the second level of European football. Flamengo will not devalue themselves against any opponent. But the squads of the elite are better. That's a fact.”

What we underestimated, though, was how streetwise grit and pure desire and all the aforementioned variables could close the gap between those squads for 90 minutes. We underestimated how much a $100 million squad could trouble a $1 billion squad when it plays as an impassioned unit that's “really emotional in some situations,” as Laimer said of Boca.

South American teams have bumped and bruised and disrupted the sometimes-coddled Europeans here in Miami and Los Angeles, in New Jersey and Philly. They haven't proven that they are better, but that they're good enough to be better on a given day.

“They play at a high level,” Kane said. “They [also] play maybe a different style, they make it more of a battle, they have different tactics that make it hostile and difficult.”

Emma Raducanu took a trip down to Queen's Club on Saturday to watch her US Open mixed doubles partner Carlos Alcaraz.

The British No1 withdrew from the Berlin Open this week as she continues to manage back pain after a spasm. She is due to compete in Eastbourne next week but before that was spotted on the Queen's Club balcony with Myah Petchey, the daughter of her coach Mark, watching her friend Alcaraz beat fellow Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-4 to reach the HSBC Championships final.

Earlier this week, the US Open revealed the partnerships for their revamp, $1million mixed doubles event in 2025. Among the more eye-catching pairings was one featuring two former US Open singles champions.

'I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma,' said Alcaraz earlier this week. ‘I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. Yeah, I made that special request.'

'She took a while (to respond),' he joked. 'No, not that much, not that much.

'But obviously she had to ask, and she had to think a little bit. But it wasn't a minute, so...'

'She's going to be the boss,' the 22-year-old grinned after being asked how the pairing would work in practice.

'The US Open came to us and gave us the opportunities to play mixed doubles. I'm super excited about it. I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament.

'I've known Emma since a really long time ago, so we know each other. I have a really good relationship with her. So it's just going to be interesting.

'We are going to enjoy it for sure. I will try to put my doubles skill on it. We will try to win. But obviously, it's going to be really, really fun.'

Raducanu has been drawn to face American Ann Li in the first round at Eastbourne, with a possible second-round clash with two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur.

Jack Draper was looking to advance to his third final of the year, on a third unique surface.

In March, Draper won his first career Masters 1000 title on the hard courts at Indian Wells, taking down Denmark's Holger Rune in the final.

Two months later, the British star made a breakthrough on the clay, when Draper qualified for the Madrid Open final, narrowly coming up short against Casper Ruud in three sets.

Looking to complete the set and reach a grass-court ATP final, Draper took on Czechia's Jiri Lehecka in the Queen's semi-finals.

Unfortunately, it wasn't to be as Lehecka beat Draper  6-4, 4-6, 7-5, to book his place in Sunday's final.

Reacting to Draper's defeat, Queen's tournament director Jamie Murray gave his verdict on the Brit's Wimbledon chances.

Talking to Claire Balding on BBC Sport after the match, Murray suggested whether the defeat would affect Draper's chances of winning Wimbledon.

“There's absolutely no reason to stress or panic about what might happen at Wimbledon,” he said.

“I'm sure when he looks back on it tomorrow, next couple of days, he will be happy he came here, played four matches, had a lot of battles.

“There were no easy matches for him, which bodes well for him going into the tournament.

Not only does Murray think there's no reason to panic, but he still considers Draper to be one of the favorites for the title.

“He's got so much good in him; he's having an amazing year. We're really hoping he's going to have a great Wimbledon,” he said.

“He will be absolutely one of the favorites behind [Jannik] Sinner and [Carlos] Alcaraz heading into that tournament.

Reaching the Queen's semi-finals, Draper guaranteed himself a top-four seeding at Wimbledon.

The Brit will now avoid playing the likes of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz until the last four at the All England Club.

Keen to play down the top-four seeding after winning his quarterfinal match on Friday, Draper chose not to get ahead of himself.

“I keep being asked by journalists about the top four seeding. It's like, well, I have got to get to the semis first,” said Draper

“I mean, that's not guaranteed.”

Draper will now rest up ahead of Wimbledon, a tournament one ex-British star thinks he will tackle with ‘a lot of confidence'.

1977 Australian Open finalist John Lloyd weighed in with his thoughts on Draper's performance against Lehecka, highlighting the shot that let him down.

“It's difficult to be critical of him, the first few rounds he wasn't playing at his best, but he was getting through it,” said Lloyd.

“On big occasions, he came up with big shots, which is what the great players do.

“Today, his serve just disappeared a little bit during the crucial periods, and at this level, if you're playing someone who's playing as well as Lehecka, you can be in trouble, but it can happen to anybody.” 

On the other hand, Lloyd praised Draper for using the crowd to great effect in London.

“He gets so fired up, I love the fact that he embraces the crowds up here, when he's in trouble, he gets aggressive, he's not afraid of anything these days,” he said.

“He's improved his all-around game; he's such a good competitor now. This match could have gone either way.

“He will take a lot of confidence going into Wimbledon the way he's playing.”

There's no question that Draper will have the crowd on side once more when he makes his fourth Wimbledon appearance later this month.

He has yet to reach the third round at Wimbledon, statistically his worst-performing Grand Slam event.

Draper will certainly be hoping to make a deep run this time around, heading to SW19 as the number four seed.

The 2025 Wimbledon tournament is scheduled to begin on Monday, June 30.

Kei Nishikori has apologized to his wife and children after his long-running affair with a model was exposed.

The tennis star, who pulled out of the recent French Open, won by Carlos Alcaraz in a thrilling final against Jannik Sinner, and is also set to miss Wimbledon, is alleged to have been having a lengthy affair with model Azuki Oguchi, with their relationship having been recently reported on by Japanese tabloid Shukan Bunshun.

In response to the allegations, Nishikori, a U.S. Open finalist back in 2014, issued a statement to the newspaper, confirming he had cheated on his wife, Mai Yamauchi, whom he married in 2020. The 35-year-old, who climbed as high as fourth in the world back in 2015, said: "I deeply apologize for causing discomfort to everyone who supports me: tennis fans, associations, sponsors, and other related parties, and for their concern and inconvenience due to my dishonest behavior."

"Additionally, I deeply regret making my wife and children feel hurt.

He continued: "Moving forward, in order to fulfill my role as a responsible member of society, I will focus solely on tennis competitions and achieving results.

"We will do everything possible to regain their trust."

Nishikori, who has two children with Yamauchi, was pictured visiting Oguchi's apartment recently, with photos published by Shukan Bunshun also showing them leaving the building together.

The pair reportedly met back in 2022 in Hawaii, with it further alleged Oguchi's then-boyfriend confronted her about her relationship with the tennis star in 2023.

While their relationship ended in 2023, they later resumed it in 2024, with Nishikori reportedly telling Oguchi he no longer loved his wife, and that they were only together for their two children.

The first Asian player to reach a Grand Slam final, the 2014 U.S. Open he lost to Marin Cilic, Nishikori was forced into pulling out of the French Open earlier this month due to injury.

He will also miss Wimbledon too, which is set to get underway at the end of June. Nishikori is currently ranked 66th in the world, with his most recent showing him have to retire against Karen Khachanov during the Geneva Open last month.

While Nishikori lost the first set 7-5 to Khachanov, he led the second 5-2. However, he was forced to retire from the event, which led to him pulling out of the French Open, and now Wimbledon.

The restructuring of the mixed doubles tournament ahead of the 2025 US Open has caused quite the stir.

In 2024, 32 teams battled it out for the mixed doubles title at the US Open, as the Italian pair of Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori emerged victorious.

Earlier this year, the US Open announced a change to the mixed doubles tournament, cutting the field from 32 to 16 teams, holding the event over two days during fan week.

The move is designed to increase viewership for a discipline that receives little attention when the singles stars are in action.

A whole host of top ten stars on the ATP and WTA Tours will compete in the revamped US Open mixed doubles event, including Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz, and Aryna Sabalenka.

Some have criticised the changes, arguing that mixed doubles players will miss out on revenue and a chance to compete in New York.

Reacting to those criticisms, former world number one Andy Roddick has shared his thoughts.

Roddick has previously expressed his support for the change to the mixed doubles tournament, as he now gives his verdict on the line-up.

“This entry list, I thought it would be fine, I thought we'd have some cool names and some cool matchups, this is a 12/10 with the people who are going to do this,” he said.

“Don't argue with me about what mixed doubles should be if you don't get excited about this.”

Nine top ten ATP players and nine top ten WTA players will participate in the tournament later this summer, with Coco Gauff and Holger Rune the two notable omissions.

The American addressed concerns over the mixed doubles players who will essentially be replaced by singles stars in 2025.

“People were like we had to grow the game of doubles, so we can't take that away from the doubles that people don't watch regularly… that was confusing to me,” said Roddick.

“Now, you get nine of the top ten on each side, biggest stars on earth, and then some. This is going to bring more eyeballs to the game of doubles.

“Now, is it taking jobs away from doubles players who kind of run this side tour? Yeah, it is.

“But, if your net, net, most important thing is, which is the defence that I get when people are mad at me when I talk about doubles is, ‘we have to grow the game of doubles', there is not a better way to grow the game of doubles than to have the biggest stars on earth playing doubles, featured, ESPN prime time, in the lead-up to the US Open.”

The 2025 US Open mixed doubles tournament is scheduled to take place on August 19 and 20, before the singles event kicks off on August 24.

Excited for the tournament, Roddick compared the event to ‘All-Star' games seen in the NBA and MLB.

“I had also never figured out how we would integrate an All-Star game style of thing in tennis, this two-birds-one-stone's it, this is the All-Star game for tennis,” he said.

“It's one less revenue stream for the doubles players that need the revenue stream, but don't create any of the revenue. The argument against it is, I like my doubles players siloed into this offset tour, rather than, let's blow this out, make tennis popular with kids that are nine years old who are watching this, it's easily digestible, it's short.

“The impact on tennis, having this level of stardom all in one place at one time, men, women, playing together [is massive].” 

It remains to be seen how the new event will be received, but it will certainly be worth tuning in for.

World No.1  Aryna Sabalenka has claimed that Grigor Dmitrov was “begging” her to play mixed doubles with him at the US Open this year. The category has been revamped for the tournament at Flushing Meadows and will take place during the same week as singles qualifying.

That has freed up many of the game's top stars to participate. Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz have already confirmed they will form an exciting partnership, while Jannik Sinner will play alongside Emma Navarro. Novak Djokovic has also entered with compatriot Olga Danilovic.

However, it seems Sabalenka needed plenty of persuasion to join forces with Dmitrov, 34. Speaking at the Berlin Open, where she was beaten in the semi-final by Marketa Vondrousova, the Belarusian revealed how their partnership came about.

"He was texting me, non-stop, begging me to play,” she joked. “I was like, ‘Man, I don't want to play.' But he was begging and I was like, ‘Ok, you got it'.”

However, the 27-year-old also conceded that she was oblivious to the new format when she first received the request. Once she was explained, she agreed in February to team up with the Bulgarian, and the pair are now set to be one of the most high-profile teams involved.

“I didn't really know about the mixed doubles situation at the US Open,” she added. “I was like, ‘What are you talking about? Why would we play mixed doubles?'

“He was explaining how it was before the US Open. But no one approached me, so I didn't know if I was invited. We decided probably straight after the Australian Open.”

The top eight teams will be seeded based on singles rankings. The remaining eight teams will be awarded wildcard entries, with the revolutionary format having divided opinion among fans and pundits so far.

Jiri Lehecka reached his first grass-court final Saturday at the HSBC Championships, where he put an end to British No. 1 Jack Draper's quest on home soil.

The 23-year-old Lehecka weathered a passionate west London crowd and an inspired fightback from Draper to triumph 6-4, 4-6, 7-5. After dropping his first set of the week at the ATP 500 at Queen's Club, Lehecka dug into a nervy deciding-set tussle before powering into the fifth and biggest final of his career.

“It means a lot, you don't beat a player like Jack every day,” said Lehecka. “I want to say thanks to [the crowd] for making it fair. I know your favourite didn't win today, but I really appreciate you being fair and clapping when I hit a few good [shots].”

With his two-hour, seven-minute victory, Lehecka is the first Czech man to reach a tour-level final on grass since Tomas Berdych at Wimbledon in 2010. He faces top seed and former Queen's champion Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday's final.

The second-seeded Draper was aiming to join record five-time champion Andy Murray as the only British male singles winners at the event, but he was unable to draw on his explosive arsenal. The 23-year-old will, however, return to a career-high No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday, having secured a Top 4 seeding at Wimbledon.

“I've really felt the home support all week, it's a real advantage and it helps drive me on,” said Draper. “But at the same time, I've got a job to do and I'm not thinking about pressures like that. I'm going to go into Wimbledon feeling great about myself, and I'll go in at a position I've been dreaming of since I was a little kid.”

With famous rockstar and tennis enthusiast Jon Bon Jovi watching on, Lehecka produced a lights-out opener on Andy Murray Arena, during which he dropped just two of 16 first-serve points and did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats.
Roared on by the British crowd, however, Draper raised his level across the next two sets. Yet Lehecka regrouped with the consistent form that he has displayed all week to record his second Top 10 win of the season and level his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Draper at 2-2.

Lehecka, who earned his 100th tour-level victory by defeating Briton Jacob Fearnley in the quarter-finals, missed last year's grass swing due to a back injury. Yet the Czech has done nothing but emphasise his potential on the surface since returning this year.
After reaching the quarter-finals in Stuttgart last week, Lehecka became the only semi-finalist at Queen's not to have dropped a set en route. By seeing off Draper and advancing to the championship match in the British capital, he also claimed his second Top 10 win of the season after stunning Alcaraz in Doha in February.
The two-time ATP Tour champion, Lehecka is up five spots to No. 25 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, just three spots from his career high.

Marketa Vondrousova defeated top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka in the Berlin Tennis Open semifinals on Saturday, reaching her first final since she won the 2023 Wimbledon championship. She will face first-time singles finalist Wang Xinyu for the title.

Marketa Vondrousova has recovered some grass-court magic at Berlin Tennis Open by HYLO.

Vondrousova, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, defeated World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka 6-2, 6-4 in their semifinal meeting at Berlin on Saturday. The Czech Vondrousova needed 1 hour and 21 minutes to level their head-to-head at four wins apiece.

Berlin: Draws | Scores | Order of play

"I didn't play for a long time," said Vondrousova, who missed three months of the season due to a shoulder injury. "I'm just happy to be back healthy, and so grateful to play these matches.

"When I saw the field here, I was like, ‘OK, let's just try to win the first round,' and then, you know, now this is happening."

Vondrousova is into her first final since she won the Wimbledon title nearly two years ago. Her opponent on Sunday will be a fellow unseeded player: Chinese qualifier Wang Xinyu.

In the later semifinal, Wang took down 2021 Berlin champion Liudmila Samsonova 6-4, 6-1 to make her first WTA singles final. It will be the first meeting between Vondrousova and Wang.

Top win: Despite her previous successes against Sabalenka, this is the first time Vondrousova has beaten her while Sabalenka was ranked World No. 1 in the PIF WTA Rankings. In fact, it is the Czech's first career win over any reigning World No. 1.

Vondrousova had previously been 0-3 against players who were ranked No. 1 at the time of their meetings. She had lost to Ashleigh Barty at 2020 Adelaide, and fell to Iga Swiatek at both 2023 Cincinnati and 2024 Roland Garros.

Another grass-court stunner: Vondrousova had only won two tour-level matches on grass at the start of the 2023 season, but that did not stop her from peaking at that year's Wimbledon, where she carved her way to the title ranked World No. 42.

Vondrousova has struggled with injuries throughout her career, and after her latest shoulder woes, she started Berlin ranked No. 164. But this week, the Czech once again summoned her best on grass.

Match moments: Sabalenka came into Saturday's showdown 7-0 in semifinals this year, but Vondrousova was prepared to upend that stat. Taking returns early, Vondrousova raced through the opening set without losing serve.

Sabalenka found a backhand winner off of a drop shot to take an quick 2-0 lead in the second set, but Vondrousova broke back at love straight away. The Czech then found some incredible forehand winners to break for 5-4.

Serving for the match, Vondrousova quickly fell behind 0-40 and it appeared a twist was in store. But the left-hander regrouped and battled all the way back, closing out the win with her fourth ace of the day.

Vondrousova becomes the lowest-ranked Berlin finalist this decade, since the event returned to the WTA calendar as a grass-court stop in 2021. She surpasses Samsonova, who won this title as a 106th-ranked qualifier in 2021.

Berlin breakthrough for Wang: Later on Saturday, World No. 49 Wang posted the biggest singles result of her career by toppling Samsonova to make her maiden singles final on tour.

"This week has been a dream for me," Wang told Andrea Petkovic on court. "I've been playing unbelievable tennis here. I don't know, it's something with Berlin, I guess!

"Coming into this match here, coming into every match, I wasn't expecting anything, you know. For me, it was really just to enjoy the stage."

Wang is a Grand Slam doubles champion (2023 Roland Garros with Hsieh Su-wei) and also won the Berlin doubles title last year (with Zheng Saisai), but she had gone 0-6 in her first six Hologic WTA Tour singles semifinals.

That all changed when Wang dismissed Samsonova in 76 minutes for her fourth straight Top 20 win this week. Wang beat Daria Kasatkina in the first round and Roland Garros champion Coco Gauff in the second round, then advanced past injured Paula Badosa in the quarterfinals.

Marketa Vondrousova defeated top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka in the Berlin Tennis Open semifinals on Saturday, reaching her first final since she won the 2023 Wimbledon championship. She will face first-time singles finalist Wang Xinyu for the title.

There wasn't much that worked in Holger Rune's favor in the quarter-final of the Queen's tournament in London, which serves a s a warm-up tournament for Wimbledon which which starts 30 June. 

The 22-year-old Dane lost 2-1 in sets (7-6, 6-7, 6-2) to Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut and never even had a single chance to break the Spaniard's serve during the game. 

A frustrated Rune therefore sought advice and guidance from his box, where Lars Christensen sat without an answer on a thoroughly bad day at the office for the Danish tennis star.

"What's wrong with my forehand?, asked Holger Rune

"It's okay", Lars Christensen replied back.

"No, it's not okay. I have made five unforced errors. What is it?"

"I don't know", Holger.

"Okay, so what are you here for?", asked Rune annoyed.

Rune also vented his frustration at Lars Christensen with the words: "It's not about you, its about me. Give me something, man", said Rune

Towards the end of the match, Lars Christensen left the box.

Rune has had a host of coaches throughout his career with Lars Christensen, Patrick Mouratoglou, Kenneth Carlsen, Boris Becker and Severin Lüthi having had the responsibility of coaching the Dane at different times of his career. 

Lars Christensen has a reputation of being an extremely calm coach but it seems clear that during times, when Rune seems to be struggling mentally, the Danish star needs somebody to pump him up, bring advice and someone who is a little bit more proactive from the box.

Rune will now see if he can get the balance right at Wimbledon, which will be the next big challenge for him in a week's time.

Jannik Sinner came up short in his maiden French Open final earlier this month.

It wasn't to be for the world number one in Paris, as Sinner lost to Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final.

The Italian led by two sets to love and failed to convert multiple championship points, before Alcaraz fought back to win 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6.

Losing the longest final in French Open history, it's hard to imagine Sinner won't have looked back at the match, thinking about what he could have done better.

Two weeks on, Toni Nadal has said what he thinks Sinner's coaching team should have shouted at him during the final.

During an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport, Nadal suggested what Sinner's team could have done differently in Paris.

“It was a very tough defeat. Jannik [Sinner] lacked a bit of calm in the most important moment. Maybe his box should have told him ‘Calm down!” he said.

“There was tension, Jannik was one step away from winning his fourth Slam, equalling Carlos [Alcaraz], and if in a situation like this you have three match points at 5-3 on clay, where the serve is less decisive and you can't close out, then yes, it can hurt a lot.”

Sinner had three championship points during the fourth set on Alcaraz's serve when the Spaniard went down 0-40.

A long forehand from Sinner saw Alcaraz save the first championship point, before a backhand unforced error returning the Spaniard's second serve, closed the gap to 30-40.

It was there that Sinner had his best chance to close out the match, taking control of the point with a great return.

Pushing Alcaraz into the corner, the 22-year-old did well to keep the ball alive, before Sinner made a devastating error, hitting a forehand into the net.

Three championship points had come and gone, as Alcaraz went on to win the title a few hours later.

Perhaps if Sinner had been told to ‘calm down' by the likes of Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi during those crucial moments, things may have been different.

The reality is we will never know, as Sinner now looks to push the defeat to the back of his mind and focus on the next Grand Slam event, Wimbledon.

Looking to bounce back, Sinner travelled to Germany for the Halle Open, a tournament he won in 2024.

Winning his opening match against Yannick Hanfmann, Sinner set up an intriguing second-round tie with Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik.

Suffering a shock defeat, Sinner lost to Bublik in three sets 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, putting an end to his title defence.

Sinner will now head to Wimbledon with a 1-1 record on grass, far from the ideal preparations he would have hoped for.

Nadal was asked whether he thinks Sinner was affected by his French Open final defeat when playing Bublik in Halle.

“I don't think so. It was a different situation, a different surface, a different player,” he said.

“Maybe Sinner still lacks a bit of consistency after the break, but let's not forget that he has reached two finals, a Masters 1000 and a Slam since he came back.

“I don't think this defeat on grass will undermine his path at Wimbledon or the rest of the season. Sinner will start again from here.”

Sinner may well take inspiration from his greatest rival, Alcaraz, ahead of Wimbledon later this month.

In 2024, Alcaraz suffered a shock defeat of his own in the lead-up to Wimbledon, losing to Jack Draper in the second round of Queen's.

In fact, looking back at the last ten Wimbledon champions, winning warm-up matches doesn't seem to be a requirement for victory at the All England Club.

Only time will tell if Sinner can add his name to the list of Wimbledon champions in 2025.

The 2025 Wimbledon tournament is scheduled to begin on Monday, June 30.

The Czech's 6-2, 6-4 semifinal victory in the German capital on Saturday was also her first career win over a reigning No. 1.ByJohn BerkokPublished Jun 21, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 21, 2025

In 2023, Marketa Vondrousova stunned the tennis world by becoming the first unseeded woman ever to win Wimbledon, and—at No. 42—the lowest-ranked woman to do it, since WTA rankings began in 1975.Today, almost two years later, lightning has struck again.The Czech, currently at No. 164 after missing most of the last year with a shoulder injury, has become the lowest-ranked woman to reach the Berlin final after stunning Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets, 6-2, 6-4, in the semifinals of the WTA 500 grass-court event on Saturday.Her victory over Sabalenka is her first win over a reigning No. 1, and she's now into her first final since conquering the All-England Club in 2023.

Sabalenka was coming off a grinder—on Friday, she came back from quadruple match point down to edge Elena Rybakina in the quarters.But on Saturday it was all Vondrousova, who broke the world No. 1 four times, twice per set, en route to a one-hour, 21-minute victory.Before this, the Czech's best career wins by ranking were five victories over world No. 2s—two against Simona Halep in 2019 (at Indian Wells and Rome), one against Naomi Osaka in 2021 (at the Tokyo Olympics), one against Ons Jabeur in 2023 (at the Australian Open) and one against Sabalenka in 2024 (in Stuttgart, on indoor clay).It's been a difficult last 12 months for Vondrousova, who—after falling in the first round of her title defense at Wimbledon last year—ended her season and had shoulder surgery. Then, after playing a few events at the start of this year, her injury flared up again and she was out for another three months before making her comeback at Roland Garros.Now she's through to her first final in almost exactly two years and will have a shot at her third career title, having also won a small indoor hard-court event in Biel/Bienne, Switzerland in 2017, as a 17-year-old (where she actually beat Sabalenka in the qualifying rounds).

The college tennis season may be over, but two Tar Heels are still racking up wins.

The UNC women's tennis duo of Reese Brantmeier and Alanis Hamilton were one of the most dominant collegiate doubles teams in the country last season. Now they will see how they stack up against some of the best in the world.

Brantmeier and Hamilton came from behind in two straight matches to clinch a berth in the US Open Tennis Championships. They were competing in the American Collegiate Wildcard playoffs, and the winners are granted a main draw wild-card entry into the prestigious tournament. 

Brantmeier and Hamilton lost the first set of their semi-finals match against the UCLA duo 6-4 before winning sets two and three both by 6-4 scores. In the championship match against the Auburn team of DJ Bennett and Ava Harstar, The Heels again lost the first match 6-4. They narrowly won the second set 7-6 (4) before taking a hard fought third match 7-6 (10-5). Brantmeier and Hamilton won six straight points to win the tiebreaker and ultimately the match. The match lasted for over three and a half hours.

Brantmeier and Hamilton were a dominant pairing for the Heels last year. They finished the season ranked second in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association's doubles rankings. The duo were a big part of UNC's ACC championship and run to the national championship semi-finals. 

The US Open will take place on August 25th - September 7th. It will be held at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York.

Carlos Alcaraz has voiced his frustration over the implementation of the shot clock during his latest match at the ATP 500 event at Queen's.

The Spaniard was victorious 7-5, 6-4 against Arthur Rinderknech in the quarter-finals and looked in solid form, less than 24 hours after surviving a 3-and-a-half-hour battle against Jaume Munar.

Despite the win, the five-time Grand Slam champion was handed a warning during the match for – according to the umpire – going beyond the allotted time between points.

According to the ATP rulebook: “A Time or Code Violation must be assessed if the ball is not struck for the next point within the twenty-five (25) seconds allowed, except if the Chair Umpire extends the time for special circumstances defined by ATP. There is no time warning prior to the expiration of the twenty-five (25) seconds.”

However, as is stated within the rule, the umpire may delay the start of the shot clock due to crowd noise or an extended prior rally.

“It was a really long match,” commented Alcaraz, whilst speaking on the Tennis Channel.

“The conditions were extreme with the heat. It was really, really hot out there, and yeah, really long rallies, long games. I felt like I had no time to recover between points. I was in a rush all the time.

“So it was kind of I can't approach the next point in an appropriate way. I mean, that talk with the umpire, it wasn't because of that I didn't lose the focus, but it was a problem all the time with all the clock.

“Jaume [Munar] talked to the umpire with the same thing. They have to change that. But yeah, I mean, they have to know where to put the clock, you know, right after the point or wait a little bit.

“Because after long points, long rallies, I finish the point at the net, I should have a little bit more time just to approach the next point in a proper way. That's what I felt today.”

Alcaraz's latest win was his 15th-consecutive victory, after lifting the trophy in both Rome and Roland-Garros – and was asked how he manages to ‘dig deep' so regularly.

“Yeah, it's really important to think positive all the time,” analysed the four-time Grand Slam champion.

“Today there were a few moments that I didn't think positive at all.

“But I didn't give up. So I think that's the most important thing. So probably negative thoughts come to your mind in a few moments, but the most important thing is you don't give up.

“You just keep fighting. You just have to keep playing and know that the opponent was going to give you chances to put yourself into the match again.

“That's what I thought today. Just keep fighting and show the opponent that if he wants to beat you, he has to play at his best level. I think that's a great mentality, a great thing to show to the opponent.”

Alcaraz will next play veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in the last four.

Tennis icon Jimmy Connors has weighed in on the launch of the 2025 US Open's revamped mixed doubles event.

With a $1 million prize pool and 16 high-profile ATP-WTA pairings set to compete during Fan Week, the United States Tennis Association (USTA) is swinging big, and Connors believes it's a clear signal that tennis is trying to modernize to stay competitive in an evolving sports and entertainment landscape.

Slated for August 19 and 20 at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, the tournament will take place during the opening days of the US Open. The draw will feature some of the sport's most recognizable names teaming up in combinations rarely seen in elite play.

Among the pairings: Naomi Osaka and Nick Kyrgios, Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz, Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud, Elena Rybakina and Taylor Fritz, Emma Navarro and Jannik Sinner, Olga Danilovic and Novak Djokovic, and Aryna Sabalenka with Grigor Dimitrov.

The format will feature best-of-three sets with sets played to four games (no-ad scoring and a tiebreak at 4-4), and a 10-point tiebreak in place of a third set. The final match will adopt a slightly extended structure with sets to six games but will retain the no-ad and 10-point tiebreak format if sets are split.

In a recent episode of his ‘Advantage Connors' podcast, which he co-hosts with his son Brett, the 72-year-old Hall of Famer offered candid thoughts on the initiative. “Yeah, I mean, it seems like they've changed the scoring a bit to bring in the big names and try to fill the stadium for another four or five days, maybe,” Connors said.

While acknowledging that drawing star players and shortening matches could generate attention, Connors expressed concern about the long-term direction of tennis and its place among other fast-growing racquet sports.

“You can tell they're trying to do whatever they can to keep interest in the game alive. Pickleball and Padel, this new sport coming in, are starting to wedge their way into the tennis conversation. They're easier to pick up, and you get better at them faster than you do with tennis,” he noted.



The former World No. 1 emphasized that these recent changes point to a deeper concern of sustaining tennis's relevance among younger generations. “The real question is: what's it going to take to keep tennis at a high level, to keep people interested, especially young players?” Connors asked.

“How do we get them back out on public courts, in high schools, and on college teams, like it was in the '70s and '80s? Maybe this is one way, changing the scoring for mixed doubles, shortening the sets.”

“I don't know. At this rate, pretty soon they might say you can't hit more than four balls in a point. Maybe that's the next step, even for singles. Maybe that's what it's going to take,” Connors joked.

France's No 1 ranked tennis star has pulled out of Wimbledon through injury - having been accused by a rival of not actually being injured.

England's premier competition will kick off on June 30, with the likes of Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic hoping for success as Alcaraz looks to defend his title.

It will draw competitors from all around the world as nations pin their hopes on their top stars -  but France will have to look elsewhere in the men's singles after Arthur Fils pulled out of the competition.

Fils had picked up an injury last month in the French Open, withdrawing from his third round match at Roland Garos against Andrey Rublev because of a stress fracture in his back.

The 21-year-old had overcome back issues to beat Jaume Munar in a four-hour and 25-minute match earlier in the week, ripping his shirt off in celebration. The next round, though, was a step too far.

And he has been unable to recover in time for Wimbledon, now officially pulling out of the tournament in a major blow to his season.

Fils, who is currently ranked No 15 in the world, had said: 'We're going to try to see if I can be ready for Wimbledon. It's a big question mark. After that, I'm 20, I still have time on the tour, it's not the time to rush.

'On the contrary, if I can take a little more time to recover well and be ready to play the whole season on hard courts and the end of the year, that's not bad.'

Spaniard Munar had accused his opponent of not actually being injured, but suffering with cramps. That was before Fils has confirmed he had been struggling with a stress fracture.

'I had some issue with the back since a long time, and during the match against Munar it gets worse,' he said. 'Then I did some exams. The exams were not good at all. Got some stress fracture.

'Yeah, whatever, we decide with the team it was better to stop now, because if I'm stopping now, I could stop for only four to six weeks. If I was pushing myself too much, I would probably stop for a couple of months.'

'It's the lower back. I got this issue a couple of times already when I was young. Yeah, L-5. So yeah, I got some issues like this in the past already.' 

He added: 'It's an injury that happens quite often when you are a child. It's a stress fracture injury.

'It happened to me twice. I had to wear a back brace. Then it healed. But also, my lower back is arched, so then I had a bone marrow edema. It's coming back right now. So I have to find a way to cure that and to get past that.'

Former ATP player Nicolas Escude has expressed his surprise at Novak Djokovic's comments about his motivation and suggested it may have been “an admission of weakness” from the Serb.

In a discussion with former Croatian footballer Slaven Bilic, Djokovic made an intriguing declaration about competing until the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

“The only thing that I have in my head, which gives me motivation, is the Olympics of 2028 in Los Angeles,” Djokovic said.

“It is the only thing that at this moment, professionally speaking, I have in my vision at this point.

“And playing for the national team and Grand Slams. But not even the Grand Slams, not as much as the Olympics.”

Djokovic delivered an incredible performance to overcome Carlos Alcaraz in a thrilling final at the 2024 Olympics in Paris.

The triumph saw Djokovic secure his maiden gold medal at what was his fifth Olympics and it meant he had become the first player in tennis history to win every significant prize in the sport.

Following the Games, Djokovic said: “Without false modesty, this is my greatest sports achievement, and I proudly carry this gold for Serbia.”

Speaking to Eurosport France, Escude shared his thoughts on Djokovic's statement about defending his Olympic title.

“I don't know what to think about it,” admitted the former world No 17.

“It's more than surprising, especially since we've never been used to this kind of long-winded statement from Novak, because the Los Angeles Olympics aren't happening any time soon.

“He's not going to make us believe that he doesn't have Wimbledon in his sights to try and win his 25th Grand Slam title.

“Is he trying to take a little pressure off himself regarding Wimbledon? Or is this an admission of weakness on his part?”

Djokovic will aim to win a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title at the 2025 Wimbledon Championships.

The 38-year-old is vying for a record-equalling eighth Wimbledon crown, and victory would see him become the oldest Grand Slam singles champion in history.

The world No 5 was beaten by Jannik Sinner in the semi-finals of the French Open in his most recent tournament.

Djokovic won his 100th ATP singles title — and only title since his Olympic gold last August — at the Geneva Open last month.

Emma Raducanu once dreamed of being a Wimbledon ball girl - not knowing the role is the enemy of being a British No.1.

Raducanu has emulated Tim Henman in taking ownership of Aorangi Terrace and nearly mirrored his most famous rule break at Queen's.

The 22-year-old kept herself warm during her 6-2, 6-4 defeat to Qinwen Zheng during a break of play by smashing a practice serve down the court - and fortunately didn't strike any ball girls.

At Wimbledon, her fans will pack out 'Raducanu Ridge', which is still commonly known as 'Henman Hill'.

The iconic banked area in the grounds of the All England Club was once synonymous with Henman for his exploits in the late 1990s.

However, it all could have been so different for the 50-year-old, who was once thrown out of SW19 for hitting a ball girl.

At just age 20, two years younger than Raducanu, Henman became the first player in the Open era to get defaulted at Wimbledon.

Hours after losing to defending champion Pete Sampras in the singles, the ex-Brit No.1 was involved in a first-round doubles match.

Henman and partner Jeremy Bates were leading Henrik Holm of Sweden and Jeff Tarango of the United States 7-6, 2-6, 6-3, while locked in a tie break to decide the 4th set, when tempers flared.

After forfeiting the third point, Henman vented his frustrations by belting the ball in anger, hitting Caroline Hall on the side of the face as she was collecting a ball from the net.

“If I had hit the girl in such an incident, I would have been thrown out of tennis,” Tarango said afterwards. 

“With the speed of the ball, it could have killed the girl.”

Following a delay, Henman was defaulted by umpire Wayne McKewan for unsportsmanlike conduct, but the worst was still to come.

Tournament referee Alan Mills was called to Court 14 and incurred the ire of a 1,800-strong crowd by officially defaulting the Brit pair. 

It was only the third time in the Open era that a player had been disqualified from a Grand Slam event, and the first at Wimbledon.

Henman, close to tears, held a press conference later where he insisted that the shot was completely accidental.

“I was not very happy to lose the point and was angry.” said Henman. “I went to put the ball down the other end of the court. Just as I did, the ball girl ran across and as I hit the ball it hit her on the side of the head.

“It was a complete accident,” he added, “but I'm responsible for my actions.”

On Tarango's claim that the speed could have killed the girl, Henman replied: “I disagree with that. If I had missed the ball girl, if she had not been there, I don't think I would have got a code violation.

“There was no one in line with the ball before I was about to hit it. As I hit it, she ran straight out in front of me so I'm the responsible party.”

A statement from the referee's office revealed that the ball-girl, Hall, was taken home to undergo a thorough medical examination.

She had initially fallen to the ground following Henman's strike, but then ran to her usual position in tears before a doctor was called.

Hall told the Guardian in 2008: “You're trained to just carry on no matter what, so that's what I did. I didn't feel that bad and besides I was 16 and I didn't want to lose face. 

“I didn't think any more of it until Bates came over, then all of a sudden the tournament referee, Alan Mills, was on court and it was chaos.

“I was sat down and got an ice pack on my face. Apparently the ball was clocked at 92mph, and it did hurt a bit, but I'd have carried on if I could. No one asked my opinion, but I was saying, 'No, no, don't disqualify him.' 

“Nothing was meant by it at all, it was just bad timing that meant the ball hit my head instead of going into the net. Alan Mills was really quite angry with him, which didn't seem very fair. After a few minutes, the umpire announced that the match was over. The crowd was booing; it was really terrible.

“Henman was supposed to come to my house the next day to say sorry, but there were loads of photographers outside, so we did a press conference at Wimbledon instead, and he gave me some flowers. 

“I was back on court the next day. I've not spoken to him since but, if I got the chance, I'd say I'm sorry and I don't mean to keep cropping up.”

Henman went on to reach the semi-finals four times at Wimbledon, admitting that the ordeal was one of the reasons behind his success.

“I'd played matches at Wimbledon before then, but that was the first time I made an impact and it was for all the wrong reasons,” he admitted in 2010.

“In hindsight, it was a very steep learning curve regarding the media. It was a nightmare for 36 or 48 hours after that.

“I was the first player to be disqualified from the tournament for 120 years and I thought, I'm going to have to make sure I have some good results because I don't want to be remembered like that.

“It was another motivation to make sure I played well at Wimbledon. I was lucky enough to play a lot of my best tennis on centre court.

“I beat French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov, I beat Roger Federer and played Pete Sampras in successive semi-finals.

“I have some amazing memories; some of my biggest achievements and some of my most disappointing loses.”

20 years later, it could be Henman giving Raducanu her flowers at Wimbledon - but hopefully this time, with tears of joy.

Tennis's great disruptor speaks on his highs and lows on Centre Court and the BBC's ‘very strange' decision to leave him out of the commentary box

Wimbledon runs through Nick Kyrgios's tumultuous career with a mysterious force full of pain, glory and controversy. It is a tournament defined by history and restraint but, for Kyrgios the disruptor, it is also a place pitted with dark despair and sunlit magic.

The Australian has spent a night in a psychiatric ward while playing at Wimbledon and also been served with court orders and lawsuits during and after the 2022 championship that ended in him pushing Novak Djokovic so hard in a memorable final. But he has since struggled with injury and he will miss his third successive Wimbledon this year.

He still can't keep away. Kyrgios returns for a live performance of his podcast, Good Trouble, at the New Wimbledon Theatre on 24 June. But he pauses when asked what this strange and beautiful place means to him: “Wimbledon holds special memories for me. It's the first grand slam where I broke through and it's the pinnacle of tennis. Every time you step into the grounds you feel the energy and the aura. But I don't always feel so comfortable there either because I don't act like the normal tennis player. Wimbledon takes note of that a lot. I definitely feel like a snowman in the desert there but I enjoy it.”

Kyrgios cackles when I ask if he expects a few hecklers to join his secret guests at his Wimbledon show. “I hope so. I really enjoy people that don't necessarily like how I go about things. If they want to come and heckle, I'm all for it. Open invitation, please.”

Past guests on his podcast range from Mike Tyson and Naomi Osaka to Matthew McConaughey and Djokovic. Kyrgios starts each episode by asking his guests what “good trouble” means to them. For Kyrgios, “good trouble” means “shaking things up, not always doing things the way we're taught. The one thing that stands out for me, being a tennis player in a Roger Federer-esque sport where you fit into a mould, is that I've gone against the grain my whole career. I've definitely shaken things up and done it my way”.

We revisit his tournament debut in 2014 and I ask Kyrgios to describe his initial impressions of Wimbledon. “That I was at the top of the tennis world. If you play Wimbledon multiple times you're playing in front of the Royal Box on a court where every blade of grass is the same length. If you make it on to that stage the journey has been worth it.”

Kyrgios was given a wildcard that year and he played sublime tennis to beat Rafael Nadal in the fourth round. Nadal made only 18 unforced errors over four sets, but he couldn't contain the fire and brilliance of the Canberra teenager. Kyrgios hit 37 aces and 70 winners, including a between-the-legs flick that almost brought Centre Court down with delirium. John McEnroe said: “We have a new star on our hands.”

“It was life-changing,” Kyrgios says, “but I wasn't ready at that age [19] to take on the responsibility.”

Five years later he played Nadal in the second round. It was another engrossing match studded with acrimony. He lost in four sets but attention focused afterwards on the fact he had tried to hit Nadal with a ball. “The dude has got how many slams, how much money in the bank?” Kyrgios said afterwards. “I think he can take a ball to the chest, bro. I'm not going to apologise to him.”

Yet, as Kyrgios revealed years later in the Netflix documentary Break Point, he was in turmoil. He was drinking and self-harming to the point where he had to wear a compression sleeve on his arm to hide the scars. He spoke of how, in the aftermath of losing to Nadal, he was admitted to a psychiatric ward in London.

But Kyrgios says something subtly different now when I ask if he can take us back to his time under psychiatric care: “I had to go and play Nadal the next day. I didn't really have a choice.”

I am so surprised that I ask Kyrgios if he really had been on the psychiatric ward the night before he faced Nadal? “Yes, yes. In 2019 people assumed that I had an incredible year. I was top 20 in the world, but I was at my lowest. When I finally opened up that's when people started realising that, yes, I haven't always been perfect or always done things right, but I'm willing to speak about it. I've had hundreds of thousands of kids messaging me on Instagram and I try and go through all of them and help as much as I can.”

How did he play against Nadal in such a fragile state? “We have to sometimes block out what we're going through and go to work. I can't just run away.” Kyrgios adds: “Playing Nadal at Wimbledon and losing in a tight four-set battle? I was extremely proud. I'm just proud I made it through [his depression].”

He was so low that, “all through that year”, Kyrgios contemplated taking his life. “I was in a dark place and it didn't get better after that moment. I was definitely struggling throughout the year with those thoughts and the self-harm. But I've been able to navigate that and help others.”

For Kyrgios, “anyone who doesn't say I'm a role model doesn't know what I go through on a day-to-day basis.

They don't have kids messaging them for advice and saying: ‘I've had suicidal thoughts and you're the only reason why I'm trying to find my way.' I do everything I can for the youth so I think [his critics] are straight-up haters.

“But I take pride in giving back and when I see kids that aren't super-high on confidence and are afraid of people speaking negative words at them, that's when I can help the most, because I've gone through it.”

Andy Murray saw the signs of self-harm and, as Kyrgios confirms appreciatively, “he was one of the first to notice and tell me, if I needed any help, I could always talk to him.”

Three years on, in 2022, Kyrgios lost that bruising four-setter to Djokovic in the final. “The fact I've made the final of a grand slam is pretty damn cool,” he says. “It's something I'll be able to share with my kids and grandkids and show them that anything is possible. The courts around my house [in Canberra] are generally concrete with cracks in them so the fact I made a grand slam final is pretty crazy.”

Earlier in that tournament Kyrgios received a summons to appear in a Canberra court on a charge of common assault after he had allegedly pushed his former girlfriend Chiara Passari during an argument in January 2021. “All the charges got dropped,” Kyrgios says. “I knew exactly what was happening, so I just had to continue playing tennis.”

In 2023 Kyrgios pleaded guilty but he was not convicted as the magistrate decided he had “acted poorly in the heat of the moment” and that the case was at the lower end of the scale of common assault.

In a written statement Kyrgios expressed his contrition. “I was not in a good place and I reacted to a difficult situation in a way I deeply regret. I know it wasn't OK and I'm sincerely sorry for the hurt I caused.”

Kyrgios was also sued after the 2022 final because he had asked the umpire to eject a spectator, Anna Palus, who shouted just before he served. He said that Palus “looks like she's had about 700 drinks, bro” but, after legal action was instigated against him, Kyrgios accepted she had not been drinking excessively: “I was mistaken, and I apologise. To make amends, I have donated £20,000 to Great Ormond Street Hospital.”

Despite all the controversy he still believes he came close to beating Djokovic. “Definitely. It was only a couple of points here and there where, if I'd acted a bit differently, I would have had a Wimbledon title. But there's no shame in losing to the greatest of all time. Do I think about it often? Yes. Do I think about what I could have changed? Yes. Could I have prepared better? No. I prepared amazingly.”

Two months later Kyrgios should have played Casper Ruud in the US Open semi-final but he lost a five-set match in the quarters to Karen Khachanov. “I should have won and I genuinely thought that was one of my biggest chances to win a slam. But it's not life or death. I can't say that losing a tennis match is catastrophic.”

Kyrgios has suffered numerous wrist, knee and foot injuries and, after struggling at the Australian Open and Indian Wells this year, he was forced to withdraw from Wimbledon. Can he come back and play in more grand slams? “Yes, I think I'll definitely play them one or two more times. But there's a lot of wear on these tyres. It's a tough sport.”

Rehab and training are a “constant grind” for the 30-year-old but he expects to play in the US Open. “Yes, for sure. I'm definitely playing the US swing and I'll take it one day at a time.”

Meanwhile, as they showed during their exhilarating French Open final, Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are playing, in Kyrgios's words, “incredible tennis. It's pretty obvious those two are going to be juggernauts of the sport for the next 10 or 15 years. They pushed each other to a level that not many have played before. I think Alcaraz has that flair and X-factor of Federer, Nadal and Novak. Sinner is incredibly powerful but Alcaraz will be up there with those greats.”

Who will win Wimbledon next month? “I've got to say Alcaraz.”

Kyrgios and Djokovic are friends now, so was he wrong to once say the Serb had “a sick obsession with wanting to be liked”?

“No. He's way more comfortable in his own skin now. I think he did want the crowd to love him but he enjoys being the villain. He finds energy when people heckle him. He's the greatest tennis player of all time so he wouldn't care as much what people think now. We have respect for each other and we are proof that different personalities can make it to the top and you don't have to have everyone liking you.”

Kyrgios has been a revelation in the commentary box. “I know I'm a great commentator,” he says. “All I've done for 20 years is play, study and breathe this sport. I also think tennis needs commentators who say things that not everyone says.”

Yet the BBC has not signed him up for this year's Wimbledon. “It's unfortunate but it's probably their loss more than mine,” he says. “I understand they've got Chris Eubanks [the American currently ranked world No 108] but he hasn't beaten the greatest of all time multiple times. When someone's beaten Federer, Nadal, Murray and Djokovic and has incredible insights, it's very strange you wouldn't want that person adding knowledge to tennis fans.”

Kyrgios sounds more conciliatory towards the BBC when he says: “I'm sure our paths will cross again. I only ever want to add humour, some knowledge and some great atmosphere.”

As he prepares to return to Wimbledon, and the scene of so many tangled memories, Kyrgios says: “Life's too short for regrets. I think if you take one little block out, it all falls down. Every mistake I've made has given me the chance to learn and be the person I am today.”

Nick Kyrgios will be at the New Wimbledon Theatre on 24 June as part of his Good Trouble with Nick Kyrgios global tour. Info at fane.co.uk.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner delivered one of the most thrilling Roland Garros finals in history, a five-set epic that lasted 5 hours and 29 minutes — the longest French Open final ever, surpassing the 1982 classic between Guillermo Vilas and Mats Wilander (4 hours and 42 minutes).

Sinner, who came within a few points of capturing his first Roland Garros title, was leading two sets to one and held three championship points at 40-0 before Alcaraz rallied to claim his fifth Grand Slam title.

The crushing defeat appeared to weigh heavily on the World No. 1, who fell in the second round of the Halle Open to Alexander Bublik. After the match, Sinner admitted the loss in Paris had taken its toll.

“The truth is that after the defeat in Paris, it wasn't easy to be competitive here,” Sinner said in his post-match press conference. “I'm relatively satisfied to have been able to play two matches on grass before Wimbledon”.

Alcaraz, now into the semifinals at Queen's Club, was asked about Sinner's comments and expressed his support for his rival, acknowledging the emotional weight of certain losses.

“There were a few matches, really long matches that I have lost, and yeah, I just left the court by myself with the head up, and I didn't need too much time to recover from that,” Alcaraz said. “Then there were other matches that it was really tough to deal with”.

“I know that day for him, that final was pretty tough to deal with after all mentally. So I don't know. From my experience, some matches that I have lost, I took three, four days just to recover mentally,” he continued. “Physically, as well, if it was demanding physically. So two or three days minimum just to recover from a really tough loss”.

While Sinner regroups ahead of Wimbledon, Alcaraz continues to build momentum on grass. With wins over Jaume Munar and Arthur Rinderknech, the Spaniard has extended his career-long winning streak to 16 matches.

He surpassed his previous best of 14 consecutive wins, first set in 2022 before being stopped by Alexander Zverev in the French Open quarterfinals. Alcaraz matched that number again in 2023 when he won Wimbledon by defeating Novak Djokovic, before falling to Tommy Paul in the Canadian Open quarterfinals.

Jittery nerves were in abundance at the Billie Jean King USTA National Tennis Center in Flushing Friday, as hundreds of prospective ball crew members attempted to secure one of 80 highly sought-after positions for the U.S. Open Championships.

The tryouts, which were split between a Friday session and a Sunday session, saw about 460 applicants, ages 14 and up, compete to join the 240 retained ball crew members from last year.

U.S. Open Ball Crew Lead Neal Kitson compared the role of the ball crew to that of the stage crew at a Broadway play.

"They're transitioning from point to point; it's like a seamless transition that allows play to move smoothly," he said in an interview.

He said that they received 1,600 applications from people all over the world, which was then whittled down to a list less than a third long.

"We had a six-question questionnaire. They had to get no more than two [questions wrong on it]", Kitson explained.

"Then after that, we looked at those who had experience at another ball crew tournament ...[and we also] looked at current high school athletes of all sports in the tristate area," he added.

At the live tryout, the applicants were evaluated in how well they rolled a ball, how smooth it runs along the ground, their speed, accuracy, and hand-eye coordination, as crews roll the balls to each other during play.

Tomas Tarnopolsky, 19, of Harlem, was part of the ball crew in 2022, but stopped due to college. While he got wait-listed for the crew last year, he is hoping to get back in to what he described as a "great community."

"I think it went well," he said. "The first [year I tried out], I actually wiped out. I fell over and I looked straight up at the person adjudicating, sort of smiled and got on with it." He was accepted, despite the fall. 

Mya Melendez of Levittown, a junior at General Douglas MacArthur High School., was a first-time applicant. She applied because she likes watching tennis and playing with her grandparents, and was inspired after seeing the ball crew at last year's Open, and seeing an ad for it on Instagram.

Melendez said that she practiced by rolling balls and tossing them in her house with her father.

"I feel like you have to be fast, you have to be into the game, and I think you just have to know what's going on," she said, describing herself as "excited, but a little nervous."

Her father, Fabian Melendez, described how excited she was after being picked to try out in person.

While he said it was "a little nerve-wracking" watching her, he added that "as long as she's having fun and doing her best, I have no issues."

A similar sentiment was echoed by Kitson, who told the first group of tryouts to not let their nerves take over, and enjoy the experience.

"One thing that I love to have on my team are people who are showing their teeth. They're smiling [and] having a good time," he told them.

The applicants will find out the results next week.

The relationship between former True Detective co-stars Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey might still be going strong, years after they wrapped filming on the HBO show's legendary first season—but their new Apple TV+ comedy series, not so much. Deadline reports that filming on the untitled series, in which the pair would play fictionalized versions of their real-life selves, living together with their families in Texas, has been suspended, and its cast sent home, with showrunner David West Read having departed the series after filming eight of its ten episodes.

Read apparently ditched out on/was encouraged to ditch out on the project—which is co-owned by Harrelson and McConaughey, and inspired by their real-life relationship—over concerns about how to end the series. Deadline notes that Lessons In Chemistry creator Lee Eisenberg is being courted to come in and showrun the last two episodes of the series, as well as likely reshoot some of what's come before. The series co-stars Holland Taylor, Natalie Martinez, Brittany Ishibashi, Oona Yaffe, Highdee Kuan, Nolan Almeida, Ella Grace Helton, and Noah Carganilla, all of whom have apparently been sent home while its leadership and creative direction is rejiggered.

The show was originally announced back in 2023, and, honestly, sounded even at the time like a thing you'd just say to get some attention—”Hey, Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey are making a show for us where they play a fake version of their real friendship, and also they're living together, doesn't that sound fun?”—and not actually spend a lot of time and energy to, y'know, make. But here we are, at least nearly: Apple is apparently still committed to getting the show finished, at least in part because nobody likes paying to make eight whole episodes of a ten-episode show, and then having to throw the whole thing out because your producer-stars couldn't agree with the writer on an ending.

	Though Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital has seen its fair share of shocks and surprises, including character returns, there's one fan-favorite physician that isn't likely to grace the ABC medical procedural again.


	During a recent Tribeca Film Festival live event with The New York Times‘ Interview, the Emmy-winning Sandra Oh spoke with co-host Lulu Garcia-Navarro (per People) about whether or not she would return as Dr. Cristina Yang.


	“What I have noticed, this is 10 years out from leaving the show, is the deep appreciation that I have for the people who appreciate Cristina,” the Killing Eve star said. “It is that love that has made me go, ‘Oh. The fans really, really, really want it,' and for the first time, that's when I started opening up the idea.”

	However, the actress continued, “For me, I think to really be true to the people who enjoy your work, you have to be true to yourself. So at this point, I don't think so.”


	Oh's tenure on Grey's spanned the show's inception through 2014, with the actress garnering five Emmy nods and a Golden Globe for her role as the driven cardiothoracic surgeon and dear friend of Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). Since her departure, the character has been referenced onscreen, whether through phone calls or other correspondence. The Quiz Lady actress has been asked about her stance on returning numerous times throughout the years, with her answers ranging from “never say never” to, later on, a resounding “no.”


	Having recently concluded its 21st season, Grey's Anatomy remains the longest-running primetime medical drama in TV history, and it will soon gear up for its 22nd installment, releasing this fall.

	











	As for Oh, she will next be seen in Aziz Ansari's debut feature Good Fortune, starring alongside Seth Rogen, Keanu Reeves, Keke Palmer and Ansari. The high-concept comedy will bow in theaters Oct. 17.

It's not every day that someone as admired and adored as Catherine, Princess of Wales, gracefully steps back from one of the most glamorous and anticipated events on the royal calendar. So when Kate Middleton's name was quietly removed from the official Royal Ascot carriage procession list just 20 minutes before the festivities kicked off, fans and royal watchers alike were left both puzzled and concerned.

Every June, Royal Ascot brings together high fashion, high society, and world-class horse racing at Ascot Racecourse in Berkshire. This year's event took place June 17–21. It continued its tradition as one of the most prestigious and high-status social gatherings in Britain. First established by Queen Anne in 1711, the five-day event has remained a highlight for the royal family and British public alike.

The 43-year-old Princess may not have appeared dressed in high fashion in her usual head-turning bold fashion, but she certainly didn't sit the week out. On the same day she was scheduled to attend, she released a heartfelt statement in support of Children's Hospice Week. She used her platform to shine light on families navigating unimaginable circumstances.

The reason behind her absence is very “Middleton-coded.” According to Kensington Palace, the Princess was pouring her heart and focusing her energy into something deeply meaningful and personal. This proved, once again, why so many people admire her due to her compassion and empathy.

“No parent expects to hear that their child has a serious health condition that could shorten their life,” Middleton wrote. “Sadly, this is the reality faced by thousands of families across the country, leaving them heartbroken, fearful of the future and often desperately isolated.”

As Patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices and Tŷ Hafan Children's Hospice, the Princess has long been very vocal about her support for pediatric palliative care. Her statement continued with a powerful reminder of what these organizations offer. “Lifting spirits through laughter, fun and play, as well as listening, holding, caring and sharing, they support children and families through life, death and beyond,” the princess wrote.

“This Children's Hospice Week,” she added, “I hope you will join me in celebrating the life-changing work they do and thanking them for the vital care they provide to children and families experiencing the most challenging times.”

Her words follow a January visit to Tŷ Hafan in Wales. There, she spent time with young patients and their parents. The cause holds deep meaning for the royal family, as her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana, was also a major advocate for children's hospices in the UK.

Middleton's absence at Royal Ascot also comes as she continues to recover from cancer. In March 2024, she shared a personal video message revealing her diagnosis. She told viewers she had begun preventative chemotherapy in order to speed her recovery process. Understandably, she revealed she was taking a step back from public life to focus on treatment, her health, and her family.

Earlier this year, a statement from Kensington Palace confirmed that she was in remission and slowly. The princess would start to ease back into her royal duties day by day. However, she is still being selective about which events to attend to avoid overexerting herself.

Her most recent public appearance was at Trooping the Colour on June 14. Spectators were able to see how radiant she looked as she was joined by Prince William. Attending were also their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, on the Buckingham Palace balcony.

But as many know, healing isn't a straight path. A spokesperson from the Palace noted that while the Princess remains committed to her royal work, she is “taking each day as it comes” and prioritizing her well-being.

She didn't issue a specific comment on missing Ascot, but her actions, as always, spoke volumes. This time around, she chose to lift vulnerable families and advocate for children's care—a true testament to her character. Prince William, meanwhile, carried on with Royal Ascot traditions, appearing in the first carriage with King Charles and Queen Camilla.

According to Queen Elizabeth II's former spokeswoman, Ailsa Anderson, Middleton is taking her time with grace and care. Speaking to People, Anderson said, “She's being sensible, listening to what her body is telling her and easing back into public life. She wants to be there for her children and maintain her health.”

In true Kate fashion, her quiet strength, compassion, and commitment to others continue to shine, even when she isn't in the spotlight.

Amy Poehler reflected on the culture of comedy at Saturday Night Live during her time at the late-night show, saying that some sketches have aged poorly.


	During a recent episode on her Good Hang with Amy Poehler podcast alongside guest and friend Will Forte, whose time on SNL intersected with Poehler's, the two discussed how much comedy has evolved since their time on the Lorne Michaels-helmed series.


	The topic came up when the two comics recalled an instance at a table read during a sexual harassment seminar, where they were “drawing pictures of dicks or something,” Forte remembered.

	“We were consensually and appropriately, just with each other, I believe, drawing pictures of penises and giving them back and forth to each other,” Poehler said, adding that she then accidentally handed that paper to the seminar leader.

	Forte then commented that as a young comedian, “it's all about getting the laughs,” implying that considerations of taste and appropriateness come later.


	“Agree, and that's the part about getting older and being in comedy is you have to, like, figure out, ‘Oh, it's like everything has an expiration date,'” Poehler said. 


	The Parks and Recreation star then referenced SNL50: The Anniversary Special, in which the long-running series wanted to have its nostalgic cake and eat it, too, owning up to the stereotypes it perpetuated in the past. In a send-up of awards-show “in memoriam” segments, a tuxedoed Tom Hanks soberly took the darkly lit stage to “take a moment to remember those who we've lost. Countless members of the SNL family taken from us way too soon. I'm speaking, of course, about SNL characters and sketches that have aged horribly.”

	











	“Even on the 50th, when they had that segment which was like, ‘Here's all the ways we got things wrong,' and they showed way inappropriate casting for people,” Poehler stated. “We all played people that we should not have played. I misappropriated, I appropriated, I didn't know, I don't know. It's very real, and the best thing you can do is make repair, learn from your mistakes, do better — it's all you can do.”

Lena Dunham and husband Luis Felber's new Netflix series “Too Much,” starring Megan Stalter, is set to drop July 10, and while the series' trailer promised laughs, Dunham said she also felt a responsibility to use the show to make a stand on women's rights. Speaking at a preview event (via The Hollywood Reporter), Dunham sported a Planned Parenthood pin and teased a “Too Much” storyline that involves abortion.

“As an artist, I'm proud … that we get to be part of showing people all over the world a healthy woman making a super self actualized choice to get reproductive care [from] a really true, loving abortion provider, because those people are heroes,” Dunham said. “So to be able to represent that was really, really important to me.”

The “Girls” creator/star also told THR prior to the preview that she felt it necessary to shine a light on Planned Parenthood during “this really pivotal moment.”

“While we know that television may not always change the dial on politics, what we can do is normalize very normal health procedures like abortion for our audience and especially let young people who may be watching and want to get care at Planned Parenthood know what a loving, safe place it is,” she said.

 










Dunham has partnered with and advocated for Planned Parenthood in the past, including in 2017 when she released a star-studded animated tribute to the organization with participants like Meryl Streep, Mindy Kaling, Jennifer Lawrence, and America Ferrera.

“We've been working on the film for over a year in an attempt to shed light on Planned Parenthood's remarkable history and ongoing battle to keep serving the people who show up to their health centers every day of the year,” Dunham told THR at the time. “I really think it's the best cartoon about the history of reproductive freedom ever made, but it may also be the only cartoon about the history of reproductive freedom ever made.”

“Too Much” finds Stalter played a workaholic that, in the wake of a failed relationship, moves to London to “live a life of solitude like a Brontë sister.” Of course, things change when she meets a man (Will Sharpe) that challenges her new life plan. The stacked cast also stars Andrew Rannells and Rita Wilson, and features appearances from Andrew Scott, Naomi Watts, and Rhea Pearlman.

	Since emerging in the late 2010s, the British yelper Yungblud — a.k.a. Doncaster, England-born Dominic Harrison — has become an anti-pop hero. His songs channeled the angst and agitation of youth into frenetic mini-anthems that musically reflected the on-shuffle mentality of the 21st century. Yungblud's voice — a piercing yelp that exists somewhere between Gerard Way's wail and Brian Molko's sneer — slotted him in the alt-rock world, but his aspirations seemed to stretch far beyond that categorization.


	With his fourth album Idols Yungblud harnesses those hopes and takes a very big swing. The 12 songs released this week are the first half of what he's calling a double-album project, with part two slated for release at some point in the future, and this installment's opening track “Hello Heaven, Hello” doubles as a leadoff statement of Yungblud's revitalized ambition. Mutating from a dreamy greeting into a muscular, shape-shifting rock song before taking a hairpin turn into fuzz-shrouded acoustic balladry, the nine-minute cut finds Yungblud reintroducing himself to his audience with equal parts bravado and humility: “All the hopes and dreams I may have borrowed/Just know, my friend, I leave them all to you,” he wails near the song's end before disappearing into a cloud of strings and feedback.

	Yungblud told Rolling Stone Australia that Idols comes “from [my] heart and not from [my] head… it came from within me, and I made this for me.” Its broad scope shows how deep his passion for taking music in unexpected directions can run. “Lovesick Lullaby” recalls the grungy, stompy power-alt-pop of the Nineties, with Yungblud sing-talking through a neurotic inner monologue on the verses before the candy-coated chorus opens up; the bridge brings forward some Brian Wilson-inspired vocal layering; and then everything comes back into the mix for chaos that's as raucous as it is hooky. “The Greatest Parade” is defiantly downcast, its charging rhythms giving heightened importance to Yungblud's withered yowl and world-weary lyrics  (“Now I think I've forgotten/Who I am/Well, can you remind me/Let's write it in the sand”). “Ghosts” is another ambitious offering, pairing ruminations on mortality with stadium-rock grandeur, complete with an outro that possesses a churning splendor in a way that feels like a rebuke of any earthly limitations. (It's one of a few cuts to feature the London Philharmonic, a nod to how much of a force Yungblud has become.)

Idols also shows how Yungblud's bellow is tailor-made for cathartic ballads. “Zombie,” where he exposes his self-loathing (“Would you even want me, looking like a zombie?”) over midtempo riffing, and “War,” which tackles the conflicted feelings dredged up by the demands of stardom — particularly ones made by the people surrounding him whose motivations he can't quite trust. On Idols, Yungblud doesn't entirely ignore the hangers-on and “helpful” outsiders, but he does barrel past them with a hungry bravado that shows why so many have become passionate about his music.

While the classic '80s sitcom “The Golden Girls” has amassed a large gay following, former writer Stan Zimmerman said that the set itself was not as open as some might assume. One co-worker even told Zimmerman to burn thrifted sweaters from a garage sale because they had probably belonged to “somebody that died of AIDS.” But the writer — who later worked on “Gilmore Girls” — said that was just “the climate then.”

“I know you see all these progressive scenes and you think, ‘Oh, it was one big gay party there,' but we couldn't be who we really were,” Zimmerman explained during a Pride LIVE! Hollywood panel (via The Hollywood Reporter). He said that their representatives even advised them to stay in the closet. But he added there was one titular “Golden Girls” gay crew members couldn't fool.

“Our first day on the set, we noticed Estelle [Getty] come running toward us, and she's like … ‘I know. Your secret's safe with me. You're one of us.' I thought she meant Jewish,” he laughed. “But she meant gay. She wasn't gay, but she was probably the first ally ever.” Getty was already deeply entrenched in the queer community, having played Harvey Fierstein's mother in Broadway's “Torch Song Trilogy,” the landmark play (and later film) about a gay, Jewish drag performer.

 










Bea Arthur, too, seemed to have a finely tuned queer radar. Script supervisor Isabel Omero would later come out as transgender decades later, and at one point during the show's long run Arthur offered Omero a sari she had received on a trip to India.

“In my closeted, panicked, paranoid brain, all I knew is that at that moment Bea Arthur was offering me a dress to wear around the house, and I wish I had been in a place where I could have said something, to even accept the gift without ever using it, just so I could express something to someone,” Omero said during the panel. “But fear and shame is a big thing.”

Despite the secrecy of the era, co-producer Jim Vallely said that the series' production team was aware of its large gay following. Several episodes addressed queer issues, including a two-episode arc where Blanche's (Rue McClanahan) brother came out and — in an especially progressive moment — married his partner. “I think [we did the episodes] because we knew… we had a gay audience,” Vallely said. “They would play [the show] in [gay] bars across the country.”

“The Golden Girls” is currently streaming on Hulu and Disney+.

[Editor's note: The following article contains major spoilers for “28 Years Later,” which is in theaters now.]

In “28 Years Later,” the aptly named sequel that comes 28 years after the rage virus ravaged England in “28 Days Later,” we find the lucky humans who survived now in a throwback communal life centered on farming, hunting, tools, customs, and gender roles ripped from a century ago. While on this week's episode of IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast (in full below), director Danny Boyle discussed the contradiction between these humans, protected from the zombie-like infected by life on an island, and the rage virus itself.

“They've learned how to survive, but they haven't really evolved. They've kind of regressed, [going] back to a 1950s-type subsistence living,” Boyle said on the podcast. “ The virus, though, has evolved more creatively.”

The virus has mutated substantially on the mainland, on the other side of the causeway connecting the humans' new island home.

 










“The way [the virus] manifested itself in the first film, it would literally burn itself out, [the zombies] would literally die in front of you,” said Boyle. “The fury, the frenzy, the violence that they have within them, which controls them, is using up so much energy, they would die out quite quickly of malnutrition and dehydration. Now, what they've learned to do is to bypass that. They've learn to hunt so that they can eat, so that they can survive.”

As Boyle explained, the ability to adapt by securing food has resulted in three distinct variants of zombies. The first variant we encounter is the “Slow-Lows,” heavy-set infected humans who don't walk but slug along the moist forest floor on their stomachs.

“There are some creatures who live on the ground, who have obviously decided not to expend energy, and they'll lower their energy expenditure and therefore their nutritional needs as they scavenge on the ground amongst worms and grubs and berries,” said Boyle. “They're much more passive, but dangerous if provoked or alarmed.”

As Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) demonstrates to his 12-year-old son Spike (Alfie Williams), the common Slow-Lows are easy to kill, and with the proper precautions, they don't pose a real threat to humans armed with a bow and arrow. It's a sharp contrast to the rarer, and far more frightening, variants known as “Alphas.”

 










“To hunt without weapons, you would need to organize. It's a natural human instinct that we organize as a pack, which can then hunt together and eat together. The evolution of that is a leader emerges out of that, an ‘Alpha,'” said Boyle. “The virus has had a kind of steroid effect upon those creatures, and they are of a larger scale.”

Also known as the Berserkers, the Alphas are massive. The principal threat in “28 Years Later” is the Alpha known as Samson, who is played by 6-foot-8-inch actor Chi Lewis-Parry (pictured below), an MMA fighter and bodyguard. As muscular as Lewis-Parry already is, special makeup effects supervisor John Nolan added even more muscles on top of his massive frame, especially to his back. In the press notes, Nolan indicated they increased the “proportions of everything about 40 percent” on Samson. Noted Boyle of the Alpha villain, who runs around pretty much naked (and quite well-endowed) for most of the film: “He had a few supplements added to him.”

“Like these big guys often are, he's a gentle giant,” Boyle said of Lewis-Parry. “He's the sweetest man, but on screen, he's absolutely terrifying.”

 










The ferocity with which Samson moves is made visceral by Boyle and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle's up-close-and-personal use of the iPhone cameras to capture the violent speed of the new zombie breed, who are so strong that they rip the skull, with the spine still attached, right out of their victims' bodies.

“That was very much scripted,” said Boyle, crediting screenwriter Alex Garland with the Alphas' disturbing way of finishing off their prey. “I remember reading that thinking, ‘Oh yes!' Because it's a horror movie, so you want to kind of horrify people, and people have to imagine it happening to themselves, really. Anatomically, it probably isn't possible, but it's cool and it's really great and terrifying to see.”

In “28 Years Later,” we also see an extremely thin, almost skin-and-bones zombie variant (pictured at the top of this page), a slight throwback to the first victims of the rage virus in “28 Days Later.” Boyle cryptically offered little explanation of this third variant: “There's a very thin man who clearly, for some reason, he's not capable of [hunting or gathering food like the others].”

“28 Years Later” was written as the first of a trilogy of films. The second film, “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,” has already been shot by director Nia DaCosta and is slated to come out next January. Pointing to the future, Boyle warned audiences that we don't know everything just yet about the adorable and very normal-looking (and seemingly non-infected) baby that Spike and Isla (Jodie Comer) watch a pregnant zombie give birth to before she dies.

 










“There's a fourth [variant], of course, which is even more complicated, which is that the baby arrives from an infected,” said Boyle. “The question which we don't answer deliberately is, ‘Was this woman a survivor who became infected while she was pregnant, or are the infected breeding? Are they having sex and [this is] the natural consequences of that?' So it's kind of multiple evolutions happening, probably, in reality.”

“28 Years Later” is now in theaters.

	First, there's the black and white portrait. It unfolds when you'd open up the CD booklet of Sueño Stereo, Soda Stereo's seminal album, released on June 21, 1995, 30 years ago.


	The photo, taken by Cecilia Amenábar, depicts the iconic Argentine trio — singer/guitarist Gustavo Cerati, bassist Zeta Bosio, drummer Charly Alberti — at work in their private Buenos Aires studio, surrounded by a beautiful mess of guitars, keyboards, amplifiers, a drum kit, and a computer monitor that looks prehistoric by today's standards. Decades later, the picture remains evocative, encapsulating the idealized mystique of everything a rock & roll session is supposed to look like. 


	And the music? It reflects the same kind of majestic, mournful introspection; a flash of genius. A visionary blend of Beatles-esque hooks, thorny psychedelia, Nineties ambient, and South American existentialism, Sueño Stereo is, beyond any reasonable doubt, Soda's tour de force, but also one of Latin rock's most baffling, otherworldly masterpieces — a record that never ceases to surprise and delight. ”

	











	“It was an amazing time,” says Bosio from his home in Miami. “At that stage, we were completely in sync. When we played together it felt like we were a single being instead of three different people. Many of the Sueño Stereo songs stemmed from us improvising together at Supersónico, an old, now demolished  home in the Belgrano neighborhood of Buenos Aires that we turned into a studio. The music poured out. We recorded jam sessions in DAT, and they quickly developed into completed songs.”

	“A long time had elapsed between albums; when we reconvened, there was a moment of hesitation,” Alberti recalls. “And then we asked ourselves: What if instead of looking ahead into the future, like we always do, we take a breather and look at ourselves? I'm not talking about reversion, but rather the idea of Soda looking at Soda. Why don't we make it a point to sound like ourselves for once?”

	In retrospect, Soda never really sounded like Soda, as the trio's restless identity kept morphing from album to album since the release of its new wave inflected 1984 debut. And because the band quickly became the official ambassador of stadium-sized rock en español throughout Latin America, every stylistic shift, every reinvention was scrutinized by fans and critics alike. In 1992, Sueño Stereo's predecessor, Dynamo, offered a grand experiment in shoegaze. But once they were done touring behind it, everything went south.


	On July 4, 1994, a car transporting Bosio's two young children was rammed by a colectivo — the Buenos Aires public buses, often manned by notoriously aggressive drivers. The car caught fire, one of Bosio's sons died on the scene, while the other one — now a musician himself — suffered severe burns.


	Understandably, the tragedy brought the band closer together. Even though Cerati had already released a solo album — 1993's esoteric Amor Amarillo — and harbored the desire to dismantle Soda, he pushed for the trio to reconvene, thinking perhaps that making music would provide a modicum of healing.


	“By the time we started work on Sueño, we had gone through hell and back,” says Alberti.


	“For Zeta, it was the toughest moment,” says producer and keyboardist Tweety González, who toured extensively with the band. “His son was only three years old and died in the most horrific way. On top of that, even though it wasn't verbalized, there was a sense that this would be the band's last album. As could be expected, those feelings seeped into the record.”


	Not surprisingly, the album's 12 tracks appear to float in some sort of amorphous realm, halfway between the kingdom of the living and a subaquatic, amniotic abyss. The electronica elements that permeate the record — the machine-made whirring on “Pasos,” the guitar reverb at the conclusion of “Disco Eterno” —give the songs a languid, dreamlike quality. Only the brassy minor hit “Paseando por Roma,” Cerati's musical fantasy about riding a Vespa on the streets of the Italian capital, has the propulsive punch of previous Soda anthems.

	For a band that rehearsed furiously and relished the chance to generate songs out of spontaneous jams, employing electronica had a liberating effect. Having switched labels, from Sony to the more controlling Ariola/BMG, Soda considered kick-starting their new record deal with a double album.


	“It was named Sueño Stereo because the original conceit was to do a bit of mischief and have two separate records,” says Bosio with a grin. “One would house the more conventional pop songs, and the other would be totally ambient, inspired by the bands that we loved at the time: The Orb, Aphex Twin, and Orbital.”


	Sadly, the label would have none of that experimental nonsense. Eager to recoup the initial investment, they pushed for a more commercial release.


	“That was the duality that plagued us,” reflects Bosio. “We were a famous pop band, but with a rebellious attitude and an alternative edge. Sony had given us more freedom in that respect.”


	More to the point, the sessions had yet to yield a proper lead single. According to Bosio, Cerati decried the absence of an in-your-face tune like the 1990 smash “De Música Ligera.” Even Dynamo had yielded the rollicking “Primavera 0.”


	“We went back to the studio, started playing a chorus, and just like that, we wrote ‘Ella Usó Mi Cabeza Como Un Revólver' in a single session,” says the bassist. “There was only a part missing, and we were whistling where the string section was supposed to be.”


	With its strains of Cerati's guitar, echoey electronic textures and an imperial keyboard line that evoked an aura of cinematic decadence, “Ella Usó Mi Cabeza Como Un Revólver” was not only Sueño's triumphant opening cut, but also a clear indication of how sophisticated and articulate the trio's vision had become. Flaunting their Beatles influences like never before, it was as powerful and finely crafted as anything by Radiohead or Massive Attack. Latin rock had arrived.


	“Gustavo was incredibly brave in his aesthetic choices,” says Alejandro Terán, who contributed string arrangements and played viola on the album. “He would jump into the void laughing like a madman, without a care in the world. The most beautiful part of it was that he would carry you by the hand with that gaze of his, so electric and serene at the same time. He was also fascinated with silence.


	“Even though I didn't play on it, I have a soft spot for Sueño Stereo,” says González, who missed the sessions because he was busy working on Fito Páez's Circo Beat. “When I finally listened to it, I wanted to kill myself. ‘Ella Usó Mi Cabeza' is so epic, like a miniature rock opera. I think it's their finest moment.”

	











	In reality, the zenith of Sueño Stereo — and, arguably, of the entire Argentine rock movement — arrives at the tail end of the album, when Soda bids farewell to the world and fades into oblivion in a suite of three interconnected songs inspired by Cerati's experiences with psychotropic substances: “Planta,” an orchestral rocker with Floydian undertones; “X-Playo,” the only surviving fragment of the shipwrecked ambient record; and “Moirè,” a delicate, hallucinogenic slice of folktronica with abstract lyrics (“cerrá la escotilla, nena, que no hay gravedad,”) and Cerati's voice sounding even more regal than usual. 


	“It's meant to be the perfect goodbye,” explains Bosio. “Inspired by those Seventies records that ended with a medley, like Pink Floyd, or Paul McCartney and Wings. You also see that in the B side of Abbey Road; the band bidding farewell. ‘X-Playo' is a weird track. We connected two MIDI islands with Gustavo, and recorded a bunch of experimental electronica that was subtle and smooth.”


	“Those are the darkest songs in the album — no wonder they show up at the end,” adds González. “It's quite a cinematic record, filled with imagery. Gustavo's intros lasted well over a minute — he could generate a mood even before he started singing. When you listen to Sueño, you realize what music was about in those days. Unlike today.”


	The Sueño journey was not over yet. The trio traveled to London, where Cerati refined his vocal tracks, and the album was mixed by recording engineer Clive Goddard.


	“I think mixing it in England gave it an international flavor,” Bosio says. “Gustavo didn't care for hi-hats, and the English happen to love them,” Alberti adds. “The finished album sounds so incredibly well balanced because it was mixed by someone who clearly knew what he was doing.”


	Still, no amount of artistic success could heal the rift that had poisoned the group. In his book Algún tiempo atrás — La vida de Gustavo Cerati, veteran journalist Sergio Marchi describes Cerati lunging at Alberti and grabbing him by the throat on a bus ride in Tegucigalpa during the Sueño tour.


	“Musically, we were in a moment of glory and could have continued making great records,” says Bosio. “On a personal level, it was over. Such is the reality of bands. If one member doesn't want to do it anymore, it's impossible to keep going.”

	











	“Gustavo wanted to carry on without the other two and play with other people,” says Marchi from Buenos Aires. “It's like a guy who has been with the same girl since he was a teenager. Naturally, he wants to date other women. This wasn't about Zeta or Charly not being good enough musicians. Gustavo was already out.”


	“His creative leadership had become increasingly huge,” González agrees. “It was sort of like The Police, where Sting had all the power and everyone else was dependent on the genius of the almighty singer/songwriter. The proof is in the pudding: Where are all the great albums made by Soda's other members? For better or for worse, it's the actual work that speaks volumes about who you are.”


	Cerati's solo career vindicated him as one of the most transcendent artists in Latin music. Eventually, he reconciled with Bosio and Alberti for a successful comeback tour in 2007. There were even rumors of a new studio album.


	But while on tour in Caracas, Cerati suffered a stroke in 2010 and remained in a coma for four years, until he passed away in September of 2014. He was 55.

	“Soda was going to continue,” says Alberti. “Gustavo and I talked over the phone, had a good cry together, and told each other everything that we weren't able to voice out in person. On Sueño we sounded free like never before. I think it's the best record we ever made.”


	“Sueño has a darkness to it that reflects everything that was going on,” Bosio says. “When we were mixing in London, I would wake up early in the morning and walk to a kindergarten nearby in the hope that my son would suddenly show up. I thought that maybe I would be able to reunite with him in England. When you are processing grief, your mind can play tricks like that.”

	Paul T. Riddle knows that he's prone to shed a tear or two when the right moment strikes. He's the first to admit he gets choked up during soft-hearted TV advertisements or when “Silent Night” comes across grocery store speakers during the holiday season. 


	So, on a Monday morning when Riddle, a longtime drummer and co-founding member of the Marshall Tucker Band, called to talk about his late bandmate Toy Caldwell, he got a little misty-eyed.


	“Mine and Toy's thing was the music,” says Riddle, a soft-spoken 71-year-old who shares stories in a steady drawl adopted from his South Carolina upbringing. “It was always our bond, since I was 17. He turned me on to so much music.” 


	And who could blame Riddle for showing a little emotion? For nearly a decade-and-a-half, he's simmered on a way to celebrate the country, soul, and Southern rock stew once brewed by his late friend on songs like “Take the Highway,” “Heard It in a Love Song” and, of course, “Can't You See.” This weekend, Riddle finally delivers a steaming plate of Caldwell-inspired melodies at Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Colorado, where his newly formed supergroup — Toy Factory Project — plays the tastemaking four-night event alongside Jason Isbell & the 400 Unit, Greensky Bluegrass, and Alison Krauss & Union Station. 

	











	Headlining Saturday night at Telluride may be a tall order for a debut gig, but Riddle plans to bring along a lineup of seasoned players. Toy Factory Project includes ace guitarman Marcus King, Dead & Co. bassist Oteil Burbridge, Blackberry Smoke frontman-guitarist Charlie Starr, and sought-after Nashville keys player Josh Shilling.

	“We just wanted to play these songs,” Riddle says. “Play versions of these songs the way we play ‘em. We know what to keep – those great hooks and everything. Outside of that, I want us to put our stamp on it.” 


	The project arrives after 13 years of start-and-stop planning from Riddle and a rotating cast of friends (Caldwell died in 1993; singer Doug Gray continued to front a touring version of the Marshall Tucker Band after Caldwell and Riddle left the group in 1984). A well-respected and arguably under-appreciated drummer in rock circles, Riddle shared long conversations — many with Vince Gill, who provided a shoulder to lean on when he needed it — and once booked studio time for a Caldwell-inspired project. Still, it wasn't until he saw a YouTube video of King belting “Can't You See” (“Ripping the neck off his grandaddy's 335,” Riddle says) that he knew it was time. He wrangled the band, including Burbridge, a supporter since the beginning, and decamped to Peter Frampton's studio in Nashville's Berry Hill neighborhood to lay down a few songs.

	Burbridge stuck with the project for years “100 percent because of Paul,” he says. “If you meet Paul, you're going to be in love with him in 15 seconds. And if you're not … that says way more about you than him.” 


	Others in the band, like King and Starr, were raised on a curriculum of Caldwell riffs and Riddle rhythms. Today, those songs are synonymous with a Southern sound that inspired a generation of players raised on rock & roll storytelling, honky-tonk riffs, and blues showmanship in equal measure. 


	To King, Caldwell and his bandmates helped build a home for himself, Starr, and others who straddle the line in country-rock. 


	“[My grandfather would] have me on a pretty heavy regimen of Waylon Jennings, Marshall Tucker Band, George Jones and Merle Haggard,” King says. “Then my dad would come home and he would put me on to rock & roll and the blues. The one artist I saw cross over in both of their playlists was the Marshall Tucker Band. They were country enough to hit the country crowd. They were rock & roll enough to hit the rock & roll crowds. Hell, they would play swing music, at times.”

	And some of King's earliest guitar riffs were Caldwell covers. “The first time I got an overdrive pedal and I wanted to test it out, the go-to was ‘Can't You See,' he says. “My grandfather was like, ‘Turn that shit off. Toy Caldwell would turn over in his grave if he heard that.'” 

	











	King's come a long way since testing out that pedal. Last month, he invited Starr, Shilling, and Riddle to crash a Grand Ole Opry performance. They teased Toy Factory Project with a rollicking rendition of “This Ol' Cowboy.” 


	“My manager was there, Trey Wilson, and he was laughin' when we were done,” Starr says. “He said, ‘I think that was the longest jam that's probably ever happened at the Grand Ole Opry.'” 


	In the studio, band members approached the songs with fresh ears, swapping flute for fiddle or adding Hammond B3 organ for touches of warmth. Largely cut on the floor, the songs only took a few takes to capture. Listeners shouldn't expect a carbon-copy of past hits with polished production. Instead of tracking a blow-by-blow retelling, the album plays like a reintroduction where the notes feel familiar, but sound new again. 


	A release date for the album is to-be-announced; guests on the album include Frampton, Gill, and others. 


	“It was magic,” says Shilling, reflecting on the first note he heard from the band. “It was the biggest sound — still is the biggest sound — I've heard in my headphones, and I've been a session player since I was young… We were just in there having a ball, and the record feels that way because of that.”

	Can that magic be defined? “I don't know if I have the vocabulary to explain or describe that, but I want to sing those songs,” Starr says. “There are tons of songs I hear every day that I definitely don't want to sing. Toy Caldwell songs are not that way. They're the songs you want to sing.” 


	And when Toy Factory Project hits the stage for the first time this weekend, Riddle's likely to hear a few folks singing along to his friend's sweet melodies. When he does, it may be hard for him not to tear up at the sound.

As “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum Teddi Mellencamp continues treatment for stage four cancer,  she is savoring quality time with the people she cares about most, including the mystery man she's been dating for nearly a month. 

On June 20, 2025, Mellencamp, 43, opened up on the latest episode of her “Diamonds in the Rough: Dear Diamonds” podcast to friend and RHOBH star Erika Jayne about the man she's been dating while navigating her divorce from husband Edwin Arroyave. 

The former couple, who share three children, announced their split in November before her stage four diagnosis and brain surgery in February. Although Arroyave has been supportive and even moved back in to help care for Mellencamp, they're moving forward with an amicable split. 

During her podcast, Mellencamp confirmed she's still dating the unidentified man that the Daily Mail photographed her with in early June, telling Jayne, 53, that her new beau is “really sweet and kind” and that she's been very honest about her complicated situation with him.

While navigating her divorce and coping with learning her skin cancer, which she'd been battling since 2022, had metastasized to stage four, Mellencamp said she's had to be very intentional and direct as she explored dating. 

She explained, “I've had to make it clear to people I've dated, like, ‘Listen, kind of this is where I am. This is what I've got. If it's enough for you, great. If it's not enough for you, I understand. I won't be upset.'”

“I mean, yes, my feelings will probably be hurting,” Mellencamp admitted, “but like, this is all I've got to give. And if that's enough, great.”

When Jayne asked if she was “still dating the same guy,” Mellencamp replied, “I am still dating the same guy. And I haven't had to say any of those things. But he is really sweet. Sweet and kind.” 

As an example, Mellencamp, who regularly rides horses with her 12-year-old daughter Slate, shared that earlier in the week, her beau “could, like, tell that I was down.” She said he didn't mind sitting with her and watching “like one million hours of horse show rounds. Like, he's just a good guy.” 

“Listen, you so deserve that,” Jayne told her, to which Mellencamp replied, “One, I know I deserve it and it's really nice. But, two, I'm like, ‘If for some reason you realize you need somebody that doesn't have three kids, one million activities to do, 87 podcasts, like (if) you want more time than I'm able to give, I would not be mad at you for not even a second.' He's like, ‘I am willing to do anything to be able to spend time with you.'” 

A post shared by Two Ts In A Pod (@two.ts.inapod)

Jayne, who clashed with Mellencamp when they were co-stars on RHOBH, said that she has met the entrepreneur's mystery man and witnessed how “sweet” he can be. 

She recalled on the podcast, “Do you know what he said to me in the driveway when I first met him and he had to move his car? ‘Teddy's such a really good girl.' And I said, ‘Yeah, she really is.' I mean, he has a very sweet spirit about him.” 

At first, Mellencamp wondered aloud why her beau thinks that about her, but then said, “I know this sounds bananas, but I think I've changed as a human being.”

Jayne agreed, noting how helpful Mellencamp has been during her own challenging month and adding that she'd recently had a conversation about Mellencamp with her “best friend” about all the ways she'd supported her during her own hard things. 

“And I said, ‘I think that Teddy has uncovered a new level of empathy,'” Jayne said. 

“Want to know what's weird?” Mellencamp asked. “I give hugs now. Because you know, I felt whatit feels like to maybe never have another. So I definitely feel like I have a softer side to me.”

When you're just starting out as an actor, wrestling with reservations about taking on a particular role, especially when it could pay a few bills or even your rent, poses a challenge. 

Then again, actors who go the distance tend to work with intention instead of throwing themselves at anything and everything. In the latest episode of “What No One Tells You,” William Stanford Davis (aka Mr. Johnson on “Abbott Elementary“) told IndieWire's Future of Filmmaking that while “people are afraid to say no,” that one word is key to setting yourself apart.

 










“They think that saying no means that you're not gonna get a job,” said Davis, “or that some type of bad spell is gonna be put on you because you said the word ‘no.' The word ‘no' is one of the most important things you can say in this business.”

Davis cited a test he gave while teaching acting classes in Los Angeles, where he asked students if they were willing to do nudity. Many, as he said, immediately responded, “Oh, yeah, sure,” but to Davis, this meant, “They didn't think about the question.” If they're willing to do nudity, that's absolutely fine, but not even trying to understand why your character might strip down indicates they would “do anything for a job.” Instead of just saying yes to everything, actors should consider why they're the best fit for a role and use that to guide their choices instead.

 










Besides advising what to say “no” to, Davis also highlighted why actors should “always be learning.” By keeping their minds open, actors can tap into new ways of performing to elevate their presence.

“For me, it was just some little things, like every experience we have is filtered through your five senses,” Davis told Future of Filmmaking. “That was like, ‘Oh my God,' that was like an ‘Aha!' moment for me. That was like, ‘Ok, I can stop pretending. I can stop acting. I can only just behave now.'”

He added, “Emotion for emotion's sake is a lie. Emotion has to be based on the truth, and if I'm telling the truth all the time — if I'm really locked in — the truth of what this character's going through, the emotion's gonna be there to save me. It takes a tremendous amount of study to perfect it, and I don't think anyone perfects it. I think you're constantly learning, you're constantly growing.”

The boy band puts fans front & center for fun, escapist Vegas debut.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	LAS VEGAS — While New Kids on the Block might seem like a perfect fit for Las Vegas, the veteran boy band had somehow never found themselves with a Sin City residency — until Friday night (June 20).


	The Right Stuff residency kicked off night 1 at Dolby Live at Park MGM, with NKOTB gracing a stage previously headlined by Usher, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga, Mariah Carey and more superstars. But when the Boston boys were getting started 40 years ago, they had a different perception of Vegas than the entertainment destination it's become.


	“When you're young, you think you're really cool,” Jordan Knight told Billboard on Friday ahead of the residency kick-off. “And if somebody said, ‘You guys are going to be doing Vegas in your 50s,' my thought probably back then would be like, ‘Oh no, no. That's so corny. … That's where acts just retire.' But us doing this right now, I feel like we're being true to ourselves, really. I don't think we're selling out to commercialism or Vegas or whatever it may be. I think we're just being really true to ourselves. Yes, we have some bells and whistles, but I think we're just using it really tastefully.”


	There were definitely bells and whistles — like the high-flying moment that saw all five members hoisted up among the rafters in individual telephone booths to get as close as possible to every fan in the 5,000-capacity venue — but at its core, this was the New Kids show that their Blockhead superfans have come to expect. That is, the once-teenybopper pop stars (now ranging in age from 52 to 56) left every drop of energy, enthusiasm and love they had on the stage to put on a fun, escapist show in their new home of Vegas, with dates through February. That included the megahits, of course — “Step by Step,” “Hangin' Tough” and the residency's namesake “You Got It (The Right Stuff)” — but it also included gems from every one of the band's seven non-Christmas studio albums, all the way back to their 1986 self-titled debut.


	For his part, Jonathan Knight is finding that he's able to enjoy things at this stage of the band's career more than those chaotic early days. “When we started, we were just kids,” Jonathan told Billboard just before the show. “I think when we look back at that, nobody prepares you for this. I mean, I would never think at 56 years old, I would be in Vegas, when I was 20. Just being able to, for me personally, just being here, being in the moment, I mean back then, it was just such a blur.”


	To keep Friday night's show from becoming a blur, Billboard has rounded up the five best moments from New Kids' nonstop fun opening night.


	Between the massive main stage that opened with a life-size replica of a Boston train atop a grand staircase and a shortcut through the pit of fans to a catwalk lined with barstools of concertgoers, there was a lot of ground to cover for the New Kids — and they made sure to use every square inch. There was also a Jamiroquai-evoking conveyor belt at the middle of the staircase that made for some eye-popping choreography and even a functioning convertible that drove the quintet out for “Kids.” Each member never stopped moving throughout the show to make sure they were reaching all angles of the venue, including when they all made their way into the crowd for Hangin' Tough‘s “Tonight,” with Joey McIntyre even plopping down in one lucky fan's lap. All these touches made it clear this was a special concert.


	Oh yeah, they weren't always contained to the stage or the crowd either. The night's first aerial moment came when Jordan Knight performed his Billboard Hot 100 top 10 solo hit “Give It to You” and, inspired by the song's carnival-themed music video, he buckled himself into a Ferris wheel gondola that floated high across the stage. All the guys got in on the action for “The Whisper,” from 2013's 10 album, with each stepping into individual telephone-booth-like pods to be lifted above the crowd. At first, it looked like they were only going to make it above the 100 and 200 sections — but then they kept elevating until they were eye to eye with the ecstatic fans in the balcony.


	The precarious nature of the flying pods was not lost on the guys, as they all embraced once they were back on the stage and sighed, “We made it!”


	When the instrumental of Bruno Mars' “Marry You” started playing and the words “NKOTB Chapel” flashed on the big screen, Donnie Wahlberg asked the crowd who among them thought they might marry a member of New Kids on the Block one day. After a string of screams, the screen shared social media posts from the countless fans who were under the impression they would be Mrs. McIntyre, Knight, Wood or Wahlberg someday. (Though Wahlberg pointed out that his wife Jenny McCarthy was not among the posts: “She thought she would marry one of the Mötley Crüe,” he laughed.) So the boy band did the next best thing and married all their fans at once on Friday night.


	“Do you, New Kids, take these Blockheads to be your forever fans, so long as we both shall live?” Wahlberg asked his bandmates, to which they all responded: “I do.”


	“Do you, Blockheads, take these New Kids to be your forever boy band, forsaking all other boy bands — that means *NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, O-Town, One Direction, all of them — so long as we both shall live?” Wahlberg cheekily asked the screaming crowd, who apparently had no trouble abandoning all those other groups to commit to New Kids on the Block once and for all.


	In addition to the quickie wedding, some other Vegas-specific touches included the boys' Rat Pack-inspired second act, with coordinated suits and a classic New Kids on the Block casino sign, plus a mash-up of Britney Spears' “Toxic” with Elvis Presley's “Viva Las Vegas” during their infamous quick change backstage camera segment.


	Speaking of those fans, they were front and center quite a few times throughout the concert. (As McIntyre told us ahead of the show: “We're gonna take care of our high rollers, you know what I'm saying? We gotta take care of our die-hards first.”) And nowhere was that love clearer than when Wahlberg got choked up reflecting on the four decades this fandom has stuck by their sides. “It's been forty years [as a band], 37 since we all found each other on various radio stations and MTV,” Wahlberg said, wiping away tears. “And you never cease to amaze us. Wow. Thank you. We love you. We appreciate you, we respect you, and we thank you.”


	The fans showed that appreciation right back, especially when they screamed and applauded for two straight minutes after the boys finished “You Got It (The Right Stuff)” as the unexpectedly early eighth song of an eventual 27-song set.


	A lot was made throughout the night of the boy band's longevity, and it doesn't seem like they have any plans to slow down soon.


	“We've been hanging tough for 40 years,” Wahlberg said before the final performance of (you guessed it) “Hangin' Tough,” the Hot 100-topping title track from their 1988 breakthrough album. “Can we hang tough for 40 more?”


	Judging by the opening night crowd's enthusiasm, that shouldn't be a problem.

The two-hour concert spanned all four decades of their time as a band.

	LAS VEGAS — For New Kids on the Block‘s first-ever Las Vegas residency — which kicked off Friday night (June 20) at Dolby Live at Park MGM — the veteran boy band had a lot of ground to cover in their night 1 setlist.


	As they explained onstage, Joey McIntyre officially joined the group in June 1985, meaning they're celebrating 40 years together this year. So how do you cover four decades of music in one two-hour concert?


	When Billboard caught up with the Kids on Friday ahead of their Sin City debut, they explained that they were trying to serve their Blockhead fanbase with the song selection while not alienating the casual Vegas fans just looking for a show while they're in town.


	“Sometimes if you're playing to the superfan, you can do deeper and deeper cuts, but we wanted to give them surprises that they haven't seen before but also keep it tight enough for the regular Las Vegas person that's just in town to go to see a show,” Jordan Knight explained to Billboard. “We want to keep it moving fast so they're entertained as well.”


	McIntyre made it clear that their superfans are always their main priority — putting it in terms Las Vegas can definitely understand. “We're gonna take care of our high rollers, you know what I'm saying? We know we gotta take care of our die-hards first.”


Billboard was in the house for night 1 of The Right Stuff residency, and below we have the full night 1 setlist. Stay tuned for our full recap of the opening night.

EXCLUSIVE: Warner Bros. Pictures will release Chinese co-produced animated feature Tom and Jerry: Forbidden Compass on August 9 in China.

Tom and Jerry: Forbidden Compass follows the iconic cat-and-mouse duo as they accidentally travel through time in a museum. Along their journey, they meet a group of intriguing new companions and become involved in a final showdown with mysterious forces.

	Chinese director Zhang Gang helmed the project, after previously co-directing Kuiba 3.


	Zhang also worked on the animation for No.7 Cherry Lane, which won the Best Screenplay Award in the main competition section at the Venice International Film Festival in 2019.


	This is not the first time that Warner Bros. has adapted the Tom and Jerry IP into a localized version for an Asian market. 


	In 2023, WBD made its first-ever localized version of Tom and Jerry, set in Singapore. This premiered as a series of shorts on Cartoon Network and HBO Go across various Asian territories, before a global rollout.


	Another series of Tom and Jerry shorts was also made for Japanese audiences.


	This year marks the 85th anniversary of Tom and Jerry, after the duo was first created in 1940 as an animated cartoon series by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.

It looks like drama is already bubbling in the “Real Housewives” world, again! Lisa Rinna, longtime star of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” is spilling some seriously hot tea about what really goes on behind the cameras.

In a new interview, Rinna claimed there is significant “pre-planning” involved in the show, specifically orchestrated by producers. She even revealed that during filming, “an editor sits in the back room and writes down everything.”

If we're being honest, it's not a total shocker, but it's still juicy. So we're here for it!

The actress-turned-reality-star, who spent eight seasons lighting up RHOBH with chaotic fashion and iconic one-liners, is finally confirming what fans have long suspected. In her words? The show is “very pre-planned.”

Known for her bold looks, catchphrases, and never being far from the drama (hello, wine glass toss), Rinna was one of RHOBH's most talked-about figures. Now, she's getting candid about the reality behind the reality show.

“There's a lot of people behind the scenes—a lot of people that make a show like that work,” Rinna said while on the “Don't Talk About The Husbands” podcast. “It looks very effortless. You see us, say, at a lunch scene. It's set up before—everybody gets an email saying that it's coming up on Saturday, maybe in two weeks… You know that you're going to someone's house; you're going to show up at this time. They send cars for you [so] you get driven there because they don't want you to drink and drive.”

She continued, “There's usually three cameras around you. It's usually set up around an event or a lunch, or a party. There's a lot of pre-planning that goes on. There's a lot of producers. It can go on for hours at a time… You never really know when it's going to end.”

Big yikes. So much for spur-of-the-moment drama.

Though Rinna announced her exit from RHOBH in early 2023, after years of stirring the pot and dividing the fanbase, she's not quite done with reality TV.

With Season 14 of “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” bringing in new cast members and reigniting old feuds, fans are already questioning just how “real” reality TV is.

“They decide they want this person here first. So there's planning in that kind of stuff. There was waiting in the car a lot of times,” Rinna revealed. “Then they come out to your car, they mic you in your car—they have to put a mic on your back—and then they wait for something to happen.”

Even her husband, actor Harry Hamlin, chimed in with a behind-the-scenes tidbit: “The amount of film that is actually run through those cameras relative to the amount that shows up on the TV screen… the editors go through hundreds and hundreds of hours of footage to find 42 minutes of film.”

And speaking of editors, Rinna had even more to say. “I feel so sorry for those editors. They literally have somebody in a back room. So let's say we're filming at someone's house — they would take a little back room and set up a monitor. There's somebody there writing down everything everyone is saying in a scene. [They do this to] figure out what to use and where to go, and keep track.”

So while the glitz, glam, and tears may look spontaneous, it turns out much of it is mapped out long before the first sip of rosé.

If you're already missing Rinna's signature sass (and frankly, who isn't?), you'll be happy to know she's stepping into another reality space.

Rinna is set to join the cast of “The Traitors” Season 4, the Emmy-winning reality competition show hosted by Alan Cumming. And she won't be alone. The new season is serving a spicy cocktail of Bravo-lebs, reality stars, Olympians, and our favorite contestant already, the best Kelce out there. Momma Donna Kelce. 

YES, Travis & Jason Kelce's mom. WILD, we're already obsessed!

With that stacked cast, expect nothing short of high-stakes deception, drama, and, of course, Lisa Rinna's signature smirk.

Here's the confirmed cast for “The Traitors” Season 4, airing in 2026:

While filming Hallmark's latest installment of its popular “Hannah Swensen Mysteries” franchise, Victor Webster realized he had so much fun learning to tango with co-star Alison Sweeney, he's up for a little more dancing — potentially even on live TV. 

The dynamic duo, who play Detective Chad Norton and baker-turned-sleuther Hannah Swensen, had to take dance lessons for a scene that appears in “Pie to Die For: A Hannah Swensen Mystery,” premiering June 22 on Hallmark Channel. 

“Ali definitely picked it up much faster than I did,” Webster told EntertainmentNow, but once he got the hang of it, he said he really enjoyed it, admitting he'd even be open to waltzing onto the cast of ABC's “Dancing With the Stars.” 

A post shared by Ali Sweeney (@alisweeney)

In addition to rehearsing the actual dance steps for their upcoming movie, Webster and Sweeney also had to hold poses as their director — and fellow Hallmark star — Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe captured gorgeous overhead angles and a dramatic scene-ending dip. Webster told EntertainmentNow they “had a great time doing the scene,” but he acknowledged that freezing in place as he and Sweeney looked into each others' eyes during that dip wasn't the easiest thing to film.

“You know, I talked with Ali about it the other day,” he said, “and she was like, ‘One of the hardest things was, you know, to look super relaxed and comfortable while you're, like, laying backwards and being held up and like, you can't put any stress in your neck.' You see stuff on screen — you can't compare that to real life. Like, we have to go through a lot to make that look real, right?”

“Nobody holds that pose,” he said, adding, “Well, maybe somebody on ‘Dancing with the Stars' does.” 

When EntertainmentNow asked if he'd consider competing on DWTS, Webster said, “You know why I would do it? I'm not a reality TV guy, and that's more of a competition show, but my goddaughter wants me to be on that show so badly.” 

Smiling as he thought of his goddaughter Eden, he said, “Like, once a month (she asks), ‘Will you go? Will you go on?' Like, I can't just snap my fingers, sweetheart, and then be on ‘Dancing with the Stars!' But if somebody asked me to do it? For her, I would.”

These days, Webster's open to all kinds of experiences that expand his horizons and zest for life — whether learning to dance, connecting with fans at events like the upcoming Hallmark Christmas Experience and fan cruise with Kristoffer Polaha, or diving into favorite hobbies, including photography and travel. 

Webster told EntertainmentNow that the latest thing he's tried is stand-up comedy. He's been taking a class in Vancouver and will perform his first live set as part of a private graduation event a few days after the “Pie to Die For” premiere. 

“It scares the heck out of me,” Webster admitted, but that's why he decided to do it. “Yeah, I just want to do things that scare me and make me feel alive. I don't know that I want to do stand-up comedy as a job or profession, but I'm doing it because it scares me.” 

Webster said his comedy material is all about dogs, based on his bond with his beloved pup, Nova. 

“I find it incredibly funny,” he said, beaming. “There might be crickets in the audience, but whatever. I find dog stuff incredibly hilarious, stuff that they do. Like, what if humans did the things to other humans that dogs do to each other? So there's a lot of stuff around that I think dog owners will really appreciate.” 

“Pie to Die For: A Hannah Swensen Mystery” premieres on Hallmark Channel at 8 p.m. Eastern time on Hallmark Channel.

	After a federal judge confirmed Donald Trump‘s control of the California National Guard, the Los Angeles Dodgers are giving back to those in the community impacted by recent ICE raids.


	On Friday, the 8x World Series champs announced a $1 million donation in partnership with the City of Los Angeles, as well as several local organizations, to provide financial assistance for families of immigrants impacted by the raids.


	“What's happening in Los Angeles has reverberated among thousands upon thousands of people, and we have heard the calls for us to take a leading role on behalf of those affected,” said Dodgers president and CEO Stan Kasten. “We believe that by committing resources and taking action, we will continue to support and uplift the communities of Greater Los Angeles.”

	Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement, “I want to thank the Dodgers for leading with this action to support the immigrant community of Los Angeles. These last weeks have sent shockwaves of fear rippling through every neighborhood and have had a direct impact on our economy. My message to all Angelenos is clear: We will stick together during this time and we will not turn our backs on one another — that's what makes this the greatest city in the world.”


	After the MLB team and the city previously joined forces to dispense financial resources to those in need during the Southern California wildfires in January, they're encouraging local organizations to step up in a similar way as they did during the natural disaster to assist with food insecurity, basic essentials and mental health services.

	











	The organizations involved in the latest initiative include the California Community Foundation and the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor.


	Under a very targeted reading of an obscure statute, Trump moved to federalize the Golden State National Guard on June 7 without Newsom's consent in response to protests over a flood of ICE raids in and around LA on June 6. Since then the parties have traded insults over social media and mainstream media, as well as been in and out of court as citizens have taken to the streets, federal buildings have become make-shift detention centers for immigrants hauled in by masked and often no warrant producing agents, and a curfew was placed on DTLA for over a week.

			By Dominic Patten, Ted Johnson 


EXCLUSIVE: After years of playing polite, California's governor and senior senator are now taking on Donald Trump with bare knuckled barbs in his favorite forum and looking to do some damage to POTUS and his MAGA agenda — as JD Vance‘s trip to the Golden State on Friday made very clear.


	“Things really changed for us on Sunday, June 8, when the president was prepping to deploy the military on American streets,” Gavin Newsom senior advisor Robert Salladay detailed to Deadline on what provoked the usually circumspect two-term Democrat to take to the digital barricades. “That broke the dam  — what he was doing was so outrageous, so deranged, it needed a sustained, creative response.”

	











	“So the governor and the whole team deployed their talents at an entirely different level, across all levels of communication, from X to his public address that went out to millions,” Salladay added in reference to Newsom's social media presence, lawsuit against Trump, and his “the moment we have feared has arrived” speech of June 10. “That means serious posts, fact-checking, and for sure, sarcasm and humor when needed.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Sarcasm and humor being very much the vibe in at least one “very generous” take from Newsom's press office on Vance's visit today:

It was very generous of the Vice President to take time out of his closed-door fundraiser to stage a photo op in front of a fire truck — where he mistakenly called a Latino U.S. Senator “Jose.” We are grateful for his visit!


	Praised as “brilliant, exactly meeting the moment,” by one Hollywood image maker Deadline spoke to, part of Newsom's response the past two weeks has been making it personal within the political. 

	











	Calling out Trump for being a would-be dictator, a fear monger, under the thumb of Santa Monica resident and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, and disturbingly “confused again,” Newsom's approach has been to flood the zone of the OG zone flooder.

You pulled National Guard from my command — who were literally doing this work — to stand around in front of a building in LA.Does the President of the United States not understand what his troops do?Is he confused again?Deeply disturbing. https://t.co/qjJZu9gDL9

MAGA =Miller ActuallyGovernsAmerica pic.twitter.com/RK1AAa4qsS


	As but one of many other examples since the federalizing of the National Guard that “creative response” Salloway spoke of was obvious on June 20. 


	In a one-two punch Newsom delivered to JD Vance, the governor played both sides on the street when the White House suddenly announced the VP was coming to L.A. 


	Vance was in town ostensibly to visit law enforcement and the military, but the VP is attending a locally held RNC summer retreat too. Revealed by the White House early Friday, Vance's West Coast visit t came less than a day after Newsom came up short in another court bid to regain control of the National Guard from Trump via a temporary restraining order, and the two went head-to-head on social media. The seesaw continued Friday as Trump once again slagged the Governor with the nickname “Newscum” while in a scrum with reporters


	That swipe and Vance's visit also occurred as a  federal judge in Newsom's old stomping ground of San Francisco today punted on a preliminary injunction request by the Governor against Trump's command of the troops. 


	Pre-empting the anticipated slags and trolling from Vance once the VP was on the ground in LA, Newsom first offered his earnest side, the same bipartisan view that has characterized his MAGA tolerant podcast launched earlier this year. Speaking directly to camera in the post with advice for Vance and, with respect to the executive branch, a plea for help with the flattery friendly Trump for victims of the wildfires from earlier this year:

I just read JD Vance is coming into town. pic.twitter.com/mPUjgoE4uC


	Then, not long afterwards, there was a shiv of L.A. love meets GOP propaganda from the Democrat with a bit of classic Ice Cube and Terminator tossed in 1990s style:

A post shared by Gavin Newsom (@gavinnewsom)


	Just today, while taking on Vance was serious fun and games, the real audience and mark for the newly aggressive Newsom, who had once again become the future of the Democrats in many circles (Hello Bill Maher), and his team is always Trump. Hitting the former Celebrity Apprentice host where it hurts the most has become the goal, even with his own pet phrases.

Trump is losing on his core issue. SAD! Has anyone checked in on Stephen Miller recently? https://t.co/JIUqMyPh3D


	“The governor isn't interested in crouching and trying to fight an asymmetrical war — there's too much at stake, and he's not going to cower in the corner or issue bland statements,” top aide Salladay noted of the new-ish strategy. “That's not him.”


	“This is very much coming from the governor — you have to battle on all fronts with everything you have.”


	It is seems a far cry from the dominate persona of Newsom that has been at the fore for most of his political career and seemingly for his future ambitions. “I always saw Newsom as one of those politicians like Bill Clinton, you know, telling whoever he was talking to what they wanted to hear,” a deep pocket Tinseltown donor, who has given money to the governor, admitted today. “That podcast of his reinforced that, thinking now I was wrong.” 


	A member of Newsom's inner circle cautions it's not quite so black and white. 

	











	“On his podcast the governor has invited conversations with people he disagrees with but has never waivered in his belief that the views held by many in the Trump Administration, and some of his administration's policies, pose a fundamental threat to millions of Americans and the American way of life,” Newsom spokesperson Anthony York says. “Governor Newsom has engaged with people like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon to learn how and why they are appealing to constituencies where Democrats are losing ground,” the aide adds of the This Is Gavin Newsom podcast that launched in February. 


	“He will continue to do so while also continuing  to speak out against inhumane and unconstitutional policies  perpetrated by this administration and urging people to push back, fight back and stand up.”


	Another California politician who suddenly has been taking bigger social media and on-air swings on more fronts is Senator Alex Padilla, who was violently manhandled and handcuffed by federal agents inside the federal building in West L.A. on June 12 as he identified himself as the state's senior senator.


RELATED: On Senate Floor, Alex Padilla Recounts Forcible Removal From Kristi Noem Press Conference: “I Pray You Never Have A Moment Like This”


	The typically mild-mannered Padilla posted immediately after he was forcibly removed from Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's press conference last week in front of dozens of cameras, including that of his own staff. That post topped out so far at 3.2 million X views. “If that's what they do to a United States Senator with a question, imagine what they can do to any American that dares to speak up. We will hold this administration accountable,” Padilla, a California secretary of state who was appointed in 2021 to fill Kamala Harris‘ seat when she became VP and elected in a landslide himself in 2022, wrote.

If that's what they do to a United States Senator with a question, imagine what they can do to any American that dares to speak up. We will hold this administration accountable. pic.twitter.com/ZMExvMmZfE


	A video of the incident posted to his personal X account drew 2.2 million views.

If that's what they do to a United States Senator with a question, imagine what they do to farm workers, day laborers, cooks, and the other nonviolent immigrants they are targeting in California and across the country. Or any American that dares to speak up. I will not stop… pic.twitter.com/TUgT060yx2


	X counts anyone who views a post as a view, regardless of whether they follow him or if it is merely a passing glance. But less important than the views may be what happened in the days afterward, as Padilla did a wave of media and podcast appearances, talking about what happened, followed by a speech on the floor of the Senate earlier this week. His accounts were populated with clips, including criticism of the ICE policy from figures like Joe Rogan, countering criticism Padilla has gotten from the right that he should have not interrupted Noem.


	A spokesperson for Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrants, said, “Senator Padilla has continued to actively engage on his platforms, consistently speaking directly to Californians, against the militarization of Los Angeles and the harmful overreach of Trump's mass deportation machine. This includes California's Latino and Spanish speaking communities, who are directly impacted by the President's actions.”


	Since the June 12 attack, Sen. Padilla has been hitting hard and at the volume of Trump, aide Miller and other MAGA diehards.

You've got it flat out wrong, @StephenM.Let's not forget California has the world's 4th largest economy in the world because of immigration, not in spite of it. https://t.co/zFSBRSDJXO


	Responding to a Trump post that enforcement raids would be expanded to other large cities, Padilla wrote, “As I've been saying, California is just the test case. Trump is now saying the quiet part out loud: blue cities and states are being specifically targeted to stoke fear, violence, and chaos — all to punish the people that didn't vote for him.” 

	











	Still, Newsom's strategy now toward “flooding the zone,” a term popularized by former Trump campaign manager and White House insider Steve Bannon, contrasts with what has been a dominant communications approach among many Democrats for a generation: stay on message. 


	In what may be a telling generational reality, there have been only a few exceptions like Reps. Maxwell Frost (D-FL), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Jasmine Crockett (D-TX). However, in the era of Trump, who has exploited the attention of the presidential bully pulpit like no other leader, so little of the counter-messaging from the Democrats' leaders has broken through. The exception may be Trump's signature piece of legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill, which has had dismal polling as Democrats label it a Project2025 wishlist and giveaway to the rich at the expense of the middle and lower income classes.


	Poll aggregators, including G. Elliott Morris and Nate Silver, show that Trump's support on immigration has fallen this month, since the ICE raids began in Los Angeles and became a national media issue.


	Aiming as always for his audience of one, Vance today took a hard stance of his own on Newsom and other SoCal Democrats over the response to the ICE raids and the troop deployment. “You had people who were doing the simple job of enforcing the law and they had rioters, egged on by the governor and the mayor, making it harder for them to do their job,” Vance said in a blatant mischaracterization. “That is disgraceful and it's why the President has responded so forecefully.”


	Then, pulling an old page out of the Trump trolling playbook, the former Ohio Senator took a racially tinged swing at the senior Senator from California and his roughing up by federal agents last week in LA.


	A swing that saw Newsom punch back in near real time. 

JD Vance served with Alex Padilla in the United States Senate.Calling him “Jose Padilla” is not an accident. pic.twitter.com/UOgdzdKcuy


	In the real world, José Padilla was designated as an “enemy combatant” by the George W. Bush White House over 20 years ago. 


	No relation at all to Senator Padilla, this Padilla a.k.a. Abdullah al-Muhajir, is currently under lock and key in a maximum security prison after being arrested in 2002 and later convicted for planning  plotting a radiological bomb a.k.a. dirty bomb attack on U.S. soil. Originally sentenced to 17 years for the crime, Padilla was resentenced in 2014 “to serve 21 years in prison for his 2007 conviction for conspiracy to murder, kidnap and maim individuals in a foreign country; conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists; and providing material support to terrorists,” according to the DOJ. 


	Also the subject Friday of Vance's “lies and utter nonsense,” as Karen Bass termed them, the suddenly politically resurrected LA Mayor jumped into the VP's so-called slip of the tongue fray this evening. “How dare you disrespect him and call him Jose,” the ex-long time Congresswoman and Fox News foil exclaimed at a end of week presser. “But I guess he just looked like anybody to you. Well, he's not just anybody to us. He is our senator.”


	With Vance on the way Friday evening to that RNC retreat, his press secretary Taylor Van Kirk offered a reply to Newsom's digital slap, according to the VP pool report. “He must have mixed up two people who have broken the law,” she said.


	Point of fact: Taylor Zvan Kirk may be a bit mixed up as Sen. Padilla has not been charged with breaking any laws in regards to the attack on him at Noem's press conference. 

	











	Intentionally or not proving Newsom's point even more in this war of words and more by the time Van Kirk's red meat words were out there, all the white gloves were off.

Hey @JDVance — nice of you to finally make it out to California.Since you're so eager to talk about me, how about saying it to my face?Let's debate. Time and place?

Details about Brand New Day, the fourth Tom Holland/MCU Spider-Man movie, have been basically nil ever since the project went from “thing Tom Holland was constantly getting asked about maybe happening” to “thing Tom Holland now constantly gets asked about definitely happening.” We know Holland's in it; we known that Spidey co-stars Zendaya and Jacob Batalon would pop up in it somewhere; we knew Stranger Things‘ Sadie Sink was somehow on board—and that was pretty much it. Now, though, THR has a new piece of casting information, and it is, as they say, a doozy: Turns out Jon Bernthal will also be appearing in the film, suggesting somebody in this movie's definitely getting punished.

Bernthal made his formal entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe earlier this year, when he appeared as Frank “The Punisher” Castle in Disney+ series Daredevil: Born Again. That version of the character appeared to have been imported pretty much wholesale from Bernthal's earlier Netflix turns as the character, completely with no compunctions at all about killing anyone he deemed in need of punishment. Which is going to make for some interesting contrasts, when he runs into whatever's going on with Holland's Peter Parker in this latest film.

The two characters have bumped heads frequently in comics, of course: Frank debuted, back in 1974, as a Spider-Man villain, his ruthlessness contrasting with Peter's baked-in idealism. Given how much the most recent Spider-Man film, No Way Home, put its title character through the ringer, though—stripping him of loved ones and his public identity as a hero, and pushing him almost to the point of murder—it'll be interesting to see how the two approaches to ground-level superhero work conflict. (Things should presumably be more copacetic on set; Bernthal and Holland are reportedly old friends, having each helped the other rehearse for their auditions for their respective superhero roles.)

Brand New Day is currently sitting on the Marvel calendar with a July 31, 2026 release date; Bernthal, meanwhile, is expected to also reprise his role as Castle for Born Again‘s second season, as well as a standalone Punisher feature.

	More than 20 years after the movie that launched Bennifer, Seth Rogen recently recalled his audition for 2003's Gigli.


	The 3x Golden Globe nominee explained that he was “an aspiring young actor” when he auditioned for the role of mentally challenged hostage Brian, who was ultimately portrayed by Justin Bartha in the Ben Affleck/Jennifer Lopez romantic comedy crime flick.


	“It has been a long time,” he said on Jimmy Kimmel Live of the last time he auditioned. “And thank god it was mostly physical VHS tapes and stuff like that that was being used when I was auditioning for things, because the things I auditioned for, in retrospect, if they were out there in the world, they would end my career very, very fast, I believe.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Rogen recalled Gigli as an example. “I auditioned for this boy with a cognitive disability. And I don't think the script was written in what, by today's standards, would be the most sensitive portrayal of a boy with a cognitive disability,” he noted.


	Explaining that he was eager to work with the film's “great director” Martin Brest, Rogen said, “I wanted to leave an impression.”


	“I don't think I wore a helmet in to the audition itself, but it was at play,” he said with a laugh. “And I'm tempted to do an impression of what I did, but I can't even do it. I can't. That's how bad it was. It's so bad. I dare not even portray what I did in this audition. Because I went for it. I saw myself at the Oscars.”


	Rogen added, “Truthfully, if that tape was out [in] the world today, this would be the last interview you ever saw me do. Other than, like, my apology tour. Please, if you have it, burn it. Please sell it to me. I will buy it.”


	The Studio star definitely dodged a bullet, as the movie barely surpassed $7 million globally, currently holding a 6% Tomatometer score on Rotten Tomatoes.

Netflix landed atop the Nielsen streaming charts in the final full week of May with the debut of its latest dark comedy Sirens.


	The series premiered on May 22, racking up 1.4B minutes streamed in just the first few days of release. Per Nielsen, it was the only title to surpass a billion minutes viewed from May 19 to 25. Interesting, Nielsen also says Sirens attracted a largely Millennial and Gen X audience, with adults 35-64 accounting for 57% of its watch time. 


	Second place went to NCIS, which nabbed the No. 1 spot among acquired titles for the first time in several years, amassing 824M minutes viewed. While this may be the highest it has climbed in quite some time, make no mistake: NCIS is a stalwart on the Nielsen Top 10, having made 265 total appearances. In fact, it is actually the all-time top acquired program by number of appearances on the list, trailed by Grey's Anatomy.

	Hulu's The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives picked up steam as Season 2 ventured into its second week post-premiere. The series came in at No. 4 with 810M minutes viewed, with the new season accounting for about 86% of viewing.

	This interval also just barely captured the Season 2 finale of HBO's The Last of Us. The series picked up another 707M minutes viewed this week, which includes the same-day viewing on Max for the May 25 finale. However, it's likely the series will make at least one more appearance on the Top 10 before it trails off as audiences wait for another season.


	Nielsen considers The Last of Us an acquired title, since it also airs on HBO and therefore Nielsen's streaming measurement doesn't fully capture the viewing for each episode. On streaming alone, Nielsen says TLOU generated 3.6B viewing minutes over the course of Season 2. 


	Another acquired title that performed quite well during this week was The CW's All American, thanks to Season 7's arrival on Netflix. The series shot to No. 8 among acquired titles that week with 559M minutes viewed. Nielsen says 55% of its total watch time this week came from adults 18-49. Black viewers were also major contributors, accounting for 30% of viewing.

Austin Metcalf, a 17-year-old football player from Frisco, Texas, tragically passed away in the arms of his twin brother last week (April 2) after being stabbed at a high school track meet.

Karmelo Anthony, a 17-year-old fellow student, was apprehended and charged with first-degree murder.

The incident not only sent shockwaves through the community and nation, it also sparked a flood of speculation. Conspiracy theories soon started to emerge, with the most notable being one that claimed that the attack was motivated by revenge, with Anthony retaliating against Metcalf's supposed bullying.

The rumor has since been debunked by Dominique Alexander, a spokesman for Anthony's family, who said the two teens had never even met each other prior to the attack.

Speaking at a press conference last Tuesday (April 8), Alexander directly addressed the online rumors.

“As we know right now, Austin Metcalf and Karmelo Anthony did not know each other,” he continued. “The disinformation that is going online is hurting this case, and it has to stop.”

According to the representative—who works with Next Generation Action Network (NGAN), a social justice advocacy organization—the narrative of Metcalf having bullied Anthony before the stabbing has not only derailed public perception of the case but has led to graphic threats against Anthony's family.

“They can't leave their home,” Alexander said. “They've received racist messages, including images of Black children with knives stuck in their heads.”

“Karmelo Anthony has a right to a fair trial, unbiased and removed of racial hate and bigotry,” he added.

The narrative, initially put forth by Anthony's online supporters without evidence, was spread in an attempt to help the teenager with his upcoming trial, however, according to Alexander, it ended up having the opposite effect.

The stabbing took place at Kuykendall Stadium in Frisco, where the two students—each from a different high school—were attending a match between their schools. An arrest report later revealed that the fatal altercation began over something trivial: a chair.

Police say Metcalf told Anthony he was sitting under his team's tent and asked him to move. Words were exchanged, and tensions escalated. According to a witness, Anthony then reached into his backpack and threatened Metcalf, saying, “Touch me and see what happens.”

Metcalf touched him, daring Anthony to punch him and attempting to forcibly remove him from the tent. At that point, Anthony took a knife out of his backpack, stabbed his rival in the chest, and ran away.

“I did it,” Anthony said after being apprehended and coming to his senses, asking officers if Metcalf was going to be ok and if his actions constituted self-defense. “It's not alleged, I did it.”

Anthony's attorney, Deric Walpole, confirmed that they intend to pursue a self-defense argument.

“I don't have any reason to think it wasn't self-defense at this time,” he said in an interview with local media. “But I need to talk to people, develop facts, and understand what really happened.”

With two weeks to go until Karmelo Anthony's bond hearing, supporters on each side have started an unlikely GoFundMe battle, with two donation pages being created, highlighting the stark division the case has created.

The fundraiser set up by Metcalf's family, by their father, Jeff, has raised $318,000 at the time of writing.

“He was a bright young man with a great future ahead of him. He was a leader of men. His smile would light up the room. His passion for football was unbelievable,” Jeff wrote. 

“I love you forever, son. It's not goodbye, it's see you later. God will take care of us till we meet again.”

Karmelo Anthony's fundraiser, on the other hand, was reported to have collected at least $280,000 for his defense. However, it has since been taken down for unknown reasons.

Every year, dozens of bills reach the governor's desk in New Hampshire. But hundreds more get left behind and, this year, some of those discarded bills include proposals to allow pet squirrels, to establish a state marsupial and to collect UFO sightings.

New Hampshire lawmakers filed over 1,000 bills in the 2025 legislative session, with headline issues like the budget, parental rights and education freedom accounts getting most of the attention. But as happens every year, some more unique bills were considered too.

In New Hampshire, legislative rules require each bill to be granted a hearing, a committee vote, and a vote on the House or Senate floor, meaning ones that would be swiftly killed if filed in other states will at least get some airtime in New Hampshire. 

“It's always been put to me as this kind of unique thing we do here,” Southern New Hampshire University civic scholar Dean Spiliotes said in an interview with Seacoastonline in 2024. “Basically anybody can get a hearing for some issue of concern to them.”

And with a legislature of over 400 people, you also get a diverse set of interests that come to Concord.

As the legislature nears the end of its session, here are some interesting (and failed) bills you may have missed.

It's still illegal to keep animals like squirrels and raccoons as pets in New Hampshire, despite an effort by some Republican lawmakers.

Rep. James Spillane, R-Deerfield, sponsored HB 251, which would've allowed rehabilitated raccoons and gray squirrels to be kept as pets without a permit if a wildlife rehabilitation facility determined that the animal could not survive in the wild. Eight Republican representatives and two senators also sponsored the bill.

However, the House ended up tabling the bill by a bipartisan vote of 226-115. During the bill's hearing, representatives from the Humane Society and New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said that keeping these animals as pets come with risks like physical harm from unpredictable behavior and the spread of diseases like rabies.

There will be no new state flag, state animated film or state marsupial after efforts to do all three failed in the legislature this year.

Both the proposal for a new state flag and state animated film were both killed with little fanfare when they made it to the House floor. But a bid for a new state marsupial, sponsored by Sen. Donovan Fenton, D-Keene, made it almost all the way to Gov. Kelly Ayotte's desk.

The bill would've established the Virginia opossum (North America's only native marsupial) the state marsupial of New Hampshire and changed its name to the New Hampshire opossum. It was brought to Fenton by a fifth-grade class at the Chesterfield School and gained bipartisan support in the Senate and the House.

But the bill ultimately failed at the final stage: the Senate killed the bill on June 12 when it non-concurred with a House amendment that would've established penalties for the incorrect application of fertilizer.

Some bills come back year after year, and these bills are two of them.

Rep. James Spillane, R-Deerfield, was back again with a bill to repeal the ban on black jacks, slung shots and metallic knuckles in New Hampshire for the third year in a row. And for the third year in a row, the bill passed the House but not the Senate. (The bill's language was added to the House budget, however, for another chance at passage.)

Rep. Juliet Harvey-Bolia, R-Tilton, sponsored this year's bill to make gold and silver recognized as a legal form of currency and be accepted as payment for any transaction in the state if the buyer and seller agree on its value. It was retained in committee, which means it won't pass this year, just as it didn't last year.

New Hampshire kept with its tradition of refusing to name state holidays this year by shooting down a bill to honor Daniel Webster with a state holiday.

The bill sponsored by Rep. James Thibault, R-Franklin, would've named January 18 as Daniel Webster day to celebrate the life of the former U.S. Representative, Senator, and Secretary of State from New Hampshire. It would have also “encouraged” schools to commemorate the day with educational activities.

While representatives who supported the bill said it would help teach students about Webster, opponents said it would add more work for teachers and was just more “clutter.”

“I am against creating more days that are nice, they're always of someone important and interesting but they don't do anything,” said Rep. Carol McGuire, R-Epsom. It's a sentiment shared by many at the state house: in 1999, New Hampshire became the last state to officially name Martin Luther King Jr. Day a state holiday, more than a decade after Illinois became the first state to create the holiday in 1985.

In the end, a holiday for Daniel Webster was voted down in the House.

One bill, filed by Rep. Aidan Ankarberg, R-Rochester, would've set up a state commission to take testimony and reports about instances of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) within the “skies and territory” of New Hampshire.

According to NASA, UAPs are “observations of events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena.” UAP is the new name for objects formerly known as UFOs and the term is supposed to encompass objects seen in the water as well.

Rep. John Cloutier, R-Claremont, said at a committee hearing in January that the purpose of the commission would be to seek out people who witnessed things they couldn't explain.

“Long ago, I had a questionable sighting that with physics, I cannot explain,” he said. "Now we have citizens, be it one or a thousand, who have come before us with things in the sky, we had New Jersey of late, of mystery drones flying around, and there's no one right now who can take testimony or evidence, whatever it may be.”

However, some representatives didn't think it was necessary. The bill was unanimously recommended inexpedient to legislate and ultimately killed by the House.

“What does this got to do with the function of the state of New Hampshire and our authority, to go after UFOs? I just think this is a total waste of time and effort,” said Rep. Michael Harrington, R-Strafford. “Just because someone comes up with an idea doesn't mean we should even be considering it as a bill.”

In never-before-seen footage, it's said the US military captured a ‘disc-shaped' UFO flying through the sky.

American artist, filmmaker and a ‘ufologist celebrity' Jeremy Corbell has been publicly sharing the video that left him stunned over the ‘implications'.

He has previously leaked footage from the US forces and shared this latest clip on his social media earlier this week.

Corbell says the video comes from 23 November 2020 and was filmed by a platform ‘operating under the direction of the United States Air Force'.

Advert

The clip does appear to show a huge disc weaving in and out of the clouds with co-ordinates indicating it was filmed somewhere over Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Corbell claims the video captures unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and that officials have admitted it's a ‘disc'.

“This is the first time in history that military filmed footage of a disc-shaped UAP, designated as such by the military, has been captured on camera and released to the public,” the ufologist told DailyMail.com.

“It has implications that are huge.”

Advert

Corbell claims US officials said the craft ‘displayed abrupt movement and intelligent control', with it seeming to suddenly change directions in footage.

He added to NBC News: “It's a perfect-looking disc, maybe it's an orb.”

It's believed the object is somewhere between 200 and 400 metres in diameter but the exact size is apparently still being debated.

There's no heat signature in the video, and nothing you'd expect ‘for a normal aircraft'.

And Corbell says it's ‘astonishing' that a UFO with a shape like this could move about without emitting heat signatures.

Advert

“You do not see plumes of heat coming off this disc-shaped object,” he explained.



“This was captured on a thermal sensor - it should have detected heat if any traditional propulsion was present. But there's nothing. That's one of the wildest aspects.”

The filmmaker claims the forces still consider the sighting a UAP and are continuing to investigate it, with him calling it a first of its kind.

Advert

During an episode of their podcast Weaponised, his cohost George Knapp said the source is ‘legit'.

“We know it's real,” he said. “It was not supposed to be made public. But it should have been.”

The pair say they spent over two years validating the clips with a number of sources – apparently including people who work in official US government UFO programmes.

“This is just the start,” Corbell added.

LADbible has contacted the US Department of Defense for comment.

Mumbai— The trailer for Jenn Osborne's upcoming supernatural thriller Holy Ghost has just dropped, offering a chilling glimpse into a story that's as emotionally resonant as it is terrifying.

Far from being just another haunted tale, Holy Ghost explores themes of redemption, buried secrets, and spiritual reckoning, set against the backdrop of a remote American town steeped in mystery. The film marks a departure from standard jump-scare fare, opting instead for psychological depth and emotional stakes.

The trailer opens with haunting visuals of an isolated town, setting an unsettling tone. We meet Grace Brown, a young woman recently rescued from captivity on a desolate farm. But her account of the rescue raises chilling questions—she claims she was saved by a police officer who had been dead for years.

As Detective Madison Wells, played by Jenn Osborne, begins her investigation, the line between the living and the dead begins to blur. The trailer teases a dark unraveling of truth, layered with paranormal tension and emotional introspection.

Osborne delivers a compelling performance as the determined detective grappling with forces she can't fully explain. Maya Adler's portrayal of Grace adds vulnerability and intensity, while Aaron Blomberg's haunting turn as the spectral officer lends the narrative a disturbing ambiguity.

Producer Sandip Patel emphasized that Holy Ghost is not a conventional horror film but rather a “story of truth, redemption, and the lingering grip of the past.” Patel, an NRI making his Hollywood debut with the film, noted that the trailer reveals just a fraction of the narrative's depth.

“This is a new kind of horror,” Patel said. “It's as much about emotional truth as it is about suspense. Holy Ghost is an exploration of how the past refuses to die—both literally and metaphorically.”

Directed by Shravan Tiwari, best known for Murshid, Holy Ghost is set to release in theatres across India on August 1, 2025, with distribution by Cinépolis India.

In a move that hints at an extended universe, Patel has also announced a sequel titled Holy Father, which is already in early development.

With its chilling premise, strong performances, and layered storytelling, Holy Ghost is poised to leave a haunting mark on the horror genre. (Source: IANS)

For how great Supernatural is, it's a classic example of a TV series that might have stretched its story a little too far, as the fan-consensus best episode should have been the true finale for the show. Running for 15 seasons, Supernatural is largely placed near the top of the best CW shows as it explores the various exploits of Sam and Dean Winchester as they hunt monsters, demons, biblical forces, and other supernatural entities. Jared Padelecki and Jensen Ackles as Sam and Dean were the driving force behind the show's success, and a big reason it stayed so popular.

Witth a staggering 327 episodes, there are only a handful of skippable Supernatural episodes, exemplifying the quality of the series as a whole. Still, there came a time when Supernatural felt like it had run its course, extending way beyond the initial ending that creator Eric Kripke had in mind. Supernatural's series finale ended the show on relatively strong terms, though it was somewhat controversial. If the series had ended with an episode that the fans agreed was the best, Supernatural could have been a nearly flawless television series.

Supernatural is full of incredible episodes with only a handful of duds thrown in the mix. Because of this, it can be hard to choose which episode of the entire series is truly the best, but according to fans over at IMDb, the consensus is Supernatural season 5, episode 22, "Swan Song." Sitting at a 9.7/10, "Swan Song" ranks above other amazing episodes like Supernatural season 6, episode 15, "The French Mistake," season 5, episode 8, "Changing Channels," and season 13, episode 16, "Scoobynatural," the iconic Scooby-Doo crossover. "Swan Song" topping them all is incredibly impressive.

Of course, there is no objective answer to what episode can be someone's favorite. For example, Jared Padalecki and Erik Kripke think "The French Mistake" is the best. No matter what, though, it is hard to argue against the lasting impact "Swan Song" left on Supernatural going forward, and how emotionally resonant it was as it closed out the spectacular fifth season. One of the most significant aspects of "Swan Song" was the original plan Erik Kripke had for it when creating Supernatural, which could have been perfect.

Supernatural was not always meant to run for 15 years Creator Eric Kripke, who went on to be the showrunner of The Boys, originally hoped to have Supernatural run for five seasons. While he likely didn't have the concrete details planned out for where exactly the narrative would go, Kripke intended to hit 100 episodes, so Supernatural could go into syndication, which would allow the series to keep bringing in a hefty revenue stream long after it ended.

Supernatural's funniest episode utilized a wild formula that the CW series repeated a year later — and then continued to capitalize on after.

Eric Kripke ended up stepping down as showrunner following season 5, with long-time Supernatural writer Sera Gamble taking over for seasons 6 and 7. Supernatural garnered four other showrunners (including Sera Gamble) over the show's remaining ten seasons. In an interview with EW, Kripke explained his reasoning for leaving Supernatural:

We were reaching the end of this five-year storyline [so] I thought the timing was right. I knew that we were closing this chapter and opening a new one. It felt like it was the right time to take a step back and focus on new projects, but still keep my grubby little mitts in the show. It was a lot about Sera and her enthusiasm and her ambition. I really think after five years of all of my crap, to have someone who has a fresh perspective and a fresh energy on these characters and this universe is healthy for the show. Supernatural has always been a show about reinvention. We try really hard not to do the same thing.

Eric Kripke's idea for five seasons is seen throughout Supernatural, as much of what the show had been building towards had finally been realized by the time "Swan Song" aired.

It's hard to justify ending a show when it is arguably the most popular series airing on a given network, and that is exactly what happened with Supernatural. It makes sense on The CW's part: Sam, Dean, and Castiel had grown to be extremely beloved by fans who were willing to see their various shenanigans for as long as the show was willing to run. While there have been spectacular moments during Supernatural's latter 10 seasons, it's entirely justified to think the show shouldn't have continued past the originally planned five seasons.

Supernatural is a TV show well known for following a procedural formula in many cases, but these episodes broke the mold in unforgettable ways.

There are a variety of reasons why Supernatural should have ended with season 5. The biggest is arguably the character arcs that Sam and Dean went through. Sam ended up sacrificing himself to save humanity, while Dean ended up choosing his own path following Sam's sacrifice, something he had struggled to do since he was a child. On top of that, it's hard to get more epic than ending in a showdown between Lucifer and the archangel Michael. Supernatural had evolved into a biblical epic by the time season 5 came to an end, and it was jaw-dropping.

Finishing off Supernatural at its highest note would have been something special, cementing the series as arguably one of the greatest pieces of genre television of all time. A lot of the best TV shows know when to end their story. Both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul come to mind, as well as countless others. A tightly-written, five-season thrill ride that Supernatural could have been if it had ended with "Swan Song" would have elevated the show's legend.

Supernatural newcomers should definitely watch every episode at least once, but some episodes are more worthy of a rewatch than others.

That didn't happen, and Supernatural ended up telling stories for 15 years, with Sam, Dean, Castiel, and the rest of the recurring cast finding new monsters to fight and new world-ending scenarios to deal with. If it wasn't for the sheer charisma and chemistry the main trio had during the entire series, Supernatural could be remembered differently. By the time Supernatural finally came to a close in 2020, the series had seen its viewership slowly decline during virtually its entire run, with the final season having the lowest ratings of the series.

Following the end of Supernatural, Jensen Ackles reprised his role briefly for The Winchesters' finale, as well as providing the narration throughout the season.

Supernatural will always have a lasting legacy in television history, and being able to span 15 seasons without any massive dips in quality is impressive on its own. Seeing Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki playing Dean and Sam for 15 years was special in its own way, and the show never outright tarnished its legacy, but some part of Supernatural will always feel like "Swan Song" should have been the end of its story.

Pioneer devices have the unique challenge of reinventing the wheel. They reimagine something that has become prevalent and referential to offer a new alternative to address common user problems. The Matic robot does precisely that for robot vacuums.

Also: I've tested dozens of robot vacuums. These are the three I recommend most to family and friends

Testing robot vacuums is always a fun experience, but many of them, excluding the Roborock Saros Z70, have gotten somewhat stagnant on their innovations. The Matic completely redefines the robot vacuum and does it so well that it outperforms many other, more expensive competitors.  

The Matic robot vacuum and mop is one of the very few robots that's genuinely worth its price. 

The Matic's shape is the first thing that catches your eye. It's shaped more like a robot than a robot vacuum, with a rectangular brush roller and mop housing at the front and an 8-inch tall body that contains the robot's debris bag and water tank.

Its brush roller is housed in the rectangular part on the front instead of in the middle of a round robot to reach corners like a traditional or cordless vacuum. The mop roller is behind the brush but doesn't touch the floor unless it's time to mop. The Matic lowers the rollers to clean and tilts up the front to mop. 

This robot is intelligent enough to see stubborn messes and go over them accordingly. If you spill liquids, the robot will mop them up rather than vacuum over them, spreading them around. 

To do this, the Matic is equipped with five RGB cameras that continuously monitor its surroundings. Inside, an Nvidia GPU powers its AI capabilities, including 3D mapping, image recognition, and real-time decision-making.

During testing, I tossed many obstacles on my floors and was rewarded with an efficient, intelligent robot vacuum unlike anything I've ever seen. For example, I put a plastic cup on the ground, and the Matic saw it immediately and avoided it. The cup was marked as an obstacle on the Matic app's map within a few seconds. 

The Matic is so intelligent that it can make real-time decisions to adjust its cleaning settings and redirect the robot. I put cords of various colors and thicknesses on my floors, and the Matic never suctioned them up. The Matic recognizes the obstacles even if they appear after it begins cleaning, and it doesn't hiccup to redirect itself like other robots do.

The Matic returns to charge sporadically during a cleaning session. On a day when my kids left a mess of art supplies in a room while the Matic was cleaning, I watched it return to charge and weave around various objects on the floor that hadn't been there minutes prior, including the glue gun's cord. It does it without even slowing down to assess its surroundings. 

Also: I tested the new Dreame X50 Ultra for months, and here's my buying advice

This robot always knows where it is in your home. It uses the cameras to create a 3D map, which was a bit unnerving to see for the first time. The robot scans your home with the cameras to create the map, letting you see your different floor types and even the patterns of your rugs on the virtual map in the app. 

I moved the Matic multiple times during testing to take photos, and the robot almost immediately updated its location on the app's virtual map. Because it knows where it is, it can always find its dock when it's done cleaning or recharging. And it can also make decisions according to its location, like taking another route to its dock when something temporarily blocks the shorter one. 

But a robot scanning your entire house like this begs the question of how secure it is. The Matic team is adamant that the data processing is all done locally on the robot, not on the cloud. The company tells me it doesn't collect video or audio data, unless you authorize it in specific instances.

The Matic app lets you choose whether you want to be able to control your robot remotely. If you do, the robot transmits data through an encrypted cloud connection. You can always opt out of remote usage if you'd prefer.

Even the Matic's dustbin is completely reimagined. Instead of a hard plastic dustbin, this robot has a soft, clear bag that holds all the waste -- even the dirty water. The bag has diaper salts to absorb liquids and a built-in HEPA filter so that you get a fresh one each time you get a new bag. Each bag lasts about a week, though your mileage may vary, and costs around $2. 

But never having to throw out a robot vacuum's dirty water tank after it's seemingly curdled at the dock is priceless.

The makers of Matic created the robot to focus more on efficiency and longevity than on having the strongest suction on the market. As a result, the robot is efficient and follows a unique checkerboard cleaning pattern to cover areas, followed by edge cleaning. 

Also: The latest robot vacuum innovation will leave clean freaks drooling

This is the fastest-moving robot vacuum I've tested, but it's meant to be more of a household companion that can clean and maintain your floors. It navigates quickly, but it takes its time to clean, often five times as long as other robot vacuums. An area of my home that takes other robots about 90 minutes to vacuum and mop takes Matic about five hours. But it's quiet enough to run at night, so I just run it overnight to wake up to a clean home. 

As a redesigned robot vacuum, the Matic looks more inviting for kids and pets, and even comes with stickers to decorate it.

The Matic's future is perhaps its most outstanding feature. It is a household robot that can vacuum and mop, equipped with an Nvidia GPU to power its computational capabilities. The Matic team continuously improves its software, adding features like edge cleaning, the new Android app, and future promises like voice and gesture control.

You won't have to worry about buying the latest and greatest robot vacuum each year; you can just trust the Matic to continue improving and gaining new capabilities.

The first devices to revolutionize the status quo can be either hits, like Apple's touchscreen iPhone, or misses, like Microsoft's failed early 2000s attempt at a tablet. Most misses tend to fail because the public isn't ready, not necessarily the manufacturer's doing. As a robot vacuum, Matic proved to be a hit. 

Matic wins a ZDNET Editors' Choice award because it brings disruptive innovation into the robot vacuum market. Its design makes a meaningful impact on the functionality of the vacuum, reinventing what we know about automated cleaning systems. Matic is an AI powerhouse that doesn't depend on the cloud, and its onboard Nvidia compute supports future upgrades based on existing camera and audio hardware.

Taking us from the Renaissance Florence of Leonardo da Vinci via the songwriting chemistry of Lennon and McCartney to the Florida launch pad of Elon Musk's SpaceX, Helen Lewis's new book, The Genius Myth: The Dangerous Allure of Rebels, Monsters and Rule-Breakers, sets out to unravel the mystery of what we mean when we call someone a genius and asks whether the modern idea of genius as a class of special people  is distorting our view of the world. 

There's a sense throughout the book that these people are modern versions of saints, that they're performing something sacred in our increasingly secular world. 

It is a really compelling argument, made by historian Darrin McMahon in his Divine Fury: A History of Genius, that during the Enlightenment, when people became more rationalist, less religious, we still craved this sense of the divine. The idea that miracles happen in the world. Where you might once have thought that a miracle was attributable to the Virgin Mary, now the miracle is: how did Van Gogh's paintings happen? How did someone have this moment of inspiration where they came up with this scientific breakthrough? There is this  deep hunger within all of us for the world not to be mundane, for there to be things that are still extraordinary within it. 

Even the phrase “gifted”, which people sometimes use about children and young people. Gifted by whom and for what purpose? 

In classical times, you were possessed by “a genius”. The muse of poetry or whatever spoke through you. I think that was a much more healthy way to think about it. The argument in the book really is about this category of special people and what that does to us and to them. It's much healthier to say I've done something extraordinary rather than I'm an extraordinary person and everything I do is probably going to be brilliant. That's the bit that tends to lead people astray.

You look in the book at the story of how Shakespeare became the figure that he is now. Part of that is these enablers who made sure the folios weren't destroyed and forgotten. And then there's a fascinating process of mythmaking, which is about Englishness and Britishness in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. It's a classic story for your purposes, isn't it? Because there is something extraordinary going on in those plays, but then there's a whole other process that involves lots of people. 

That's the bit I wanted to try to unpick. There's a bad version of this book that is falsely egalitarian and implies that there is no such thing as extraordinary achievement. You're hard-pressed to look at the plays of Shakespeare and think that. So, yeah, I'm not trying to argue that great achievement doesn't exist, but I think which achievements we choose to praise and flag up often has a political dimension to it too, which is worth exploring. 

Then there's another element added to the mix, which is the idea of the artist as mad, bad and dangerous to know. The outsider who burns brightly and sputters out early. 

I find that really interesting because it isn't at all the idea of the artist that you have before then, If you take someone like a Rembrandt, he was painting portraits of rich Dutch people. There was no sense that in order to market himself, he needed to be wasting away in a cupboard somewhere. It's only when you get to the Romantics that we get so into the idea that great art has this terrible cost to people. Susan Sontag wrote about tuberculosis being part of that story. Tuberculosis, which spiked as people moved into cities, has a lot of symptoms that are quite similar to all the things that people used to say about Romantic poets. And that's hard to separate out from the rise of capitalism. The idea that artists don't rely on patronage any more. They now compete in the marketplace. My brutal conclusion about a lot of the way that we talk about genius is that it's really a kind of a branding exercise. 

The idea that the life itself is the work of art. 

One of the things that's really interesting is the hunger for people who achieve things to have had interesting biographies and the slight sense of disappointment when they don't, as if we feel like we've been cheated. 

The book is also very much about science and also about pseudoscience – when science gets too big for its boots. Someone like Francis Galton, who used to be very famous but has been airbrushed out of history by embarrassed institutions. 

He was an incredible 19th-century polymath, a half-cousin of Charles Darwin from the same very talented family. He came to be interested in the idea of genius. He was grappling with the new ideas of evolution and natural selection and selective breeding. And that gets him to eugenics, which is the idea that you can “improve a population” by only letting the smart people have babies. From that, you get this scientific discipline of eugenics that has absolutely no human empathy behind it. 

And it was really widely accepted. 

I used to work for the New Statesman magazine, which was founded by Beatrice and Sidney Webb, who were Fabian socialists. But part of the paternalism of their socialism was they were interested in the eugenics movement. I wrote in my last book, Difficult Women, about Marie Stopes, the great contraceptive pioneer, who was also madly interested,  until the [19]30s, it was a respectable scientific endeavour. Because people hadn't yet had the vivid proof about what happened when this ideology was put into practice. The book is a very odd book. It pings about from Renaissance Florence to eugenics to The Beatles. When you put them all together, you begin to realise that we have these very deep ideas about human worth and that we're always fighting over them.

One of the other themes is that just because somebody is good at something, it doesn't mean they're necessarily good at anything else. But that seems to be a common fallacy. 

Yes, the book ends with Elon Musk, who I think is a great demonstration of this. It's hard for people on the left to acknowledge that he did have great success in business because of personal qualities. He's not purely a lucky idiot who wandered into his success with Tesla and SpaceX. However, the last six months have shown that he isn't good at everything. If I may say something controversial, maybe he also is quite gullible. He seems to fall for a lot of conspiracy theories. What it comes back to is humility. Just because you've had great success in one area, you should still be humble about all the other areas. 

Humility doesn't seem to come with most of these characters. 

There's a really interesting question about whether or not there are certain personality traits that make you more predisposed to either be a genius or get called a genius. A certain level of narcissism, because you're okay with people looking at you and bigging you up and you accept the attention and you thrive in it. You can take two people of absolutely equal achievements and the bigger narcissist will probably get called a genius more. 

You quote someone saying that in this world there are actors and there are movie stars. 

I think that there are these people who have those magnetic qualities to them. But yeah, it's really hard to separate it out, isn't it? You can't be a genius on your own. It's not an intrinsic quality to you. It's something that gets conferred on you by other people. 

There's a right-wing, left-wing element to this. On the one hand an emphasis on collaboration and community. And on the other, on the primacy of individual agency and the individual casting off the bonds of the little people all around him. 

Because of copyright, because of the patent system, because of people wanting to make money, it becomes winner takes all. Alexander Graham Bell becomes the inventor of the telephone, even though it was much more collaborative than that. 

You're a writer with the Atlantic magazine and often cover politics. Some of these themes feed into what's happening right now, such as the assault on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). I have my own reservations about some aspects of DEI, but the crudeness of that assault uses language about excellence being damped down by it. Is there a resurgence of the genius myth happening right now? 

Definitely. One of the things I argue in the book is that every age has its own different template of genius, which tells you a lot about that society. Our current one is the tech superman, these brilliant start-up founders who have an insight that no one else does. And you are right, they are often guys who think that they're just special people. But to go back to Elon Musk, both Tesla and SpaceX had significant public investment. SpaceX, at its lowest point, got a Nasa contract that assured its future. So, yeah, the dynamism of the private sector contributed enormously to its success, but taxpayers' money was ultimately also part of the story of what allowed it to thrive. It's really tempting for people to believe that they made it all on their own, whereas what you usually need is talent, plus luck, plus society that lets you achieve stuff.

As you point out, there are millions of people who never got that opportunity. 

Like you, I have reservations about some of the way that that DEI has ended up being implemented. Things like the implicit bias test don't really seem to predict very well who is actually racist in real life. But go back and look at someone as brilliant a scientist as George Washington Carver, who was black and therefore never got to go to school. Or the fact that Jewish people were excluded from lots of the Ivy Leagues. The exclusion of women from the professions for a huge amount of history. The number of bright working-class kids who never got the opportunities they deserved. So for all that we are now in this period of backlash, I think you have to say that the small efforts that we've made towards allowing more people to realise their potential come against this background of a huge amount through human history of wasted talent. I'm thinking about all the children who died in war or  starved to death. There's a quote from Stephen Jay Gould about people who got very into preserving bits of Einstein's brain. He said he was less interested in the exact form of Einstein's brain than in the people who were just as brilliant but who died working in sweatshops or cotton fields.
