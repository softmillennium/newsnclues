                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. The detection rate of nodules has significantly increased with the implementation of health screening using low-dose spiral computed tomography (LDCT), and it is not uncommon that small and multiple pulmonary nodules are frequently detected, demanding advancements in diagnostic technologies for accurate biopsy and precise localization of pulmonary nodules. Various preoperative localization techniques for marking target pulmonary nodules have been developed, CTPLP was the most preoperative localization procedures utilized in clinical practice, including dye marking, radiotracer labeling, hook wire or micro-coil placement, ethiodized oil injection, etc. However, for patients with multiple ipsilateral nodules, CTPLP significantly increases the radiation exposures and the risk of procedure-related complications. In recent years, ENBDM has been widely utilized and showed reliable outcomes with minimal invasion, high accuracy and few complications. Totally, 203 patients undergoing preoperative nodules localization were retrospectively collected (ENBDM: n=99, CTPLP: n=104). All patients received videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after localization in the same operative room. In term of the localization time, ENBDM group compared with CTPLP group consumed less time (8.00±4.66 vs. 22.00±8.82 min, P< 0.001). ENBDM also achieved comparable localization accuracy with CTPLP (94.9% vs. 97.4%, P = 0.48). Importantly, no related complications occurred in the ENB group, including pleural reaction [0 vs. 8 (7.7%), P=0.01], pneumothorax [0 vs. 36 (34.6%), P<0.001], and hemothorax [0 vs. 15 (14.4%), P<0.001]. For patients with multiple ipsilateral pulmonary nodules, ENBDM can achieve the similar localization accuracy as CT-guided lung puncture, with shorter localization time and no complications. ENBDM offers a safer and faster alternative to CTPLP for preoperative localization of multiple pulmonary nodules in the ipsilateral lung. A better option for localization of multiple pulmonary nodules in the ipsilateral lung: electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy-guided preoperative localization.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liver fibrosis, a pathological condition in which the liver becomes stiff and scarred, commonly develops in the progression of chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Because advanced fibrosis can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer, understanding the underlying mechanisms is critical for developing effective therapies. A research team led by Dr. Takao Seki (Assistant Professor) and Dr. Hiroyasu Nakano (Specially Appointed Professor) at the Faculty of Medicine, Toho University, has uncovered a previously unknown intercellular network that promotes liver fibrosis. Under normal physiological conditions, hepatic stellate cells remain quiescent and serve to store vitamin A. However, upon liver injury, they transform into myofibroblasts that actively produce collagen and other extracellular matrix components, contributing to fibrosis. This study reveals how these stellate cells influence each other to propagate fibrotic activity. The researchers first demonstrated that stimulation of activated hepatic stellate cells with FGF18 significantly enhances the production of OPN. They further showed that OPN acts on neighboring quiescent stellate cells to induce their activation, establishing a positive feedback loop. Interestingly, OPN does not act on already activated cells but specifically targets quiescent ones, effectively spreading fibrosis in a stepwise manner from cell to cell. Using a mouse model of liver fibrosis, the team found that OPN transmits signals via a cell surface receptor called integrin, highlighting how molecular communication; among stellate cells drives the fibrotic process. These findings identify a novel self-amplifying intercellular communication system in liver fibrosis, mediated by FGF18 and OPN. This discovery offers a new perspective on the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. The FGF18–OPN axis is also a promising therapeutic target. Because FGF18 selectively acts on hepatic stellate cells, therapies based on this pathway may offer cell-specific interventions that avoid the broad effects of conventional liver-targeted drugs. The study was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Yuichi Tsuchiya (Associate Professor, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Toho University) and Dr. Minoru Tanaka (Division Chief, National Center for Global Health and Medicine Research Institute).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For more than a decade, ticagrelor (Brilinta in the US and Brilique in Europe) has been recommended for patients with acute coronary syndrome - a range of conditions related to sudden reduced blood flow to the heart. Last December, an investigation by The BMJ found serious data integrity problems in the landmark clinical trial (PLATO) that was used to gain worldwide approval for ticagrelor, calling into question the drug's advantage over cheaper rivals. Now, as generic versions of the drug prepare to launch this year, The BMJ has expanded its investigation, looking at two key platelet studies that AstraZeneca claimed explained ticagrelor's ability to treat acute coronary syndrome successfully. It finds that the "primary endpoint" results (the trial's key measurement) for both clinical trials were inaccurately reported in the leading cardiology journal Circulation, and reveals that more than 60 of 282 readings from platelet machines used in the trials were not present in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) datasets. What's more, one active trial investigator never became a study author, while one author told The BMJ he was not involved in the trial, and most investigators, including the principal investigator, were unreachable or declined to be interviewed. Victor Serebruany, an adjunct faculty member at Johns Hopkins University and ticagrelor's most renowned critic, told The BMJ that "there are episodes of skyrocketing rebound and profound platelet inhibition after ticagrelor making patients prone to thrombosis or bleeding. If doctors had known what happened in these trials, they would never have started using ticagrelor." Circulation and AstraZeneca did not respond to a request for comment. It's been obvious for years that there is something wrong with the data. We all need to know how and why that happened." Victor Serebruany, adjunct faculty member, Johns Hopkins University Ticagrelor doubts: inaccuracies uncovered in key studies for AstraZeneca's billion dollar drug.
