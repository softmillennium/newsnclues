                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he is considering taking $3 billion of previously awarded grant money for scientific and engineering research away from Harvard University and giving it to trade schools. His comments on his social media platform Truth Social come less than a week after his administration sought to block the Ivy League school from enrolling foreign students as part of Trump's extraordinary effort to seize some government control of U.S. academia. Trump, a Republican, has frozen some $3 billion in federal grants to Harvard in recent weeks, complaining that it has hired Democrats, "Radical Left idiots and 'bird brains'" as professors. Harvard, a private university, has sued to restore the funding, saying the cuts are an unconstitutional attack on its free speech rights and unlawful. Most of that grant money is appropriated by Congress for the National Institutes of Health to disburse to fund biomedical research after a lengthy application process by individual scientists, work that is not typically done at trade schools. Harvard has said it was told that virtually all of its federal grant awards were revoked earlier in May, in a series of letters by the NIH, the U.S. Forest Service, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense and other agencies. Harvard did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. On Friday, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, a policy the university said was part of Trump's broader effort to retaliate against it for refusing to "surrender its academic independence." The order provides temporary relief to thousands of international students, who were faced with potentially having to transfer under a policy that the university in Cambridge, Massachusetts called a "blatant violation" of the U.S. Constitution and other federal laws. It said the move would have an "immediate and devastating effect" on the university and more than 7,000 visa holders. Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, representing 27% of total enrollment and a significant chunk of its revenue from tuition fees. The move was the latest escalation in a broader battle between Harvard and the White House, as Trump seeks to compel universities, law firms, news media, courts and other institutions to align with his agenda. Trump and fellow Republicans have long accused elite universities of left-wing bias. In recent weeks, the administration has proposed ending Harvard's tax-exempt status and hiking taxes on its endowment, and opened an investigation into whether it violated civil rights laws by discriminating against "white, Asian, male, or straight employees" or job or training program applicants. Harvard has said its hiring and admissions are compliant with the law. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Ukrainian artillerymen launch a missile attack on Russian military positions in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Ukraine has been given permission to use weapons supplied by its allies to launch strikes deep inside Russia. 

“There are absolutely no range limits anymore for weapons delivered to Ukraine, not from Britain, the French or from us — also not from the Americans,” Merz said at a conference in Berlin on Monday. “That means Ukraine can defend itself by attacking military positions also in Russia.”</p>

President Donald Trump's erratic policies offer a “prime opportunity” to strengthen the euro's international role and allow the currency bloc to enjoy more of the privileges so far reserved for the US, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said.

If national governments can solve issues that have long restrained the European Union's economic potential, they could be rewarded with lower borrowing costs as well as protection from currency fluctuations and sanctions, Lagarde said in a speech in Berlin. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We've all heard the phrase a million times: "Money can't buy happiness." But scientists have found that money actually can absolutely buy happiness, we've just been spending it all wrong. Research shows that strategic spending absolutely pumps up your happiness levels, but not in the way you may think. As a happiness researcher, there are eight things you shouldn't feel guilty about spending money on. There's something magical about belting out lyrics with thousands of strangers. When we sing together, our brains release oxytocin (the bonding hormone) and endorphins that create what sociologist Émile Durkheim called "collective effervescence" — that buzzy feeling of connection that washes over a crowd. Studies show group singing reduces cortisol levels and creates a sense of belonging that can last for days after the final encore. Neuroscience shows that new experiences cause our brains to release dopamine and create denser memory formation, which is why time seems to crawl during your exciting vacation, but flies during your routine workweek. Even small novel experiences like checking out a new farmer's market, calling a friend you haven't spoken to in ages, painting your nails an unexpected color, can create what researchers call "time abundance," making life feel richer and more textured. And when you share these experiences with friends? Neuroscience shows it supercharges the happiness effect — shared joy literally multiplies rather than divides. That shiny gadget you just had to have so often becomes forgotten within weeks.

Your future self, the one not frantically cleaning before guests arrive, will thank you. After tracking people for more than 80 years, Harvard researchers discovered something surprising: close relationships predict happiness better than genetics, wealth, or fame. That dinner with friends or plane ticket to visit your sister? Here's a brain hack: Your reward circuits fire more intensely when you spend on others versus yourself. Scientists call it the "helper's high," that warm rush when you cover a friend's lunch or donate to causes you care about. Your brain literally rewards generosity more richly than self-indulgence. That $4 specialty coffee twice weekly delivers more cumulative joy than one $400 splurge. These modest, regular pleasures create happiness rhythms your brain comes to anticipate and savor. Counterintuitively, challenging experiences — plunging into cold water, completing tough hikes, mastering difficult skills — create lasting satisfaction. These "earned pleasures" trigger achievement circuits in your brain that passive comforts simply can't reach. The struggle literally becomes part of your identity story. The smartest money you'll ever spend isn't on things that impress others, but on experiences that transform how you feel about your life. That's not indulgence — it's intelligent investing in what actually matters.

Oil storage containers and pipelines at the Hardisty terminal in Hardisty, Alberta

A boom in sales of drilling rights in western Canada's oil heartland of Alberta is fading as US President Donald Trump's trade war and OPEC+ production increases hammer crude prices. 

The average price paid to lease oil sands lands for development tumbled to C$771 per hectare this year, according to provincial data. That's down 18% from last year's average, which was the highest since 2007. For lands outside of the oil sands, the price has fallen 25%. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sweden-based automaker Volvo Cars on Monday said it would cut around 3,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. The move comes after the company, which is owned by China's Geely Holding, announced an 18 billion Swedish kronor ($1.89 billion) cost and cash action plan late last month. Volvo Cars said the 3,000 job cuts would primarily impact office-based positions in Sweden and represent around 15% of the firm's total office-based workforce. "The actions announced today have been difficult decisions, but they are important steps as we build a stronger and even more resilient Volvo Cars," Håkan Samuelsson, Volvo Cars president and CEO, said in a statement. As part of the redundancies, the company said it would reduce around 1,000 positions currently held by consultants, mostly in Sweden, roughly 1,200 employees in Sweden and the remaining in other global markets. When the action plan was launched on April 29, Volvo Cars said the program would include reductions in investments and redundancies at its operations across the globe. The company also withdrew its financial guidance for both 2025 and 2026, citing tariff pressure on the automotive sector. Uncertainty over trade tariffs is expected to have a profound impact on the car industry, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to impose 50% tariffs on imports from the European Union from the start of June, prompting Europe's auto index to fall sharply. The U.S. president has since watered down the threat, announcing on Sunday that he had agreed to push the rollout of the punitive import duties back to July 9, following a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The EU already faces 25% U.S. import tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum and so-called "reciprocal" tariffs of 10% for most other goods. Volvo Cars said the measures were necessary to ensure it can deliver on its long-term strategy, adding that it remains firm on its ambition to become a fully electric car company. A leader in the electric vehicle (EV) transition, Volvo Cars announced plans in September to drop its near-term goal of selling only EVs, citing a need to be "pragmatic and flexible" amid changing market conditions and cooling demand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the midst of a tense Oval Office meeting with the president of South Africa last Wednesday, President Donald Trump made a passing reference to the man who, until recently, seemed to be omnipresent in Washington. "Elon is from South Africa," Trump said, gesturing toward the world's richest man, who just so happened to be in the room. That's all I have to do, get him into another thing." Elon Musk's appearance at the White House came just one day after he told an audience that he planned to spend far less money on politics moving forward. And last month, the tech titan told Tesla investors that he would be scaling back his involvement in DOGE and "allocating far more" time to the electric vehicle company. Last week demonstrated that Musk, while he may be posting less about politics and shifting his attention back to his business interests, is unlikely to completely disappear. After all, he did say on that same April earnings call that he would continue to spend one or two days a week on "government matters" for "as long as the president would like me to do so." In both cases, he was meeting with groups of Republican lawmakers to discuss AI and other issues. It's a sign that Musk, even beyond his role as the informal head of DOGE, remains a trusted source of expertise for the GOP. "He is an extraordinary business leader who has created jobs throughout Texas and across the country," Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told BI last week, reacting to the news that Musk said would be spending less on elections. After meeting with Musk on Thursday, one House Republican — Rep. John James of Michigan — posted a selfie with the tech titan on X. "The mission of DOGE — to cut waste, fraud, and abuse — will surely continue," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement for this story. For Democrats, Musk's continued presence is a reason to stay vigilant. Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin dismissed the tech titan's comments about stepping back from politics earlier this week, suggesting that Republicans simply understand that he's a lightning rod of controversy. "He put way too much money into that race," Pocan said, referring to the 2024 election.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>K-pop concerts have been known to easily and repeatedly sell out arenas that can seat upward of 16,000 people, such as the Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul. And a strong zoom lens is crucial for fans seated far from the stage. So, phones with 10x optical zoom lenses are now a key part of the concert survival tool kit. 🌟  Our customer had the chance to meet her idol #SEVENTEEN , and capture every moment with Woori Mobile's Samsung S23 Ultra rental! 🎶📸 With our service, you can enjoy the concert without worrying about storage—just focus on making memories! 🎤✨ Contact us today and get ready to capture your best moments! >> @Seventeen   Oppa Saranghaee ❤️💙 <<  𝐖𝐨𝐨𝐫𝐢 𝐌𝐨𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 – Your trusted telecommunications partner in Korea. --- #Seventeenconcert #Seoul #KoreaTravel #seventeenrightherewoldtour #Kpop #Fancam #SamsungUltraS23 #Rentalphone #Carat #exchangestudent #ExploreKorea Both phones, released in February 2023 and January 2024, respectively, have strong 10x optical zoom lenses. Small businesses and individuals rent phones for concert day use all across Southeast Asia. Mingwan Jeong, the founder of Snapshoot, told BI his business serves hundreds of customers monthly and is increasingly attracting customers from outside South Korea, such as Japan, Malaysia, and Indonesia. "Fans quickly recognized that this advanced camera could help them capture their idols clearly at concerts." Another example is Woori Mobile Service, a South Korean telecommunications company that started renting out phones in 2023. Its collection points are at Seoul's Konkuk University and the hip Sinchon neighborhood. It also has a pickup point at Seoul's Incheon airport, catering to Woori's foreign clients. "Many of them didn't own the latest smartphones or didn't want the hassle of international roaming," Han Da Bean, a spokesperson for Woori Mobile, told BI. They see a spike in activity during major K-pop festivals and tour seasons, he added. Han said Woori Mobile keeps an inventory of about 20 Samsung devices, but it plans to expand to other models like the Galaxy Z Fold and Flip series and add more mid-range models for budget-conscious users. Forholiday, a luggage storage and rental company in Seoul, also offers phone rentals, with its services available on Klook. It has rented phones to more than 2,000 customers, per the Klook listing. Forholiday's CEO, Shin Dong-min, told BI the company's phone rentals are a stopgap for cost-conscious fans. Shin said Forholiday sees the most demand around concerts by boy bands BTS, Seventeen, Stray Kids, and Zerobaseone. Some K-pop fans who've rented phones for concerts have said the experience was worth every cent. "I own an iPhone 11, which works pretty well except the phone camera is limited to a 3x, which means I can't do any close-up fancams if I'm in any seat beyond VIP," Ghia Hong, a content creator from Malaysia, told BI. TikTok user wanderwithgaby also posted about renting a Samsung S25 for 50,000 South Korean won. To be sure, Samsung's smartphones are not the only phones with a strong zoom lens. Google's Pixel 9 Pro's specs say it produces pictures with the quality of a 10x optical zoom. Other Asian brands like Oppo, Huawei, and Xiaomi are strong contenders, too. Catherine Bautista, a partner at Flying Fish Lab, a branding consultancy agency in Singapore, said Samsung is also core to fan culture, and rentals have made it "the default choice for K-pop enthusiasts." "Renting out Galaxy S23/S24 Ultra phones for K-pop concerts is a brilliant reputation booster for Samsung because, instead of simply competing on specs, Samsung dominates a niche need and turns fans into brand ambassadors," she said. Bautista said Samsung has also positioned itself as the "official phone of K-pop" by sponsoring concerts, featuring top idols in its advertisements, and releasing special edition phones. Samsung recently tapped Felix Lee, a singer from the band Stray Kids, as its newest ambassador. And with Stray Kids now on a 34-city tour, the group's fans can sing, dance, and zoom in on their idols' faces to their hearts' content.
