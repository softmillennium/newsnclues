                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home » News » Can't Knock The Hustle: Pro Wrestling Conspiracy Theories I Believe Are True Look no further than people who believe the United States faked the Apollo 11 moon landing over 55 years ago for quick proof of that. It does seem like recent years have seen a spike in conspiracy theories, conspiracy theorists who believe them, and the battle between fiction and reality. Each and every one of us has a friend, family member, or co-worker that is on social media and posting “DID YOU HEAR WHAT JOE BIDEN SAID?! ?” or “DID YOU READ WHAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO DO?! The world of professional wrestling is no stranger to conspiracy theories, either. Some of them seemed believable, while others were too insane to even consider for more than a second. This week, I want to discuss some pro wrestling conspiracy theories. “Macho Man” Randy Savage Gave Hulk Hogan That Black Eye Before WrestleMania 9: Of all the conspiracy theories in the history of wrestling, there might not be any that are more believed to be true than this one. Hulk showed up to WrestleMania 9 with a really nasty looking black eye, looking like there was no way in hell he'd be able to see well enough to even wrestle at the show. The story he told was that he was in a jet ski accident two days before WrestleMania, and that his face slammed into the craft's handlebar. The other version is that Randy Savage confronted Hulk after finding out that Miss Elizabeth had run off to stay at Hulk's house because she was friends with Hulk's wife at the time, Linda. Savage, the most notoriously jealous and protective man in wrestling history, was enraged at Hulk's “betrayal” and punched him in the face because of it. One way or another, Hulk put himself in this situation. On one hand, he could've/should've been up front with Randy about what was going on, and because of that, he nearly got knocked smooth out. Because Hulk has lied more times than there are stars in the night sky. Personally, I'm fully behind the story that Savage took a swing at Hulk. The Matt Hardy/Lita/Edge Love Triangle Was A Work: If you were around as a “smart” fan back then, do you remember how scandalous this entire thing was? Immediately, WWE fans all over the world felt so bad for Matt. That poor son of a bitch got his heart broken, and one of his closest friends was responsible for the heartbreak to boot?! Matt was clearly taking it hard, as he began lashing out online. WWE released Matt because of his actions online after the affair was made public. He continued lashing out online, even cutting a “shoot” promo on WWE during an appearance for Ring Of Honor. Three months after being released, Matt would return to WWE and have a feud with Edge. It went back and forth, but eventually, Edge won the feud, winning a Loser Leaves Raw match, sending Matt over to Smackdown. The entire thing worked out way too conveniently, with Matt, Lita, and Edge all benefiting from everything for their careers. The only problem is that Matt's career never quite took off like everyone involved assumed it would. I know A LOT of Matt Hardy fans who were completely turned off by the way he handled the Lita breakup online. As time went on, Matt started letting less and less sympathy from people, instead of getting more and more of it. All Vince needed to know was that he was probably going to gain a brand new main event babyface and a brand new main event heel, and he signed off on it. Ideally, Matt and Edge would've went on to become megastars for WWE, using the storyline as fuel to the top. It just didn't work out for Matt. He has had a very solid career over the last 20 years, but it certainly didn't match what Edge has been able to do in that time frame. If Matt would've dialed back on the public whining and petulance, it's interesting to think about what could've been for him. Matt eventually won the TNA World Title twice, but if the storyline with Lita and Edge worked out the way it was planned to, how many World Title reigns would he have? Paul Levesque and/or Stephanie McMahon Leaked The Vince McMahon Story To The Wall Street Journal: If you've ever watched murder mystery shows, or even police shows like Law & Order: SVU, Blue Bloods, Hawaii Five-O, NYPD Blue, and so on, you know about motive, means, and opportunity. When a crime is committed, and a suspect is sought, the authorities look at motive, means, and opportunity to pin the crime on someone. Did they have a reason or motivation to commit the crime? Did they have adequate chances to commit the crime? Obviously, I'm only half serious here, as we're not talking about a crime when it comes to who leaked the Vince McMahon story to the media that would eventually lead him to leave the wrestling business altogether. However, the motive, means, and opportunity angle (pun intended) is still there. He has been able to swoop in and take WWE to incredible heights, becoming more of a fan-friendly figure in the process. I'm of the belief that Paul Levesque does love his father-in-law, and that he does owe him everything because of the career opportunities that Vince provided him, not to mention giving the green light to begin dating his daughter in the first place. At one point, Vince seemed completely hands-off with NXT, allowing those in charge there to run things however they saw fit. More and more “Paul Levesque Guys and Girls” were getting pushed to the side, if not pushed out of the company altogether. Vince saw the praise and love his son-in-law was getting for the way he was running NXT, and I think it ate away at him, so he wanted to show that he was the real boss. As far as Stephanie is concerned, I think she loves her father very much, but it's also a different atmosphere for her. While Vince's departure from the company hasn't done anything for Stephanie's power, as she doesn't even work for the company anymore. Do you remember the timing of her departure from WWE? When Vince “retired” from WWE in 2022, Stephanie was named the company's new chairwoman and co-CEO. Stephanie's “issue” with Vince is what the accusations against him do for her as a woman. If she's the one who leaked the story, it was done to protect her own image, as well as to benefit her husband, who stood to gain the most by Vince's departure. Like I said, there's no way you're going to convince me that one, or both, of them aren't behind the professional downfall of Vince McMahon. Vince Russo Was Sent To WCW To Destroy It… Sort Of: A lot of people feel this one is legit, but it's mostly something along the lines of thinking that Vince McMahon and Vince Russo were in cahoots. I do feel that Vince McMahon had no issue with Russo going to WCW because he knew the type of damage that Russo could do for the company without anyone to rein him in. Russo, on the other hand, really thought he would be a game-changing addition for WCW. I mean… he was, just not in the positive direction. Sure enough, the WWF roster got to flex their muscles, and sure-er enough-er, Russo's dumb ass helped to accelerate WCW's downward spiral from the moment he got there. He herniated two discs in his back, and “crushed” a third disc, after taking a back body drop over the top rope and clipping his back against a casket at ringside. The injury was so bad that he needed to retire two months later, after dropping the WWF Championship to “Stone Cold” Steve Austin at WrestleMania 14. The thing is, though… I don't think he had a back injury that was bad enough to force him into an early retirement. I've seen a lot of people agree with this line of thinking, and there are a few paths people go down when it comes up. Some people feel that Shawn did get hurt at the 1998 Rumble, and his injury was enough of an excuse for him to take time off, where he would find himself going to rehab to deal with the personal issues he had in his life at the time. While he was fixing those issues, his relationship with Rebecca Curci, aka Nitro Girl Whisper, blossomed, and he also found religion. Eventually, though, he felt that itch, and the rest was history. Another theory has a similar beginning, with his Rumble injury giving him the right “excuse” to go off to rehab. While he was away at rehab, Vince McMahon made the decision to keep Shawn away, probably with the line of thinking that a return to the road would only make things difficult for Shawn again. The first theory makes more sense to me. With everything going on in his life, and all of it being so positive for his mental and physical health, there was no need for Shawn to return to the company. He was fulfilled, and he found other things besides pro wrestling and drugs to take the pedestal positioning in his life. Shawn Michaels Had Some Major Dirt On Vince McMahon: When you think about Shawn Michaels in the late-90's, a lot of things come to mind. One of the first things, though, is just how much of a self-admitted asshole he was to damn near everyone he came in contact with. By the way, that last part is an entirely different conspiracy theory with Vince and Shawn, but it's one I don't believe in. Vince let Shawn get away with so much. While it's common sense that bigger stars would get preferential treatment, Shawn took things to such a ridiculous level, and caused so much trouble in so many ways, that you really wonder why Vince wouldn't just let him go. Somewhere along the way, Shawn was able to uncover some dirt on Vince that guaranteed him a well-paying job, no matter what he did that would've gotten anyone else fired. It makes perfect sense that Shawn would be able to have that kind of power in the company because he was able to discover some things he wasn't supposed to discover. There have been multiple people saying that they've seen him conversing with different WWE wrestlers before shows, after shows, during commercial breaks, etc. I've seen it with my own eyes, having sat in the front row for an episode of Raw and Smackdown a few years back. The popular theory is that he works for WWE's social media team. He's in the front row, and he's almost always taking pictures and filming things with his phone, so that makes sense. WrestleMania 40 is when I really started to realize something was up. Everyone seen on-camera is looking all over the stadium, trying to anticipate where Seth Rollins (and/or Dean Ambrose, in the wildest dreams of some fans) were preparing to make their entrance. Green Shirt Guy and the person he always sits next to were focused on the ringside area, with their phones out. They JUST SO HAPPENED to be looking in the direction that Seth Rollins hopped the barricade, seconds before Rollins could be seen by anyone else. Yeah, the guy definitely works for WWE in some shape or form. What pro wrestling conspiracy theories do YOU believe are true? As always, feel free to hit me up in the comments section below, or on Bluesky (@aaronhyden.bsky.social), and let me know what's on your mind. Now, let's move on to my Weekly Power Rankings, before closing things out for the week with the list of songs I was listening to as I put this column together. Anarchy In The Arena: Absolutely everything you could ever want out of a match like this, combining a bloody spectacle with tons of great action, and even mixing in some comedy. Will Ospreay vs “Hangman” Adam Page: They wrestled like two men who knew people were going to question whether or not they should've been in the main event spot. With so much on the line, both men delivered a fantastic match that came with what I believe was a surprising outcome. Jamie Hayter vs Mercedes Moné: Like her or not, Mercedes really may be the best in-ring performer in the history of women's wrestling. Oba Femi vs Myles Borne: We already know that Oba is going to deliver in a big match scenario, but it was nice to find out that Myles Borne could rise to the occasion, as well. NXT might have something special in him moving forward. Mark Briscoe vs Ricochet: Like Anarchy In The Arena, this was a nice combination of a bloodbath, exciting action, and comedy work. Stephanie Vaquer vs Jordynne Grace: Styles make matches, and that was the case here. Both women were able to showcase what they do best. If history is any indication, the Wyatts will be back off of television sooner than later because of injuries or shoddy creative work. Meanwhile, the Profits and FrAxiom will continue to do great work. WWE has completely destroyed it at this point. AJ Styles & Penta vs Finn Balor & JD McDonagh: Lots to like here, with all four men putting in work as the battle of the Bullet Club leaders continues. Natalya vs Becky Lynch vs Roxanne Perez: A freshly motivated Natalya, the new kid on the block trying to prove herself on a bigger stage, and perhaps the greatest overall performer in women's wrestling history, all coming together with big stakes on the line. Joe Hendry vs Trick Williams: We really live in a timeline where an NXT wrestler is the current TNA World Champion, winning the match on an NXT pay-per-view against the former champion, who just wrestled at WrestleMania a month ago. Samoa Joe, Swerve Strickland & Powerhouse Hobbs vs Jon Moxley & The Young Bucks: A fun little amuse-bouche to hold us over until Anarchy In The Arena. Damian Priest vs Drew McIntyre: Both men wrestled hurt here, and maybe that's why I felt the match wasn't quite as good as it could've been. Still very entertaining, with two of wrestling's hardest hitters throwing everything at each other. They could easily have an entire pay-per-view with their current roster, without having to dip too many times in the “Legends” well to fill the card out. Daniel Garcia & Nigel McGuinness vs FTR: I really hope someone finally gets their hands on Tony Schiavone one day. Zelina Vega vs Charlotte Flair vs Giulia: Another simple concept… take some competitors and put them in a match where some big stakes are on the line, then watch them go to work. LA Knight vs Aleister Black vs Shinsuke Nakamura: Another simple concept… take some competitors and put them in a match where some big stakes are on the line, then watch them go to work. Bronson Reed: He was involved in a big storyline last year when he got injured and needed to take time off. Hopefully, we get an explanation soon as to why he and Seth Rollins are working together after trying to kill each other for so long, but hey, it's a good start for Big Bronson. Oba Femi & Myles Borne: They had a good promo segment on NXT, leading up to their match at Battleground. Borne did a fantastic job delivering a promo that should've motivated anyone out there who has faced an uphill battle in life, who has told they can't do something, and who has ever been defined by their supposed “disabilities.” Jey Uso vs Bron Breakker: Whenever I watch Bron wrestle, it's hard not to envision someone who is going to be the WWE Champion or the World Heavyweight Champion much sooner than later. Chris Sabin vs Tommaso Ciampa: Whenever a tag feud is going on, we always get singles matches involving members of the teams. This was no different, but Sabin and Ciampa are old pros that delivered something fun. We also got the added bonus of Candice LeRae aligning herself with Ciampa and her husband, Johnny Gargano. Jimmy Uso & Rey Fenix vs Solo Sikoa & JC Mateo: I'm not sure what was stranger… seeing the former Jeff Cobb wrestling in a WWE ring, or seeing one-half of The Usos teaming up with one-half of The Lucha Bros.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A man who recorded the 'best ever UFO footage' has explained why he doesn't think what he saw was fake. There are plenty of people who are convinced they've seen a UFO hurtling through the sky, and some even manage to get video evidence of their sightings. Some of the claims people make aren't hard to debunk, others take a lot more explaining. Within just a few seconds, a strange square-like object can be seen flying past Arteaga's plane and goes whizzing off in another direction. Arteaga claimed that the pair had wanted to keep following this strange sight before it suddenly started heading right for them. However, Arteaga was able to get some footage on his phone which he's claimed as proof that he had a bona fide daylight encounter with a UFO. There are all sorts of objects in the sky which might just be a balloon or a scrap of something else floating about in the wind. However, the pilot said that since his plane was at 12,500 feet there's no chance it could just have been a balloon. Arteaga claimed it would be too cold and turbulent at that height for something like a balloon to survive in the skies, so he reckons it must have been a UFO. On top of that, the pilot claimed the thing he saw was 'something totally unknown without means of propulsion' and he thought it moved in an 'intelligent' manner. You may believe what you like, but the man who saw and filmed it is pretty convinced he laid eyes on a UFO that day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was no shortage of villains for Sam and Dean to fight, especially during its early years when the series felt more episodic. By the time the series had hit its stride, it leaned towards its serialized overarching stories more, and lost some of the charm it had when delivering great Monster-of-the-Week episodes. Though there is much to be discovered by diving into the underlying themes of Supernatural, sometimes the Winchester brothers are at their best when doing their job - slaying monsters. From classic creatures such as werewolves and vampires to more obscure legends of regional folklore, Sam and Dean have hunted them all. Upon Sam and Dean's arrival in Black Water Ridge, they're informed of the cases of several missing hikers in the area. They learn from the local rangers that the brother of Haley Collins, portrayed by Gina Holden, has gone missing. This spinoff brought fan-favorite characters together in a community-centered story that was unique but also very Supernatural. Reluctantly, they agree to let Haley accompany them into the deep woods of Black Water Ridge in hopes of finding Ben and their father. The earlier episodes of Supernatural are viewed as having a creepy vibe, and the hulking and speedy Wendigo fits in perfectly with that line of thinking. The legend of Bloody Mary is widely known in the real world among groups of teenagers trying to scare each other at sleepovers, and the world of Supernatural is no different. After discovering Mary's identity and concluding that her remains have already been torched, Sam and Dean determine the best way to defeat Mary is to summon her spirit in a mirror. As previously mentioned, viewers often attribute the earlier episodes and seasons of Supernatural to possessing a much more horror-centric feeling. The true-to-life urban legend of Bloody Mary adds a significant scare factor to viewers who may have taken part in such slumber party antics in their youth. Sam and Dean are once again called to action to investigate a string of murders plaguing a college town. Supernatural has had many hits and misses in its run. But its most controversial episode had a distinct and unique reason for existing. Sam and Dean arrive on the scene after picking up a clue in a diner about something weird afoot. Joking with Sam about the Djinn's ability to grant wishes, Dean searches a distant spot he assumes would be an appropriate dwelling for a genie. He is then attacked and placed in a world not quite his own. Dean is taken through a dream of his restructured past. Waking at his childhood home in Lawrence, Kansas, Dean is confused as he can barely recall the fight with the Djinn. What ensues is a false imagining of what could have been if Mary had never died and the brothers had never been forced into hunting. Supernatural Season 2, Episode 20 is especially emotional and unnerving as Dean is forced to face this alternate reality and have it ripped from him, losing his family again. Sam and Dean are called to action to investigate the strange behavior of husband and father, Jack Montgomery. When Jack submits to the urge to kill and eat his fellow man, the metamorphosis into a monster truly begins. Even though the Winchester brothers express sorrow for Jack and his family, and lament having to kill him in the end, even though they are seasoned hunters. In the world of Supernatural, Christmas is not necessarily a season for joy and spending time with loved ones. Alerted to rumors of murders where the victim was pulled up through a chimney, Sam and Dean set out to solve the Christmas mystery. Their attention is drawn to an older couple whom the brothers identify as a pair of pagan gods that can only be killed by stakes crafted from evergreen. Throughout the episode, there are flashbacks to Sam and Dean's childhood Christmases. During Oktoberfest, when Sam and Dean find a victim displaying bite marks on the neck, Supernatural law points to a vampire being the culprit. This clue is muddled when the next victim shows signs of a werewolf attack. After some sleuthing and confirming that two witnesses indeed saw a vampire and a werewolf attack the individual victims, respectively, the brothers settle on the monster being a shape-shifter. The story is shot like a classic Universal monster film, in full black-and-white glory. To continue with the theme of classic creatures, a mummy rises from its tomb within the local museum and attacks a security guard. The Winchester brothers are proven correct in their assertion that this is the work of a shape-shifter with an affinity for horror movies. In Supernatural, shape-shifters are monsters that can disguise themselves as the image of any person or beast. This is a truly standout episode and epitomizes the Monster-of-the-Week format by dipping into several examples of old-school film frights. With Sam and Dean investigating recent disappearances in Elwood, Indiana, Supernatural explores the existence of aliens with a clever tie-in to the lore of fairies and leprechauns. She tells them the fairies love cream and must count every grain of salt, should any be spilled. While the previous entries may have more of a creepy factor, this episode is extremely fun and wacky. This Supernatural episode also reintroduces a fan-favorite character, Garth. He calls the Winchester brothers in as backup on a hunting case. Garth informs him he suspects he is dealing with a ghost or vengeful spirit, though the attacks are more similar to those of a monster. One of the group is startled by a sound, and then he views a ghost-like creature that only he can see. After fleeing into the woods, he is heard screaming and found dead by his friends. The Shojo is summoned via a cursed bottle of saké, gifted to the deceased owner of a local brewery. Much like the previous entry, this episode is quite entertaining as Sam, Dean and Garth must maintain a certain level of intoxication to see the Shojo. Supernatural is perhaps at its best when tackling cases of classic monsters. The attention of Sam and Dean is called to a college town to investigate several suspicious deaths that, on the surface, seem like wild animal attacks. When spotted, the filmmakers flee, and one of them is attacked off-screen. In the following days, he developed powers like otherworldly strength, and his friends wondered if he was some sort of superhero. This gave them all the idea of filming the process and making a documentary out of their friend's transformation. Unbeknownst to the roommates, their friend was attacked by a werewolf and is slowly changing into one himself. Eventually, they are all infected with the curse. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Supernatural is a beloved and long-running series that, unfortunately, still has more than a few problematic episodes that aren't easy to rewatch. From pointless character deaths to uninspired writing, some scenes in Supernatural pushed the audience too far. The Last of Us Season 2 finale gives Ellie and the fans what they want by bringing back a controversial character, but at a fatal cost.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BraveWords Records is pleased to announce that Aska have released a video for the track “From Out Of The Sky”, taken from their latest album, Knight Strike. “From Out Of The Sky” is a followup song Aska wrote on one of their favorite topics, Extraterrestrial Alien Invasion. George Call, from Aska, “We love Science Fiction as much as we love writing about medieval fantasy and such. On our previous album, Fire Eater, we had a brief soundscape called ‘The Last Message'. This message had been playing in space for practically an eternity before our listeners stumble upon it and hear the tale of humanity's demise. ‘FOotS' kind of picks up, extrapolates and delves deeper. “As ‘TLM' was put together by Aska bassist, Keith Knight, and he was the principal songwriter on ‘FOotS', we felt it appropriate that he should take the lead vocals on this one. I thought it would be a great surprise for our fans as it's the first time Keith has sang lead vocal on an Aska song since our third album, Nine Tongues.” Catch Aska live with BraveWords Records labelmates, Lillian Axe, on August 17 at Reno's in (Deep Ellum) Dallas. The new album is just straight ahead classic heavy, heavy metal and features George Call who also sang in Cloven Hoof, Omen, and a few other bands. Knight Strike… exceeds expectations, offering a tour de force of U.S. heavy/power metal replete with vigor, melody, and fervor. In essence, with Knight Strike, Aska not only meets but exceeds expectations, offering a tour de force of US heavy/power metal replete with vigour, melody, and fervour. George Call's vocals, a sublime fusion of Coverdale's grit, Defeis's range, and Lizzy Borden's theatricality, further elevate the sonic tapestry, infusing it with depth and resonance. – Lance Souther Metalholics, Rock, Punk & Comedy for Eternity “1944” “Queen of Mirrors” “Soul Stealer” “Love Then Oblivion” “Black Flight” “Together” “Janissary” “From Out of the Sky” “Skoll & Hati” “The Lie” Aska, Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas-based, long-running heavy metal band has, as the title they gave their 3rd international tour can attest, “been there, done that”. For nine years the group maintained a steady course, playing for U.S & foreign military troops in well over 56 countries and territories globally before turning their focus to the civilian world. From inception to present, Aska released seven full length albums on both national and international labels. During the process, Aska's triple-threat frontman/vocalist/guitarist, George Call, came to the attention of cult, US underground metal pioneers, Omen, where he was promptly recruited to take over the lead vocalist slot for three years while still maintaining his role in Aska. When that association dissolved, George was immediately snatched up by former Atlantic Records/Metal Blade, Midwestern, MTV veterans, Banshee, where he's been front and center on the band's two newest top notch releases. While helming both bands after a fateful meeting at a festival performance with Aska in Germany, Call, was further enlisted to join UK legendary, cult NWOBHM band, Cloven Hoof, where he proceeded to record and release three critically acclaimed, fan-favorite albums. Aska drummer Danny White joined George on two of these endeavours while the band's long-serving bassist/vocalist, Keith Knight, engineered and recorded a high percentage of George's extra-curricular activity at his Knight Recording Studios, keeping the three working together even when it was outside of the band. BraveWords Records has released albums by Paul Di'Anno's Warhorse, The Chris Slade Timeline, Rhett Forrester and Rob Robbins, Prophets of Addiction, Jack Starr and future releases from Lillian Axe, Crimson Glory and Aska.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A UFO researcher has an ominous message for humanity as governments around the world begin releasing more information about alleged contact with extraterrestrials. Dr Julia Mossbridge is a cognitive neuroscientist and a researcher of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) - the new term for UFOs and alien sightings. After scientists in Colombia recovered a mysterious, sphere-shaped object that many now believe is a piece of UFO technology, Mossbridge said the world is moving into an era which may soon have to deal with the knowledge that aliens exist. 'It ends up making us very confused when something shows up that doesn't fit our model of the world,' she added. A sphere discovered in Colombia displays symbols that researchers compared to ancient scripts, including runes, Ogham, and Mesopotamian writing systems. They also used AI to help decipher a possible message Dr Julia Mossbridge said that humans are quickly realizing they no longer have control over the universe around them as more information about UFOs emerges 'The sphere itself seems kind of like an art project,' the UFO researcher said, adding that she believes it was created by humans, not aliens. Mossbridge noted that no direct connection has been made between a video of what's being called the Buga sphere and the actual metal object found in Colombia. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us,' Mossbridge explained. That same object was allegedly recovered shortly after it landed and has since been analyzed by scientists, who discovered it features three layers of metal-like material and 18 microspheres surrounding a central nucleus they are calling 'a chip.' Dr Jose Luis Velazquez, a radiologist who examined the sphere, reported finding 'no welds or joints,' which would typically provide a clue that humans made it. More testing is needed to establish its origin,' Velazquez and his team contended. 'We interpret it as a message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth—especially considering the current issues with pollution and environmental decline,' the researchers said. The object was recovered shortly after it landed and has since been analyzed by scientists, who discovered it features three layers of metal-like material and 18 microspheres surrounding a central nucleus they are calling 'a chip' David Velez el Potro, one of the individuals who recovered the object, recently spoke on Maussan Television hosted by journalist and ufologist Jaime Maussan, whose research has stirred controversy for nearly a decade. 'When I poured water on it, it started to smoke and the water vaporized instantly,' Velez el Potro added, suggesting the interior was hot and exterior cold. There have been no official reports or scientific analysis to confirm claims of a sphere falling over Buga. Velez el Potro said the government contacted him to hand it over the sphere, but he refused, saying, 'It would never be seen again.' Mossbridge noted that Velez el Potro's alleged discovery is the latest incident where people outside of the government are trying to find out what's going on with UAPs before someone comes in and shuts down the investigation. A team of scientists have recently analyzed the sphere using X-rays and conducted other tests to identify its origins Pictured is David Velez el Potro who helped find the sphere Velez el Potro gave it to Maussan and his team of experts with hopes of them uncovering the sphere's origin. The findings suggest that the outer layer could be made of titanium or steel, but researchers noted that a full composition analysis is needed to confirm this. X-rays did not reveal any visible signs of how the mysterious object was assembled. By posting your comment you agree to our house rules. Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French President Emmanuel Macron dismissed a video of his wife appearing to push his face away while departing a plane as “joking around,” after the clip went viral on social media Monday morning and became a hotbed for conspiracy theories. Macron, who arrived in Vietnam with his wife, Brigette Macron, on Monday, told reporters he was “squabbling and joking around with my wife,” stating he is “surprised” the video became a “disaster of planetary proposition with everyone having their own theory about it.” Macron acknowledged the video was real while speaking with reporters, though multiple outlets reported his office initially denied the incident had happened. The video was circulated online by social media accounts, many of whom appear to be European and American right-wing profiles that are typically critical of Macron, who used the incident to question his relationship with his wife or to attack his masculinity. The two met in 1993 while Emmanuel Macron was a student at Lycée la Providence, the high school where Brigette Macron was his teacher. Their relationship has been the subject of gossip in the French press, and Macron's parents attempted to separate him from Brigette while he was in high school by sending him to another school for his final year. Macron's office denounced the theories in a post on X, alleging they were being “spread by France's enemies” and that social media users must “remain vigilant against manipulation.” In Hanoi, Vietnam, on Monday, Macron met with Vietnamese President Luong Cuong and signed deals worth about $10 billion on defense, transportation, nuclear energy and other contracts as Macron advocated for greater cooperation between France and its former colony at “a time of both great imbalance and a return to power-driven rhetoric.” The visit was the first to Vietnam by a French leader in nearly a decade. While in southeast Asia, Macron will next visit Singapore and Indonesia. France's first lady seems to push her husband as they land in Vietnam.</p>

The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office confirmed that a partial skull found near Trinidad Head in 1993 belongs to Kay Medin, who went missing in 1987. He returned from a business trip to find her missing, with her purse and personal belongings still at their home. Three months later, a package containing skeletal remains and an anonymous letter was received by the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office. In 2024, federal funding cleared a backlog of unidentified human remains cases. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office partnered with private lab Othram Inc., which used advanced DNA technology to confirm the skull's identity. Investigators located Kay's possible daughter, and DNA testing confirmed the match. Nikolas Medin passed away in 2018 and is not considered a suspect.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Horror and Paranormal enthusiasts are well aware about the demonically possessed doll, Annabelle, a raggedy doll which was linked to some of the most bizarre and inhumane cases from the 1970s. The doll was captured and locked by the paranormal investigators, Edward Warren Miney and Lorraine Rita Warren, with a warning that the doll should never be unlocked. While some believe that the stories surrounding the doll are just horror stories meant for Halloween nights and slumber parties, the history of the doll and everyone linked to it, has often made people cautious about it. However, after being locked in for over five decades, the news recently went rife that Annabelle is no longer in her box, which has left the internet in a buzz. According to the New England Society For Psychic Research, the Ann Doll was purchased by a mother in 1970 from a hobby store. The doll was a birthday present for her daughter, Donna, who was preparing to graduate from college with a nursing degree. While the raggedy doll was an odd choice as a gift for a 28-year-old, what followed was further disturbing for Donna, her roommate, Angie, and their common friend, Lou. When Donna brought the Ann doll home, she didn't give it much thought and placed her on her bed, but soon after, something extremely strange started happening. However, over time these changes became more noticeable. The doll would be in a completely different room. Angie and Donna would, at times, find the doll with its legs crossed and arms folded, and other times, it would be found upright, standing on its feet. Things changed when, several times, Donna left Ann Doll on her couch, only to find her back in bed with the bedroom door closed. These increased instances alerted the two young women, and what followed was beyond anything explainable. As if the movements made by the Ann Doll didn't frighten the girls enough, Donna and Angie started finding messages on parchment paper that read, "Help Us" and "Help Lou". However, it was not the messages that creeped them out; it was the way they were written. What further worried the girls was the fact that Donna and Angie never kept parchment paper at their place which raised concerns as to where the notes were coming from.

The change in positions, rooms and notes could mess with anyone's psyche. So, one night, when they found the doll moved back to the bed, despite it being a regular occurrence, they felt as if something had changed. Upon inspecting the doll, they found a blood-like red substance on Ann's hands and chest. Scared and desperate for help, the girls decided to seek expert advice. This led Donna and Angie to be introduced to Annabelle Higgins, the spirit of a young girl who had resided on the property before the apartments were built. Annabelle recalled her life as a happy young girl whose lifeless body was found in the field upon which the complex was now built. Hearing the young child's plea for attention and considering her past, Donna and Angie gave her permission to inhibit the doll and stay with them. However, they soon found out that Annabelle, despite how sweet she seemed, had the most malicious intentions. The incident with Angie and Donna's friend Lou Lou was Donna and Angie's close friend. One night, Lou woke up in a state of panic, only to find out he was stuck in his own body and the Ann Doll at his foot. The haunted doll soon moved and strangled him, leaving him paralysed and gasping for air. Nonetheless, he woke up the next morning unharmed. However, as he planned a way to get rid of the doll, he heard someone in Donna's room. However, as he got up to check, he found the room empty, with only Annabelle on the floor in a corner.

The doll's activities continued for weeks before a special case was built for the doll, which has since remained locked. While Ed Warren asked him to leave, it was already too late, the man died in an accident while returning from the museum.

Soon after, a fire at the adjacent Nottoway Plantation, which is now the Nottoway Resort in White Castle, heightened rumours that Annabelle's purported abduction was somehow related to the fire. What are your thoughts on Annabelle's back story? According to the New England Society For Psychic Research, the Ann Doll was purchased by a mother in 1970 from a hobby store. The doll was a birthday present for her daughter, Donna, who was preparing to graduate from college with a nursing degree. While the raggedy doll was an odd choice as a gift for a 28-year-old, what followed was further disturbing for Donna, her roommate, Angie, and their common friend, Lou. When Donna brought the Ann doll home, she didn't give it much thought and placed her on her bed, but soon after, something extremely strange started happening. However, over time these changes became more noticeable. The doll would be in a completely different room. Angie and Donna would, at times, find the doll with its legs crossed and arms folded, and other times, it would be found upright, standing on its feet. Things changed when, several times, Donna left Ann Doll on her couch, only to find her back in bed with the bedroom door closed. These increased instances alerted the two young women, and what followed was beyond anything explainable. As if the movements made by the Ann Doll didn't frighten the girls enough, Donna and Angie started finding messages on parchment paper that read, "Help Us" and "Help Lou". However, it was not the messages that creeped them out; it was the way they were written. What further worried the girls was the fact that Donna and Angie never kept parchment paper at their place which raised concerns as to where the notes were coming from.

The change in positions, rooms and notes could mess with anyone's psyche. So, one night, when they found the doll moved back to the bed, despite it being a regular occurrence, they felt as if something had changed. Upon inspecting the doll, they found a blood-like red substance on Ann's hands and chest. Scared and desperate for help, the girls decided to seek expert advice. This led Donna and Angie to be introduced to Annabelle Higgins, the spirit of a young girl who had resided on the property before the apartments were built.

What are your thoughts on Annabelle's back story? However, as he planned a way to get rid of the doll, he heard someone in Donna's room. However, as he got up to check, he found the room empty, with only Annabelle on the floor in a corner. Seven distinct claw marks were found on his chest, all hot-like burns, yet again, they healed almost immediately. She contacted the Episcopal priest, Father Hegan, who contacted Father Cooke, who reached out to Ed and Lorraine Warren. However, their journey back home was one filled with vicious hatred and danger, with the car swerving at every turn. The brakes and steering of their vehicle failed, but before they could meet a deadly end, Ed took out some holy water and doused the doll. The doll's activities continued for weeks before a special case was built for the doll, which has since remained locked.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARANORMAL fanatics have spoken out after baseless rumors surrounding the disappearance of the supposedly haunted doll Annabelle went viral. Social media has been rife with conspiracy theories claiming the red-headed toy had vanished or been stolen. Baseless rumors have been swirling on TikTok that the real-life version of Annabelle escaped from its box, or went missing in Texas and Chicago. A TikTok video revealed Annabelle is still housed in the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut. Those who approach Annabelle's glass box are instructed not to touch it based on a note. And, it has been bizarrely linked to a jailbreak that saw 10 inmates escape a New Orleans lockup. The Raggedy Ann doll was given to student nurse Donna in 1970 as a present from her mom. Donna recalled on one instance she put the doll on the couch before leaving work only to discover that it was on the bed. One of the notes said: “Help us,” while another reportedly said: “Help Lou,” according to the New England Society for Psychic Research. Lou was a friend of the nurse and her mom. The male friend claimed he woke up to a feeling of being strangled and had scratches on his body. Meanwhile, the doll just stared at him as he was being allegedly attacked. The nurse and her mom called a medium, who revealed the story about a girl named Annabelle Higgins who was found dead at the age of seven. The nurse called paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren and they probed the claims whether Annabelle was indeed haunted. Legend has it that Annabelle was responsible for a man who died after visiting the museum. He then smashed into a tree while riding back from the museum with his girlfriend. "I don't know if you're going to want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape," he emphatically said in a YouTube video. "Annabelle's here in all her infamous glory. "If she had left the museum, I'd instantly know if something happened or somebody broke in." Annabelle is set to make an appearance in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in July as part of the Devils on The Run Tour.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A strange metallic sphere discovered in Colombia has sparked speculation about unidentified flying objects (UFOs), with scientists offering conflicting views on its origin. 🚨 BREAKING - Radiologist Examines UFO Sphere That Crashed in Buga, Colombia#Ufotwitter pic.twitter.com/TFeJ8OPmhE Researchers studying the sphere say it appears to have no visible welds or joints-features that typically indicate human manufacturing. This has led some to believe the object could be of extraterrestrial origin, Fox News reported. Jose Luis Velazquez, one of the researchers involved, said the sphere has a unique three-layered structure and its design is unlike anything he has encountered before. Julia Mossbridge, a physicist and founder of The Institute for Love and Time (TILT), told Fox News Digital that she doubts the object is alien in origin. She added that the discovery-regardless of its origin-should serve as a reminder of how little we truly understand about the world around us. She also pointed to the increasing global interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), noting that various scientific groups such as the Galileo Project and the UAP Disclosure Fund are investigating such sightings independently of government agencies. Mossbridge stressed the need for rigorous scientific testing before labeling any unidentified object a UFO. Let experts determine if the material is clearly not man-made," she said.</p>
