                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A millionaire investor in the cryptocurrency market, managing assets totaling $500 million, has selected five altcoins to build a $50 million portfolio. This article examines the coins he's chosen and explores the reasons behind his bullish stance on these meme-based tokens. During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Active contributors aren't just spectators—they're rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It's a game where the most passionate players win big. With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum cap. What began as a "memecoin" gained serious traction in 2021. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, propelled it into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, reaching over $50 billion. However, its unlimited supply means it's less scarce than Bitcoin or Ethereum. Some believe this could limit its price growth over time. Yet, its strong community and widespread recognition keep it in the spotlight. Investors should consider market volatility and the coin's fundamentals. While it lacks the technical advancements of some other projects, its cultural impact is undeniable. Whether it's a good investment depends on your appetite for risk and belief in the power of memes. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin, but it sets itself apart by running on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi, SHIB began with a supply of one quadrillion tokens. Buterin donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, boosting SHIB's popularity. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's Ethereum base allows it to interact with decentralized applications like ShibaSwap. This paves the way for future projects like an NFT platform and a decentralized governance system. SHIB's integration with Ethereum gives it potential beyond being just a meme coin. It can support smart contracts and decentralized finance applications, opening doors to various projects. In the current market cycle, SHIB's unique features and active community make it stand out among other cryptocurrencies. While the crypto market is always changing, SHIB's developments and plans for expansion make it interesting to watch. Compared to other memecoins, SHIB's utility and technology may offer it more staying power in the evolving crypto landscape. In late April to May 2023, PEPE's market cap skyrocketed to $1.6 billion, making millionaires out of early holders and attracting a strong community. This surge sparked a "memecoin season," with other meme coins experiencing wild price swings. PEPE's potential lies in its viral appeal and dedicated community. Its roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a "meme takeover," signaling big ambitions. In the current market, with anticipation building for Bitcoin's next halving and hopes for a bull run, PEPE could continue to gain traction. For those who believe in the power of memes and are willing to take a chance, PEPE might be an attractive option. With a fun Shiba Inu mascot, it aims to give power back to the community by moving it away from big venture capital players. After getting listed on Coinbase, BONK's value shot up by over 100%. Though BONK has grown quickly and found its place in Solana's ecosystem, it does face some hurdles like having a large total supply and the ups and downs common with meme coins. On the bright side, it's making strides by joining a growing number of decentralized apps, including plans for a new exchange called BonkSwap. In today's market, where community-driven coins are gaining ground, BONK's grassroots approach makes it stand out. While DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) combines memes and sports for huge growth, making it a standout in the memecoin space.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin treasury company Strategy on Monday announced another crypto buy, bringing its total holdings to over 580,250 BTC—worth $63.7 billion at today's prices. Strategy—formerly MicroStrategy—said it bought 4,020 BTC last week for an average price of $106,237 per digital coin. That's nearly another half billion worth, as the price of Bitcoin now hovers around $110,000. Strategy stock (NASDAQ: MSTR) is right now trading at $369.51—nearly 8% lower than its Friday price. The company was last week hit with a lawsuit from an investor who alleged its executives made false and misleading statements about the profitability of its BTC-buying masterplan. Strategy stock took a hit after news of the lawsuit dropped. Over the long term, however, MSTR has rocketed since it started buying the leading cryptocurrency in 2020: It was trading for under $15 a pop back then and is up more than 2,400%. Other companies are now following its lead—albeit smaller ones—by snapping up Bitcoin as a way to get shareholders better value for money. Bitcoin was recently trading for $109,826, up more than 2% over a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko data. Just in April, the digital asset dropped below $75,000 when President Trump rattled markets with his trade war rhetoric but has since recovered and touched new highs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GOMBLE BUILDERS empowers supporters, NFT holders, meme token communities, and developers to come together to shape game content from the ground up. But unlike most Web3 projects, these games aren't limited to crypto-native audiences. They're designed for mass-market players across app stores and mobile platforms, making this one of the first creator-powered Web3 pipelines built for Web2-scale adoption. The platform's first Proof-of-Concept is an NFT licensing marketplace. NFT holders can submit their assets and ideas to be featured in GOMBLE games. If selected, those IPs will be integrated into actual titles, and contributors will receive a share of the revenue generated from the licensed IPs—connecting digital ownership with mainstream game economies in a real, measurable way. GOMBLE BUILDERS is supported by a powerful roster of Web3 partners: Story for IP provenance, PG/Jirasan and DXNK for NFT integrations, Adventure Layer—an AI-native onchain gaming L2 developed by Adventure Gold (AGLD DAO)—and AWE for AI-powered logic, and meme communities like MEW, Sundog, and Hippo, who bring cultural resonance and fan-driven engagement. At the core of this collaborative economy is $GM, GOMBLE's native token. With BUILDERS, Gomble Games is setting the stage for a new development model: games made by communities, for the masses—where ownership, creativity, and rewards flow together. Founded by a team of veterans from 111%, GOMBLE merges deep expertise in game development with blockchain technology to build an ecosystem where anyone can easily play, contribute, and earn within Web3 games.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's recent all-time high may be linked to ongoing issues in the Japanese bond market, possibly signaling BTC's growing recognition as a hedge against instability in the traditional financial (TradFi) system. Bitwise's head of European research, André Dragosch, pointed to growing concerns around Japan's sovereign credit outlook, highlighting a spike in the country's long-term bond yields. But when yields rise sharply, it often signals investor concerns about fiscal sustainability and repayment risk. Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 250%, compared to Germany's 62%, yet both countries had 30-year bond yields near 3.1% on May 21, noted The Kobeissi Letter. “And so you end up in this kind of fiscal debt doom loop.” Dragosch said the growing volatility in Japan's bond market could be prompting some institutional investors to reconsider Bitcoin's role as a hedge against sovereign default risk. “This is now affecting other bond markets, especially the US Treasury market,” Dragosch added. Related: Crypto, NFTs are a lifeboat in the sinking fiat system: Finance Redefined Japan's bond market instability raises sovereign credit risk concerns, leading to more Bitcoin adoption among TradFi participants, Dragosch told Cointelegraph, adding: This is a rough benchmark of why Bitcoin could be heading toward $200,000,” Dragosch said, adding that this remains conditional on continued Bitcoin accumulation by corporations and exchange-traded fund (ETF) holders.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cryptocurrency sector inches higher on Monday, supported by a 0.3% increase in the total market capitalization to $3.58 trillion over 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) reversed the trend upwards, reaching an intraday high of around $110,228 while exchanging hands at approximately $109,654 at the time of writing. Top altcoins, including Ethereum (BTC), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), portray bullish outlooks, possibly building upon potential capital rotation as Bitcoin dominance consolidates at 64%. Bitcoin rallied to new all-time highs of around $111,980 last week, supported by growing concerns about the sustainability of United States (US) debt. Moody's cited over a decade of rising government debt and interest payment ratios significantly higher than those of similarly rated sovereigns. As market dynamics shifted, resulting in a significant increase in treasury yields, investors expanded their scope, embracing risk assets such as Bitcoin and other digital assets amid the need to diversify investments. Bitcoin's stint at the new all-time highs was short-lived when US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union (EU), triggering a weekend sell-off to $106,600. The increase in digital asset inflows to $3.3 billion, according to CoinShares data, implies growing institutional and retail interest in crypto-related products. In comparison, the total asset under management (AUM) temporarily peaked at an all-time high of $187.5 billion earlier in the week. Inflows into Ethereum-related assets totaled $326 million, the highest level in 15 weeks, possibly due to positive sentiment surrounding the recent Pectra upgrade. This was also the fifth week in a row of gains. The cross-border remittance token Ripple (XRP) suddenly broke its impressive 80-week inflow streak with $37.2 million outflows. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) posted a net weekly inflow of $2.75 billion, representing the third-highest weekly inflow since the products started trading in January 2024. Based on SoSoValue data, spot Ethereum ETFs saw a net weekly inflow of $248 million from all nine products. Bitcoin showcases a bullish outlook, while bulls knock on the immediate resistance at $110,000. Key monitoring levels on the downside include $106,639 (weekend support) and the demand area around $100,635, tested last on May 12. Bitcoin dominance, which shows the percentage of BTC's market share compared to altcoins, is moving broadly sideways, slightly above 64%, as observed in the chart below. Investors could consider capital rotation by selling BTC at a profit and channeling the proceeds to select altcoins like Ethereum and Cardano. Both assets sit above key moving averages, including the 50-, 100-, and 200 EMAs. Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset's network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Sweden and Norway rethink their stance on cash, Buterin sees an opportunity for Ethereum. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that if decentralized networks become more robust and private, they can support national efforts to reduce reliance on cash. In a May 25 post on X, Buterin commented on recent developments in Sweden and Norway, where authorities are rethinking their near-total shift toward digital payments. The shift highlights a broader tension between innovation and stability in national financial systems. While digital payments offer speed and convenience, recent events suthey'rehey're not yet a complete substitute for physical money in high-risk scenarios. In Buterin's view, the centralized digital systems were too fragile to withstand geopolitical shocks, which invariably made cash “necessary.” Buterin sees these concerns as an opening for Ethereum to step in, but only if the network evolves. He suggested Ethereum could offer a more durable alternative if it could operate securely, privately, and independently of single points of failure. He stressed that Ethereum would need to improve significantly before supporting such critical infrastructure. That includes enhancing privacy protections and increasing its system resilience by decentralizing more. Already, the network is making significant changes by introducing new features that improve its functionality. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jakarta, Pintu News – Latin America is back in the cryptocurrency spotlight. Argentina faced controversy over the closure of investigations into the $Libra scandal, while Colombia launched an ambitious central bank digital currency (CBDC) project. This decision came after the UTI submitted their findings to the prosecutor's office, although no official report has been made public. The $Libra scandal began when Milei promoted the token on social media in February 2025, causing a significant price spike before it plummeted, resulting in huge losses for investors. Although Milei claims to have only shared information without direct involvement, many have alleged market manipulation and insider trading.

According to Maghnus Mareneck, co-CEO of Interchain Labs, this CBDC was developed in collaboration with a consortium of banks and the Colombian government. By utilizing Cosmos' infrastructure, Colombia hopes to create faster, safer, and more transparent payment solutions. While Argentina faces challenges in regulation and transparency, Colombia is taking proactive steps in adopting new technologies to strengthen its financial system. Both cases highlight the importance of a clear and transparent regulatory framework in managing technological innovation in the financial sector. For investors and industry observers, these developments are important indicators in understanding the dynamics of crypto markets in Latin America.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This groundbreaking decision positions Pakistan among an elite group of 7-9 nations, including the United States, El Salvador, and the UAE, with dedicated leadership for cryptocurrency and blockchain, signalling a bold commitment to leading the global digital economy. As CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, Bilal has spearheaded strategic collaborations and built critical bridges between Pakistan and global technology stakeholders. Under his leadership, the Council signed a landmark partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLF) — a decentralised finance platform backed by US President Donald Trump — to help drive blockchain innovation and stablecoin adoption in Pakistan. He also invited Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder of Binance, and appointed him as Strategic Advisor to the PCC to help shape regulatory development, infrastructure expansion, and education programs for crypto in Pakistan. ●	Developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets ●	Overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records ●	Facilitating licensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs) ●	Championing investor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth in Pakistan This appointment reflects Pakistan's commitment to aligning with global trends. Just as the United States has brought leaders like David Sacks — appointed by Trump as the White House AI and Crypto Czar — into its digital policy framework, Pakistan is taking a forward-thinking approach by empowering a youth leader to help steer national strategy in emerging technologies. Strategic policymaking in these fields is not just an opportunity but a national imperative.</p>

Investment firms, including Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB, and Crafoord Capital Partners, contributed a combined $800,000 to the round. The largest share came from Back, a British cryptographer and known Bitcoin advocate, who invested $1.4 million. The loans are set to mature on June 15, 2028, and can be converted into equity at a rate of 1.3 SEK (about 11 US cents) per share. Full conversion would issue roughly 16.15 million new shares, resulting in a 12% dilution. That earlier purchase, valued at around $490,000, marked H100's initial foray into Bitcoin and cemented its name as the first publicly listed company in Sweden to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset and one of the first in Europe. At the time, H100 said the move is part of a long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy, which aims to diversify its reserves without deviating from its core focus on health technology. Bitcoin's role as a corporate treasury asset continues to gain momentum, with several public healthcare companies making significant acquisitions this month. Meanwhile, Canadian healthcare provider SRx Health Solutions has announced plans to diversify its financial assets by purchasing Bitcoin, following a previous investment of $1.5 million in Solana tokens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the first six months or so of his term, Trump ordered the creation of a Federal Reserve comprising Bitcoin, while also investigating a digital asset stockpile for cryptocurrencies seized as proceeds of crime. The Northern state bordering Canada recently introduced a series of bills seeking to make crypto a part of Michigan's ecosystem. So, let's find out how the local government plans to revolutionise its finances by…using oil rigs for Bitcoin mining (it's much less outrageous than it sounds). Related: GENIUS Act Anti-Corruption Amendment Planned to Foil Trump Stablecoin Profiteering The primary focus of Michigan's venture is to rejig legislation around retirement assets for residents. Currently, public retirement systems – those looking after public servants such as educators and government workers – do not allow investment in digital currencies. House Bill 4510 is looking to change that by introducing policies supporting crypto as a retirement asset. Additionally, investors can only expose their pensions to these assets via exchange-traded products (ETPs). So yeah, Fink and BlackRock will continue to get richer. Michigan lawmakers introduced several bipartisan bills today that seek to position the state as a leader in crypocurrency and blockchain innovation: pic.twitter.com/HhKVZKwaX1 Nevertheless, if the bill passes, it will be yet another example of how cryptocurrency is finding its feet in modern finance. It might not be exactly what Satoshi envisioned fifteen years ago, but Bitcoin has cemented itself as part of the world's financial future. Retirement policies and strategic reserves have been key to crypto's growth in acceptance across the United States. Texas and Arizona recently greenlit new frameworks supporting crypto investment for these purposes. But, perhaps most interesting, are the final two crypto-related proposals, House Bill 4512 and 4513. The first bill suggests that Michigan allows Bitcoin mining agencies to set up base at abandoned oil and gas sites, leveraging the pre-existing source of power. To make this more appealing, the secondary, accompanying bill proposes that businesses receive a tax incentive for participating in the initiative. It's an ambitious goal for Michigan, and one that will need to endure the scrutiny of policymakers before going live.
