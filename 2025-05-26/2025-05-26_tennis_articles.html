                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Fritz has battled an abdominal injury for much of this season and rolled his ankle last week in Geneva. While the American has been content with his level of play despite those issues, there is one particular aspect of his game that has plagued him recently: his ability to rise to the occasion on the big points. After a 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 defeat to Daniel Altmaier on Monday in the Roland Garros first round, Fritz felt that trend continued. "It's kind of what's been going on a bit lately. It's just a lot of important points, I just am playing horrendous tennis on a lot of the important points," he said. "When I'm break point down, or I've got looks on his serve, like 0/30, 15/30, 30/30, break point — all the pressure, important points... I don't know what's going on. I'm finding ways to just play the worst point possible." Fritz converted just one of five break points in the opening round, while saving just three of eight, according to Infosys ATP Stats. While he said he has been feeling unusually uncomfortable on the clay in recent weeks — his run to the last 16 in Madrid the lone exception — Fritz still feels his game has held up overall.

"The fact that I'm not just converting big points, not playing big points well, the only way to get rid of that is have a match or a couple matches where that just doesn't happen and I perform well on some of those points," he said. It's not something you can really fix in practice. I felt great about my game in practice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aussie crowds are as volatile as the feisty French fans who last year drew widespread condemnation from players? Get all the latest golf news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail. That is the opinion of French Tennis Federation president Gilles Moretton who, while defending the passion shown by local fans at Roland Garros, cited the behaviour of patrons at the Australian Open as an example of why there is no difference around the world. “You're talking about the French players playing? It was the same in Australia. “Maybe they make too much noise. We feel like that atmosphere is good for tennis. If it goes too far, we will have to say something. I hope it not bother too much the players. The issue of crowd behaviour in Paris was a hot topic in 2024, with four-time French Open champion Iga Swiatek and Belgian veteran David Goffin among those to complain about fans going beyond the traditional chant of “Allez. Goffin alleged he had chewing gum spat at him during a five set win over rising French star Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard at Roland Garros last year when liking the behaviour of the crowd to soccer hooligans. It's becoming football,” he told Belgian press. Soon there will be smoke bombs, hooligans and fights in the stands. Swiatek, who arrived in Paris low on confidence but began her bid for a fifth Roland Garros title with a 6-3 6-3 victory over Rebecca Sramkova, was upset about the treatment she received in a thriller against Naomi Osaka, which prompted a call from the FFT for respect. But Aussie Adam Walton, who plays German Maximillian Marterer in an opening round match on Tuesday, indicated there might be some truth to Moretton's point when discussing his clash with Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech last year. “I mean, when I played the Australian Open, it was all for me and then obviously here, it was all against me,” he said. To be fair, some ugly incidents aside in Paris, the atmosphere for matches at Roland Garros for finals and for big matches involving local favourites is superb given the passion the fans demonstrate. And Australian crowds have been the subject of criticism, with supporters of Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis drawing complaints during their run to the doubles crown at Melbourne Park in 2022, while some players are not fans of the “Party Court” at the complex. Moretton, meanwhile, defended French officials against complaints men's matches were being played in the prime-time spot at night in Paris, while the women stars are taking to centre court for the early matches. Swiatek posted her 22nd win in succession at Roland Garros in front of a half-empty crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday morning, with French fans typically arriving after lunch for action on the main stadium court. On the first day of the tournament, world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka opened with a dominant win over Kamilla Rakhimova while former Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin will play the midday match on the main court on Tuesday. In contrast, American Ben Shelton won a five set thriller on Sunday night in Paris that finished after midnight, while world No.1 Jannik Sinner was drawn to play Rinderknech on Monday night. French veteran Gael Monfils has the night slot on Tuesday. “Sometimes we need to put, I mean, for the night session, we need to put the better match (that), we think, could be for the spectators,” Moretton said. “Maybe we will have a few, I have no idea, a few female matches on the night sessions. Swiatek, for her part, has refused to buy into debate about the issue, in part because she prefers playing in the day in Paris. “But on the other hand, people just try to look for, like, not even things between men and women. You can find that in the schedule a little bit, and you can ask us all the time, but honestly, my answers are not going to change, so I don't mind.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The biggest active oddity in Australian tennis is over. Alexei Popyrin signed off his promising junior career with the Roland-Garros boys' singles title eight years ago, but had won just once in the men's event from six trips to Paris – and not since 2019 – until he defeated Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka on Monday.

It was an anticlimactic end to 25th-seeded Popyrin's six-match losing streak at Roland-Garros, but he won't be picky, given his lean record at the tournament. Every match that I've played here has been really tough,” Popyrin said. Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka retired from the match with a lower back injury.Credit: AP They've been tough first-round losses – ones that I've taken to heart. Ajla Tomljanovic, who made the last 16 at Roland-Garros 11 years ago, also progressed with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over in-form fellow Australian Maya Joint, the 19-year-old rising star who won her maiden WTA singles title in Morocco only a day earlier. Hard-hitting Joint, one of only two teenagers in the WTA top 100 at a career-high No.53, struck one more winner than Tomljanovic, but delivered a wayward performance with 39 unforced errors to 18. Daria Kasatkina made it three Australian winners with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 dispatching of Czech Katerina Siniakova in her first grand slam for her adopted country. Ajla Tomljanovic plays a forehand against Maya Joint.Credit: Getty Images Popyrin lost in five sets to countryman Thanasi Kokkinakis last year despite leading 2-0 in the final set, following defeats to Aslan Karatsev, Fabio Fognini, 14-time champion Rafael Nadal, Lloyd Harris and Laslo Djere in previous years. Nishioka, who was ranked No.24 two years ago, has retired or handed his opponent a walkover at six of his past 10 tournaments, and also called it quits one game into the fifth set in the first round of last year's US Open. Popyrin has a good chance to go further, with another left-hander, Alejandro Tabilo, up next after the Chilean outlasted French wildcard Arthur Cazaux 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 1-6, 6-3. Roland-Garros has mostly been a challenging tournament for Australians, outside Alex de Minaur's surprise quarter-final run last year. Maya Joint plays a forehand against Ajla Tomljanovic.Credit: Getty Images Maya Joint just won a title on clay last week, which is massive for her. The hairiest it got for Popyrin was at 30-all in the sixth game of the second set, but he produced an excellent second serve then clobbered a big cross-court forehand that his Japanese rival could not retrieve. There was little explanation for Popyrin's claycourt struggles in the French capital, given the surface has been his most successful by win percentage across his tour career. He reached last month's Monte-Carlo Masters quarter-finals – beating three top-20 opponents, including two-time Roland-Garros finalist Casper Ruud – and the same stage in Geneva last week. Popyrin would dearly love that form to continue because he is defending more than half his ranking points in the second half of the year, including his Masters 1000 title win in Montreal and third- and fourth-round showings at Wimbledon and the US Open, respectively. He risks going into ranking freefall unless he can finish the season well after an injury-marred beginning to the year that included his co-coach Xavier Malisse ending their partnership at Indian Wells in March. Popyrin is still working with Neville Godwin but has added another South African, Wayne Ferreira, to his team. “I think mentally it's been challenging, but since the start of the claycourt [season], I feel like my game is starting to come back to me; the results are starting to show a little bit more, there's more consistency and match wins every single week.” No.10 seed Paula Badosa won her heavyweight battle with Naomi Osaka, 6-7 (1-7), 6-1, 6-4.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American Taylor Fritz suffered a surprise first-round defeat against Germany's Daniel Altmaier at the French Open on Monday. Altmaier triumphed 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 against fourth-seed Fritz, who becomes the first major casualty of the men's draw at Roland-Garros. “It was very special,” said Altmaier after recording his fifth victory against an opponent ranked inside the top 10, per the ATP Tour. “I think I was working really hard the past weeks to get confidence, preparing myself for those kinds of matches. Having finished runner-up to Jannik Sinner at last year's US Open, Fritz has now had two disappointing defeats at majors this season – the loss against Altmaier adding to a third-round exit at the Australian Open in January. He converted just one of his five break points in Monday's match and managed 34 winners – 14 of which were aces – compared to Altmaier's 46. In the women's draw, ninth seed Emma Navarro was thrashed 6-0, 6-1 by Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in just 57 minutes. Elsewhere in the women' draw, Spanish 10th seed Paula Badosa triumphed 6-7(1), 6-1, 6-4 against four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka, who wore pink bows in her hair and an outfit inspired by the cherry blossoms of her native Japan. It means that Osaka, currently ranked No. For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com</p>

He holds to love in double-quick time and celebrates by pumping his fist. Jannik Sinner is creating space for himself, smartly changing up the angles and building points. Rinderknech can't get near him in his latest game as the Italian holds to love. Well, Rinderknech just about gets away with it. 40-0 and then Rinderknech tries a cheeky under-arm serve... It's all fun and games until your opponent switches on. He rattles through his service game, swatting away two winners at the net to back up the break and take a solid 4-1 lead. A long way back for Arthur Rinderknech now. Arthur Rinderknech was far too keen to play that forehand down the line and it's a wild miss. Sinner takes the lead in this second set. Arthur Rinderknech recovers with a pacey forehand winner and we go to deuce. But another miss from the Frenchman gives Jannik Sinner a second chance. The drop shots aren't fooling Jannik Sinner. He's up to the net in a flash, and from there he is dictating the point each time. The Italian top seed has got himself a break point after Rinderknech nets. Arthur Rinderknech glares at Jannik Sinner with a smirk after hitting a no-look winner and beating the Italian at his own game. He, and the crowd on Philippe Chatrier, loved that. He gets back to business and sweeps up the next two points with forehand winners. A mixed service game from Arthur Rinderknech, but he finishes it off with a blistering cross-court winner that wrongfoots Jannik Sinner. A sliced backhand from the Frenchman goes long, and it's a straightforward hold for Sinner to get set two started. Jannik Sinner takes advantage of Arthur Rinderknech's weaker second serve with a blistering return that the Frenchman can only plant into the net. Jannik Sinner was expecting it and he easily swats it down the line to bring up two set points. This is when Jannik Sinner can be ruthless. Arthur Rinderknech doesn't even bother trying to reach that drop shot from Jannik Sinner. The world number one whips a wicked backhand across court before landing another drop shot that Rinderknech does get to this time, but he can't find the court with his lofted return. Another serve-volley combo comes up trumps for Arthur Rinderknech. Jannik Sinner, despite his best efforts, had no chance of reaching that. And there's an ace to wrap up another hold.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Robin Montgomery is not leaving Paris early. The 20-year-old American, who is appearing in her first-ever French Open main draw, secured her place in the second round by sending home-hero Diane Parry home with a 6-2, 6-1 win on Monday. Montgomery dominated during the contest, winning five of her seven break points, dropping just three games and serving down five aces in her win. Up next for her is Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, who recently dismantled World No.9 and fellow American Emma Navarro. Since then she's amassed over a million dollars in prize money. She followed that victory up a few hours later with the junior doubles title when she and partner Ashlyn Krueger defeated Reese Brantmeier and Elvina Kalieva in three sets. It meant she became the first person to win both titles in New York since Michaëlla Krajicek in 2004. Montgomery first began to make some noise on the professional tour in 2023. She was able to qualify for the Austin Open early that year and also earned her first WTA 1000 win when she defeated Ana Bogdan. In 2024, she faced her toughest challenge yet and one that she still remembers to this day. It took Sabalenka two-and-a-half hours to beat Montgomery, edging her in a 6-1, 6-7(5), 6-4 victory and one that demonstrated to the then-teen where her level was at. "It was a very close match, and it kind of opened my eyes a little bit of where my level is and what I can actually do," Montgomery told Clay Tennis. I called my childhood coach and he was like ‘relax' and I'm like ‘no, screw this'. But yeah, it was a stinger, but it does happen for a reason," she added. She hits the ball very big, very hard and you have to always be ready for anything. When you play against her it sometimes feels like you're already on defense even before the point starts. It's very tough, she's a top player. Montgomery is also friends with fellow American tennis star Coco Gauff, saying she grew up with the 2023 US Open winner. "We grew up together, both chasing similar goals since young. I've known her since I was 9, we had our first USTA camp together, so we've known each other for a long time." Montgomery will be focused on forging her own path in tennis, and this year's French Open gives her that chance. "I do have good results on clay. So I probably enjoy it and play better than most American players on clay."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS (AP) — Naomi Osaka still wore the pink accessories in her hair inspired by “sakura” — cherry blossoms — and there were streaks on her cheeks where tears had rolled, when she sat down for a French Open news conference after her first-round loss to Paula Badosa on Monday. But also — I kind of talked about this before, maybe a couple years ago, or maybe recently, I'm not sure — I hate disappointing people,” said Osaka, who owns four Grand Slam trophies from the hard courts of the U.S. Open and Australian Open but never has been past the third round on the red clay of Roland-Garros. Then, referring to her current coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, who used to work with Serena Williams, Osaka said: “He goes from working with, like, the greatest player ever to, like, ‘What the (expletive) is this?' Osaka, who was born in Japan and moved to the United States as a young child, was undone Monday by 54 unforced errors. That was twice as many as Badosa, whose best showing at a major was a semifinal run at the Australian Open in January and who reached the quarterfinals at Roland-Garros in 2021. After taking the opening set, Osaka was treated by a trainer for hand blisters and also took time to clip her sakura-themed fingernails on the sideline. She attributed the blisters, which also bothered her at the Italian Open this month, to “the friction of clay, because I don't have blisters on any other surface.” Osaka was broken five times and finished with nearly as many double-faults, five, as aces, seven. 49, Osaka withdrew from the French Open in 2021 before her second-round match, explaining that she experiences “huge waves of anxiety” before speaking to the media and revealing she had dealt with depression. She then took multiple mental health breaks away from the tour. She helped usher in a change in the way athletes, sports fans and society at large understood the importance of mental health. A year ago at Roland-Garros, Osaka played one of her best matches since returning to action after becoming a mother, coming within a point of upsetting eventual tournament champion Iga Swiatek. On Monday, after taking a break from questions, she returned to field one query from a Japanese journalist with an eye to the next major tournament, Wimbledon, which begins on grass on June 30. “I don't necessarily know my grass-season schedule right now,” Osaka said. “I wasn't really expecting to lose in the first round.” Howard Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS (AP) — U.S. Open semifinalist Emma Navarro only lasted 57 minutes at the French Open, losing 6-0, 6-1 in the first round Monday to Jessica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American tennis sensation Ben Shelton opted not to mimic Emma Raducanu's controversial move last year when the British star withdrew from her Wimbledon mixed doubles commitment with Andy Murray following a singles win, confessing: "I wasn't raised that way". Shelton, who has already sailed into the second round of the French Open after triumphing over Lorenzo Sonego, was confronted with a dilemma at Wimbledon last year. He had soared to the fourth round in the men's singles while simultaneously competing in doubles with Mackenzie McDonald. Raducanu, who withdrew citing stiffness in her right wrist, had also advanced to the women's singles fourth round, leaving Judy Murray, Andy's mother, astounded by the withdrawal — remarks she later described as sarcastic. Yet even as his own singles success beckoned, Shelton did not forget the commitment he made to McDonald, promising to uphold it despite progressing in the singles competitions. "Yeah, I mean, whenever you're on the schedule seven days straight, it's not something easy to deal with," the 22-year-old said. I signed up to play doubles yesterday. Shelton didn't bring up Raducanu directly but candidly expressed his dedication to the game and to his partner, stating: "I think a lot of people probably would have pulled out of doubles in that situation, but I didn't want to do that to my partner. I'm not just going to pull out on the guy. I think it's a selfish thing to do. Just kind of wasn't raised that way." In light of Raducanu's Monday match at Roland Garros, where she required medical assistance against Wang Xinyu, the Brit mentioned apologizing to Murray again, expressing her regret and anticipation for a future conversation: "I hope he's forgiven me for last year, I still feel bad about it," she commented. "I'm looking forward to seeing him around and having a conversation. I think he would give great advice, he's been in a similar situation and would probably understand a lot of things that I'm also going through. But as to anything more, I don't know, that's very far out of thought." Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recent ATP finalists Hubert Hurkacz and Flavio Cobolli will be making quick turnarounds to play at Roland Garros on Tuesday. Hurkacz faces Joao Fonseca, while Cobolli–who won Hamburg–meets Marin Cilic. (30) Hubert Hurkacz vs. Joao FonsecaHurkacz heads into the French Open with much-needed momentum on the heels of some injury-plagued months–and really almost a full year–due to a knee problem. The 28th-ranked Paul finally raised his level with a quarterfinal run at the Madrid Masters and a runner-up performance last week in Geneva. It could have been even better, though, since Hurkacz led Novak Djokovic by a break late in third set only to fall 5-7, 7-6(2), 7-6(2) as the 37-year-old Serb captured title No. 100.With only two days off, it doesn't get much easier with Fonseca on the other side of the net on Tuesday. The 18-year-old Brazilian has cooled off a bit since a scorching-hot end of 2024 and start of 2025, but he obviously remains one of the most dangerous unseeded players in the field. Fonseca also loves clay–as he proved with his first ATP title in Buenos Aires–and would prefer to face Hurkacz on this surface as opposed to any other. 30 seed likely fatigued both mentally and physically, this a great opportunity for Fonseca–especially if it turns into a long, physical match.Pick: Fonseca in 5    58WWW: Hurkacz vs. Fonseca? The 26th-ranked Italian went on seven-match losing streak during the hard-court swing, but he has already captured two ATP titles on clay. Up first for Cobolli on Tuesday is a second meeting with Cilic, who lost their only previous encounter 6-4, 6-3 on the red clay of the Umag Challenger in 2023. Although injuries have been more of a problem than form, even when healthy he is obviously well past the prime that saw him win the 2014 U.S. Open. The Croat went to Paris on a three-match losing streak and fell to Lloyd Harris in the final round of qualifying, but he got a lucky-loser spot in the main draw. Wouldnt  surprise me but Hurkacz has a history of just forgetting about a disappointing loss like it never happened. If so, he probably wins this in 4. Your email address will not be published.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek was emotional at Nadal's farewell ceremony, which she attended alongside many other star names within tennis. His fellow legends Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray were also present to give the Spaniard a fitting send-off. But his efforts in Paris particularly caught the eye, with former players Marion Bartoli and Pat Cash having now shared their take on the legendary figure for BBC 5 Live Sport. Bartoli said: “He has been synonymous with Roland Garros for the past two decades, and now Carlos Alcaraz is sort of starting to fill those shoes.

I sat there with my jaw open every time.” Just like Nadal made Roland Garros his home, Federer enjoyed stunning success on the grass courts of Wimbledon. The Swiss icon won eight times in London before calling time on his phenomenal career, more than any other player.

Nadal and Federer will likely be watching on, with their efforts at the French Open and Wimbledon respectively simply needing to both be admired in their own individual ways as opposed to being pitted against one another. Both were truly jaw-dropping in their own ways, with such heroic feats not likely to be repeated in the future of the sport.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italian clay specialist Flavio Cobolli underlined that he is a force to be reckoned with at Roland Garros, when he won the biggest title of his career by upsetting third seed Andrey Rublev 6-2, 6-4 to win the Hamburg Open. Cobolli thereby became just the third player to win multiple titles on the ATP Tour this year after Carlos Alcaraz (three) and Felix Auger-Aliassime (also two), as the impressive win also saw him rise to a career-high 26th in the rankings. A little over 1000 km to the south of Hamburg, Novak Djokovic won the 100th singles title of his career by beating Hubert Hurkacz 5-7, 7-6(2), 7-6(2) at the Geneva Open in Switzerland. He thereby became only the third man in the Open Era to win 100 titles, after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer. Djokovic arrived in the bank capital without any wins on clay this season, but recovered his form just in time for the French Open, where he bids for a fourth crown. 8 seed Liudmila Samsonova to capture the WTA 500 Internationaux de Strasbourg title in France. The former Wimbledon champion Rybakina otherwise had not reached a final since April 2024, when she won another clay-court title at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. The win in Strasbourg was Rybakina's ninth career WTA singles title; four of her previous titles have also come on clay. The German said sickness was behind his lacklustre showing. "It was OK considering I threw up 37 times and had a fever of 39.4 degrees (Celsius, 102.9 Fahrenheit) all night." "When I had to walk it was difficult. He then realised at some point I wasn't feeling well and made the points last as long as possible." “I have no idea what's happening to me right now. I have been trying to understand it for several months, but I don't even know what to say anymore", said Zverev at the beginning of April as he bowed out of the Monte Carlo Open, and he seems far from his best going into the French Open. American contender Danielle Collins, who was set to end her career last year given the fact that she has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and endometriosis - with the former the same disease that haunted Caroline Wozniacki - has turned into a divisive figure on the Tour. She has often found herself in the midst of controversy as she previously told a booing Australian Open crowd that they “pay her bills”, and has also earlier taken issue with Iga Swiatek. It's not that difficult to give space, I'm sorry,” she said. While Collins' on-court antics have often frustrated other players, Raducanu admitted after the match that she had no problem with the 31-year-old's behaviour. Cobolli and Rublev treated the crowd at the Rothenbaum Arena in the Hamburg Open final to an amazing tennis afternoon where Cobolli won a spectacular clay-court rally with a strong forehand winner. Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime had to battle for his ticket into the semi-finals of the Hamburg Open as he closed off a marathon match on his seventh match point against Alexandre Muller with a delicious drop-shot volley. Since then, many tennis greats have graced the famous clay courts, including Bjorn Borg, Ivan Lendl, Mats Wilander, Gustavo Kuerten, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Iga Swiatek won her third consecutive French Open title in the 2024 tournament, drawing her closer to Chris Evert's record of seven titles.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Grand Slam champion Madison Keys begins her Paris campaign, a loaded Monday lineup also includes Naomi Osaka, Emma Navarro and Barbora Krejcikova. What happens when, after years of trying, you finally achieve your wildest dream? How do you move forward and stay motivated? Madison Keys, winner of the year's first Grand Slam, has some thoughts. “From the time I was 14, I just always wanted to win a Grand Slam, and what would that feel like?” Keys told reporters at Roland Garros. “For 16 years, it was just always kind of still the elusive question, and then to finally achieve it and feel that success, have that achievement and then go home and then think, `OK, wait, this is the first time that I don't not know anymore.' So I think that's just the biggest thing. Just kind of shifting past goals that you have now achieved and setting new ones.” Working on a 7-0 winning streak in the majors -- the last two victories against Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka -- Keys begins her first Slam as a major champion. One of the best matches Osaka played last year was a second-round loss to four-time French Open champion Iga Swiatek. The score was 7-6(1), 1-6, 7-5, and it revealed that Osaka could be a threat on her least-successful surface. This was confirmed when she won the recent WTA 125 in Saint-Malo and won three matches in Rome. Osaka has won five of her previous seven first-round matches at Roland Garros. Badosa, meanwhile, reached the third round in each of her previous four appearances. After going 2-5 in the first round of Grand Slams, she's working on a 13-match win streak. The Spaniard is coming back from a back injury and advanced to the quarterfinals last week in Strasbourg before falling to Liudmila Samsonova. Keys has been mostly money in first-round matches at Roland Garros, winning 11 of 13. Good news and bad news: Saville has won five of eight career clay-court matches against Top 10 opponents -- but the last time it happened was seven years ago. Navarro is coming off a grueling, three-hour loss to Beatriz Haddad Maia in the Strasbourg quarterfinals -- and this is her fifth event of the clay season. Her first appearance at Roland Garros, two years ago, resulted in a second-round loss. Last year, she progressed to the Round of 16. Bouzas Maneiro has made three straight second rounds at the majors but is 1-4 against Top 10 players. Bouzas Maneiro has defeated one Top 50 opponent on clay. The original draw called for Rybakina to play Belinda Bencic, but an arm injury forced the Swiss player to withdraw. Rybakina won four matches and the title in Strasbourg on Saturday -- her first in more than a year -- and has a quick turnaround. Riera, a 22-year-old from Argentina and ranked No. 202, won three qualifying matches and six of seven sets. Krejcikova sat out of six months, nursing a lingering back injury but came back last week in Strasbourg. She lost her opening singles and doubles matches but will be encouraged  by a return to Paris, scene of her first Grand Slam singles title in 2021. Maria, 37 and mother of two daughters, lost her first match at Roland Garros the past five attempts. She won the first four matches from 2017-20, but since then it's 1-all. Kasatkina, playing her first major under the Australian flag, comes in with a 2-3 record on clay -- but knows what it feels like to go deep in Paris. Siniakova, playing her 11th French Open, was the doubles champion in 2018, 2021 (with Barbora Krejcikova) and last year with Coco Gauff. As Grand Slam champion Madison Keys begins her Paris campaign, a loaded Monday lineup also includes Naomi Osaka, Emma Navarro and Barbora Krejcikova.</p>
