Emma Hayes's side will take on the People's Republic of China and Jamaica in the latest international break. 

The United States Women's National Soccer Team (USWNT) return to action this week, with two friendlies on their horizon for the latest instalment of international football.

Emma Hayes's side will face the People's Republic of China, before turning their attention to Jamaica next week.

‚ÄòTriple Espresso' remain absent from the roster, with Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson out through pregnancy, while Trinity Rodman is continuing to work back from an injury.

Noami Girma is a highly anticipated returnee, while Kansas City Current midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta earns a first call up to the senior squad. Should the latter feature in any of the friendlies, she will become the oldest USWNT debutant in the program's 40-year history.

‚ÄúEveryone always earns their call-ups but there are some much-deserved call-ups in this camp for players who have shown consistency in league play,‚Äù Hayes said.

‚ÄúWe have two different types of opponents ahead of us, so we'll have to be creative in breaking down those teams in different ways.

‚ÄúAs has been one of our focuses this year, this camp and the following camp are going to be two amazing opportunities to develop squad depth.‚Äù

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LAFC look to qualify for their first-ever FIFA Club World Cup in Saturday's playoff match at BMO Stadium against Mexican powerhouse Club Am√©rica. They'll slot into Group D alongside Chelsea (England), Flamengo (Brazil) and ES Tunis (Tunisia). Concacaf teams earn a guaranteed $9.55 million for participating in the Club World Cup and could win up to nearly $100 million as part of the unprecedented $1 billion prize pool. In 2023, LAFC reached their second Concacaf Champions Cup final by ousting LD Alajuelense of Costa Rica (Round of 16), Vancouver Whitecaps FC (quarterfinal) and the Philadelphia Union (semifinal). Head coach Steve Cherundolo's side is riding an eight-match unbeaten streak and has lost just once at BMO Stadium this year. Following a 34-point Clausura campaign, Las √Åguilas finished second in the LIGA MX table. However, Toluca denied their four-peat bid with a 2-0 victory in Sunday's Leg 2 finale. With that setback, manager Andr√© Jardine's team can still extend their 2024-25 season and join fellow Mexican sides CF Monterrey (2021 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) and CF Pachuca (2024 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) at this summer's marquee tournament. LAFC and Club Am√©rica met during a preseason friendly in February, with goals from Denis Bouanga and Nathan Ordaz delivering a 2-1 Black & Gold victory at BMO Stadium. This time around, however, the scenario is a bit different with equal ticket distribution for fans and $9.55 million on the line.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madrid are optimistic about signing the young left-back this week, according to MARCA and AS. Real Madrid are accelerating efforts to complete the signing of Benfica left-back √Ålvaro Carreras this week, aiming to finalize the deal in time for the player to be registered for the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup ‚Äî a competition that has become a clear priority for the Spanish giants. According to reports from both MARCA and AS, negotiations between Real Madrid and Benfica resumed after a brief pause to allow the Portuguese club to focus on their domestic cup final. The renewed talks signal Madrid's urgency in reinforcing their squad ahead of a demanding summer schedule. Carreras, 21, is reportedly eager to make the move to the Santiago Bernab√©u, having already reached a verbal agreement with the club several weeks ago. However, Real Madrid are pushing to reduce the financial burden of the transfer, aiming to avoid paying the full ‚Ç¨50 million release clause set by Benfica. Still, all reports suggest that an agreement is likely to be reached within days. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Please enter a valid email and try again.

GOAL looks at the tiers of U.S. internationals playing in Europe, with some finding form and others needing a fresh start

It's been a year full of learnings for Americans Abroad. We know, at this point, that Christian Pulisic is really rather good at football. It's clear, too, that Ricardo Pepi and Antonee Robinson are real talents - who could be part of the USMNT for the foreseeable future.

Elsewhere, though, it's all a bit mixed. Weston McKennie did a bit of everything for Juventus, but it didn't amount to much in the end. Brenden Aaronson helped Leeds to promotion without really winning over the fans. A near-perfect campaign for Malik Tillman was once again disrupted by injury.

Meanwhile, a fair few, not least Gio Reyna and Matt Turner showed exactly why they badly need to move this summer. Piece it all together, though and it made for an interesting campaign in Europe, one that certainly offers plenty of promise - and questions - for the future.

GOAL ranks the tiers of Americans Abroad in the 2024-25 season.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LAFC host Mexican powerhouse Club Am√©rica on Saturday evening, with the winner punching their ticket to the FIFA 2025 Club World Cup. As such, either LAFC or Club Am√©rica will take their place in Group D alongside Chelsea (England), Flamengo (Brazil) and ES Tunis (Tunisia). LAFC were granted this opportunity as the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup runners-up; head coach Steve Cherundolo's side fell 3-1 on aggregate to Club Le√≥n during that two-legged final. They're also carrying an eight-game unbeaten run (3W-0L-5D), most recently earning a 2-2 comeback draw at CF Montr√©al thanks to Olivier Giroud's rebound finish. Should LAFC win, they'd become the third MLS side at the Club World Cup alongside Seattle Sounders FC (2022 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) and Inter Miami CF (host nation spot). Their top threat is Denis Bouanga, who has 10 goals in 20 appearances (all competitions) this season. However, their bid for a four-peat was denied Sunday evening when they fell 2-0 to Toluca in Leg 2 of the Clausura final. That result only adds fuel for head coach Andr√© Jardine's side, which is littered with high-profile stars. That list includes former FC Dallas homegrown forward Alejandro Zendejas, who also represents the US men's national team. Should Las √Åguilas prevail, they would join fellow Mexican sides CF Monterrey (2021 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) and CF Pachuca (2024 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) at this summer's marquee tournament.</p>

Hugo Viana is taking over as director of football from Txiki Begiristain, while City hope Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White ‚Äì called up to Thomas Tuchel's latest England squad - will also join them. Manchester City have stepper up their pursuit of AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders (pictured) Pep Guardiola has, though, insisted that the club will make the final decision on transfers rather than him Guardiola suggested that an influx of new faces is unlikely but City are thought to want at least one full back - Rayan Ait-Nouri at Wolves has long been admired - as well as a couple of midfielders. The futures of the likes of Ederson and Matheus Nunes are up in the air, while Guardiola confirmed that Jack Grealish could leave, with outgoings likely to have an impact on supplementary business. 'I don't have any doubts that with Rodri there and Phil (Foden) there, we would have competed (this year),' Guardiola said after they secured Champions League qualification. 'I'm not saying we would have won because Liverpool deserved to win, but we would have been better. What happens next season the club is going to decide. 'I give my suggestions but the club will decide. That is not the most important thing, the most important thing is how we create our connection and vibes between all of us to go and compete everywhere.

This according to today's print edition of Milan-based newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, via FCInterNews. The club season is only just coming to an end. Then, next month, Inter will play in the expanded Club World Cup in the United States. They will be one of two teams representing Serie A in the competition along with Juventus. However, there is also time for another international break right after the Champions League final. The Gazzetta confirm that Italy coach Luciano Spalletti has called up Alessandro Bastoni, Federico Dimarco, Nicolo Barella, and Davide Frattesi. Then, there is the question of whether Francesco Acerbi could get a spot. Aside from Bastoni, Spalletti will call up Federico Gatti, Alessandro Buongiorno, and Riccardo Calafiori in defense, reports the Gazzetta. However, there will likely also be an additional defender, the newspaper reports.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Josep Pedrerol has revealed news that shakes the market. Trent Alexander-Arnold will play the Club World Cup with Real Madrid. The English defender will join Xabi Alonso's team immediately. Real Madrid has accelerated the operation so that Xabi Alonso has all his reinforcements from the start. "Arnold will go to the Club World Cup, they will pay about 5 million to Liverpool so he can go. Therefore, it is already closed for 5 million," Pedrerol insisted. The English full-back's contract ends this summer. But Madrid did not want to wait. They prefer to pay this symbolic amount and have him right away. The club already made his signing official a few days ago. The second will be √Ålvaro Carreras, Benfica's left-back. The third, already closed, is Trent Alexander-Arnold. All three will be available for Xabi Alonso. Real Madrid's new coach will be presented today. Florentino P√©rez wants to offer him a competitive team from the start. Trent Alexander-Arnold arrives with the experience of having won everything at Liverpool. His quality, vision of the game, and offensive capability make him a top-level reinforcement for the right-back position. For only 5 million euros, Madrid secures a strategic signing. They do it before his contract ends. In summary: Alexander-Arnold will play the Club World Cup with Real Madrid.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is the first major easing of Saudi Arabia's alcohol ban in over 70 years Saudi Arabia will reportedly permit alcohol sales at select tourist venues by 2026, in a significant policy shift aimed at boosting tourism ahead of Expo 2030 and the FIFA World Cup in 2034. Permitted drinks will be limited to wine, beer and cider, with a maximum alcohol content of 20%. According to a report by Saudi Moments, all alcohol must be consumed on-site. Alcohol will also remain unavailable in homes, shops, and public areas outside of the licensed zones. Officials said the changes are part of Vision 2030, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's wide-reaching plan to diversify the Saudi economy and reduce reliance on oil revenues. The general ban on alcohol for Saudi citizens and Muslim residents will remain in place. Religious cities such as Mecca and Medina will continue to prohibit alcohol entirely. Located in Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter, the store is open only to non-Muslim foreign diplomats. Access is limited to customers who register via a government app, receive foreign ministry clearance, and comply with monthly quotas. The alcohol licensing programme will begin rolling out in 2026, just four years before Saudi Arabia is due to host Expo 2030 in Riyadh and eight years before the World Cup. In an interview with LBC ( London Broadcasting Company), Prince Khalid bin Bandar Al Saud stated that alcohol would not be sold anywhere during the tournament, including hotels. ‚ÄúAt the moment, we don't allow alcohol,‚Äù Prince Khalid said. Asked whether fans would be able to drink in hotels, as was the case at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, he replied: ‚ÄúNo, there is no alcohol at all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Looks like we will have at least part of an answer about who Juve's next manager will be in a short amount of time. After helping Juventus secure Champions League football for next season on Sunday night in Venice, it appears as though interim manager Igor Tudor has drawn a line in the sand when it comes to his future at the club. And it also sounds like we will find out shortly as to whether the Croatian will be Juve's manager going forward ‚Äî and even at the Club World Cup this summer. During his post-match media availability on Sky Italia following Juve's 3-2 win over Venezia that secured a fourth-place finish and Champions League qualification, Tudor said that he will discuss his future with the club ‚Äúvery soon.‚Äù On top of that, Tudor essentially said that it makes no sense for him to manage Juventus at the Club World Cup if he is not confirmed as the head coach for next season ‚Äî which goes against something that we've heard from the club's management for much of the last couple of weeks and again from Chief Football Officer Cristiano Giuntoli after Sunday night's game that Juve will decide on their next manager after their participation in the tournament. Juventus can either keep Tudor for the 2025-26 season or payout a buyout ‚Äî believed to be around ‚Ç¨1 million ‚Äî if they want to go a different direction with their next manager. Here are Tudor's words regarding his future as Juventus' manager beyond Sunday night's season finale: ‚ÄúYou're making me get into discussions about which I can't say anything. We'll see each other soon and a decision will be made soon, we were all focused on this finale, on the games. I don't even have to talk about it for a question of concentration, now there's the World Cup but everything can be resolved beforehand.‚Äù Juventus begin group play at the Club World Cup against Al Ain FC from the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday June 18, at Audi Field in Washington D.C. One of the biggest clubs in the sport, Real Madrid, have already set up their managerial succession line and will see it get officially underway this summer, with Xabi Alonso coming in for Carlo Ancelotti, who will now head to the Brazilian national team. With rumors spinning that a certain former Juventus manager ‚Äî and teammate of Tudor's during his playing days in Turin ‚Äî might be leaving Naples after leading Napoli to the Scudetto this season, the Bianconeri might be trying to rekindle their old flame shortly. And if that's the case, then they may as well have their new manager start work and evaluating this squad at the Club World Cup no matter who is actually available to play. If they have determined that Sunday night's win in Venice was the last time he will be on the sidelines and somebody else will be hired on a full-time basis, then it seems like we're going to know in relatively short order.</p>
