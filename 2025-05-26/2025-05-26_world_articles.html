                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tánaiste to announce draft legislation on Tuesday, covering trade in goods such as olives, oranges and dates The Irish government is to unveil a bill to ban imports from the occupied Palestinian territories in the first move by an EU member to curtail trade in goods produced in Israeli settlements illegal under international law. Simon Harris, the tánaiste (deputy prime minister), confirmed he would unveil draft legislation on Tuesday. The law would make it a criminal offence to import goods originating from the occupied territories but would not result in a boycott on Israeli goods. A ban on exports from the occupied territories is seen as symbolic, as trade is limited to physical products such as dates, oranges, olives and some timber and was worth just €685,000 (£575,000) in the four years from 2020 to 2024. The move comes just days after the EU said it would review its 1995 trade agreement with Israel after a Dutch proposal, similar to a rejected demand put forward by Ireland and Spain in February 2024, was made to the European Commission. “This is a massive welcome step, it is the first time a trade measure of this kind has been applied to Israel by any EU country. Trade is an EU competency but there are exceptional circumstances in which member states can restrict it. The European Commission said it was unable to comment on a proposal it had not yet received, but would offer “factual positions” once such a bill had been enacted by the Irish parliament and transmitted to Brussels. “We want to do something impactful … but the European Union acting collectively would have a much more profound impact,” Harris said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The reported decision by Ukraine's Western backers to lift restrictions on Kiev's use of long-range weapons runs counter to Russia's efforts toward a peaceful settlement of the conflict, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. Peskov made the remarks in response to comments by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who said Ukraine is no longer subject to range limitations on Western-supplied weaponry. “If such decisions have indeed been made, they are entirely at odds with our aspirations for a political resolution and with the efforts currently being made toward a settlement,” Peskov stated. “Quite dangerous decisions, again – if they were indeed made,” he stressed. At the EuropaForum on Monday, Merz said “there are no longer any range restrictions” on Western-supplied weapons used by Ukraine against Russian military targets. Moscow has repeatedly warned Western countries against enabling Ukraine to carry out long-range strikes, arguing that this could make the military bloc a direct participant in the conflict given that such attacks would require targeting data from NATO satellites – capabilities that Kiev does not possess. Since then, Ukrainian forces have launched numerous long-range strikes inside Russia using Western-supplied weapons. Russia has consistently condemned Western arms shipments to Ukraine, arguing that they fuel more bloodshed and hinder efforts toward the peace process. Earlier this month, Russia and Ukraine held their first direct talks since 2022. The sides agreed to present detailed ceasefire proposals, carry out a record 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner swap, and continue negotiations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Friday that Moscow is at an “advanced stage” of preparing a memorandum outlining the principles and timeline for a peace settlement with Ukraine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The global economy thrived on a foundation of openness and multilateralism underpinned by US leadership,” Lagarde said in a speech at the Hertie School in Berlin. Washington's support for a rules-based international system and the US dollar as a reserve currency had “set the stage for trade to flourish and finance to expand.” “But today it is fracturing,” she said in an apparent reference to global trade tensions fuelled by US President Donald Trump's threat to impose sweeping tariffs on key partners. “Multilateral cooperation is being replaced by zero-sum thinking and bilateral power plays. “Any change in the international order that leads to lower world trade or fragmentation into economic blocs will be detrimental to our economy,” she said. It would also need to strengthen its economy and defend the rule of law, she said. “This is not a privilege that will simply be given to us. That's boosting the euro in a move Lagarde has previously called “counterintuitive” but justified. In yesterday's speech, Lagarde highlighted three areas that are critical to enhance euro's global status. Second, she repeated calls to complete the single market, help start-ups, trim regulation and build the savings and investment union, toward which progress has been slow. Lagarde also reiterated that there should be more joint financing on the European level for measures including defense — another politically contentious idea. “Economic logic tells us that public goods need to be jointly financed,” Lagarde said. “And this joint financing could provide the basis for Europe to gradually increase its supply of safe assets.” Finally, Lagarde said Europe must show its ability to uphold a robust legal and institutional foundation to safeguard investor confidence in their long-term value.

LONDON, May 26. /TASS/. The Palestinian movement Hamas has accepted the proposal of US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff on cessation of hostilities with Israel in the Gaza Strip, Reuters reported, citing a Palestinian official close to the radicals.

According to him, the new proposal, which Hamas received through mediators, includes the release of ten hostages and a 70-day truce. During this period, a permanent ceasefire would be discussed under US guarantees.

"The proposal includes the release of ten living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in two groups in return for a 70-day ceasefire and a partial withdrawal from the Gaza Strip," the source told Reuters.

The source added that the list of conditions also includes Israel's release of several Palestinian prisoners, including those serving long sentences.

On March 18, the Israeli army resumed fighting in the Gaza Strip, launching massive attacks on the Palestinian enclave and violating a ceasefire reached in January. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explained that the radical Palestinian movement Hamas refused to agree to the proposals put forward at the talks by mediators and US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, saying that the goal of the operation in the enclave was the release of all hostages. The radicals blamed Israel and the US for the resumption of hostilities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump also  touted his push for an annual $1 trillion military budget during a West Point commencement address. U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday bragged to West Point's graduating class that he has refused to cut Pentagon spending and touted his push for an annual military budget of $1 trillion, arguing that other programs should be on the chopping block instead. I said, ‘I'm not cutting 10 cents,'” the president said of Pentagon spending during his bizarre, campaign-style commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy. “We can cut plenty of other things,” Trump added, without specifying what he sees as better targets for cuts than the Pentagon, a sprawling morass of waste and abuse that recently failed its seventh consecutive audit. Trump's remarks came after House Republicans, with his support, passed a massive budget reconciliation package that includes more than $100 billion in additional spending for the U.S. military and around $1 trillion in combined cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The military spending boost, which critics slammed as unnecessary and detrimental, is aimed at promoting Trump priorities such as his proposed “Golden Dome,” an idea that experts have dismissed as a “fantasy.” It is also a major opportunity for profiteering: Reuters reported last month that Elon Musk's SpaceX has emerged as one of the frontrunners to build a “crucial part” of the system. “A trillion-dollar investment in ordinary Americans is not radical; it would effectively help prevent crime, improve security, and raise standards of living across the country. And it's what most people actually want,” wrote NPP research analyst Hanna Homestead. “Poll after poll shows Americans would rather have their tax dollars spent on public services than on Pentagon contractors, and would prefer policymakers prioritize spending on healthcare, education, housing, and infrastructure — not the military.” The Trump administration is cracking down on political dissent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Palestinian civilians and Israeli Defense Force members described a practice that is banned under international law. “Orders often came from the top, and at times nearly every platoon used a Palestinian to clear locations,” AP reported, citing the account of an unnamed Israeli officer. “Soldiers stood behind him and, once it was clear, entered the buildings to damage or destroy them, he said,” AP reported. “He spent each night bound in a dark room, only to wake up and do it again.” Nadav Weiman, executive director of Breaking the Silence — an anti-occupation group founded by former Israeli soldiers — told AP that “these are not isolated accounts; they point to a systemic failure and a horrifying moral collapse.” But Israeli forces have long been accused of using detained Palestinians as human shields, both during and prior to the current assault on Gaza. According to the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, “Over the years, the military practiced an official policy of using Palestinians as human shields, ordering them to carry out military activities that put their lives in jeopardy: Palestinians were forced to remove suspicious objects from roads, tell other Palestinians to come out and surrender themselves, physically shield soldiers while they fired, and more.” “In most cases, no one was held accountable,” the group said. Earlier this year, an anonymous Israeli officer wrote in a column for Haaretz that “in Gaza, human shields are used by Israeli soldiers at least six times a day.” The reporting came as Israel continued with its large-scale ground offensive and aerial assault in Gaza, where the entire population is facing a dire hunger crisis due to Israel's monthslong siege. On Sunday, according to Reuters, “Israeli military strikes killed at least 23 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip… including a local journalist and a senior rescue service official.” Hours earlier, an Israeli strike on a home in Khan Younis killed nine children of a Nasser Hospital pediatrician and badly injured her husband while she was at work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senior figures in British business have described a chilling effect on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, saying they are being “rebranded” to avoid attracting unwanted political attention. “They're basically embedding diversity and getting rid of the word – I don't necessarily see it as a bad thing. But some companies, particularly US-headquartered firms, have already scaled back some commitments, and are less keen to celebrate inclusion work publicly. Sesay said US businesses were finding ways to disguise DEI work so they could still promote the best talent and address inequalities. They have to take the word diversity out of absolutely everything. Noreen Biddle Shah, who founded Reboot, a campaigning group of senior financial service professionals, to tackle racial inequality in the industry in 2019, said the “landscape feels very different” now. “DEI has become a politically charged term, and many firms are either stepping back from the work – a trend we saw coming from the US, but it is impacting UK financial services too,” said Shah. “Not only do fewer organisations want to partner with us, but they're also discouraging their own employees from speaking out. In our latest annual Race to Equality: Financial Services report, we found that in light of the DEI backlash, ethnic minority professionals in the sector feel muzzled for speaking out – many expressed fear of losing their jobs if they raised race-related concerns. And sadly, 70% said there has been little progress since the Black Lives Matter movement.” Nina Mohanty, a finalist in Veuve Clicquot's Bold Future awards 2025, which celebrates rising female entrepreneurs, and who is the founder of a tech startup, Bloom Money, said: “In the world of startups and tech companies, you had a lot of VCs [venture capitalists] that were saying, ‘we're gonna do special programmes for black entrepreneurs, we're gonna back more women and women of colour'. James Hockin, an employment law expert and partner at global law firm Withers who advises senior executives in New York and London, said Trump's unpopularity among some people also meant employees were exerting pressure on British employers to keep policies in place. I don't like what Trump is doing on DEI',” he said. But I think increasingly, with pressure from employees, there is a desire for employers to be seen to be taking a stance.” Agreeing that DEI would survive but in a “rebranded” form, Hockin said: “DEI, for employers at least, started from a place of sorting out the culture in an organisation so that you weren't leaving yourself vulnerable to a [legal] claim against your organisation – employers were keen to mitigate their risk. “Where employers are getting on side with the Trump agenda, inadvertently, what they're doing, is potentially opening themselves up to that risk.” Zahoor Ahmad, Co-op's head of social mobility, said: “The key assumption is that if you didn't have [DEI], everything will be a level playing field. All of human history tells us that is not true. It's very hard to have a true meritocracy, when we are not born equal. What we are trying to do is eliminate inequalities.” But the public sector, our primary client base, continues to champion these values. Embracing DEI isn't just morally right, its actually a strategic advantage.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French President Emmanuel Macron has dismissed a viral video showing his wife Brigitte pushing his face away as they disembarked from a plane in Vietnam for the first leg of a Southeast Asia tour. Speaking to reporters in Hanoi on Monday, Macron addressed the clip directly, pushing back against the speculation it sparked. “There's a video showing me joking and teasing my wife and somehow that becomes a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe, with people even coming up with theories to explain it,” the president said. Macron acknowledged the footage was genuine but criticized how it had been weaponized. “The videos are all real, and yes, sometimes people tamper with them, but people are attributing all kinds of nonsense to them.” Seconds later, both of Brigitte Macron's hands reach out from the side and press against the president's face in what looks like a sudden shove. Macron appears momentarily surprised but quickly regains his composure and waves to the press outside. It was a “moment of togetherness,” according to an Élysée source. “It was a moment when the president and his wife were unwinding one last time before the trip began, playfully teasing each other,” the source told CNN Monday. Macron has been at the forefront of efforts to agree a coordinated European response to defending Ukraine following Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. The incident in Hanoi comes as Macron faces another swirl of online disinformation. Earlier this month the Élysée dismissed as “fake news” a viral claim - amplified by Kremlin officials - that the French president was using cocaine aboard a train to Kyiv alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The rumor, traced back to pro-Russian accounts, falsely claimed a crumpled tissue Macron picked up was a cocaine bag. For blowing your nose… When European unity becomes inconvenient, disinformation makes a simple tissue look like drugs.” French officials condemned the campaign as part of ongoing efforts by Moscow to weaken Western unity on Ukraine and manipulate peace discussions through false narratives and social media manipulation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stand behind Ukrainian independent journalism when it's needed most. Western partners are not imposing any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine for use against Russian military targets, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on May 26. "There are no longer any restrictions on the range of weapons delivered to Ukraine – neither by the U.K., France, nor us. "This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia," the chancellor added. Ukraine has previously received long-range missiles from the U.S., the U.K., and France — including ATACMS, Storm Shadow, and SCALP — but was initially permitted to deploy them only against Russian military forces in occupied Ukrainian territories. Only in late 2024, the U.S. Biden administration and other allies eased the restrictions, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian military targets in border regions. U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized ex-President Joe Biden's decision to ease the restrictions as he seeks to negotiate a peace agreement between Kyiv and Moscow. The German chancellor also stressed that while Ukraine is using its arms to target Russian military infrastructure, Russia continues to attack Ukrainian "cities, kindergartens, hospitals, and care homes." We're working hard to show the world the truth of Russia's brutal war — and we're keeping it free for everyone, because reliable information should be available to all. Our goal: reach 20,000 members to prove independent journalism can survive without paywalls, billionaires, or compromise.</p>

MOSCOW, May 26. /TASS/. Russia's Armed Forces have been delivering strikes on Ukrainian military facilities in response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian civilian infrastructure, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a news briefing.

"We can see how the Ukrainians attack our social infrastructure facilities, civilian infrastructure. These are retaliatory strikes, strikes on military facilities and military targets," he said in response to a TASS reporter's question.

On Sunday, Russia launched high-precision strikes on military facilities on Ukrainian soil, following days of unprecedented massive drone attacks from Kiev. Among other things, Ukrainian defense plants that manufacture missile and drone components, as well as electronic intelligence and satellite communication centers were targeted. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, all designated targets were hit.

The West chose to ignore Ukrainian attacks as it criticized the Russian retaliatory strikes instead. US President Donald Trump, for one, voiced his dissatisfaction with the Russian attacks and said that he is considering more sanctions on Russia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Florida Panthers centre Sam Reinhart tries to score against the Toronto Maple Leafs during their playoff series earlier this month.Michael Laughlin/The Associated Press Shortly after the start of the NHL's Eastern Conference final, Florida Panthers coach Paul Maurice was doing his usual trick – unsettling an opponent with philosophy. “I'm not a believer at all in momentum,” Maurice said. “I don't think you establish anything. That while their starless, tough-minded-but-not-actually-tough approach is great for the regular season, it's not fit for purpose in the playoffs. But I can almost guarantee you that the Toronto Maple Leafs' current management is getting the opposite, entirely wrong, message from the exact same data set. The one time they didn't involved Boston, who then lost to Florida, who then won the title, making the Leafs Stanley Cup champions twice removed. If you've ever wondered why the Leafs have become so inured to the status quo, this is why. It's possible to break out the magnifying glass and reduce all of Toronto's seven-game auto-destructs to one moment. If you had to pick one in the most recent instance, it was Sam Bennett braining Anthony Stolarz in Game 1, and the rest of the Leafs standing around watching. That was the moment Maurice and the Panthers would have known that while the Leafs had acquired some wolfish new personnel, they were all still sheep in their bones. It's irresistible to think and talk like this in Toronto, where Leafs chat is the conversational coin of the realm. What else are we supposed to talk about? Any talk that is ongoing 51 weeks of the year (aside from that one news cycle where the Blue Jays pack it in) is going to be granular. Opinion: After Shanahan bloodletting, Pelley leaves little doubt over where the buck stops at MLSE So you don't try to move an all-star centre who's had nine kicks at the can and hasn't managed to connect once. Instead, you leave the non-performing centre where he is and hope next time is different. Then you hire a cheap piece who would've gone over and beaten Bennett like a rug without needing to be told to do so. This nitpicking way of going about things had one benefit – it kept everything calm. Above all, Toronto sports has come to prize executive serenity. On the odd chance they do, it's only after an endless supply of second chances. Nobody should get too worked up about it because nothing is going to be different. There's a plan and, sure, it's not working, but we're going to stick to it. Because the real enemy here is panic. You could once have argued that that made some sense, in the Brian Burke, J.P. Ricciardi, Bryan Colangelo years, but the cultural pendulum has started making loop-the-loops. It's time to inject some hysteria back into Toronto sports, and the Leafs in particular. Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment president and CEO Keith Pelley.Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press What happens when Real lose two years in a row? This is harder to manage in a salary-cap environment yadda yadda yadda, but if you're going to take ruthless performance targets out of it, GMs of hockey teams should make the same money as GMs of car dealerships. In future, think less like the Florida Panthers or Tampa Bay Lightning. Those teams live in a different reality than the Leafs – zero local pressure, lower taxes, free to lose for years after they've won once. Think more like Real Madrid – hire hard-minded players who don't know how to lose, and then hold them to it by demanding immediate and permanent results. If the people you've got can't provide them, don't try to fix anybody. Release them into some other, low-pressure environment where they'll be happy. Then go out and get other winning-fixated types. If the Leafs are serious about change the first thing they'll do is bid adieu to Mitch Marner and John Tavares. It's true that it is hard to find guys who score 100 points in the regular season, but it should be easy to find replacements who haven't folded up like lawn chairs in the last seven playoffs. Making radical change on this team won't be easy to do, but there ought be no excuse not to do it. Anyone who wants to sit you down and explain why that isn't the way it works does not belong at the greatest team in the world. In future, the Leafs should put one idea above all others – no more explanations. No more jabber about culture or structure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. ZAUR SHIRIYEV is a Nonresident Scholar at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. As recently as 2020, the small, oil- and natural-gas-rich country was mired in a decades-long conflict with neighboring Armenia and lacked full control of its territory. For years, the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous area with an ethnic Armenian population within Azerbaijan's internationally recognized borders, had been governed by a self-declared authority backed by Armenia. Following successful wars in 2020 and 2023, Azerbaijan has finally reincorporated Nagorno-Karabakh as well as seven adjacent districts that had been occupied by Armenian forces since the early 1990s. It has also gained a decisive upper hand against Armenia. Meanwhile, distracted by the war in Ukraine, Russia has ceded much of its former regional influence to Azerbaijan; and with Moscow cut off from Western markets, Azerbaijan has risen in importance as a global energy supplier, including to Europe. Amid this remarkable recent good fortune, Azerbaijan faces an important choice. Yet it is unclear whether Azerbaijan will embrace the opportunity. Seeing itself in a position of strength, it has demanded further concessions from Armenia and appears to be in no hurry to conclude the deal. Meanwhile, although its oil- and gas-centered economy has brought much prosperity in recent years, these gains are fragile, and there has been little effort to diversify. Even a modest dip in energy prices—as has already begun to occur in 2025—could destabilize state finances and expose deeper vulnerabilities, including rising social inequality and public disaffection. In power for more than 20 years, Azerbaijan's leader, Ilham Aliyev, has continued to tighten his political control and clamp down on dissent, relying on the country's economic growth and a narrative of national strength to keep the population content. These weaknesses, coupled with geopolitical uncertainty across the region, make Azerbaijan's rise precarious. If the war in Ukraine begins to wind down, Russia might refocus on a region where it can still exert control—including over its former longtime ally, Armenia. Even short of that, Moscow could be a potent spoiler, especially if no peace agreement is signed and transport links between Armenia and Azerbaijan remain blocked. Lacking the broader dividends of peace, including foreign investment and regional economic integration, Azerbaijan might also lose the chance to build a more sustainable political order at home. As a result, the South Caucasus could remain trapped in rivalry, forfeiting what may be the region's best opportunity yet for meaningful cooperation among its three states. In one sense, it is remarkable that Azerbaijan and Armenia, decades-old antagonists, have hammered out a draft agreement at all. Without Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it is unlikely that a peace process would have even started. But just as Azerbaijani forces seemed set to retake the final Armenian-held areas of Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia intervened, halting the offensive and deploying peacekeepers on Azerbaijani soil. In Baku's eyes, Moscow had snatched away its rightful victory. Azerbaijan was now dependent on Russia, which exploited the situation for its own interests. Meanwhile, Armenia had effectively outsourced the security of Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenian population to Moscow, assuming that the Kremlin—a traditional Armenian ally—would never allow Baku to fully reassert sovereignty. With the peacekeepers lacking a formal mandate or strong engagement from Moscow, an emboldened Azerbaijan began testing the Russian presence with limited military incursions and expanded forward positions in Armenian-populated areas. That message was confirmed in September 2023, when Azerbaijan launched a large-scale military operation that within a few hours captured all of Nagorno-Karabakh—without Russian resistance. Sensing it was overpowered, Armenia stood by, leaving Azerbaijan with a resounding victory and causing a mass exodus of Karabakh Armenians to Armenia—many of whom had long resisted integration into Azerbaijani rule. Meanwhile, the Aliyev government had been leveraging geopolitical shifts to gain greater regional clout. Cut off from the West by sanctions, Moscow had begun relying on alternative trade routes—particularly the so-called North-South Transport Corridor, which runs from Moscow through Azerbaijan and Iran to Persian Gulf ports. Although the infrastructure on this route is still being developed, it has become a vital path for an isolated Russia and has strengthened Azerbaijan's hand against the Kremlin. Moscow now understood that confronting Baku risked straining its complex and strategically important relationship with Turkey. As a result of this push, in late 2022, Armenia formally recognized Azerbaijan's territorial integrity—a step that had been almost unthinkable a year earlier. Baku, for its part, now positioned itself as a more autonomous actor, capable of engaging with Russia, Turkey, and the West on its own terms. By 2024, it was even able to compel Russian peacekeepers to withdraw ahead of schedule, thus clearing the way for a durable bilateral peace. For Azerbaijan, however, peace with Armenia was only one of several opportunities opened up by the war in Ukraine. Although Azerbaijani gas supplies could not rival the scale of Russian exports, they offered enough to buttress European energy security—particularly for southern European countries with more modest needs. Through the Southern Gas Corridor, which channels Azerbaijani gas to Europe via Georgia and Turkey, Baku solidified its role as a key energy partner, exporting more than 44 billion cubic meters of natural gas to the EU between 2021 and 2024. Yet the profits were more modest than some in Baku may have anticipated. Despite higher global energy prices, gas exports brought in around $12 billion over those four years—less than Azerbaijan earned from oil in a single year, as surging prices delivered a much larger windfall. The outlook has been further clouded by Europe's reluctance to expand its energy delivery infrastructure to receive more Azerbaijani gas exports—a step that some member states see as conflicting with the bloc's ambitious climate goals. Russia turned to the South Caucasus as a critical link in alternative north-south trade routes, and Azerbaijan also capitalized on its position as a transit point for alternative east-west corridors—supported by Western efforts to reroute trade flows from Asia away from Russia via the Caspian Sea, in the so-called Middle Corridor. Although cargo volumes along this route have risen, they have been constrained by limited infrastructure and bottlenecks and still constitute just three to five percent of total Eurasian trade. Nonetheless, Central Asia's growing economic importance—as a source of critical raw materials, energy diversification, and strategic balance vis-à-vis Russia and China—makes these routes worth developing. Yet this new geopolitical clout has not insulated Azerbaijan from regional tensions, especially with neighboring Iran. Although Azerbaijan is also a Shiite-majority country, Iran has watched its influence there steadily wane. The relationship worsened sharply after the 2020 war, which restored Azerbaijani control over a large stretch of its border with Iran and which tightened Baku's ties to Tehran's rivals, Turkey and Israel. Although tensions have since eased, Iran is losing its long-standing leverage over Baku, including its historical relationship with Nakhichevan, the Azerbaijani exclave on Iran's border. In March 2025, Turkey and Azerbaijan inaugurated a new gas pipeline connecting Nakhichevan to Turkey's gas grid, and thus reduced Nakhichevan's decades-old reliance on Iranian energy. If a peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia also unlocks a direct land corridor from Azerbaijan to the exclave through southern Armenia, Iran would lose yet another point of leverage. Such a shift would diminish Iran's role not just in energy transit but also in regional trade, where it has long served as a conduit for Turkish goods headed to Central Asia. Iran also harbors deeper concerns about Azerbaijan: that in a future conflict over its nuclear program, Baku could serve as a springboard for Israeli military action. For this Iranian minority, many of whom are in the country's northwest, a more assertive Baku, and its growing emphasis on shared ethnic and historical ties, could inspire ethnic mobilization, or even separatist aspirations. Azerbaijan's rising international profile has not insulated it from internal weaknesses. In theory, this should offer a rare chance for a broader political reset: for years, the lack of political and economic reforms and overinvestment in the military were justified by the unresolved conflict, and many Azerbaijanis hoped that victory would finally open up the country and allow it to fashion a new “post-Karabakh” national identity. In doing so, the government had continued to portray Armenia as a threat, drawing on the population's shared experience of war, territorial loss, and mass displacement. But with the return of the occupied territories and little public appetite for renewed conflict, those experiences no longer resonate as they once did. The government shows little interest in moving beyond the old narrative—not only because it helps legitimize domestic control, but because no clear alternative national story has emerged. And as the government narrative weakens, the structural challenges it once helped obscure are becoming harder to ignore, including public frustration over limited economic opportunity and concerns about transparent governance. Azerbaijan depends heavily on volatile revenues from its Caspian Sea oil and gas reserves. Even this year's moderate drop in oil prices—from around $80 a barrel in early 2025 to just $64 as of late May—could, if sustained, wipe out more than 20 percent of state revenue. Baku's geography alone will not be enough to make it a critical east-west energy and trade hub. Countries that have successfully leveraged their location—whether in Europe, the Gulf, or Central Asia—have paired it with institutional reliability, regulatory transparency, and a baseline of political stability. Foreign investors may not require democracy, but they do require rules-based systems—where decisions are predictable, institutions function consistently, and political interference and corruption is kept in check. Last December, for example, after a Russian missile mistakenly downed an Azerbaijani civilian aircraft, Aliyev himself publicly rebuked the Kremlin. But that might change if Russia were to reassert itself in the Caucasus. If tensions grow between Iran, Israel, and the United States, Tehran could lash out at Azerbaijan militarily or by using its influence with Shiite clerics to foment internal unrest—particularly if Baku appears to be supporting Israel. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan has stalled on a historic chance for lasting regional peace. Quietly, Azerbaijani officials suggest they may also insist on an upfront guarantee of major investment from the European Union and Western development institutions to help rebuild Azerbaijan's formerly Armenian-controlled territories. Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding regions are now being gradually resettled by some of the more than 600,000 Azerbaijanis displaced during the 1990s war, but progress is slow; so far, only around 13,000 of them have returned. With creativity, patience, and trust, many of these issues can be resolved. Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is a strong supporter of a deal, and if he manages to persuade Armenians that constitutional reform is simply a bilateral confidence-building step that will bring much larger long-term economic rewards, he might ultimately succeed. But if he takes such a controversial step before crucial Armenian parliamentary elections in 2026, domestic critics may accuse him of selling out, and the entire peace process could be derailed. Notably, Pashinyan is the only major political figure in Yerevan pushing for a permanent settlement, and members of Armenia's opposition have called the proposed constitutional reform a betrayal of national interests. If Pashinyan loses power, it could open the door to a very different Armenian leadership, likely led by a mix of revanchist and Russia-leaning figures who may see renewed confrontation with Azerbaijan as politically advantageous. Moreover, for many Armenians, the issue of reopening trade routes and borders—some of them closed for over three decades—remains politically charged, particularly the proposed route linking Azerbaijan to Nakhichevan. Here, the European Union, which is still seen as a credible peace broker on both sides, could propose practical arrangements that meet both sides' expectations on access and control—while also offering financial assistance, infrastructure investment, and technical support to help implement them. Ankara sees the South Caucasus as part of its strategic hinterland and views normalization with Armenia as a way to help shape, not dominate, the postconflict order. The question is not whether a peace treaty is desirable but whether it can be secured before the window that has made it possible closes. The strategic opening created by Moscow's distraction in Ukraine will not last indefinitely. If further geopolitical shifts occur without a durable settlement in place, Russia may still find ways to reinsert itself—maybe not to restore its former dominance but to obstruct progress, prolong ambiguity, and make sure its interests are preserved. That outcome would benefit none of those who would be immediately affected by Russia's presence—not Azerbaijan, not Armenia, and not the broader region.
