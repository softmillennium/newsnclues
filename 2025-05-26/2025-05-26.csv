            French President Emmanuel Macron has dismissed a viral video showing his wife Brigitte pushing his face away as they disembarked from a plane in Vietnam for the first leg of a Southeast Asia tour.
    


            Speaking to reporters in Hanoi on Monday, Macron addressed the clip directly, pushing back against the speculation it sparked.
    


            “There's a video showing me joking and teasing my wife and somehow that becomes a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe, with people even coming up with theories to explain it,” the president said.
    


            Macron acknowledged the footage was genuine but criticized how it had been weaponized. “The videos are all real, and yes, sometimes people tamper with them, but people are attributing all kinds of nonsense to them.”
    


            The short clip shows the aircraft door opening with Macron appearing in the doorway. Seconds later, both of Brigitte Macron's hands reach out from the side and press against the president's face in what looks like a sudden shove.
    


            Macron appears momentarily surprised but quickly regains his composure and waves to the press outside.
    


            As the couple descend the steps, Macron offers Brigitte his arm, which she does not take, opting instead to hold the railing.
    


            The Élysée initially denied the incident on the plane, before later moving to downplay its significance.
    


            The couple were merely bickering, a source close to the president told CNN affiliate BFM TV. It was a “moment of togetherness,” according to an Élysée source.
    


            “It was a moment when the president and his wife were unwinding one last time before the trip began, playfully teasing each other,” the source told CNN Monday.
    


            “No more was needed to feed the mills of the conspiracy theorists,” the source added, saying pro-Russian trolls were quick to spin the moment into controversy.
    


            Macron has been at the forefront of efforts to agree a coordinated European response to defending Ukraine following Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.
    


            The incident in Hanoi comes as Macron faces another swirl of online disinformation. Earlier this month the Élysée dismissed as “fake news” a viral claim - amplified by Kremlin officials - that the French president was using cocaine aboard a train to Kyiv alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
    


            The rumor, traced back to pro-Russian accounts, falsely claimed a crumpled tissue Macron picked up was a cocaine bag. The Élysée posted a rebuttal online with the caption: “This is a tissue. For blowing your nose… When European unity becomes inconvenient, disinformation makes a simple tissue look like drugs.”
    


            The Kremlin's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova fueled the claim, suggesting the scene was part of a wider European dysfunction. French officials condemned the campaign as part of ongoing efforts by Moscow to weaken Western unity on Ukraine and manipulate peace discussions through false narratives and social media manipulation.

            The head of a new aid distribution program for Gaza, backed by the US and Israel, has resigned after weeks of controversy, citing concerns over impartiality and urging Israel to allow more aid into the blockaded enclave.
    


            The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is meant to run a new, tightly controlled, mechanism for aid deliveries into Gaza, but it has been criticized by the United Nations and others, who warn it risks further displacing Palestinians and endangering civilians.
    


            US military veteran Jake Wood has quit as GHF's executive director after just a matter of weeks at the organization, publicly launched by the US in early May.
    


            “I am proud of the work I oversaw, including developing a pragmatic plan that could feed hungry people, address security concerns about diversion, and complement the work of longstanding NGOs in Gaza,” said Wood in a statement.
    


            “However, it is clear that it is not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which I will not abandon,” he added.

A US-backed group says it will deliver aid to Gaza, but humanitarian organizations are skeptical. Here's what we know



            The GHF said in a statement it was “disappointed” by Wood's resignation, criticizing opponents who they said “have been more focused on tearing this apart than on getting aid in.”
    


            And the organization said it will begin deliveries on Monday, with plans to scale up rapidly to feed “the full population in the weeks ahead,” it said on Sunday, adding that its “trucks are loaded and ready to go.”
    


            The GHF's plan for delivering aid has been approved by Israel and the US, which both countries say is designed to prevent Hamas from “stealing” aid.
    


            It's supposed to start operating four distribution sites, all located in southern and central Gaza – but it has come under heavy criticism from top humanitarian officials, with the UN and other organizations refusing to work with the new group.
    


            The UN warned that the fact the initial sites were only in southern and central Gaza could be seen as encouraging Israel's publicly stated goal of forcing “the entire Gazan population” out of northern Gaza, as Defense Minister Israel Katz put it earlier this month.
    


            The US and the GHF have both been at pains to say that it is not an Israeli initiative – despite Israel's support for it, and its role in designating and securing the distribution sites.
    


            Speaking to CNN earlier in May, Wood had urged the UN and other groups to reconsider their opposition, admitting that the plan was “not perfect,” but would allow critical aid and food supplies to Gazans who desperately need it.
    


            He added in May that he “unequivocally… will not be a part of anything that forcibly dislocates or displaces the Palestinian population.”
    


            In his resignation statement on Sunday, he said he had sought to establish the foundation “as a truly independent humanitarian entity” during his time as its executive director.
    


            Wood said he was “horrified and heartbroken at the hunger crisis in Gaza” and was “compelled to do whatever I could to help alleviate the suffering.”
    


            “I urge Israel to significantly expand the provision of aid into Gaza through all mechanisms, and I urge all stakeholders to continue to explore innovative new methods for the delivery of aid, without delay, diversion, or discrimination,” Wood said.
    


            The GHF is only expected to be able to feed about 60% of Gaza's population in its first weeks.
    


            A private American security contractor will be responsible for guarding its aid trucks from the Gaza border to the distribution sites and will not be involved in distributing the aid to civilians, Wood had previously said.
    


            Gaza faces widespread starvation amid a severe shortage of essential humanitarian aid. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza has recorded 58 deaths from malnutrition and 242 deaths from shortages of food and medicine since Israel's blockade on aid began in March, it said.
    


            More than 300 miscarriages had been attributed to a lack of nutrients, the ministry told CNN on Sunday.
    


            Last week, Israel said it would allow a “basic amount of food” to enter Gaza due to an “operational need” as the military pushes ahead with its offensive, dubbed “Gideon's Chariots.” The Israeli Prime Minister's Office has said a hunger crisis in Gaza could jeopardize the operation, which  Israel says aims to defeat Hamas.
    


            Ahmad Al-Banna, who owns a bakery in Deir al-Balah in Gaza, told CNN Sunday that he had reopened on Wednesday, only to close three days later, because flour stocks had run out.
    


            “Gaza is exhausted,” he said. “There are starving people in the streets.”
    


            Another resident, Um Jamal Musleh, said she and her two children relied on the local charity-run kitchen. “Today, we were shocked to see a sign saying it's the last day for the kitchen. That means we'll go hungry,” she said.
    


            Asmaa Al-Kafarneh, who was waiting at the kitchen on Sunday, said she had not eaten bread in two months. “If we don't die from Israeli airstrikes, we'll die of hunger,” she said.
    


            Israel said it allowed 107 aid trucks into the territory on Sunday – but the UN has said that's not nearly enough.
    


            The enclave needs at least 500 to 600 trucks daily to avert a deepening humanitarian catastrophe, as civilians face a severe shortage of supplies like food and medicine, said UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza. The UN has also complained that Israel has insisted on humanitarian aid traveling along insecure routes, preventing many aid trucks from safely arriving at their destinations.

Public remarks by Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky are only making things worse for his country, US President Donald Trump has said. His comments came after the Ukrainian leader accused the US of a lack of support, which he claimed benefits Russia.

Trump took to Truth Social on Sunday to criticize Zelensky for making diplomatic efforts to settle the Ukraine conflict more difficult. The Ukrainian leader, he said, “is doing his country no favors by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems. I don't like it, and it better stop.”

The US president added that the conflict “would never have started” if he had been in office. “This is Zelensky's, Putin's, and Biden's War, not ‘Trump's.' I am only helping to put out the big and ugly fires, that have been started through gross incompetence and hatred,” he said.

Trump's comments came after Zelensky criticized his Western backers, including the US, for what he described as a lackluster reaction to Russia's latest large-scale air strike. “America's silence, the silence of others in the world, only encourages Putin,” Zelensky said, calling for increased pressure and sanctions on Moscow.

The exchange occurred amid an escalation in fighting between Russia and Ukraine, with Moscow accusing Kiev of launching hundreds of drones between Tuesday and Friday alone. According to Russian air defense commander Yury Dashkin, one strike took place during a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Kursk Region, where his helicopter “was at the epicenter” of a Ukrainian drone assault.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has vowed an appropriate response, stating that the Ukrainian strikes are intended to “disrupt direct Russian-Ukrainian negotiations” aimed at a lasting settlement.

The Russian Defense Ministry later announced a successful strike on a drone and missile production plant in Kiev as well as a radar surveillance center and a US-made Patriot air defense system. Moscow has repeatedly said its strikes are never aimed at civilians.

Trump, however, voiced disapproval of Russian actions, claiming that Putin had “gone absolutely CRAZY” and alleging that he had targeted Ukraine with recent strikes “for no reason whatsoever.” The US president has on several occasions threatened to impose new sanctions on Russia if he does not see peace efforts making progress.

However, following a call between Trump and Putin last week, Axios reported that the US leader is still refraining from imposing new restrictions on Moscow. Instead, he reportedly told European leaders that he believes “Putin wants a deal” and that diplomacy remains possible.

US President Donald Trump has reacted to Russia's overnight missile raids on Ukraine by insisting that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had “gone absolutely crazy for no reason,” despite a week of constant Ukrainian drone raids across Russia involving several hundred UAVs.

Ukraine significantly intensified its drone attacks inside Russia last week, with at least 764 drones intercepted over Russian territory from Tuesday to Friday, and hundreds more destroyed over the weekend. A helicopter carrying Russian President Vladimir Putin was reportedly caught in the “epicenter” of a massive drone raid while he was visiting Kursk Region on Tuesday.

In response, the Russian military conducted a major strike against a drone and missile production plant in Kiev on Saturday, followed by additional reported strikes on Ukrainian military facilities on Sunday.

Speaking to journalists on Sunday, Trump claimed Russia's response was unwarranted and said he was “surprised” by what he is seeing.

“I'm not happy with what Putin's doing,” he said. “We're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kiev and other cities. I don't like it at all… We'll see what I'm going to do.”

“I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!” Trump added in a post on Truth Social, claiming that “missiles and drones are being shot into cities in Ukraine for no reason whatsoever.”

Trump also criticized Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, in an apparent reference to his remarks about Washington's “silence” in response to the latest Russian attacks.

“Likewise, President Zelensky is doing his country no favors by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems. I don't like it, and it better stop,” the US leader stated, reiterating that the Ukraine conflict is “not his war.”

The Russian Foreign Ministry suggested that the spike in UAV incursions is an attempt to derail the US-brokered peace talks between Moscow and Kiev, while Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that “some European nations led by the UK, France, Germany, and the EU leadership,” who are supporting Kiev and want the conflict to continue, bear some responsibility for the drone raids.

Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine have completed a record prisoner exchange, which was agreed to during direct talks in Türkiye earlier this month. Lavrov earlier stated that the sides will exchange draft ceasefire proposals once the swap is complete.

US officials recently travelled to the UK to meet with local anti-abortion campaigners who Washington believes face retribution for expressing their views, The Telegraph reported on Saturday. The paper described the move as evidence of Washington's desire to “intervene in domestic British affairs.”

In March, the State Department dispatched a delegation from the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), to meet with officials from the Foreign Office and communications regulator Ofcom to “affirm the importance of freedom of expression in the UK and across Europe.”

The talks, which also overlapped with separate UK-US trade negotiations, focused on Britain's new online safety act and its potential consequences for freedom of speech.

However, the five-member US team also quietly met with British activists who had been arrested for protesting outside abortion clinics, the article said. The US officials also reportedly attended an event held at a “nondescript” office block where campaigners were present.

“The visit is the latest sign of the Trump administration's willingness to intervene in domestic British affairs,” The Telegraph noted.

While the paper did not provide details on whom the US officials met, Washington has sounded the alarm over several controversial cases where the right to free speech in the UK may have been violated.

One of them was that of Livia Tossici-Bolt, a 64-year-old campaigner who was charged in 2023 for holding a sign reading “here to talk if you want” outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth. She refused to leave when asked by police and faced prosecution under a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) – a legal restriction that creates a 150-meter buffer zone around facilities providing abortion services.

In February, US Vice President J.D. Vance also singled out the case of Adam Smith-Connor, a 51-year-old British army veteran and anti-abortion activist, who was convicted in October 2024 for silently praying near the same Bournemouth clinic. Vance called it a “most concerning case” and said it illustrated the threats to the “basic liberties of religious Britons.”

UK law enforcement has been criticized for so-called “two-tier policing,” a term suggesting that much harsher measures are often taken against right-wing protesters than against left-wing ones. Elon Musk, a close Trump ally, has been particularly vocal on the matter, blasting the UK over its response to what he described as a disproportionate response to anti-immigration demonstrations.

LONDON, May 26. /TASS/. The Palestinian movement Hamas has accepted the proposal of US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff on cessation of hostilities with Israel in the Gaza Strip, Reuters reported, citing a Palestinian official close to the radicals.

According to him, the new proposal, which Hamas received through mediators, includes the release of ten hostages and a 70-day truce. During this period, a permanent ceasefire would be discussed under US guarantees.

""The proposal includes the release of ten living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in two groups in return for a 70-day ceasefire and a partial withdrawal from the Gaza Strip,"" the source told Reuters.

The source added that the list of conditions also includes Israel's release of several Palestinian prisoners, including those serving long sentences.

On March 18, the Israeli army resumed fighting in the Gaza Strip, launching massive attacks on the Palestinian enclave and violating a ceasefire reached in January. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explained that the radical Palestinian movement Hamas refused to agree to the proposals put forward at the talks by mediators and US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff, saying that the goal of the operation in the enclave was the release of all hostages.

Analysts say US and Israeli attacks failed to weaken rebels and are only pushing the country to the brink of famine

Late last month, a suspected US airstrike levelled four homes on the fringes of the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, killing at least 11 people. A video posted by an eyewitness shows a frightened man carrying a young child on his back as they run through the darkness, warning people away, before the roar of a jet and the white flash of a blast.

Local people quickly circulated notifications of funerals for the many killed in the airstrike on the outlying Thaqban neighbourhood, listing the whole families that had died in an instant.

This included Ali Yahya Salah Masoud, who one mourner said on social media was killed “hand in hand with his entire family, including his wife, sons and daughters”, alongside pictures from a long-ago celebration showing his daughters with red bows in their hair and his smiling sons in small suit jackets.

Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, said in late April that a punishing campaign of US airstrikes that began in mid-March had “hit over 1,000 targets, killing Houthi fighters and leaders … and degrading their capabilities”.

While the US claims to have targeted the Houthis, the intense wave of airstrikes on major cities and sites across Yemen has also claimed dozens of civilian lives, according to human rights groups and the London-based monitoring organisation AirWars, which lists fatalities from three families in the attack on the Thaqban district.

“There's nothing in this world, no matter how precious, that can replace my family,” said a 27-year-old mother of three, who said her parents and sisters were killed in the airstrike. “I feel like I die a hundred times a day from the grief.”

“We buried eight people from a single family, from a single house,” said a mourner at the funeral procession. “There's no sign that this was a military target. We're their neighbours … we saw what happened.”

Airwars cites several social media accounts which posted allegations that Yemen's Houthi rebels used the Thaqban neighbourhood, including one Yemeni activist who posted on X that a home there contained a missile launch pad. All the posts were later deleted, and observers suggested that US forces had used the tweets to source information about where to target.

An official with US Central Command (Centcom), which oversees American military operations in Yemen, declined to comment on the airstrike on Thaqban, but said they were “aware of the claims of civilian casualties related to the US strikes in Yemen, and we take those claims very seriously. We are currently conducting our battle-damage assessment and inquiry into those claims.”

In a statement last month, Centcom also released figures different from Parnell's, saying US forces had struck more than 800 targets, killing “hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders”, including senior drone and missile operatives, while also destroying swaths of the group's facilities, air defences, weapons-manufacturing facilities and missiles.

It added: “These operations have been executed using detailed and comprehensive intelligence ensuring lethal effects against the Houthis while minimising risk to civilians.”

As waves of American airstrikes pounded the Yemeni capital, Mohamed Althaibani watched the walls of his house shake. The bombs that pummelled sites on the outskirts have often hit sites that the US, and before them a coalition led by neighbouring Saudi Arabia, has already struck repeatedly over their decade-long military campaign, he said.

“People here in Yemen are born into nothing, the government has nothing – so why are they bombing?” he asked. “There is nothing left to bomb. The missiles are worth more than the buildings they're hitting.”

To the 72-year-old naturalised US citizen, the airstrikes were a grim reminder that the country he has lived in for four decades views civilian life in his home country as expendable.

Then early this month, a fresh wave of Israeli strikes targeted the airport and a power station in Sana'a, hitting civilian infrastructure and residential areas.

“Many people have died – and for what? There is nothing to strike here, except people trying to live, looking for food.

“We have nothing. They claimed to bomb the power plant but it wasn't working anyway. We're already relying on generators,” said Althaibani.

Photos from late April showed the mangled wreck of a car and people gathered around a large crater in the Farwah market in Sana'a after just one of the airstrikes, which the Houthis claimed killed 12 people and wounded 34 others.

For people across Yemen, the airstrikes are a deadly addition to a humanitarian crisis that has overwhelmed the country for more than a decade. Civilians across the country have weathered a bloody civil war as Houthi rebels battled and eventually overwhelmed government forces in the capital, followed by a decade-long campaign of airstrikes and a naval blockade from a military coalition spearheaded by Saudi Arabia.

At least 4.5 million people in Yemen are displaced by the fighting, the UN estimates, while 17 million people are in desperate need of food, including 5 million living on the brink of famine. A decision by the Trump administration to slash the US contribution to aid, particularly at the UN, has left humanitarians fearful that the cuts will further endanger civilian lives in Yemen.

Althaibani describes being swarmed by desperate people each time he leaves the house, with most unable to afford food at the local markets, where even basic goods have become increasingly expensive.

“If I buy imported milk, that can be $6-7 (£5); a lot of people can't afford that,” he said. “Only people with money can afford these kinds of things; the others are just trying to subsist on bread.”

It was the strike on the Farwah market that made Althaibani weigh whether to leave Sana'a and return home to New York following months of pressure from his family to escape the bombings. Although the airport reopened this week after the Israeli strike earlier this month, he fears it could easily be a target again.

“We used to say to one another, ‘if God loves you, he will send you to America',” he said, expressing a deep love for the place he has called home, set up businesses and raised a family, but which recently unleashed the deadliest bombing campaign on Yemen in years.

“I feel bad because they bombed my country, but America is my country too,” he said.

Another US strike on the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea coast in mid-April marked one of the single deadliest since Washington drastically escalated its air campaign in Yemen weeks after Donald Trump took office. The family of a 48-year-old truck driver, Nabil Yahya, said he was killed when the fuel tanker he was driving burst into flames after the airstrike on the port.

“That truck was all he had,” said Nabil's younger brother, Sultan Yahya. “It was his only source of income.”

The US president abruptly announced earlier this month that the US would halt its campaign of airstrikes, claiming that the Houthis had agreed via Omani mediators to halt their attacks on key Red Sea shipping lanes off Yemen's coast.

“The Houthis have announced to us at least that they just don't want to fight any more … we will honour that,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “They have capitulated, but more importantly we will take their word that they won't be blowing up ships any more.”

The president's words provided little reassurance to those in Yemen that the agreement with the Houthis would endure, and left many sceptical about how the Israeli bombing campaign could escalate. Israel has struck Yemen repeatedly in the past 18 months, in response to Houthi rocket attacks on Tel Aviv, while the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, threatened further airstrikes on Yemen earlier this month even without US support.

“Israel will defend itself by itself. We are doing this in Yemen, we are doing this in other places, at great distances. We have harshly struck the Houthis in Yemen, and we still have not had the last word,” he said in a speech earlier this week.

Abdullah Sabri, Yemen's ambassador to Syria during the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad, who was an ally of Iran and the Houthis in Yemen, said US forces had “largely spared the Houthi leadership and military assets,” and instead accused them of targeting civilians and basic infrastructure.

“Washington is spinning a diplomatic defeat as a success,” he added.

Analysts such as Maysaa Shujaa Aldeen, writing for the European Council on Foreign Relations, agreed. While the intense US air campaign initially appeared successful, she said, it had “not delivered broader strategic gains: despite the pounding, the Houthis still managed to attack US targets and Israel. Commercial shipping has not meaningfully resumed.

“Moreover, the campaign has allowed the Houthis to tighten their grip domestically and they now celebrate the US stand-down as a sign of victory,” she said.

While Trump halted American military campaign, the US treasury department has continued to impose waves of sanctions, including on Yemeni banks, in an effort to curb funds flowing to the Houthis and “stop Iran-backed Houthi attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea”.

The sanctions on key banks in Sana'a have left many inside Yemen panicking, said Radhya al-Mutawakel, of the human rights organisation Mwatana. “We don't know if this will eventually affect all banks. Our organisation transferred our money to another bank, but that could be designated at any time,” she said.

“It's not only direct attacks where civilians are killed, injured and civilian infrastructure destroyed, but daily life, especially at an economic level, is under attack,” she said. “People are just eager to live, they want all of this to stop.”

Murad Ahmed, who works at the port of al-Hudaydah, said the ceasefire agreement between Washington and the Houthis had provided some relief despite fears of future airstrikes. Recent US sanctions also targeted oil tankers delivering fuel to ports including Hudaydah, which Washington claims is under Houthi control, allowing the group to benefit from selling fuel at inflated black market prices.

“After the bombings and fuel blockades, we faced serious crises. Prices were rising to a dangerous point. But two tankers have now been allowed to offload fuel, and conditions are slowly improving,” Ahmed said.

Althaibani said civilians remain caught between the ongoing Israeli bombing campaign, US sanctions and the Houthis, with most unable to do more than shelter in their homes when they hear the sound of bombardments.

“They could target the Houthis if they wanted to, but why are they bombing cities if they don't want to kill civilians?” he said. “They bombed all over the city and people were scared to flee in case they strike those areas. They decided to die in their homes. There is nothing they can do.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Kremlin says giving Ukraine long range missiles is a ‘dangerous move' as German chancellor says Kyiv can now hit Russian targets

Germany's new chancellor Friedrich Merz has confirmed that western countries allied to Ukraine are no longer imposing range limits on arms delivered to Kyiv.

“There are no longer any restrictions on the range of weapons delivered to Ukraine – neither by the UK, France, nor us. There are no restrictions by the US either,” Merz was quoted by the Kyiv Independent as having said during a discussion forum organized by the WDR channel.

“This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia,” the chancellor added. “Until recently, it couldn't do that, and apart from very few exceptions, it hadn't done so either.”

Last April, Ukraine used longer-range ballistic missiles called Army Tactical Missile System (Atcams) - supplied by Joe Biden administration - for the first time after Washington gave the green light to do so.

There had been hesitation to approve such use amid fears of an escalation of the conflict.

Ukraine has previously received long-range missiles from Washington, London and Paris but Kyiv was initially only allowed to use them against Russian military targets in occupied Ukrainian territories.

Moscow launched its third consecutive night of massive drone strikes against Ukraine overnight into Monday, with Russia firing a record 355 Shahed drones as well as nine cruise missiles.

Russia's attack came despite Donald Trump's warning on Sunday night that if Vladimir Putin attempts to conquer all of Ukraine it will lead to the “downfall” of Russia. In the same post, the US president said Putin was “absolutely CRAZY” after a weekend of deadly Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine.

In a toughening up of his language, which puts him more in line with the EU's position, Trump said he was seriously considering imposing “more sanctions on Russia” following the attacks.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the increase in Russian strikes should be met with “increased sanctions”, adding that Moscow's dismissal of the US-proposed 30 day ceasefire should lead to a “freeze on Russian finances and a halt to its oil trade”.

The European Union has rejected a Russian request for consultations on its carbon border adjustment package, a World Trade Organization document showed on Monday, citing Russia's “war of aggression” against Ukraine as the reason.

Moscow defended its latest drone and missile attacks on Ukraine as a reaction to Kyiv's attacks on Russian infrastructure and military targets.

French president Emmanuel Macron said he thinks Trump is realising Putin had lied to him (about his intentions for peace) and he hoped his anger “translates into action”.

Germany's chancellor Friedrich Merz has confirmed that western countries allied to Ukraine are no longer imposing range limits on arms delivered to Kyiv.

Russia has now said European countries lifting any restrictions on capabilities for Ukraine would be a dangerous move, according to Reuters. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said such a decision would run counter to aspirations for a political settlement to the crisis.

A top Kremlin official on Monday scoffed at a report that Russia could be involved in recent arson attacks on the private home of British prime minister Keir Starmer, a building where he once lived and a car that he had owned.

Zelenskyy will reportedly visit Berlin on Wednesday, where he will meet with Merz and German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

The European Union has rejected a Russian request for consultations on its carbon border adjustment package, a World Trade Organization document showed on Monday, citing Russia's “war of aggression” against Ukraine as the reason.

Russia requested consultations with the EU over its carbon border levy earlier this month at the WTO – the first step in a dispute before formal proceedings begin.

“The European Union is of the view that the consultations requested by the Russian Federation cannot be fruitful and cannot lead to a mutually satisfactory solution of (the) matter at hand,” an EU document submitted to the WTO on 26 May read.

A top Kremlin official on Monday scoffed at a report that Russia could be involved in recent arson attacks on the private home of British prime minister Keir Starmer, a building where he once lived and a car that he had owned.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was responding to a Financial Times report that said UK security officials were looking into whether Russia was involved in the attacks.

The Associated Press was not been able to independently confirm the FT report that relied on unnamed senior UK government figures. But Peskov, who the London-based paper said did not respond to a request when it published the story Friday, was asked about the report at his regular press briefing Monday.

“London tends to suspect Russia of anything bad that happens in the UK,” Peskov said. “As a rule, all these suspicions are groundless, unsubstantiated and often laughable.”

No one was injured in the fires that occurred on three nights between 8 May and 12 May in north London, authorities said.

Three men with ties to Ukraine face arson charges and are being held without bail before a hearing 6 June in London's Central Criminal Court.

A prosecutor said there was no explanation for the crimes and no official has publicly said Moscow is behind the fires.

Ukrainian firefighters and rescuers work at the site of a damaged storage facility of a private factory following an overnight attack in Vasyshcheve, near Kharkiv, Ukraine.

A response now from the Kremlin to Germany chancellor's Friedrich Merz's comments on Ukraine's military capabilities.

We reported earlier that Merz said Ukraine now has long-range fire to target military infrastructure in Russia.

Russia has now said European countries lifting any restrictions on capabilities for Ukraine would be a dangerous move, according to Reuters.

Ukraine has previously received long-range missiles from Washington, London and Paris but Kyiv was initially only allowed to use them against Russian military targets in occupied Ukrainian territories.

My colleagues Peter Beaumont and Pjotr Sauer have filed a report about Russia's continuing attacks on Ukraine and the diplomatic reaction to the assaults. Here is an extract from their piece:

Russia has massively scaled up its domestic production of drones such as the Shahed, meaning it is no longer reliant upon Iran for its supply as it was when the weapons were first deployed even as it has developed sophisticated new tactics for their use, making them an increasingly potent weapon.

Analysts are split, however, whether the heavy bombing of Ukrainian cities is a tactic in its own right, to demoralise the Ukrainian home front, or is part of a wider push on the battlefield going into the summer amid Ukrainian and western intelligence assessments that Russia intends to continue fighting through this year.

The Netherlands will send the last one of 24 promised F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine on Monday, defence minister Ruben Brekelmans said on Sunday on a Dutch television talkshow.

The first 23 Dutch F-16 jets were delivered from last summer. The Netherlands has also provided fighter jets to a training centre in Romania for Ukrainian pilots and crew.

The F-16 fighter jets that Ukraine has received from its western partners to help fight Russia's invasion have been the frontline combat planes of choice for the Nato alliance for 50 years.

Analysts say the F-16s enhance Ukraine's military strength, especially by upgrading its air defences and enabling it to hit distant targets with sophisticated weaponry.

Denmark's prime minister Mette Frederiksen said on Monday that Russia's attacks on Ukraine over the weekend proved that Moscow is not interested in peace, Reuters reports.

Reuters reports that, despite the chancellery in Germnay declining to comment, several sources have confirmed to it that Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to visit Berlin on Wednesday.

It was first reported by news outlet Spiegel, who said Zelenskyy would meet with chancellor Friedrich Merz and German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

Emmanuel Macron said Monday he hopes Donald Trump's anger at Moscow “translates into action”.

Speaking to reporters in Hanoi, AFP reports the French president said:

President Trump realises that when President Putin said on the phone he was ready for peace, or told his envoys he was ready for peace, he lied. We have seen once again in recent hours Donald Trump express his anger. A form of impatience. I simply hope now that this translates into action.

In a post to social media yesterday, the US president said Vladimir Putin had gone “crazy” and that an attempt to conquer all of Ukraine “will lead to the downfall of Russia!”.

The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected proposals for a 30-day ceasefire from Kyiv and its western allies, but the unwillingness of the Trump administration to press ahead with wider sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine has been the subject of some dismay in European capitals.

Reuters has a quick snap, citing Der Spiegel, that Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Berlin on Wednesday.

French president Emmanuel Macron, who is on a diplomatic trip to Vietnam, has been asked about Russia's continuing attacks.

He said he thinks Donald Trump is realising aspects of Vladimir Putin's lies regarding Ukraine, adding that he hopes the US president's anger at Putin will “translate into action” (presumably meaning sanctions, along with the EU).

We will give you more comments as they come in.

Last month, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said China was supplying weapons to Russia, including gunpowder and artillery, and that Chinese representatives were involved in weapons production on Russian territory. He cited reporting by Ukrainian security and intelligence agencies.

China dismissed the accusations as “groundless” in response, with the country's foreign minister saying Beijing has been trying to push for a ceasefire in the war and have been promoting peace talks.

As my colleague Dan Sabbagh notes in this story, Russia makes heavy use of Chinese-made components in its arms industry, and Ukraine does so to some extent.

Both sides make significant use of Mavic drones from the Chinese manufacturer DJI, though Kyiv is trying to reduce its dependence on products from Beijing.

In February 2022, China and Russia declared a “no limits” partnership when Vladimir Putin visited Beijing to meet Xi Jinping shortly before he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine has said that China is supplying a range of important products to Russian military plants, the chief of Ukrainian foreign intelligence told Ukrinform news agency.

Oleh Ivashchenko said:

There is information that China is delivering machines, special chemicals, gunpowder, and components specifically to military-purpose enterprises. We have confirmed data on 20 Russian factories.

Here is a snippet of the Ukrinform report, which we have not yet independently verified.

According to Ivashchenko, at least five instances of “aviation-related cooperation” with China were recorded in 2024–2025, involving equipment, spare parts, and documentation. Additionally, six major shipments of special chemicals were identified.

The intelligence chief also noted that as of early 2025, 80% of critical electronics used in Russian drones originate from China. This includes cases of mislabeled items, deceptive product naming, and the use of shell companies to smuggle necessary components for microelectronics production from China into Russia.

Russia's defence ministry said earlier today that air defence systems had downed 96 Ukrainian drones, including six over the Moscow region.

Moscow's Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports temporarily halted flights, Russia's aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said.

Dmitry Peskov said the latest drone and missile attacks on Ukraine – the heaviest recorded so far in the war - are in reaction to Kyiv's attacks on Russian infrastructure.

“We have seen how the Ukrainians have been hitting our social infrastructure, peaceful infrastructure. This is a response strike. It's a strike against military facilities, military targets,” the Kremlin spokesperson has been quoted by BBC News as having said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

British business figures say many companies in UK and US disguising inclusion policies in face of rightwing attacks

Corporate diversity policies are under fire from the right – but also from the left

Senior figures in British business have described a chilling effect on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, saying they are being “rebranded” to avoid attracting unwanted political attention.

Five years after the murder of George Floyd in the US shone a spotlight on racial inequality, efforts to create a level playing field in the workplace are facing a rightwing backlash on both sides of the Atlantic.

But experts say many organisations are resisting the attacks by reframing policies previously known as DEI in the US, and sometimes EDI (equality, diversity and inclusion) in the UK.

Paul Sesay, the founder and chief executive of the National Diversity Awards, whose sponsors include Amazon, Auto Trader and HSBC, said: “It's rebranded to ‘wellbeing', ‘belonging' and ‘culture'. Even with roles, it's no longer heads of DEI, it's heads of culture, heads of people, heads of wellbeing.

“They're basically embedding diversity and getting rid of the word – I don't necessarily see it as a bad thing. When I first started, back in 2003, it was about diversity – and that was the main word – but then, as it progressed, it was inclusion. It's advancing now to culture, transformation, that kind of thing, as culture affects the whole organisation.”

In the UK, the Reform party has vowed to scrap DEI initiatives from councils it controls, months after the Trump administration began sacking black public servants and ripping up fairness policies.

Experts believe a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK, where the Equalities Act and the legal risk of discrimination cases present barriers to turning back the clock.

But some companies, particularly US-headquartered firms, have already scaled back some commitments, and are less keen to celebrate inclusion work publicly.

Sesay said US businesses were finding ways to disguise DEI work so they could still promote the best talent and address inequalities. “American companies have had to change, simply to survive in America. They have to take the word diversity out of absolutely everything. I've heard a few firms that say inclusion is allowed within their policies, but the word diversity isn't.”

Noreen Biddle Shah, who founded Reboot, a campaigning group of senior financial service professionals, to tackle racial inequality in the industry in 2019, said the “landscape feels very different” now.

“DEI has become a politically charged term, and many firms are either stepping back from the work – a trend we saw coming from the US, but it is impacting UK financial services too,” said Shah.

“Not only do fewer organisations want to partner with us, but they're also discouraging their own employees from speaking out. In our latest annual Race to Equality: Financial Services report, we found that in light of the DEI backlash, ethnic minority professionals in the sector feel muzzled for speaking out – many expressed fear of losing their jobs if they raised race-related concerns. And sadly, 70% said there has been little progress since the Black Lives Matter movement.”

Even before the retrenchment driven by Trump's return, there was concern companies were drawing back from promises made in 2020, when the Black Lives Matter movement sparked a conversation across the west about societal fairness.

Nina Mohanty, a finalist in Veuve Clicquot's Bold Future awards 2025, which celebrates rising female entrepreneurs, and who is the founder of a tech startup, Bloom Money, said: “In the world of startups and tech companies, you had a lot of VCs [venture capitalists] that were saying, ‘we're gonna do special programmes for black entrepreneurs, we're gonna back more women and women of colour'. And there are a lot of initiatives and there's a lot of talk. Five years on, where are those things? The budgets are gone.”

James Hockin, an employment law expert and partner at global law firm Withers who advises senior executives in New York and London, said Trump's unpopularity among some people also meant employees were exerting pressure on British employers to keep policies in place.

“We've got more people in the UK now saying, ‘well, what are we saying on this? I don't like what Trump is doing on DEI',” he said.

“There has been for a little while, a bit of a temptation just to keep quiet and let it happen and just go, ‘OK, let's just wait and see'. But I think increasingly, with pressure from employees, there is a desire for employers to be seen to be taking a stance.”

Agreeing that DEI would survive but in a “rebranded” form, Hockin said: “DEI, for employers at least, started from a place of sorting out the culture in an organisation so that you weren't leaving yourself vulnerable to a [legal] claim against your organisation – employers were keen to mitigate their risk.

“Where employers are getting on side with the Trump agenda, inadvertently, what they're doing, is potentially opening themselves up to that risk.”

Earlier this year, Shirine Khoury-Haq, the CEO of Co-op group, warned that a DEI rollback risked undoing decades of progress. Zahoor Ahmad, Co-op's head of social mobility, said: “The key assumption is that if you didn't have [DEI], everything will be a level playing field. All of human history tells us that is not true. It's very hard to have a true meritocracy, when we are not born equal. What we are trying to do is eliminate inequalities.”

A number of trade bodies have also doubled down on their commitment to inclusion in the face of the backlash.

The Law Society's president, Richard Atkinson, said that while “the current climate in the United States has made diversity and inclusion work increasingly difficult”, the organisation would never waver from its “wholehearted” commitment to a more diverse and inclusive legal profession.

UK Finance, which represents the banking and financial service sector, said greater diversity was “a driver for economic success”, while the Local Government Association said the case for DEI remained “compelling”.

Dawar Hashmi, a director at Penna, a leading recruiter for senior local government executives, said: “There has been a noticeable pullback in the UK within some sectors – when the US sneezes, the UK catches a cold. This trend concerns me. But the public sector, our primary client base, continues to champion these values. Embracing DEI isn't just morally right, its actually a strategic advantage.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde yesterday said the global economic order backed by the US dollar was “fracturing” and made a pitch for the euro as a global reserve currency. 

“The global economy thrived on a foundation of openness and multilateralism underpinned by US leadership,” Lagarde said in a speech at the Hertie School in Berlin.

Washington's support for a rules-based international system and the US dollar as a reserve currency had “set the stage for trade to flourish and finance to expand.”

The persistence of that US-led economic order over the past 80 years had “proved immensely beneficial to the European Union.”

“But today it is fracturing,” she said in an apparent reference to global trade tensions fuelled by US President Donald Trump's threat to impose sweeping tariffs on key partners.

“Multilateral cooperation is being replaced by zero-sum thinking and bilateral power plays. Openness is giving way to protectionism.”

The recent upheaval was also threatening “the dominant role of the US dollar,” she said. 

The disintegration of the global economic order would “pose risks for Europe,” Lagarde said. “Any change in the international order that leads to lower world trade or fragmentation into economic blocs will be detrimental to our economy,” she said. 

But the retreat of the US dollar could also “open the door for the euro to play a greater international role.” Increasing the international role of the euro would lower borrowing costs for EU member states, insulate the bloc from exchange rate fluctuations and would “allow Europe to better control its own destiny,” Lagarde said.

For that to happen, the European Union would need a “steadfast commitment to open trade” and to underpin its position with sufficient security capabilities.

It would also need to strengthen its economy and defend the rule of law, she said.

“This is not a privilege that will simply be given to us. We have to earn it.”

Lagarde's comments show how policymakers in the region are seeking to turn Trump's attacks on global trade and US institutions to their advantage. Such aspirations have received encouragement from investors, who have sold the US dollar on the tariff mess. That's boosting the euro in a move Lagarde has previously called “counterintuitive” but justified.

In yesterday's speech, Lagarde highlighted three areas that are critical to enhance euro's global status.

First, she urged “a solid and credible geopolitical foundation by maintaining a steadfast commitment to open trade and underpinning it with security capabilities.”

Second, she repeated calls to complete the single market, help start-ups, trim regulation and build the savings and investment union, toward which progress has been slow.

Lagarde also reiterated that there should be more joint financing on the European level for measures including defense — another politically contentious idea. Progress on that front would mean investors would have a deeper pool of securities to tap into, she said.

“Economic logic tells us that public goods need to be jointly financed,” Lagarde said. “And this joint financing could provide the basis for Europe to gradually increase its supply of safe assets.”

That echoes recent remarks by Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel that a large European bond market is a prerequisite for a greater role for the euro.

Finally, Lagarde said Europe must show its ability to uphold a robust legal and institutional foundation to safeguard investor confidence in their long-term value.

‘FAILED EXPORT CONTROLS':
                                        Jensen Huang said that Washington should maximize the speed of AI diffusion, because not doing so would give competitors an advantage                                        Nvidia Corp cofounder and chief executive officer Jensen Huang (黃仁勳) yesterday criticized the US government's restrictions on exports of artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, saying that the policy was a failure and would only spur China to accelerate AI development.
The export controls gave China the spirit, motivation and government support to accelerate AI development, Huang told reporters at the Computex trade show in Taipei.
The competition in China is already intense, given its strong software capabilities, extensive technology ecosystems and work efficiency, he said.
“All in all, the export controls were a failure. The facts would suggest it,” he said.

“New import restrictions could jeopardize current US leadership in the competitive technology industry and create uncertainties for many committed semiconductor capital projects in the US, including TSMC Arizona's significant investment plan in Phoenix,” the chipmaker wrote in a letter to the US Department of Commerce.
TSMC issued the warning in response to a solicitation for comments by the department on a possible tariff on semiconductor imports by US President Donald Trump's

                                                                                President William Lai (賴清德) yesterday thanked Palau for its continued support of Taiwan's international participation, as Taipei was once again excluded from the World Health Assembly (WHA) currently taking place in Switzerland.

""Palau has never stopped voicing support for Taiwan"" in the UN General Assembly, the WHO and other UN-affiliated agencies, Lai said during a bilateral meeting with visiting Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr.

""We have been profoundly touched by these endorsements,"" Lai said, praising the Pacific island nation's firm support as ""courageous.""

Lai's remarks came as Taiwan was excluded for the ninth consecutive year from the WHA, which is being held in                                    


RESOLUTIONS DEBATE:
                                        Taiwan's allies said that UN and WHA resolutions cited by China and other nations ‘do not determine Taiwan's participation in WHO activities'                                        A proposal to invite Taiwan to this year's World Health Assembly (WHA) was rejected on Monday, resulting in Taipei's absence from the annual meeting for a ninth consecutive year, although partners spoke up for Taiwan's participation at the first day of the meeting.
The first agenda item after the opening was a “two-on-two debate” on a proposal to invite Taiwan to participate at the WHA as an observer.

Our kids should know we think the world of them – even if there are always better ways to say it.Nadezhda1906/Getty Images/iStockphoto

When my five-year-old daughter brought home her end-of-year project – the kids in her class were each tasked with creating a model of something that would help the planet – I was beside myself. 

She designed a machine that would theoretically pull garbage from the ocean while also “feeding the fishes.” The model was a literal pile of garbage itself – or, more accurately, recycling, glued together with varying success. 

I told her I had never seen anything more amazing, and repeatedly said she is so very clever, so very creative. A visionary – just what this world needs. “Good job, kiddo!” I exclaimed, promptly placing her creation on the mantel, where it remains.

I was still admiring the beautiful garbage pile when a mom friend sent me a TikTok video about effective praise. According to Dr. Chelsey Hauge-Zavaleta, the parenting coach in the clip, saying “good job” to kids is ineffective because “children do not have jobs” and “it is not clear, it is not specific.” I suddenly felt a pang of guilt. How many times have I told my kids they've a done a good job? 

Days later, I listened to an episode of the popular podcast Your Parenting Mojo, where host Jen Lumanlan argued praise is “a subtle mechanism” to shape and control our children. “My concern arises when praise becomes a way that children internalize our surveillance, and this means they know we're watching them, so they act in a certain way to get our approval,” Lumanlan said.

As I listened, I found myself wondering if that's such a bad thing. I want my kids to know their actions matter and that I am indeed watching them. Isn't that the point of parenting – to gently steer our kids toward independence, while letting them know we've got eyes on them? 

Praise feels especially warranted in moments like the end of the school year, when projects and report cards are flooding in. Shouldn't kids know we see and value their effort and that we are proud? Praise can also have a lasting positive impact. I don't remember every “good job” from my childhood, but I do remember the day I crossed the monkey bars for the first time and my dad said, “You can do anything in this world. You are capable of everything.”

Stephanie Leon, a child psychologist in Montreal, says praise can absolutely be used for good. “It's the strongest external reinforcement we can provide our children. It's also the way we share our values with our kids,” she said. “When we're using praise to influence their behaviour, we want them to be able to function in society, and that's not a bad thing at all.”

But, Leon says, we can elevate the impact of our praise by having it be specific, genuine and focus on the effort, rather than the outcome. 

The debate over positive feedback has been around for decades. In his 1993 book Punished by Rewards, education critic Alfie Kohn argued that praise, like other rewards, can be controlling. And in her 2006 book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, psychologist Carol Dweck made the case that kids praised for effort, not innate ability, were more likely to embrace challenges. According to this theory, focusing on a child's patience and interesting choice of colours, for example, will encourage more growth than declaring them the world's best artist. 

Katie Cataford, a mom of two young kids and the director of school life and community at Vincent Massey Academy, a private school in Toronto, says she struggles with finding the right balance. 

“It's easy to say ‘good job!' and I do, all the time. But as an educator, I know it's much more meaningful to focus on the deeper, intrinsic motivator. … It just takes so much more effort.” 

That's why she has her own kids say mantras in the mirror every night – ‘I am strong, I am brave, I can do hard things' – so they can recognize those traits in their daily challenges and feel proud of themselves, rather than seeking outside approval. 

When nothing else worked, ChatGPT helped me be a better parent

In today's extremely digital parenting era, there is seemingly a right and a wrong way to do everything, and sometimes it feels like experts online are overanalyzing every little action and complicating things just for the sake of it (or more likely, for views). It's never good enough if our kids are eating vegetables – are they organic and locally sourced?

At the same time, if there is a more effective way to show our kids we appreciate them, while also encouraging them to find pride in themselves, I'm here for it.

The best approach, as with many parenting conundrums, is likely found in the messy middle: “Great garbage invention, my wonderful little inventor!” isn't going to turn my kid into a people-pleasing perfectionist later in life. 

Our kids should know we think the world of them – even if there are always better ways to say it. And if they believe, deep down, that their parents are fundamentally rooting for them, we're doing a pretty good job ourselves.

Florida Panthers centre Sam Reinhart tries to score against the Toronto Maple Leafs during their playoff series earlier this month.Michael Laughlin/The Associated Press

Shortly after the start of the NHL's Eastern Conference final, Florida Panthers coach Paul Maurice was doing his usual trick – unsettling an opponent with philosophy. 

“I'm not a believer at all in momentum,” Maurice said. “I don't think you establish anything. It's all rear-view mirror, you look back at key moments in the series or something, if you win or if you lose.”

This is easy for the winner who has the momentum to say. On Saturday night, the Panthers went up 3-0 on the Hurricanes. They aren't just beating Carolina. They're embarrassing them. 

It's possible the Hurricanes will come out of this with the right lesson. That while their starless, tough-minded-but-not-actually-tough approach is great for the regular season, it's not fit for purpose in the playoffs.

But I can almost guarantee you that the Toronto Maple Leafs' current management is getting the opposite, entirely wrong, message from the exact same data set.

The Leafs are chokers, but they are chokers of discernment. Four of the five last years, they've lost to the eventual Stanley Cup finalist. The one time they didn't involved Boston, who then lost to Florida, who then won the title, making the Leafs Stanley Cup champions twice removed. 

If you've ever wondered why the Leafs have become so inured to the status quo, this is why. 

They never just lose lose. They lose with caveats.

Fans react to the Leafs' latest loss to the Panthers.Arlyn McAdorey/The Canadian Press

It's possible to break out the magnifying glass and reduce all of Toronto's seven-game auto-destructs to one moment. If you had to pick one in the most recent instance, it was Sam Bennett braining Anthony Stolarz in Game 1, and the rest of the Leafs standing around watching. That was the moment Maurice and the Panthers would have known that while the Leafs had acquired some wolfish new personnel, they were all still sheep in their bones.

It's irresistible to think and talk like this in Toronto, where Leafs chat is the conversational coin of the realm. What else are we supposed to talk about? Traffic?

Any talk that is ongoing 51 weeks of the year (aside from that one news cycle where the Blue Jays pack it in) is going to be granular. Granularity defies wholesale change. It encourages incrementalism.

Opinion: After Shanahan bloodletting, Pelley leaves little doubt over where the buck stops at MLSE

So you don't try to move an all-star centre who's had nine kicks at the can and hasn't managed to connect once. Instead, you leave the non-performing centre where he is and hope next time is different. Then you hire a cheap piece who would've gone over and beaten Bennett like a rug without needing to be told to do so. Problem solved. 

This nitpicking way of going about things had one benefit – it kept everything calm. Above all, Toronto sports has come to prize executive serenity. 

No one gets fired. On the odd chance they do, it's only after an endless supply of second chances. Nobody should get too worked up about it because nothing is going to be different. There's a plan and, sure, it's not working, but we're going to stick to it. Because the real enemy here is panic. 

You could once have argued that that made some sense, in the Brian Burke, J.P. Ricciardi, Bryan Colangelo years, but the cultural pendulum has started making loop-the-loops. It's time to inject some hysteria back into Toronto sports, and the Leafs in particular.

Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment president and CEO Keith Pelley.Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press

If the Leafs are what the team's new overseer, Keith Pelley, has called them – “the greatest hockey team in the world” – everyone who oversees them should feel an urgency bordering on frenzy. If you can't deal with that anxiety, or the media and fans being mean to you, you should find another place to work. This one isn't for you.

Real Madrid is, by Pelley's description, the soccer version of the Leafs. What happens when Real lose two years in a row? Everybody gets fired and the roster is shaken until all the loose parts fall out. It doesn't matter what they cost or how hyped they were or what they once did. If you aren't winning, you're leaving. As a result, Real Madrid has won 75 trophies since the Leafs last won one.

This is harder to manage in a salary-cap environment yadda yadda yadda, but if you're going to take ruthless performance targets out of it, GMs of hockey teams should make the same money as GMs of car dealerships.

In future, think less like the Florida Panthers or Tampa Bay Lightning. Those teams live in a different reality than the Leafs – zero local pressure, lower taxes, free to lose for years after they've won once. 

Think more like Real Madrid – hire hard-minded players who don't know how to lose, and then hold them to it by demanding immediate and permanent results. If the people you've got can't provide them, don't try to fix anybody. Release them into some other, low-pressure environment where they'll be happy. Then go out and get other winning-fixated types. Don't hire for skillsets. Hire for obsessiveness. 

If the Leafs are serious about change the first thing they'll do is bid adieu to Mitch Marner and John Tavares. It's true that it is hard to find guys who score 100 points in the regular season, but it should be easy to find replacements who haven't folded up like lawn chairs in the last seven playoffs. Only one of those things matters. 

If either one of them is back, at whatever money, the Leafs are the same. 

Making radical change on this team won't be easy to do, but there ought be no excuse not to do it. Everyone can be traded. Every trade can be won. Anyone who wants to sit you down and explain why that isn't the way it works does not belong at the greatest team in the world. 

In future, the Leafs should put one idea above all others – no more explanations. No more jabber about culture or structure. No more jobs for life. No more star system. You either win, or you go.

Xabi Alonso will take over as Real Madrid coach from June 1, the Spanish club has confirmed. The former midfield star returns after leading Bayer Leverkusen to a historic domestic treble.

Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid has confirmed Bayer Leverkusen coachXabi Alonso as its new coach from June 1.

Former midfielder Alonso had confirmed earlier this month he would leave Leverkusen, having last season led the club to its first Bundesliga title to end Bayern Munich's 11-year domination of the league.

""Xabi Alonso will be the Real Madrid coach for the next three seasons, from June 1, 2025 until June 30, 2028,"" the Spanish club said in a statement. The move had been widely expected.

Basque trainer Alonso had an agreement allowing him to leave if one of his former clubs — Real Madrid, Liverpool, or Bayern Munich — wanted to hire him.

His achievement of going domestically unbeaten during Leverkusen's surprise run had made him a top target for European clubs.

As well as winning the league with Leverkusen last season, Alonso also completed a historic domestic treble by steering them to German Cup and German Super Cup victories.

The 43-year-old takes over at the Spanish club from Italian Carlo Ancelotti, who is expected to become Brazil's national team coach ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Despite having a year left on his contract, Ancelotti has reportedly agreed to part ways with the club after an underwhelming season and his interest in the Brazil job.

Alonso is set to join Real ahead of the expanded Club World Cup, set to take place in the United States from June 14 to July 14.

He began his coaching career with Real Madrid's youth academy, managing the Under-14 team during the 2018–19 season.

Alonso played for the club from 2009 to 2014, making 236 appearances and winning multiple titles, including the Champions League, La Liga, and Copa del Rey. 

As a player at Liverpool, Alonso won the 2005 UEFA Champions League with a crucial goal in the final. At Bayern Munich, he secured three consecutive Bundesliga titles and the 2016 German Cup.

Four former Volkswagen executives have been found guilty of fraud in a criminal trial relating to the ""Dieselgate"" scandal.

The Braunschweig Regional Court in northern Germany on Monday convicted four former Volkswagen executives of fraud over the ""Dieselgate"" scandal.  

The verdict brings a massive trial to an end after almost four years. The scandal surrounding the manipulation of diesel car emissions tests came to light in September 2015. The Wolfsburg-based automaker had shortly before admitted to false test results in the US. 

Two of the executives were sentenced to several years in prison, with two other former employees receiving suspended sentences.

A former head of diesel engine development was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. The former head of drive electronics received two years and seven months in prison.

The highest-ranking defendant, a former member of the Volkswagen brand's development board, received one year and three months' probation. A former department head was sentenced to one year and ten months' probation.

The global scandal, widely known as Dieselgate, plunged the Wolfsburg-based carmaker into a deep crisis.

Volkswagen has faced countless lawsuits and estimated the total cost of the scandal at more than €30 billion ($34 billion).

The public prosecutor's office had demanded between two and four years in prison and considered probation appropriate in only one case. The defense, however, pleaded for three acquittals and one warning.

Former chief executive Martin Winterkorn was originally due to stand trial alongside the four, but proceedings against him were suspended for health reasons before they began in September 2021.

Winterkorn has since appeared in court as both a witness and a defendant, repeatedly denying any responsibility for the scandal.

A recent accident and hospitalization further interrupted his case, and it remains unclear if or when the proceedings against the now 78-year-old will resume.

Winterkorn, once Germany's highest-paid executive, resigned shortly after the scandal broke but has denied any personal responsibility. Prosecutors alleged in court that he knew about the illegal software as early as May 2014—well before the timeline he has acknowledged.

US President Donald Trump has expressed his growing frustration with Vladimir Putin and threatened to ramp up sanctions on Moscow. Meanwhile, Kyiv says Russia launched a record number of drones against it. DW has more.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz says Kyiv's key allies no longer limit range of weapons they send to Ukraine

Here is a roundup of developments from Russia's war on Ukraine on Monday, May 26:

Russia said that any Western decision to remove range limits on weapons delivered to Ukraine would be ""dangerous.""

""If these decisions have indeed been made, they are completely at odds with our aspirations for a political (peace) settlement... These are quite dangerous decisions, if they have been made,"" AFP news agency quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, as telling Russian journalist Alexander Yunashev.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Ukraine's other key Western allies, has lifted range restrictions on the weapons they send to Kyiv to fight against Russia. The question now is: will Merz authorize the delivery of longer-range weapons—specifically, Taurus cruise missiles—or not?

The Federal Chancellor did not specify what consequences this decision will have for future arms deliveries to Ukraine. So far, Germany has not supplied any weapons to Ukraine with a range exceeding approximately 70 kilometers. Many are now wondering whether the German government will deliver the powerful Taurus cruise missile under Merz's leadership.

During the election campaign, Merz emphasized that he would be prepared to approve such a deliverz, but only in coordination with allies who have already supplied or possess similar weapons. Then he became chancellor. In that role, he has become more opaque, quickly halting the publication of information about weapons delivered to Ukraine.

As a reminder: when he was in opposition, Merz was one of the leading voices pushing for the German government to disclose what it was supplying. Chancellor Scholz eventually gave in to that pressure. As chancellor, Merz reversed that decision, citing the need for “strategic ambiguity”—the idea that one should not let the opponent know exactly what has been delivered, or is being considered for delivery, and when.

Until the Taurus is actually delivered, today's statement falls squarely into that category: avoiding public debate over the specifics of arms deliveries. At the same time, however, it opens the door to a broader discussion about whether Germany might now be willing to supply such weapons.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Ukraine's allies had lifted range restrictions on weapons sent to help fend off Russia's ongoing invasion.

""There are no longer any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine — neither by the British nor by the French nor by us nor by the Americans,"" Merz told public broadcaster WDR.

""This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia... With very few exceptions, it didn't do that until recently. It can now do that.""

Merz did not say whether this would mean that Germany would be delivering long-range Taurus missiles, something he said he was open to in April, provided it was done in coordination with European partners.

Russia at the time warned that it would treat Taurus missile strikes on ""critical transport infrastructure"" as ""direct"" German involvement in the war.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said Russian President Vladimir Putin views proposals for peace talks in Ukraine as a ""sign of weakness"" and has responded by intensifying the war.

""Putin obviously sees offers of talks as a sign of weakness,"" Merz told public broadcaster WDR. He added that recent diplomatic efforts to end the conflict had been met with harsher military action from Moscow.

Since returning to office, US President Donald Trump has been pushing for direct negotiations at the highest level.

Last week, he suggested the Vatican as a possible host. Italy said Pope Francis was ready to organize such talks, but Russia has cast doubt on the proposal.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it would be ""inelegant"" for the Catholic Church to mediate between two mainly Orthodox countries.

Merz said Ukraine's Western allies had used every diplomatic avenue available.

""After the last three weeks, no one can seriously accuse us of not having exhausted all available diplomatic means,"" he said. 

Short of ""raising the white flag,"" Merz said, Ukraine's backers had ""done everything"" they could.

""If even an offer to meet at the Vatican does not get [Putin's] approval, then we must be prepared for this war to last longer than we all wish or can imagine,"" Merz warned.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that the Russian army has launched the largest number of drones against Ukrainian cities and communities since the start of the full-scale war.

The attack included 355 attack UAVs, mostly ""Shaheds,"" as well as nine cruise missiles. 

Zelenskyy reported that there had been injuries and damage to civilian infrastructure, and noted that the geography of the strikes extended across northern, central, eastern, and southern Ukraine. 

He added that it marked the third consecutive night of combined Russian attacks involving both drones and missiles.

""Only a sense of total impunity can allow Russia to carry out such strikes and continue increasing their scale,"" said Zelenskyy. ""There is no real military logic to this, but there is significant political meaning.""

""In doing this, Putin shows just how much he despises the world — the world that spends more effort on 'dialogue' with him than on real pressure.""

""Like any criminal, Russia can only be constrained by force. Only through strength — the strength of the United States, of Europe, of all nations that value life — can these attacks be stopped and real peace achieved.""

Zelenskyy added that the increase in Russian strikes and Moscow's ""disregard for diplomacy"" should be met with tougher sanctions. 

Russia has downplayed US President Donald Trump's comment that Vladimir Putin had ""gone absolutely CRAZY,"" attributing it to emotional strain

At the same time, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov thanked Washington for helping launch peace negotiations over Ukraine.

Trump made the remark as Russia unleashed its largest aerial assault of the war. He also said he was considering new sanctions on Moscow, while criticizing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

""We are really grateful to the Americans and to President Trump personally for their assistance in organizing and launching this negotiation process,"" Peskov said Monday when asked about Trump's comment on Putin.

""Of course, at the same time, this is a very crucial moment, which is associated, of course, with the emotional overload of everyone absolutely and with emotional reactions,"" Peskov added.

Russia has been claiming fresh territorial gains in Ukraine's north-eastern Sumy region, saying its forces have taken control of two more border villages.

Moscow's defense ministry, cited by Russian media, said troops have captured Volodymyrivka and Bilovody, both located near Russia's Kursk region.

Ukraine did not confirm losing the two villages. 

The announcement comes two days after Russia said it had seized another settlement in the same area, where it has been pressing an offensive for several weeks.

Russia has launched 355 drones at Ukraine in what Kyiv says is the largest such attack since the full-scale invasion began in 2022, with air alerts in the capital lasting six hours and damage reported across multiple regions.

Ukraine's air force said Moscow deployed 355 Shahed-type drones, including decoys, along with nine cruise missiles.

Ukrainian officials say it was the biggest drone assault since February 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale offensive against Ukraine.

The overnight strike came after what officials described as a weekend of ""terror.""

While no deaths were reported from the drone barrage, Ukrainian authorities said one man was killed in Russian shelling in the northeastern Sumy region, which has faced months of near-daily attacks.

In the western city of Khmelnytsky, 18 residential buildings were damaged and a 14-year-old boy was injured in the southern Odesa region.

The escalation followed Russian strikes Sunday that killed 13 people.

It also came as US President Donald Trump offered rare criticism of Vladimir Putin, saying the Russian leader had gone ""absolutely crazy"" as Moscow bombed Ukraine during a major prisoner exchange.

Russia continued pounding Ukraine for the third night in a row using large swarms of combat drones, Ukrainian authorities reported early on Monday.

The Ukrainian air force warned of new cruise missile attacks by Russia on Telegram.

Air defense systems were deployed in many places, with numerous blasts reported, authorities said.

There were no immediate reports of any casualties or damage.

According to the air force, Russian drones attacked the port city of Odesa from the Black Sea. 
 

Donald Trump told the media he was ""not happy with what Putin is doing,"" and replied ""absolutely"" when asked if he was considering further sanctions on Russia. 

His comments come after Russian launched the biggest aerial strike targeting Ukraine since its full-scale invasion in 2022.

""I've known him a long time, always gotten along with him, but he's sending rockets into cities and killing people and I don't like it at all,"" he said.

""We're in the middle of talking and he's shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities. I don't like it at all. And I'm surprised. I'm very surprised.""

US President Donald Trump called Russian President Vladimir Putin ""crazy"" after Moscow targeted Ukraine with a deadly series of attacks that killed at least 13 people amid a massive prisoner exchange.

""I've always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that's proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.

""I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!"" he added.

The remarks coming from Trump against Putin signal an increasing frustration with Moscow.

He said Putin is ""needlessly killing a lot of people"" by firing missiles and drones into Ukrainian cities ""for no reason whatsoever.""

Russia continued its aerial attack on Ukraine, killing at least 12 people even as the biggest prisoner exchange took place between the two countries on Sunday.

Ukraine's military said Sunday it had shot down 45 Russian missiles and 266 attack drones overnight as Moscow targeted its neighbor for a second night running. 

The prisoner exchange was completed on Sunday under which Ukraine and Russia have each released 303 prisoners.

It has been the biggest prisoner exchange since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbor, according to a report from Russia's RIA news agency citing the country's Defense Ministry.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

			As the country buys up property in the Bahamas, one Nassau landmark has become a particular focal point

The white sands and spacious lobby of the British Colonial Hotel in Nassau have twice provided a sumptuous backdrop for James Bond.

Now the iconic hotel is at the centre of a real-life espionage battle as China buys up property and land in the Bahamas, barely 50 miles from the Florida coastline.

China had spent the past two decades mixing economics with geopolitics in the Caribbean, giving it the perfect platform to spy on American space launches, the US embassy, and an underwater warfare facility, said Rear-Adm Peter Brown, former Homeland Security adviser to president Donald Trump.

“The unique geography of the Bahamas poses a special opportunity to the United States, but it also creates risk if the People's Republic of China takes over the best friend role to the government of the Bahamas,” he said.

The Trump administration has taken notice. It sent a warning recently to Caribbean governments to avoid deals that could be exploited by the Chinese Communist Party.

Nowhere is the potential risk more obvious than the British Colonial Hotel, said Adm Brown.

At 100 years old, it is a Nassau landmark.

It was popular with the Duke of Windsor and his wife Wallis Simpson during the Second World War when he was appointed governor of the Bahamas, in part to keep their suspected Nazi sympathies as far from Europe as possible.

If its old world charm and glamorous soirees were good enough for exiled members of the Royal Family, then it was certainly good enough for the very suavest of MI6 agents.

The hotel was dressed up as a casino for the 1965 movie Thunderball, and was used in scenes where Sean Connery took on eyepatch-wearing Emilia Largo at baccarat.

Connery returned to the hotel for 1983's Never Say Never Again. Its private beach was where Fatima Blush, played by Barbara Carrera, waterskis into Bond's arms.

It has been owned by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation since 2014.

Rear Adm Brown said its position, just around the corner from the US embassy, gave it huge strategic importance.

“The hotel kind of commands the high ground with its upper floor, so the ability to electronically surveil not only the embassy itself, but also the people coming and going to and from the embassy and neighbouring businesses, means that diplomatic or governmental interests of the United States are vulnerable,” he said.

The 700 or so islands of the Bahamas are best known to Americans for their golden sands and cocktail spots.

But they occupy a key strategic location on the western edge of the Caribbean. China hawks have long warned that Washington has missed a trick, allowing Beijing to build favour, particularly with aid, grants and investment in the wake of 2019's devastating Hurricane Dorian.

The list of Chinese interests is extensive.

Beijing provided a $40 million grant for construction of a national stadium in 2012.

The state-owned China Export-Import Bank poured $2.5 billion into the Baha Mar resort and casino — with its 2200 rooms and more than 9000 square metres of gaming space.

A $3 billion megaport was built with Chinese money and is operated by a Hong Kong-based company.

It all gives China a ringside seat at US space launches in Florida, said Adm Brown, as well as the US Navy's Atlantic Underwater Testing and Evaluation Center, where submarine captains and crews are put through their paces between three islands of the Bahamas in an area known as the “Tongue of the Ocean.”

“It has for decades been an important site for us, with submarine and anti-submarine warfare testing, and Chinese entities have purchased properties, including entire islands, in the vicinity of the Tongue of the Ocean,” he said.

The move has not been lost on Washington.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, met prime ministers from seven Caribbean nations earlier this month to warn of the dangers.

“Secretary Rubio urged our partners to make responsible, transparent decisions when selecting vendors and contractors for critical infrastructure projects, ensuring they are not vulnerable to privacy and security risks and exploitation by malign actors like the Chinese Communist Party,” said Tammy Bruce, his spokeswoman.

American officials say cooperation with Caribbean nations help secure the nation's maritime border, as well as tackle drug and people smugglers.

And although Chinese investments might not be made with hostile intent to the US, they could be used for multiple purposes in times of conflict.

“China's predatory tactics have left many countries with excessive debt, undermining their development, stability, and sovereignty,” said a State Department spokesman.

“We will continue to work with The Bahamas and other Caribbean nations to ensure they are aware of the risks associated with accepting Chinese investments.”

The FBI is launching a new investigation into the 2023 discovery of cocaine at the White House during Joe Biden's term.

Dan Bongino, the podcaster-turned-FBI deputy director, made the announcement on X, adding that he will receive a weekly briefing on the progress of the case.

The discovery of a small bag of cocaine in a cubby near the entrance to the West Wing two years ago sparked outrage, including from Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate at the time, who said it was implausible the drugs could belong to anyone beyond Mr Biden or his son Hunter.

The Biden family was away from Washington when the drugs were discovered and a spokesman said that the allegations were “incredibly irresponsible”.

Mr Bongino also ordered an investigation into the 2022 leak of the Supreme Court's draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade.

“Shortly after swearing in, the director and I evaluated a number of cases of potential public corruption that, understandably, have garnered public interest. We made the decision to either re-open, or push additional resources and investigative attention, to these cases,” Mr Bongino said.

“These cases are the DC pipe bombing investigation, the cocaine discovery at the prior administration's White House, and the leak of the Supreme Court Dobbs case. I receive requested briefings on these cases weekly and we are making progress. If you have any investigative tips on these matters that may assist us then please contact the FBI,” he added.

Previous investigations into the cases, by the Secret Service and the Supreme Court, respectively, ended without identifying who was responsible for the cocaine or the judgment leak.

Mr Bongino previously claimed that he was in touch with whistleblowers who told him they were “suspicious” that evidence from the White House cocaine bag “could match a member of the inner Biden circle”.

The publication of the Supreme Court's opinion ending the constitutional right to abortion in Politico on May 2 2022, provoked ire from Mr Trump, who described the source of the leak “slime” and demanded that the journalists involved be imprisoned until they revealed who it was.

Mr Bongino also announced more resources for the FBI's investigation into the placement of pipe bombs at the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee in Washington.

The bombs, which were later defused, had been planted the night before Mr Trump's supporters stormed the US Capitol in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying Mr Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.

The perpetrator has never been publicly identified.

“End times schooling” risks turning schools into graveyards for hope — but they can also be greenhouses for resistance.

What happens when the most powerful people give up on the future — but still control the schools?

To understand what's happening in education today — the banning of books, the rise of AI that surveils and dehumanizes learning, the outlawing of honest lessons on race and gender, and the criminalization of critical thought — we must look beyond the classroom and name the dystopia being built around us.

Prophetic storytellers have long warned us about this moment. What once read as science fiction is fast becoming science nonfiction. In Parable of the Sower, Octavia Butler envisioned a nation unraveling under climate collapse and corporate rule, where the wealthy retreat to walled-off company towns protected by private security. Neill Blomkamp's film Elysium imagined a world where the elite flee the earth to an orbital fortress.

What Butler and Blomkamp warned of in fiction, Naomi Klein and Astra Taylor now name in fact. In a searing essay for The Guardian, they call this era end times fascism: a grim convergence of white supremacist nationalism, billionaire bunker fantasies, apocalyptic Christian Zionism and a pandemic response that treats mass death as collateral for profit.

At the heart of this strategy is a billionaire exodus — a flight from accountability and from the world they set ablaze. Plutocrat preppers like Elon Musk envision colonizing Mars through SpaceX, building a self-sustaining city governed by AI and populated by a select few. Jeff Bezos talks of offloading Earth's industry to space. Peter Thiel has invested in luxury bunkers in New Zealand and backed “seasteading” projects aimed at building floating, privately governed city states in international waters beyond the reach of democratic regulation. This isn't science fiction. It's class war — the ultrarich abandoning the rest of us to climate collapse and surveillance capitalism, while shielding themselves behind fortress walls, digital firewalls and ideologies that sanctify abandonment.

Consider the world they're trying to escape: 2024 was the hottest year ever recorded. Wildfires in Los Angeles revealed the scale of the unfolding climate catastrophe, causing rising sea levels, crop failures and mass displacement. The AI arms race is accelerating, with experts warning of mass labor displacement, autonomous weapons and systems beyond human control. Nuclear tensions are rising. And the U.S. government is funding the bombing of schools, universities, hospitals and mosques in Gaza — while punishing teachers who allow students to even debate the morality of genocide and ethnic cleansing in Palestine. Schooling is being recast as a tool not just for compliance and surveillance, but for instilling hopelessness and surrender.

This is end times schooling — and we must decide whether to be its instruments or its interruption.

It's not just that schools are impacted by end times fascist policy; teaching young people to accept the end of the world is a prerequisite to bringing it about.

That means teaching students that history is made by elites, not everyday people; that the climate disasters they see either don't actually exist or are unstoppable; that unregulated AI is benevolent and beyond challenge; that genocide in Gaza is too “complicated” to name; and that questioning power is dangerous, while submission to it is safety.

You can see it in the criminalization of truth. Today, nearly half of U.S. public school students attend schools where teachers are banned from teaching honestly about race, gender or sexuality. Texas law prohibits teachers from giving credit for student civic engagement. The statute reads: “[A] teacher may not require, make part of a course, or award a grade or course credit … for a student's … efforts to persuade members of the legislative or executive branch at the federal, state, or local level to take specific actions by direct communication.” Laws like this are about crushing the idea that education can empower students to make change.

You can see it in the rise of AI tutors and scripted lessons that sever learning from human relationships. AI is being used to justify fewer teachers, larger class sizes and automated discipline — where algorithms decide who gets flagged, suspended or punished. The result is a digital caste system: Rich youth get mentorship and creativity; the rest get automation and monitoring.

You can see it in the crackdown on teaching and protesting the genocide in Gaza: educators disciplined, students arrested and campus groups disbanded for daring to name the violence.

And you see it in what we could call “armageddon academics”: the near-total erasure of climate crisis education. For example, McDougal Littell's Modern World History limited climate change to just three paragraphs, claimed “not all scientists agree,” and blamed the Global South for inaction — without quoting a single person affected by climate collapse.

This is schooling for extinction.

The fascist project has no room for young people who think critically, question authority, or imagine a world beyond border walls, binaries and bunkers.

The danger of naming end times fascism is that it can feel paralyzing, like the system is so powerful and cruel that resistance is futile. That's exactly the point. This project feeds on despair.

The antidote is not denial; it's defiant hope and collective action. As the editors of Rethinking Schools remind us, “To step into a classroom is to express confidence in young people's capacity to learn, to grow, to change, to make a difference — to do good in the world.”

We need to say this out loud. Because everything about end times schooling tells young people their lives don't matter — that nothing they do will make a difference.

But history tells us otherwise.

Every major movement for justice — abolition, labor, civil rights, anti-colonial uprisings — was built during hard times, under hostile regimes. The Montgomery Bus Boycott began just months after Rosa Parks told fellow organizers she didn't believe anything big would happen in her city. Then she acted — and history turned. Before that, the 1936–37 Flint Sit-Down Strike erupted at the height of the Great Depression, when autoworkers faced brutal conditions and mass unemployment — and still seized General Motors' Fisher Body plants, holding them for 44 days until they forced the company to recognize their union.

If end times fascism tells students there's no future, we must teach as if the future is ours to shape. If schools are being weaponized to train youth for extinction, then education must become a form of survival — rooted in truth, care, resistance and imagination.

And that kind of education is already happening — in walkouts for Gaza, in classrooms defying book bans, in radical reading groups and mutual aid projects. Just listen to Alex Ames, one of the founding members of the Georgia Youth Justice Coalition (GYJC), speaking at the “Our Freedom to Learn” forum hosted by HEAL Together:

It has been an incredible three years at GYJC since we first started building young people's power toward education justice and toward multiracial democracy. Just this spring, we defeated the largest voucher bill in Georgia's history. We stopped “Don't Say Gay” legislation for the second time in two years — they keep coming back. We halted policies criminalizing librarians or banning gender-affirming medical care. And we won $25 million for public school counselors that our students need. And last year we halted every book ban in the state. … I also should mention we just won the largest public school budget in the entire history of the state of Georgia.

This is what end times fascists fear most: the imagination of a generation not willing to disappear quietly.

Educating against end times schooling doesn't mean offering shallow optimism; it means helping students confront the world as it is — and insisting it doesn't have to stay that way.

In their essay on end times fascism, Klein and Taylor invoke the Jewish tradition of Doikayt, Yiddish for “hereness” — a call to stay and struggle for justice where you are, rather than escape to imagined sanctuaries.

I share that ethic. But I'd argue we can't fully commit to the here and now without first journeying through time and space, using the people's true futuristic technologies: memory, study and imagination.

We must travel back in time — through conversations with elders, research and engagement with study groups — to remember what has been stolen and to gather lessons from the people and movements who dared to fight back. Then we must travel to the future — through the power of radical imagination — to glimpse a world where housing is a right, where we feed people instead of bombing them, where freedom isn't gated, policed or sold. (If you need a high-powered time machine: the Zinn Education Project offers free people's history lessons; Molly Crabapple paints revolutionary futures into being; and Afrofuturists like Octavia Butler, Sun Ra and Ryan Coogler carry us forward beyond today's limits.) Only then can we return to the present, with new perspectives and strategies, ready to fight.

Billionaires know this. That's why they are trying to smash the curricular “flux capacitors” of social justice classrooms — curricular devices that allow students to travel through history, with freedom to dream about the future and act in the present.

They know they cannot inflict end times fascism without turning classrooms into graveyards for hope. That's why they're attacking schools with such ferocity.

But if we refuse to surrender the schools, they cannot win.

The 2018–19 Red State Revolt showed us how to fight back. Educators in GOP-controlled states like West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona won dramatic gains by shutting down their entire school systems until funding for public education was substantially increased.

The Chicago Teachers Union's (CTU) recent contract victory shows what that resistance can build. CTU not only won higher wages, but also protections for teaching the truth about race, gender and sexuality; investments in housing and mental health; immigrant protections; and groundbreaking environmental initiatives, from installing solar panels to launching composting programs.

This is social justice unionism: bargaining for the common good.

And here is the inconvenient truth for billionaires: even in their bunkers or space stations, they still need labor — because they won't be cleaning their shelters, caring for the sick, or repairing technology on their own.

But while billionaires need us, we don't need them.

The world would do quite well without them — and that means we hold power. We can refuse. We can refuse to code their surveillance, fly their rockets, or educate the next generation for extinction. That spirit lives in the growing call for a general strike in 2028. After its 2023 strike victory, the UAW aligned all contracts to expire on May Day and invited other unions to do the same. CTU's new contract expires in 2028 and they have joined with the UAW to launch an organizing initiative to prepare.

While the oligarchs are doing everything they can to make this the era of end times fascism, we are not at the end; we are at the start of a process of revealing what this country truly is and what we must overcome to achieve a new beginning — the one our ancestors dreamed of and that our children deserve.

Palestinian civilians and Israeli Defense Force members described a practice that is banned under international law.

Israeli soldiers have “systematically” used Palestinians as human shields during the 19-month assault on the Gaza Strip, The Associated Press reported Saturday, citing Palestinian civilians and members of the Israel Defense Forces who described engaging in the practice that is banned under international humanitarian law.

“Orders often came from the top, and at times nearly every platoon used a Palestinian to clear locations,” AP reported, citing the account of an unnamed Israeli officer.

One Palestinian man, Ayman Abu Hamadan, said Israeli soldiers dressed him in army fatigues, attached a camera to his forehead, and forced him to enter homes to ensure they were clear of bombs and militants. Abu Hamadan said he was passed from unit to unit for over two weeks.

“Soldiers stood behind him and, once it was clear, entered the buildings to damage or destroy them, he said,” AP reported. “He spent each night bound in a dark room, only to wake up and do it again.”

Nadav Weiman, executive director of Breaking the Silence — an anti-occupation group founded by former Israeli soldiers — told AP that “these are not isolated accounts; they point to a systemic failure and a horrifying moral collapse.”

Israeli officials frequently justify attacks on homes, hospitals, and other civilian infrastructure by alleging that Hamas uses Gaza's civilian population as human shields. But Israeli forces have long been accused of using detained Palestinians as human shields, both during and prior to the current assault on Gaza.

According to the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, “Over the years, the military practiced an official policy of using Palestinians as human shields, ordering them to carry out military activities that put their lives in jeopardy: Palestinians were forced to remove suspicious objects from roads, tell other Palestinians to come out and surrender themselves, physically shield soldiers while they fired, and more.”

“In most cases, no one was held accountable,” the group said.

Earlier this year, an anonymous Israeli officer wrote in a column for Haaretz that “in Gaza, human shields are used by Israeli soldiers at least six times a day.”

“Today, almost every platoon keeps a ‘shawish,' and no infantry force enters a house before a ‘shawish' clears it,” the officer wrote. “This means there are four ‘shawishes' in a company, twelve in a battalion, and at least 36 in a brigade. We operate a sub-army of slaves.”

In response to AP's reporting, the IDF told the Jerusalem Post that it would only investigate the claims in the story “if further details are provided.”

The reporting came as Israel continued with its large-scale ground offensive and aerial assault in Gaza, where the entire population is facing a dire hunger crisis due to Israel's monthslong siege.

On Sunday, according to Reuters, “Israeli military strikes killed at least 23 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip… including a local journalist and a senior rescue service official.”

Hours earlier, an Israeli strike on a home in Khan Younis killed nine children of a Nasser Hospital pediatrician and badly injured her husband while she was at work.

“Targeting families in the still-standing buildings: distinguishable sadistic pattern of the new phase of the genocide,” Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote in response to the deadly strike.

Trump also  touted his push for an annual $1 trillion military budget during a West Point commencement address.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday bragged to West Point's graduating class that he has refused to cut Pentagon spending and touted his push for an annual military budget of $1 trillion, arguing that other programs should be on the chopping block instead.

“Some people say, ‘Could you cut it back?' I said, ‘I'm not cutting 10 cents,'” the president said of Pentagon spending during his bizarre, campaign-style commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy.

“We can cut plenty of other things,” Trump added, without specifying what he sees as better targets for cuts than the Pentagon, a sprawling morass of waste and abuse that recently failed its seventh consecutive audit.

Trump's remarks came after House Republicans, with his support, passed a massive budget reconciliation package that includes more than $100 billion in additional spending for the U.S. military and around $1 trillion in combined cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

The military spending boost, which critics slammed as unnecessary and detrimental, is aimed at promoting Trump priorities such as his proposed “Golden Dome,” an idea that experts have dismissed as a “fantasy.” It is also a major opportunity for profiteering: Reuters reported last month that Elon Musk's SpaceX has emerged as one of the frontrunners to build a “crucial part” of the system.

With the $1 trillion that Trump is seeking to allocate to the military in the coming fiscal year, the U.S. could erase all medical debt, slash child poverty, end homelessness, tackle the nation's nursing and teacher shortages, replace all of the country's lead pipes, and build nationwide high-speed rail, according to an analysis by the National Priorities Project (NPP).

“A trillion-dollar investment in ordinary Americans is not radical; it would effectively help prevent crime, improve security, and raise standards of living across the country. And it's what most people actually want,” wrote NPP research analyst Hanna Homestead. “Poll after poll shows Americans would rather have their tax dollars spent on public services than on Pentagon contractors, and would prefer policymakers prioritize spending on healthcare, education, housing, and infrastructure — not the military.”

He served as Deputy Special Envoy for Iran during the Biden administration and on the National Security Council and in the State Department during the Obama administration.

Of all the consensus-bucking foreign policy moves that U.S. President Donald Trump has undertaken, few have been more surprising than the resurrection of nuclear talks with Iran. Trump, after all, pulled the United States from the 2015 nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018. And after four years in which the Biden administration failed to negotiate a deal to replace the JCPOA, the prospects for a new agreement seemed slim. Instead, during those seven intervening years, Iran produced enough near-weapons-grade enriched uranium for multiple warheads.

Yet despite their history of enmity, Tehran and Washington have shown consistent, mutual interest in a deal since Trump's return to the White House. Over the course of several rounds of talks, the two sides have even sketched out potential frameworks. Both have clear motivations for getting a deal done. The Trump administration wants to restore some strategic stability to the Middle East and Trump is personally invested in bolstering his image as a dealmaker. Iran, still suffering under the U.S. sanctions regime, wants lasting economic relief and a pause in hostilities after the weakening of many of its proxies.

But although Trump has said that he wants to deal with the nuclear issue quickly and insists that an agreement is close, long-standing, core issues between the two parties are likely to bedevil the process. U.S. concerns with Iran's enrichment program and its funding of proxies will remain a sticking point; so will Iran's reticence to scale back its nuclear program and its concerns about the durability of any U.S. deal, given that Trump broke the last one. It will be hard for Iran to concede enough to make a nuclear agreement worthwhile for the United States without crossing Tehran's own redlines.

Even a deal with terms favorable to the United States will have risks and any agreement will require uncomfortable concessions from both sides. But a deal that grants broad oversight over Iran's declared and undeclared nuclear sites and limits uranium enrichment, in exchange for some sanctions relief, could recapture the benefits of the JCPOA. If carefully negotiated and given enough time to demonstrate results, such a deal would undo some of the damage done when Washington withdrew from the original agreement, prevent a crisis in the near term, and create a foundation on which to build regional stability in the future.

The JCPOA, negotiated by the Obama administration and signed in the summer of 2015, put important restraints on Iran's nuclear program. It permitted uranium enrichment and other nuclear activities, but under strict limits and tightened international supervision. Under the deal, Iran was to be kept at least one year away from nuclear weapons possession for the foreseeable future. Even though some elements of the JCPOA were time bound, sunsetting at various points over the succeeding two decades, Iran would have emerged from the agreement's most significant restrictions in 2030 with roughly the same nuclear program as it had in 2015.

The deal, however, had plenty of critics. Many hawks, particularly within the Republican Party, argued that the deal's failure to roll back Iran's nuclear progress meant that a patient Tehran still had a path to the bomb. Better, they said, for Washington to confront a nuclear crisis sooner, when Iran's economy was still reeling from U.S.-led sanctions, than after years of relief. These critics found a receptive audience in Trump, who exited the JCPOA in May 2018, prompting Iran to restart its centrifuge R & D and expand enrichment activities in May 2019.

President Joe Biden attempted to negotiate a return to the JCPOA throughout his administration. But Iran's leaders, fearing the reelection of Trump, did not trust that Biden could deliver a durable deal. When talks between the United States and Iran faltered, the Biden administration declined to pursue an entirely new agreement, opting instead to avoid escalation. The failure of both U.S. administrations to come up with a replacement for the 2015 deal has been thrown into even higher relief by the news that Iran stands just days away from producing its first nuclear weapons–worth of material if it so chooses.



Fortunately, elements of the JCPOA can still be applied to a deal that could garner bipartisan support. Chief among them are the original agreement's transparency tools. Although much of the diplomatic and public discussion about a deal have focused on the future of Iran's enrichment program, international inspections, using the latest techniques and equipment, are the fundamental element around which any agreement must be structured. Iran must give the International Atomic Energy Agency the access to evaluate whether its nuclear program is peaceful or moving to weapons production. Without enhanced inspections and transparency, no deal—whether it requires the dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program or not—will last. Consequently, the United States should prioritize getting Iran to agree to the most intense inspections regime possible, at both declared sites and undeclared sites. If Iran will not fully meet the current standard of the IAEA Safeguards Agreement and adhere to its Additional Protocol, a set of IAEA rules developed in 1994 in response to revelations about Iraq's nuclear program, Washington should walk.

The United States should also demand that Iran accept the JCPOA's transparency mechanisms related to centrifuges and uranium stockpiles. These mechanisms gave the international community insight into the location and quantity of Iran's centrifuges (both completed and as manufactured components), as well as the quantity of its uranium. Without this transparency, Iran could easily develop a covert nuclear program, even as it publicly asserts its peaceful intentions. Seven years after the United States exited the JCPOA, Iran has created advanced centrifuges that have permanently reduced its breakout time. It is also capable of building a clandestine enrichment plant with smaller signatures that would be harder to detect and, because of its efforts to bury and harden these facilities, destroy. Worse, after attacks on its centrifuge-associated infrastructure in 2021, Iran stopped providing the IAEA with access to the centrifuge components the government is producing and information on where they are stored. Even if an agreement between Iran and the United States eliminated Iran's declared enrichment facilities, without intrusive declarations and inspections that focus on the country's centrifuge manufacturing pipeline, Tehran could still covertly go nuclear. Restoring JCPOA inspection rights would go a long way to correcting this problem.

To be sure, there are areas of JCPOA's inspection regime that did not go far enough and that a new deal must strengthen. A new deal, for example, should address the challenge of weaponization more directly than the JCPOA did. In Section T of the original deal, Iran agreed not to engage in work on nuclear weaponization or with certain technologies that could enable it, but Tehran was not required to declare existing equipment that could be used in the weaponization process or provide routine access to it to the IAEA. As a result, verification was extremely difficult. Although the United States had to accept this weaker provision in 2015, times have changed. After Israel acquired and publicized documents from Iran's nuclear archive in 2018, IAEA investigators discovered new sites where Iran had been working on weapons in the past. Since then, U.S. government reports indicate that Iran continues to engage in dual-use work relevant to weapons. Iranian leaders now frequently bandy about the idea of producing nuclear weapons if need be. A deal should thus require that Iran declare any equipment or materials that are related to nuclear weaponization as defined by the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The deal should also require that Tehran let the IAEA verify how Iranian nuclear equipment and materials are being used, with the clear understanding that if the agency's inspectors were ever stonewalled, Washington would be within its rights to revoke the agreement. This should include, explicitly, access to military sites.

International transparency is the necessary condition for any new nuclear deal. But it alone is not sufficient. The United States must also demand modifications to Iran's nuclear program itself.

Some changes should be easy for Iran to accept. In the JCPOA, Iran essentially agreed to end any near-term option for a plutonium-based bomb by modifying its reactor capable of producing weapons-usable plutonium and to refrain from any spent-fuel reprocessing work.

But other changes, especially on Iran's uranium enrichment program, will be harder for Tehran to swallow. To some extent, Iran's nuclear progress since May 2018 has rendered some of the restrictions obtained in the JCPOA moot. During those talks, the United States was dealing with Iran's first-generation centrifuge. It was a machine akin to a teenager's first car: capable of getting the user where it wanted to go, but not efficiently. Restricting centrifuge R & D was an important win for the United States in 2015. Today, however, Iran can do a lot more with a smaller number of centrifuges.

Iran could reassure the rest of the world that it has no intention of secretly building a weapon by completely dismantling its enrichment program, subject to international verification, which would make it easier to spot secret projects. In light of Tehran's deal with Russia to supply Iran's Bushehr nuclear reactor with fuel, and in the absence of forthcoming reactors that require a domestic supply of enriched uranium fuel, Iran's current nuclear program has scant economic value. And although the Trump administration persistently misstates why countries enrich uranium (several countries do so for energy, not for weapons programs), Iran could find more supplies of enriched uranium internationally, if needed.



Iran has long maintained that it will not dismantle its enrichment program, despite all the pressure, threats, and diplomatic entreaties from the United States and its partners, claiming it has invested too much—politically, economically, and socially—to give it up. Enriched uranium also represents Iran's best bet if Tehran wants to retain a future nuclear weapons option.

Complex proposals to sidestep this issue—whether by setting up a joint enrichment venture between Iran and Saudi Arabia; a consortium with other countries in the Middle East; matching tight restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment to its reactor construction; or making esoteric fuel supply arrangements that would have Iran convert its uranium into gas, export it for enrichment elsewhere, then import it back—could still ultimately leave thousands of centrifuges in Iran's possession. These proposals could also create a population of international monitors at Iranian nuclear sites, who could serve as de facto human shields and deter an international attack if Iran took up illegal weapons production.

Negotiating parties could hammer out more practicable arrangements. But ultimately, Washington might have to live with some risk. Still, an agreement on uranium enrichment would serve a critical purpose for both the Trump administration and Tehran: the United States could accept some enrichment by Iran while strengthening limitations, and Iran could accept those limitations without being seen as completely caving to its sworn enemy.

Iran's appetite for more extensive sanctions relief than what the JCPOA provided creates space for negotiations. The United States should thus build its sanctions relief framework on a sliding scale that ties relief to domestic enrichment restrictions.

If, for example, the United States insisted on the long-term or permanent cessation of uranium enrichment in Iran, it could promise Tehran not just relief from secondary sanctions (which punish foreigners who do business with Iran) but also an end to some elements of the U.S. embargo. This deal, for example, might drop sanctions on trade in commercial manufacturing projects and energy while retaining them on military or dual-use technology, the activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Iranian proxies. This would be a bold stroke, similar to Trump's decision to suspend all U.S. sanctions on Syria in hopes that the new Syrian government delivers on its promises of inclusion and reform. The Trump administration has greater political flexibility to make such an offer than did the Obama or Biden administrations, thanks to the Republican Party's deference to Trump's foreign policy initiatives.

Iran has much to gain from substantial sanctions relief. U.S. sanctions have mauled Iran's economy, limiting its ability to trade or bank internationally and undermining its key industries and infrastructure. They have made it hard to keep electricity and natural gas flowing, severely damaging Iran's industrial base. Reducing sanctions, then, would increase Iran's manufacturing capacity while opening it to the foreign financial and technological investment needed to pull the country out of its spiral.

Even limited sanctions relief would come at the expense of other U.S. efforts to counter Iran's influence in the Middle East, however. Iran would use some of the new revenues to help reconstruct its “axis of resistance,” which has been battered by Israel over the last 18 months. It could also build up its covert action capabilities and domestic military bases, including its missile programs and its naval forces (which could be used to harry shipping throughout the region). Although post-JCPOA U.S. sanctions have not stopped Iran from funding its proxies, which do a lot with a little, the United States would have to accept the possibility that sanctions relief commensurate with significant Iranian concessions could lead to the rearming of organizations it has fought hard to dismantle.

To avoid this outcome, the United States should insist that any deal with Iran include restrictions on Tehran exporting or deploying missiles, drones, and other ranged attack vehicles outside its territory. It could also demand that Iran not interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries in the region. Iran would almost certainly not respect such a commitment, but future violations could serve as a justification for future responses.

Since the United States withdrew from the JCPOA, Iran's nuclear advances have been significant and dangerous. Tehran now sits on the threshold of becoming a nuclear weapons state and, with the destruction of much of its proxy forces, may feel it has no choice but to cross over. For decades, U.S. policy under Democratic and Republican presidents has correctly aimed to prevent this possibility, through force if necessary. Now, Washington is nearing the moment of truth.

Just because Washington should be prepared to use force to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, however, doesn't mean that military action is the most desirable outcome. Striking Iran's nuclear program would likely set off a much larger conflict in which Israel and the United States hunt for covert Iranian nuclear sites and Tehran retaliates in the Middle East and beyond. Instead, the United States should take advantage of its leverage and Trump's ironclad grip on the Republican Party to make a deal—even an imperfect one—while doing so remains possible. Trump could even make good on his promise from 2018: to secure a better agreement than the JCPOA. His deal would have expanded inspection authorities, limitations on nuclear weaponization–related work, and limits on Iranian support to proxies. Improbably, the administration has a golden opportunity to reach an agreement. It should take it.

Few other countries in the past five years have experienced as great a shift in fortune as Azerbaijan. As recently as 2020, the small, oil- and natural-gas-rich country was mired in a decades-long conflict with neighboring Armenia and lacked full control of its territory. For years, the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous area with an ethnic Armenian population within Azerbaijan's internationally recognized borders, had been governed by a self-declared authority backed by Armenia. The unresolved status of the conflict left Azerbaijan diplomatically constrained and limited outside engagement with the country. It also made the nation strategically dependent—particularly on Russia, which cast itself as the region's indispensable arbiter and used the stalemate to keep Armenia reliant on its security guarantees while maintaining leverage over Azerbaijan.

Today, that situation has dramatically changed. Following successful wars in 2020 and 2023, Azerbaijan has finally reincorporated Nagorno-Karabakh as well as seven adjacent districts that had been occupied by Armenian forces since the early 1990s. It has also gained a decisive upper hand against Armenia. Meanwhile, distracted by the war in Ukraine, Russia has ceded much of its former regional influence to Azerbaijan; and with Moscow cut off from Western markets, Azerbaijan has risen in importance as a global energy supplier, including to Europe. At the same time, it has strengthened ties with both Turkey and Israel, expanded its diplomatic and economic footprint in Central Asia, and increased its presence in the Middle East—staking out broader regional ambitions. The Azerbaijani government also appears to have favorable relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has business ties to Baku, the country's capital, going back to his first term. Amid this remarkable recent good fortune, Azerbaijan faces an important choice. After 36 months of negotiations, it now has a rare opportunity to reach a more lasting peace with Armenia. In mid-March, officials in Baku and in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, announced they had finalized the text of a long-awaited peace agreement. If formalized, the treaty would put a definitive end to the once intractable conflict, cementing a new order in the South Caucasus together with the region's third country, Georgia. Yet it is unclear whether Azerbaijan will embrace the opportunity. Seeing itself in a position of strength, it has demanded further concessions from Armenia and appears to be in no hurry to conclude the deal. Meanwhile, although its oil- and gas-centered economy has brought much prosperity in recent years, these gains are fragile, and there has been little effort to diversify. Even a modest dip in energy prices—as has already begun to occur in 2025—could destabilize state finances and expose deeper vulnerabilities, including rising social inequality and public disaffection. In power for more than 20 years, Azerbaijan's leader, Ilham Aliyev, has continued to tighten his political control and clamp down on dissent, relying on the country's economic growth and a narrative of national strength to keep the population content.

These weaknesses, coupled with geopolitical uncertainty across the region, make Azerbaijan's rise precarious. If the war in Ukraine begins to wind down, Russia might refocus on a region where it can still exert control—including over its former longtime ally, Armenia. Even short of that, Moscow could be a potent spoiler, especially if no peace agreement is signed and transport links between Armenia and Azerbaijan remain blocked. In such a scenario, the Kremlin could reimpose itself as the key guarantor of regional connectivity—on its own terms. And without a peace agreement, Azerbaijan could find itself economically exposed, politically overextended, and at risk of strategic stagnation. Lacking the broader dividends of peace, including foreign investment and regional economic integration, Azerbaijan might also lose the chance to build a more sustainable political order at home. As a result, the South Caucasus could remain trapped in rivalry, forfeiting what may be the region's best opportunity yet for meaningful cooperation among its three states.

In one sense, it is remarkable that Azerbaijan and Armenia, decades-old antagonists, have hammered out a draft agreement at all. Without Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it is unlikely that a peace process would have even started. The story begins in 2020, when Azerbaijan won a decisive six-week war against Armenia, reclaiming most of the territory it had lost in the early 1990s. Fueling that triumph was advanced Israeli drone technology and an Azerbaijani military transformed by $40 billion in spending and decades of training, joint exercises, and coordination with Turkey. But just as Azerbaijani forces seemed set to retake the final Armenian-held areas of Nagorno-Karabakh, Russia intervened, halting the offensive and deploying peacekeepers on Azerbaijani soil. In Baku's eyes, Moscow had snatched away its rightful victory. For Azerbaijan, like Armenia a former Soviet republic, the Russian military presence seemed to mark a return to the past.

Azerbaijan was now dependent on Russia, which exploited the situation for its own interests. Meanwhile, Armenia had effectively outsourced the security of Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenian population to Moscow, assuming that the Kremlin—a traditional Armenian ally—would never allow Baku to fully reassert sovereignty. By the eve of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Kremlin was pressing for a formal set of rules of engagement for its peacekeepers that would have allowed it to act as a de facto occupying force. Azerbaijan pushed back, and once Russia became mired in Ukraine, the issue quietly fell off the agenda. With the peacekeepers lacking a formal mandate or strong engagement from Moscow, an emboldened Azerbaijan began testing the Russian presence with limited military incursions and expanded forward positions in Armenian-populated areas.



Starting in early 2022, these moves steadily undermined Russia's security guarantees, sending a clear message to the Armenian government and to Nagorno-Karabakh's ethnic Armenian population that the peacekeepers would no longer intervene to protect them. That message was confirmed in September 2023, when Azerbaijan launched a large-scale military operation that within a few hours captured all of Nagorno-Karabakh—without Russian resistance. Sensing it was overpowered, Armenia stood by, leaving Azerbaijan with a resounding victory and causing a mass exodus of Karabakh Armenians to Armenia—many of whom had long resisted integration into Azerbaijani rule.

Meanwhile, the Aliyev government had been leveraging geopolitical shifts to gain greater regional clout. Cut off from the West by sanctions, Moscow had begun relying on alternative trade routes—particularly the so-called North-South Transport Corridor, which runs from Moscow through Azerbaijan and Iran to Persian Gulf ports. Although the infrastructure on this route is still being developed, it has become a vital path for an isolated Russia and has strengthened Azerbaijan's hand against the Kremlin. With Russia weakened, Azerbaijan has also deepened its strategic ties with Turkey. In the 2021 Shusha Declaration, the two countries expanded military cooperation and framed their alliance as a deterrent against outside interference. Moscow now understood that confronting Baku risked straining its complex and strategically important relationship with Turkey.

After the 2020 war, Russia had opposed a formal Armenian-Azerbaijani peace deal, sensing that it might weaken its own hand in the region. But after the invasion of Ukraine, the European Union, supported by Washington—which also helped mediate the process—initiated high-level direct talks between Baku and Yerevan and helped create a new negotiating framework. As a result of this push, in late 2022, Armenia formally recognized Azerbaijan's territorial integrity—a step that had been almost unthinkable a year earlier. Baku, for its part, now positioned itself as a more autonomous actor, capable of engaging with Russia, Turkey, and the West on its own terms. By 2024, it was even able to compel Russian peacekeepers to withdraw ahead of schedule, thus clearing the way for a durable bilateral peace.

For Azerbaijan, however, peace with Armenia was only one of several opportunities opened up by the war in Ukraine. As Europe scrambled to reduce its dependence on Russian energy, Baku emerged as a partial alternative. Although Azerbaijani gas supplies could not rival the scale of Russian exports, they offered enough to buttress European energy security—particularly for southern European countries with more modest needs. Through the Southern Gas Corridor, which channels Azerbaijani gas to Europe via Georgia and Turkey, Baku solidified its role as a key energy partner, exporting more than 44 billion cubic meters of natural gas to the EU between 2021 and 2024.

Yet the profits were more modest than some in Baku may have anticipated. Despite higher global energy prices, gas exports brought in around $12 billion over those four years—less than Azerbaijan earned from oil in a single year, as surging prices delivered a much larger windfall. The outlook has been further clouded by Europe's reluctance to expand its energy delivery infrastructure to receive more Azerbaijani gas exports—a step that some member states see as conflicting with the bloc's ambitious climate goals.

At the same time, with the sanctions-induced collapse of traditional Europe-Asia trade routes through Russia, Azerbaijan had new economic opportunities. Russia turned to the South Caucasus as a critical link in alternative north-south trade routes, and Azerbaijan also capitalized on its position as a transit point for alternative east-west corridors—supported by Western efforts to reroute trade flows from Asia away from Russia via the Caspian Sea, in the so-called Middle Corridor. Although cargo volumes along this route have risen, they have been constrained by limited infrastructure and bottlenecks and still constitute just three to five percent of total Eurasian trade. Nonetheless, Central Asia's growing economic importance—as a source of critical raw materials, energy diversification, and strategic balance vis-à-vis Russia and China—makes these routes worth developing. Even if the Middle Corridor never meets the lofty ambitions of its advocates, Azerbaijan's strategic location ensures its continued relevance.



Yet this new geopolitical clout has not insulated Azerbaijan from regional tensions, especially with neighboring Iran. Although Azerbaijan is also a Shiite-majority country, Iran has watched its influence there steadily wane. The relationship worsened sharply after the 2020 war, which restored Azerbaijani control over a large stretch of its border with Iran and which tightened Baku's ties to Tehran's rivals, Turkey and Israel. An armed attack on Azerbaijan's embassy in Tehran in early 2023—widely viewed in Baku as tolerated, if not orchestrated, by Iranian authorities—marked a low point in Azerbaijani-Iranian relations. 

Although tensions have since eased, Iran is losing its long-standing leverage over Baku, including its historical relationship with Nakhichevan, the Azerbaijani exclave on Iran's border. In March 2025, Turkey and Azerbaijan inaugurated a new gas pipeline connecting Nakhichevan to Turkey's gas grid, and thus reduced Nakhichevan's decades-old reliance on Iranian energy. If a peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia also unlocks a direct land corridor from Azerbaijan to the exclave through southern Armenia, Iran would lose yet another point of leverage. Such a shift would diminish Iran's role not just in energy transit but also in regional trade, where it has long served as a conduit for Turkish goods headed to Central Asia. And it would further boost Turkey's regional influence.

Iran also harbors deeper concerns about Azerbaijan: that in a future conflict over its nuclear program, Baku could serve as a springboard for Israeli military action. On top of that, Iran has its own restive population of some 20 million ethnic Azeris—making up perhaps as much as a quarter of the Iranian population. For this Iranian minority, many of whom are in the country's northwest, a more assertive Baku, and its growing emphasis on shared ethnic and historical ties, could inspire ethnic mobilization, or even separatist aspirations.

Azerbaijan's rising international profile has not insulated it from internal weaknesses. In the wake of the victory in Nagorno-Karabakh, President Aliyev has enjoyed greater popular legitimacy than at any previous moment in the country's post-Soviet history. In theory, this should offer a rare chance for a broader political reset: for years, the lack of political and economic reforms and overinvestment in the military were justified by the unresolved conflict, and many Azerbaijanis hoped that victory would finally open up the country and allow it to fashion a new “post-Karabakh” national identity.

But those hopes are rapidly fading. Since 2023, the government has tightened its grip—jailing journalists, activists, and opposition figures while restricting access for foreign media and limiting the activities of several UN agencies and humanitarian organizations. In doing so, the government had continued to portray Armenia as a threat, drawing on the population's shared experience of war, territorial loss, and mass displacement. But with the return of the occupied territories and little public appetite for renewed conflict, those experiences no longer resonate as they once did. The government shows little interest in moving beyond the old narrative—not only because it helps legitimize domestic control, but because no clear alternative national story has emerged. And as the government narrative weakens, the structural challenges it once helped obscure are becoming harder to ignore, including public frustration over limited economic opportunity and concerns about transparent governance.

Beneath the surface, economic vulnerabilities are mounting. Azerbaijan depends heavily on volatile revenues from its Caspian Sea oil and gas reserves. Oil output has plummeted from a 2010 peak of 823,000 barrels per day to just 566,000 by early 2025, as extraction has become more difficult. Developing new reserves could take years and require major foreign investment, a hard ask in a world transitioning toward renewables. Even this year's moderate drop in oil prices—from around $80 a barrel in early 2025 to just $64 as of late May—could, if sustained, wipe out more than 20 percent of state revenue.

These structural risks complicate Azerbaijan's wider ambitions. Baku's geography alone will not be enough to make it a critical east-west energy and trade hub. Countries that have successfully leveraged their location—whether in Europe, the Gulf, or Central Asia—have paired it with institutional reliability, regulatory transparency, and a baseline of political stability. Foreign investors may not require democracy, but they do require rules-based systems—where decisions are predictable, institutions function consistently, and political interference and corruption is kept in check. Without them, no route—no matter how strategic—can fulfill its potential.

The war in Ukraine has transformed Azerbaijan's position in previously almost unimaginable ways. But these short-term gains do not guarantee lasting stability, and the government's overconfidence in the country's rise could backfire. Last December, for example, after a Russian missile mistakenly downed an Azerbaijani civilian aircraft, Aliyev himself publicly rebuked the Kremlin. Baku's response—open and defiant—signaled a new attitude: it no longer fears Moscow as it once did. But that might change if Russia were to reassert itself in the Caucasus. 

Similarly, Azerbaijani officials seem to assume that their country's diplomatic proximity to Israel, and geographic proximity to Iran, will make Baku indispensable to long-term U.S. interests—regardless of who sits in the White House. The government had even signaled a preference for a second Trump administration, calculating that Trump would be tougher on Iran. Yet that alignment carries risks of its own. If tensions grow between Iran, Israel, and the United States, Tehran could lash out at Azerbaijan militarily or by using its influence with Shiite clerics to foment internal unrest—particularly if Baku appears to be supporting Israel.

Meanwhile, Azerbaijan has stalled on a historic chance for lasting regional peace. In postponing the deal with Armenia, Baku has made two core demands: changes to the Armenian constitution to remove perceived territorial claims, and the granting of an uninterrupted land corridor connecting mainland Azerbaijan to the Nakhichevan exclave. Quietly, Azerbaijani officials suggest they may also insist on an upfront guarantee of major investment from the European Union and Western development institutions to help rebuild Azerbaijan's formerly Armenian-controlled territories. Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding regions are now being gradually resettled by some of the more than 600,000 Azerbaijanis displaced during the 1990s war, but progress is slow; so far, only around 13,000 of them have returned. Many towns were heavily damaged, and nearly everything—from infrastructure to housing—has to be rebuilt from scratch amid ongoing demining efforts. But such Western investment may not come.



With creativity, patience, and trust, many of these issues can be resolved. Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is a strong supporter of a deal, and if he manages to persuade Armenians that constitutional reform is simply a bilateral confidence-building step that will bring much larger long-term economic rewards, he might ultimately succeed. But if he takes such a controversial step before crucial Armenian parliamentary elections in 2026, domestic critics may accuse him of selling out, and the entire peace process could be derailed. Notably, Pashinyan is the only major political figure in Yerevan pushing for a permanent settlement, and members of Armenia's opposition have called the proposed constitutional reform a betrayal of national interests. If Pashinyan loses power, it could open the door to a very different Armenian leadership, likely led by a mix of revanchist and Russia-leaning figures who may see renewed confrontation with Azerbaijan as politically advantageous.

Moreover, for many Armenians, the issue of reopening trade routes and borders—some of them closed for over three decades—remains politically charged, particularly the proposed route linking Azerbaijan to Nakhichevan. Here, the European Union, which is still seen as a credible peace broker on both sides, could propose practical arrangements that meet both sides' expectations on access and control—while also offering financial assistance, infrastructure investment, and technical support to help implement them. Europe stands to benefit, too: a successful deal could help shift the geopolitical balance in the South Caucasus permanently away from Russia.

Turkey's role will also be critical. Ankara sees the South Caucasus as part of its strategic hinterland and views normalization with Armenia as a way to help shape, not dominate, the postconflict order. It has deferred to Baku at every step, saying it will open its border with Armenia only with Azerbaijani consent. A peace deal would give Ankara the green light—and help develop a new regional order in which Turkish engagement, backed by EU diplomacy, could offer Armenia a strategic lifeline and limit any Russian return. A stronger regional role for Turkey will also help Azerbaijan, which ultimately relies on Turkey to counterbalance any renewed Russian pressure. The question is not whether a peace treaty is desirable but whether it can be secured before the window that has made it possible closes.

The longer a settlement is delayed, the more vulnerable the process will become to shifting political currents and external interference. Armenia's domestic fragility, waning global attention, and renewed Russian interest could derail the positive steps made over the past three years. The strategic opening created by Moscow's distraction in Ukraine will not last indefinitely. If further geopolitical shifts occur without a durable settlement in place, Russia may still find ways to reinsert itself—maybe not to restore its former dominance but to obstruct progress, prolong ambiguity, and make sure its interests are preserved. That outcome would benefit none of those who would be immediately affected by Russia's presence—not Azerbaijan, not Armenia, and not the broader region.

            Being an honest public servant will always be a rewarding choice, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Sunday in a speech at a pre-graduation ceremony at Princeton University amid months of unrelenting personal attacks from President Donald Trump.
    


            “As you navigate the world of bright possibilities that awaits you, I urge you to take on the challenge and the opportunity to serve your fellow citizens,” Powell said. “Fifty years from now, you will want to be able to look in the mirror and know that you did what you thought was right, in every part of your life.”
    


            “At the end of the day, your integrity is all you have. Guard it carefully,” he said.
    


            Powell also described America's universities as the “envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” designations he urged the class to not take for granted. He then delivered a stark warning about the threats facing universities and democracy at a time when Trump is increasingly wielding the power of the federal government to make institutions of higher education bend to his will.
    


            “When you look back in 50 years, you will want to know that you have done whatever it takes to preserve and strengthen our democracy, and bring us ever closer to the Founders' timeless ideals,” he said.
    


            Since taking the helm in 2018, Powell has steered the Fed through a litany of challenges, such as an economic crisis sowed by the Covid-19 pandemic, a historic bout of high inflation, and now, an erratic global trade war that has unsettled decision-makers across the world.
    


            Powell has also dealt with direct and personal attacks on his character — a rarity for someone in charge of America's central bank.
    


            Trump has assailed Powell for not lowering interest rates quickly enough, accusing him of playing politics and describing him as a “fool” and “a major loser,” while also saying that his termination “cannot come fast enough.” Top administration officials have privately warned Trump of financial-market chaos if he were to proceed with sacking Powell, CNN previously reported.



            Powell, for his part, has remained mum amid the criticism. In November, when asked if he'd step down if Trump asked him to, Powell said that's “not permitted under the law.”
    


            In recent weeks, Fed officials have said they will keep rates on hold, mostly because of lingering uncertainty over Trump's tariff policies. Trump, meanwhile, hasn't provided evidence to back up his claims that Fed officials are not cutting rates as a way to help Democrats.
    


            In the latest salvo of the one-sided Trump-Powell clash, the president took to his social media platform again to call on Powell to lower borrowing costs.
    


            “Too Late Powell, a man legendary for being Too Late, will probably blow it again - But who knows???” Trump wrote on May 17.
    


            Earlier this month, the Fed kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, extending a holding pattern that began in January. Central bank officials have maintained that it's best to wait to see how the US economy responds to Trump's ever-evolving trade war before lowering rates.
    


            “Everything's always on the table. But I feel like the bar for me is a little higher for action in any direction while we're waiting to get some clarity,” Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC in a May 23 interview.

            Some soldiers prove their valor in battle. Lt. Roland Christensen revealed his character on another proving ground—with a split-second decision that would change another Navy pilot's life.
    


            On March 17, 1947, Christensen gathered with other flight instructors at a naval air base in Glenview, Illinois. They appraised a group of nervous trainees who had assembled for the first day of selective flight training. The stakes were high — an average of 10 pilots per day washed out of Glenview.
    


            One of the trainees had another reason for nerves. He was a slim, Black man named Jesse Leroy Brown. The son of Mississippi sharecroppers, Brown was attempting to become the Navy's first Black pilot. One flight instructor told him “You'll never sit your Black a** in a Navy plane.” Others dubbed him “oil slick” or called him “n***er.” The other instructors ignored Brown as they greeted trainees and peeled off for their first training flights.
    


            But Christensen approached him with an outstretched hand.
    


            “You'll be flying with me today,” Christensen said, ignoring the snickers and glares from the other White trainers. Brown snapped to attention with a hearty, “Yessir!”
    


            Brown would go on to break the Navy's color barrier, becoming its first Black pilot. He would earn the Distinguished Flying Cross for valor during the Korean War. A Navy ship would eventually be named after him, and his life would inspire a bestselling book and movie.
    


            But Brown never would have taken off without Christensen's moral courage. These are the type of stories that have long helped make the modern US military so distinctive. The military is the most racially integrated institution in America. This is not just reflected in numbers but also in power: Although problems with deep-rooted racism persist, people of color have risen to the top echelons of the US military.
    


            That integration, though, goes beyond race. The military is one of the few large institutions left in America where citizens voluntarily form close relationships with people of different religions, socio-economic backgrounds and ethnicities — all in service of a common national purpose.
    


            Combat veterans in particular talk about the brotherhood, and sisterhood, formed in battle.
    


            “The enduring emotion of war, when everything else has faded, is comradeship,” William Broyles Jr., a combat veteran in Vietnam, wrote in a classic essay. “A comrade in war is a man you can trust with anything, because you trust him with your life.”
    


            But now some of America's leaders are telling a different story. The Trump administration has launched a purge of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives throughout the armed forces and military academies. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says a culture of “wokeness and weakness” has made the military less lethal.



            Hegseth, who wrote in a book published last year that “America's white sons and daughters are walking away” from military service, says he wants to restore the “warrior” mentality to America's military.
    


            “I think the single dumbest phrase in military history is ‘Our diversity is our strength,” Hegseth said in February in a speech at the Pentagon.
    


            But the strongest rebuttal to Hegseth's argument is military history itself. Many of the nation's biggest military blunders occurred because there wasn't enough diversity in the armed forces.
    


            Consider one the worst military disasters to befall the US: the Japanese's navy's 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, which triggered the nation's entrance into World War II. Most history books describe the event simply as a Japanese sneak attack. At least 2,400 Americans were killed and images of the massive USS Arizona destroyer, engulfed in flames and billowing black smoke, represent one of the nation's most humiliating military failures.
    


            But the US had ample warnings that the Japanese might attack. Why didn't they heed those warnings?
    


            One factor was racism, some military historians say.
    


            America's military leadership in the mid-20th century was all-White, and many commanders harbored stereotypes about the Japanese. When Admiral Husband Kimmel, commander of Pearl Harbor's navy base, was later asked about the intelligence failures that led to the attack, he said, “I never thought those little yellow sons of bitches could pull off such an attack, so far from Japan.”
    


            US military leaders had succumbed to “groupthink,” which often occurs when there's not enough diversity in a decision-making body.
    


            The term was popularized by psychologist Irving Janis. It comes from an essay he wrote in the 1970s that described how groupthink leads to military failures. It describes a dynamic where a group unwittingly creates a culture of conformity when making decisions. The desire for group consensus blocks out alternative points of view. No one feels empowered to disagree. The risk for groupthink increases with homogeneous groups, or groups with members who share the same background and experience.
    


            Janis wrote that American military commanders didn't pay attention to warnings of an impending attack in part because of groupthink. They saw Japan “as a midget that would not dare to strike a blow against a powerful giant.”



How far can West Point's ‘Long Gray Line' bend before it breaks?



            He also wrote that groupthink led to other American military blunders, including the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba under President Kennedy and President Truman's ill-fated decision to invade North Korea, which brought China into the Korean War.
    


            Groupthink also led to the debacle in Vietnam. The Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Barbara Tuchman wrote the US lost that war in part because the Kennedy and Johnson administrations lacked anyone with a deep understanding of Vietnamese culture, politics and history.
    


            She had a term for that groupthink failure: “The March of Folly.”



            With its DEI purge, the Trump administration is making the same mistake that American military leaders made in the past, says Kyle Bibby, an infantry captain in the US Marines who served in Afghanistan. He cited several recent decisions: Trump's firing of Charles Q. Brown, the second Black person to serve as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Colin Powell was the first); and Hegseth's firing of Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the chief of the Navy.



            The Defense Department has also banned using official resources to celebrate cultural awareness events such as Black History and Hispanic Heritage months.  The US Naval Academy last month banned nearly 400 books in its library that dealt with racial justice, gender and LGBTQ+ issues. The library, however, reportedly still retained two copies of “Mein Kampf” by Adolf Hitler.
    


            “They're trying to make a very clear statement to the military that this is a White man's military and the rest of you will fall in line,” says Bibby, co-founder of the Black Veterans Project, a group that preserves the legacy of Black veterans and secures restitution for Black soldiers denied benefits.
    


            Bibby says the purge doesn't make business sense, either.
    


            “There's no one on Earth who genuinely thinks that having differing opinions and experiences wile coming together to solve issues or build products is a bad thing for a team,” Bibby tells CNN. “The only people who think like that are people who believe in groupthink.”
    


            Yet research shows it's not enough for a military to be diverse. Numbers don't mean much if women or non-White soldiers don't feel valued and heard. This belief led to one of the most important victories in the Iraq War, one American general recently wrote in an essay.
    


Gen. Mark Hertling was commanding an Army division during the Iraq War in 2008 when he noticed an increase in suicide bombings carried out by Iraqi women, often in crowded public places. He couldn't figure out how to stop it. Cultural prohibitions prevented men from touching and searching women.
    


            The solution came from a junior female officer. At her suggestion, the military arranged a conference for Iraqi women to convince them that they had a stake in their country's future. Within months, 60 female officers were fanning out across Iraqi provinces.
    


            Would a woman officer feel comfortable approaching a male general with an out-of-the-box suggestion in today's anti-woke culture?
    


            Hertling, who is now retired and a CNN commentator, doesn't answer that question in his essay, but he says that female officer saved lives.
    


            “By the time 1st armored division rotated home, not only was the female suicide-vest cell almost completely destroyed, but the overall level of violence in northern Iraq was down significantly,” Hertling wrote.



            The scenario Hertling described would not have possible not too long ago. This is not the US military's first DEI purge. The voices and contributions of women and people of color were overlooked and erased through much of America's military history.



            Black soldiers were routinely treated as second-class citizens, held menial jobs such as cooks and were forced to serve in racially segregated units. Women in the military routinely experienced — and still do — discrimination and sexual harassment.
    


            President Truman began to change this culture in 1948 when he issued an executive order desegregating the US military. Today, 32% of active-duty members are racial minorities and 17.7% are women, according to a 2023 Department of Defense study.
    


            The military's march to diversity faced some of its stiffest challenges in Vietnam. The racial tensions of 1960s America spilled over into the battlefield. There were constant reports of “fragging,” incidents in which US soldiers killed their comrades. Racial tensions between White and Black soldiers led to many fragging incidents.
    


            The military created many of its diversity programs after Vietnam because they learned that a racially divided army cost lives, says Matthew Delmont, author of “Half-American: The Epic Story of African Americans Fighting World War II at Home and Abroad.”
    


            “It wasn't about being politically correct,” Delmont says. “It was about we're going to be less effective fighting wars if we can't sort out this racial business.”
    


            One Vietnam veteran recalls how racial tension affected his soldiers. Karl Marlantes, was then a young White man from a coastal logging town in Oregon when he commanded a platoon in Vietnam. He recalls the sensation of fighting two battles—one against the North Vietnamese, and another to hold marines together in the rear.
    


            “I can just remember the sadness I felt in my platoon,” says Marlantes, who wrote about his war experiences in “Matterhorn,” and “What It Is Like to Go to War.” “We would all work together in the bush but when we got off the chopper, all the Black kids are in one part and the White kids in another part.”
    


            Marlantes tells CNN he once tried to persuade a Black soldier to hang out with White soldiers as well but the soldier refused.
    


            “He said I don't want to be the one Black guy hanging out with a bunch of White guys when suddenly there's a riot,” Marlantes says. “There was a lot of fear.”
    


            That type of fear can lead to defeat. Armies that are divided by racial and ethnic tensions that bleed over from civilian life underperform, says Jason Lyall, author of “Divided Armies: Inequality and Battlefield Performance in Modern War.”
    


            Lyall says he studied nearly 850 armies in 250 wars fought since 1800 and made a discovery: inclusive armies fight harder, suffer lower rates of desertion and exhibit more creative problem solving on the battlefield.
    


            “Victory on the battlefield over the past 200 years has usually gone to the most inclusive armies,” Lyall wrote in a 2020 essay, “not the largest or best equipped.”
    


            There was another reason the American military decided to become more diverse after World War II. They saw what happened to Nazi Germany.
    


            People sometimes forget that Nazi Germany was built on, and destroyed by, racism. A racist demagogue persuaded Germans that other groups were inherently inferior. The Nazis' demonization of ethnic and religious minorities, as well as political opponents, led to the Holocaust.
    


            Many of the American soldiers who liberated the concentration camps were stunned that an advanced country like Germany could turn so barbaric. Some of them were Black veterans like Leon Bass, who simmered in anger over the racist treatment he received in the segregated Army. Then he entered the Buchenwald Concentration camp.



            There he encountered what he called the “walking dead”— emaciated survivors who wordlessly stumbled toward him with sores across their naked bodies.



            “Segregation, racism, can lead to the ultimate (horror) … that's what I saw in Buchenwald,” says Bass, who died at 90 in 2015.
    


            Fear of a similar democratic collapse motivated Americans like Bass after World War II. They resolved to, as the author David Brooks said, never “fall for the strongman's deductive promise of domination.” They invoked, without irony, America's traditional motto, “E Pluribus unum,” meaning “Out of many one.”
    


            No other idea captured the nation's imagination like racial integration during the 1950s and ‘60s, says Leonard Steinhorn, co-author of “By The Color Of Our Skin.”



            “We saw ourselves as the big melting pot where everyone blended together and all the characteristics of different groups added to the pot,” Steinhorn tells CNN. “We wanted to believe that we could be better, that we weren't bound by the prejudices, hatreds and outdated ideologies of old.”
    


            But in recent years the desire for common ground seems to have evaporated. Our schools and communities remain widely segregated. Diversity programs are being driven out of academia and corporate America. People are self-sorting into political enclaves where they have little contact with people with different opinions.
    


            The military is a last bastion of integration in America. Not even college and pro sports teams approach its commitment to the concept. Communities with large military installations dominate the list of the least segregated metropolitan areas of the US. There are higher rates of intermarriage among military members.
    


            That diversity serves a vital military interest, some of the country's leading military leaders recently said. Thirty-five retired senior defense officials, including four former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff, signed an amicus brief in 2022 supporting diversity as vital for the nation's armed services.
    


            “History has shown that placing a diverse Armed Forces under the command of a homogeneous leadership is a recipe of internal resentment, discord, and violence,” they wrote.
    


            That diversity is also needed more than ever because of another factor: In recent years the military has faced a severe recruiting shortage. The Army, for example, missed its recruitment goal by nearly 25% in 2022 and 2023. An uptick in recruiting that began last summer has carried over into 2025 so far. But a fundamental challenge remains: an all-volunteer force must consistently attract large numbers of people of color if it's going to remain effective.
    


            Here's another intangible reason why diversity makes the military stronger. Some of the biggest beneficiaries of this diversity are White men. They may become hidden casualties in this war on wokeness.
    


            Diversity not only increases the chance that they will succeed in war zones. It teaches them how to negotiate differences with someone who is different — a vital skill for preserving a multiracial and multicultural democracy.
    


            Bibby says Black Marines swelled with pride when they saw his captain bars, but it was also important that White soldiers saw him. There are numerous historical examples of White soldiers who harbored racist attitudes being transformed by serving with, and fighting alongside, Black soldiers.



            “We don't talk enough about how much it means to young White men who have never seen a Black captain to understand that I'm a part of this damn story,” Bibby says. “It's important that they see Black and women officers and they understand that we're all part of the same team.”
    


            Marlantes says he has a comfort level with Black people he probably wouldn't have otherwise if not for his experiences in the Marines. He says he met all sorts of soldiers who expanded his perspective.



            “We had an artillery forward observer whose great-grandfather owned Hilton Head,” says Marlantes of the popular South Carolina tourist destination. “He was rich. And he was in there with us, eating cold beans and being miserable while trying to save our ass by bringing in artillery.”
    


            Christensen, the naval instructor who taught the Navy's first Black pilot, was also transformed by an unlikely friendship. A descendent of Danish immigrants, he grew up on a Nebraska farm where he knew no Black people. But he was also poor and knew what it felt like to be an outsider.
    


            He bonded with Brown over those shared experiences. The two men later exchanged letters that Christensen kept in a cedar chest in his home for more than 60 years.
    


            Their friendship reflected the profound bonds that often form between people who serve together in the armed forces. “It is,” Philip Caputo wrote in his classic Vietnam War memoir, “A Rumor of War, “unlike marriage, a bond that cannot be broken by a word, by boredom or divorce, or by anything other than death.” 



            Their friendship ended when Brown was killed in action in 1950 during the Korean War. He was shot down and died before a rescue helicopter could ferry him to safety. After hearing about Brown's death, Christensen became a helicopter rescue pilot and saved six pilots during the Korean War.
    


            Before he died at 91 in 2014, he made an admission to his daughter, Nancy King.
    


            “He told me that there wasn't a single week that had gone by since 1950 that he didn't think about Jesse Brown,” King said. “He said, “I dream about it.' “
    


            Critics of DEI will say that the friendship between Brown and Christensen fulfills their vision of a colorblind military. They want a military meritocracy, where only competence matters.
    


            But integration of any kind never happens naturally in any large institution. The old hierarchies from civilian life can easily reassert themselves in the military. Armies splinter, groupthink leads to disasters and people die.
    


            The Trump administration's DEI purge ignores those hard-won lessons. It will go down as an epic case of friendly fire, a self-inflicted wound that harms more than helps.
    


            It's another march of folly.

            President Donald Trump honored fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day Monday hours after blasting his political opponents and perceived enemies as “scum” in a social media post marking the solemn day.
    


            In the early morning Truth Social post, Trump criticized members of the federal judiciary as “USA hating” as well as “monsters,” and his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, as “incompetent.”
    


            The all-caps message, posted just before 7 a.m. ET, sees the president wishing a “Happy Memorial Day to all, including the scum that spent the last four years trying to destroy our country through warped radical left minds,” which he writes were responsible for illegal immigration into the country under Biden.
    


            Trump went on to suggest that 21 million people entered the US illegally under the previous administration — a figure not borne out by US Customs and Border Protection data, as previously reported by CNN.
    


            He blamed “an incompetent president” for the influx of migrants and “judges who are on a mission to keep murderers, drug dealers, rapists, gang members, and released prisoners from all over the world, in our country so they can rob, murder, and rape again,” for stymying his deportation agenda, claiming criminal migrants are “protected by these USA hating judges who suffer from an ideology that is sick, and very dangerous for our country.”
    


            In the United States, Memorial Day honors those who died while serving in the armed forces; due to the holiday's grave significance, it's largely considered taboo to wish someone a “Happy Memorial Day.”
    


            During his first term, Trump largely kept to prepared speeches when delivering his Memorial Day remarks. He participated in the ceremony at Arlington for the first three years of his presidency before it moved to Fort McHenry in Baltimore during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.
    


            Trump's Memorial Day message came two days after a politically inflected commencement address at the US Military Academy at West Point, where the president combined traditional advice to graduates with more overtly partisan themes.
    


            In the speech, Trump touted his election victory last year and veered into litigating some of his grievances about investigations into him. He wore a red “Make America Great Again” hat during the speech.
    


            He also told the graduating cadets they would be the first to serve in the “golden age” of the military, touting at length his efforts to rid the military of diversity initiatives and criticizing his predecessors for entering what he deemed to be wars of choice.
    


            “The job of the US armed forces is not to host drag shows, to transform foreign cultures (and) spread democracy to everybody around the world at the point of a gun,” he said. “The military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America, anywhere, anytime and any place.”

            In his speech, Trump also offered somewhat off-key advice about not marrying “trophy wives,” citing as an example a friend who moved to Monte Carlo with a younger bride, only to later suffer financially when he lost his “momentum.” Trump offered the story as a point of guidance to graduates.
    


            Trump has previously drawn criticism for inserting political messages into traditionally apolitical occasions and settings.
    


            During his first term, he took to then-social media platform Twitter in 2018 to wish Americans a “Happy Memorial Day!” writing, “Those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today,” highlighting his own policy wins instead of the sacrifice made by America's armed services.
    


            And in August 2024, the US Army issued a rare rebuke after Trump's campaign recorded a video while visiting the Arlington National Cemetery gravesites of some of the service members killed during the US' chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. In a statement, the Army wrote that Trump and his staff “were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations, and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds.”
    


            At the time, the Trump campaign pointed to a statement from the Gold Star families he accompanied, saying they gave his videographer and photographer permission to be there, although some imagery from the visit showed the graves of other US service members whose families did not give permission.
    


            The president originally posted a different version of Monday's Memorial Day post but appears to have deleted the original version (which had some minor grammatical errors) and reposted it again.

            As the World War II bomber Heaven Can Wait was hit by enemy fire off the Pacific island of New Guinea on March 11, 1944, the co-pilot managed a final salute to flyers in an adjacent plane before crashing into the water.
    


            All 11 men aboard were killed. Their remains, deep below the vast sea, were designated as non-recoverable.
    


            Yet four crew members' remains are beginning to return to their hometowns after a remarkable investigation by family members and a recovery mission involving elite Navy divers who descended 200 feet (61 meters) in a pressurized bell to reach the sea floor.
    


            Staff Sgt. Eugene Darrigan, the radio operator was buried with military honors and community support on Saturday in his hometown of Wappingers Falls, New York, more than eight decades after leaving behind his wife and baby son.
    


A mistake finally corrected after more than 80 years for two WWII Jewish American soldiers



            The bombardier, 2nd Lt. Thomas Kelly, was to be buried Monday in Livermore, California, where he grew up in a ranching family. The remains of the pilot, 1st Lt. Herbert Tennyson, and navigator, 2nd Lt. Donald Sheppick, will be interred in the coming months.
    


            The ceremonies are happening 12 years after one of Kelly's relatives, Scott Althaus, set out to solve the mystery of where exactly the plane went down.
    


            “I'm just so grateful,” he told The Associated Press. “It's been an impossible journey — just should never have been able to get to this day. And here we are, 81 years later.”
    


            The Army Air Forces plane nicknamed Heaven Can Wait was a B-24 with a cartoon pin-up angel painted on its nose and a crew of 11 on its final flight.
    


            They were on a mission to bomb Japanese targets when the plane was shot down. Other flyers on the mission were not able to spot survivors.
    


            Their wives, parents and siblings were of a generation that tended to be tight-lipped in their grief. But the men were sorely missed.
    


            Sheppick, 26, and Tennyson, 24, each left behind pregnant wives who would sometimes write them two or three letters a day. Darrigan, 26, also was married, and had been able to attend his son's baptism while on leave. A photo shows him in uniform, smiling as he holds the boy.
    


            Darrigan's wife, Florence, remarried but quietly held on to photos of her late husband, as well as a telegram informing her of his death.
    


            Tennyson's wife, Jean, lived until age 96 and never remarried.
    


            “She never stopped believing that he was going to come home,” said her grandson, Scott Jefferson.
    


            As Memorial Day approached twelve years ago, Althaus asked his mother for names of relatives who died in World War II.
    


            Althaus, a political science and communications professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, became curious while researching World War II casualties for work. His mother gave him the name of her cousin Thomas Kelly, who was 21 years old when he was reported missing in action.
    


            Althaus recalled that as a boy, he visited Kelly's memorial stone, which has a bomber engraved on it. He began reading up on the lost plane.
    


            “It was a mystery that I discovered really mattered to my extended family,” he said.
    


More than 80 years after he went missing in Romania, an American WWII airman has been honored



            With help from other relatives, he analyzed historical documents, photos and eyewitness recollections. They weighed sometimes conflicting accounts of where the plane went down. After a four-year investigation, Althaus wrote a report concluding that the bomber likely crashed off of Awar Point in what is now Papua New Guinea
    


            The report was shared with Project Recover, a nonprofit committed to finding and repatriating missing American service members and a partner of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, or DPAA. A team from Project Recover, led by researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, located the debris field in 2017 after searching nearly 10 square miles (27 square kilometers) of seafloor.
    


            The DPAA launched its deepest ever underwater recovery mission in 2023.
    


            A Navy dive team recovered dog tags, including Darrigan's partially corroded tag with his the name of his wife, Florence, as an emergency contact. Kelly's ring was recovered. The stone was gone, but the word BOMBARDIER was still legible.
    


            And they recovered remains that underwent DNA testing. Last September, the military officially accounted for Darrigan, Kelly, Sheppick and Tennyson.
    


            With seven men who were on the plane still unaccounted for, a future DPAA mission to the site is possible.
    


            More than 200 people honored Darrigan on Saturday in Wappingers Falls, some waving flags from the sidewalk during the procession to the church, others saluting him at a graveside ceremony under cloudy skies.
    


            “After 80 years, this great soldier has come home to rest,” Darrigan's great niece, Susan Pineiro, told mourners at his graveside.
    


            Darrigan's son died in 2020, but his grandson Eric Schindler attended.
    


            Darrigan's 85-year-old niece, Virginia Pineiro, solemnly accepted the folded flag.
    


This American soldier witnessed the Nazi surrender. 80 years later, he's still happy to be home



            Kelly's remains arrived in the Bay Area on Friday. He was to be buried Monday at his family's cemetery plot, right by the marker with the bomber etched on it. A procession of Veterans of Foreign Wars motorcyclists will pass by Kelly's old home and high school before he is interred.
    


            “I think it's very unlikely that Tom Kelly's memory is going to fade soon,” said Althaus, now a volunteer with Project Recover.
    


            Sheppick will be buried in the months ahead near his parents in a cemetery in Coal Center, Pennsylvania. His niece, Deborah Wineland, said she thinks her late father, Sheppick's younger brother, would have wanted it that way. The son Sheppick never met died of cancer while in high school.
    


            Tennyson will be interred on June 27 in Wichita, Kansas. He'll be buried beside his wife, Jean, who died in 2017, just months before the wreckage was located.
    


            “I think because she never stopped believing that he was coming back to her, that it's only fitting she be proven right,” Jefferson said.

Follow:


            Pope Leo XIV asked Sunday for prayers for China's Catholics to be in communion with the Holy See, as he made his first public remarks about one of the thorniest foreign policy issues facing his new pontificate.
    


            History's first American pope recalled that on Saturday the Catholic Church marked a special feast day to pray for the church in China. Pope Benedict XVI had initiated the feast day as part of his efforts to unify China's estimated 12 million Catholics who were divided between an official, state-controlled church that didn't recognize papal authority, and an underground church that remained loyal to Rome through decades of persecution.
    


            Leo noted that on the feast day “in the churches and shrines in China and throughout the world, prayers have been raised to God as a sign of the solicitude and affection for Chinese Catholics and their communion with the universal church.”
    


            Speaking from his studio window during his noontime blessing, Leo prayed that Catholics in China and elsewhere “obtain the grace to be strong and joyful witnesses of the Gospel, even in the midst of trials, to always promote peace and harmony.”
    


Pope Francis took Benedict's unifying efforts further by approving a controversial deal in 2018 over bishop nominations. The details of the deal were never released, but it affords the state-controlled church a say in its church leaders, though Francis insisted he retained veto power over the ultimate choice.
    


            The deal has been criticized by some, especially on the Catholic right, for having caved to Beijing's demands and sold out the underground faithful in China. The Vatican has said it was the best deal it could get and it has been renewed periodically since then.
    


            Leo will have to decide whether to continue renewing the accord. There have been some apparent violations on the Beijing side with some unilateral appointments that occurred without papal consent. The issue came to a head just before the conclave that elected Leo pope, when the Chinese church proceeded with the preliminary election of two bishops, a step that comes before official consecration.
    


            Leo told the archbishop of Hong Kong, Cardinal Stephen Chow, that he had “visited China several times and got to know the Chinese culture and reality,” according to the Fides missionary news agency, citing comments Chow made in his diocesan weekly newsletter after the conclave.
    


            Chow added that he expected Leo would follow Francis' direction for the church in China. He said he had given Leo a small statue of Our Lady of Sheshan, a statue of the Madonna that is particularly venerated by Chinese faithful and is celebrated on the feast day, May 24.
    


            Chow, a Jesuit, said he had implored Leo “to not forget the church in China and the Chinese people,” according to the newsletter. “He nodded his head to indicate that he will not forget,” according to Fides.
    


            The Vatican has been working for years to try to improve relations with China that were officially severed over seven decades ago when the Communists came to power. Relations had long been stymied over China's insistence on its exclusive right to name bishops as a matter of national sovereignty, while the Vatican insisted on the pope's exclusive right to name the successors of the original Apostles.
    


            The 2018 deal was aimed at uniting the flock, regularizing the status of seven bishops who weren't recognized by Rome and thawing decades of estrangement between China and the Vatican.

PARIS (AP) — Marcel Ophuls, the Academy Award-winning filmmaker whose landmark 1969 documentary “The Sorrow and the Pity” shattered the comforting myth that most of France had resisted the Nazis during World War II — has died at 97.

The German-born filmmaker, who was the son of legendary filmmaker Max Ophuls, died Saturday at his home in southwest France of natural causes, his grandson Andreas-Benjamin Seyfert told The Hollywood Reporter.

Though Ophuls would later win an Oscar for “Hôtel Terminus” (1988), his searing portrait of Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, it was “The Sorrow and the Pity” that marked a turning point — not only in his career, but in how France confronted its past.

Deemed too provocative, too divisive, it was banned from French television for over a decade. French broadcast executives said it “destroyed the myths the French still need.” It would not air nationally until 1981. Simone Veil, Holocaust survivor and moral conscience of postwar France, refused to support it.

But for a younger generation in a country still recovering physically and psychologically from the aftermath of the atrocities, the movie was a revelation — an unflinching historical reckoning that challenged both national memory and national identity.

The myth it punctured had been carefully constructed by Charles de Gaulle, the wartime general who led Free French forces from exile and later became president. In the aftermath of France's liberation in 1944, de Gaulle promoted a version of events in which the French had resisted Nazi occupation as one people, united in dignity and defiance. Collaboration was portrayed as the work of a few traitors. The French Republic, he insisted, had never ceased to exist.




“The Sorrow and the Pity,” which was nominated for the 1972 Oscar for Best Documentary, told a different story: Filmed in stark black and white and stretching over four and a half hours, the documentary turned its lens on Clermont-Ferrand, a provincial town at the heart of France. Through long, unvarnished interviews with farmers, shopkeepers, teachers, collaborators, members of the French Resistance — even the town's former Nazi commander — Ophuls laid bare the moral ambiguities of life under occupation.

There was no narrator, no music, no guiding hand to shape the audience's emotions. Just people — speaking plainly, awkwardly, sometimes defensively. They remembered, justified and hesitated. And in those silences and contradictions, the film delivered its most devastating message: that France's wartime story was not one of widespread resistance, but of ordinary compromise — driven by fear, self-preservation, opportunism, and, at times, quiet complicity.

The film revealed how French police had aided in the deportation of Jews. How neighbors stayed silent. How teachers claimed not to recall missing colleagues. How many had simply gotten by. Resistance, “The Sorrow and the Pity” seemed to say, was the exception — not the rule.

It was, in effect, the cinematic undoing of de Gaulle's patriotic myth — that France had resisted as one, and that collaboration was the betrayal of a few. Ophuls showed instead a nation morally divided and unready to confront its own reflection.

Even beyond France, “The Sorrow and the Pity” became legendary. For cinephiles, its most famous cameo may be in Woody Allen's “Annie Hall”: Alvy Singer (Allen) drags his reluctant girlfriend to a screening, and, in the film's bittersweet coda, she takes her new boyfriend to see it too — a nod to the documentary's singular place in film history.

In a 2004 interview with The Guardian, Ophuls bristled at the charge that he had made the film to accuse. “It doesn't attempt to prosecute the French,” he said. “Who can say their nation would have behaved better in the same circumstances?”

Born in Frankfurt on Nov. 1, 1927, Marcel Ophuls was the son of legendary German-Jewish filmmaker Max Ophuls, director of “La Ronde,” “Letter from an Unknown Woman”, and “Lola Montès.” When Hitler came to power in 1933, the family fled Germany for France. In 1940, as Nazi troops approached Paris, they fled again — across the Pyrenees into Spain, and on to the United States.

Marcel became an American citizen and later served as a U.S. Army GI in occupied Japan. But it was his father's towering legacy that shaped his early path.

“I was born under the shadow of a genius,” Ophuls said in 2004. “I don't have an inferiority complex — I am inferior.”

He returned to France in the 1950s hoping to direct fiction, like his father. But after several poorly received features — including “Banana Peel” (1963), an Ernst Lubitsch-style caper starring Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jeanne Moreau — his path shifted. “I didn't choose to make documentaries,” he told The Guardian. “There was no vocation. Each one was an assignment.”

That reluctant pivot changed cinema. After “The Sorrow and the Pity,” Ophuls followed with “The Memory of Justice” (1976), a sweeping meditation on war crimes that examined Nuremberg but also drew uncomfortable parallels to atrocities in Algeria and Vietnam. In “Hôtel Terminus” (1988), he spent five years tracking the life of Klaus Barbie, the so-called “Butcher of Lyon,” exposing not just his Nazi crimes but the role Western governments played in protecting him after the war. The film won him his Academy Award for Best Documentary but, overwhelmed by its darkness, French media reported that he attempted suicide during production.

In “The Troubles We've Seen” (1994), he turned his camera on journalists covering the war in Bosnia, and on the media's uneasy relationship with suffering and spectacle.

Despite living in France for most of his life, he often felt like an outsider. “Most of them still think of me as a German Jew,” he said in 2004, “an obsessive German Jew who wants to bash France.”

He was a man of contradictions: a Jewish exile married to a German woman who had once belonged to the Hitler Youth; a French citizen never fully embraced; a filmmaker who adored Hollywood, but changed European cinema by telling truths others wouldn't.

He is survived by his wife, Régine, their three daughters, and three grandchildren.

The Democrats' 2028 podcast primary is well underway.

From Govs. Gavin Newsom of California, Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan to former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, potential presidential contenders are following the lead of President Donald Trump, who frequently went on podcasts appealing to younger men during his 2024 campaign. 

Liberal strategists acknowledge Trump showed that Democratic candidates need to master the podcast space, which is typically looser and more freewheeling than a press conference or a traditional media interview.

“The way that politicians communicate and need to be seen by their audience is changing,” said Liz Minnella, who fundraised for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and this year launched Connect Forward, a group to support liberal influencers. “I hate to give him credit, but he found a way to connect with people, talk to them like human beings in non-political speak.”

Newsom, long derided by conservatives as a San Francisco liberal, has welcomed conservatives onto his podcast and agreed with them on issues such as trans participation in women's sports. Beshear, a lower-profile Democrat in a red state, hosted his teenagers to teach him how to use the youth slang “skibidi.”

The likely 2028 contenders have produced many hours of content already. Here's a look at key moments and what we've learned about the field so far.

Launching “The Andy Beshear Podcast” earlier this year, the Kentucky governor now has hosted a donor, a former ambassador, businessmen he calls friends and U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who ran for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. 

He even brought on his two children to explain slang words high schoolers are using, asking them to explain to him how to use terms like “skibidi” to say something looks good, or “doing it for the plot” to say you'll be taking a risk on something despite a potentially bad outcome.

From his first episode, the 47-year-old politician outlines some rules and says the first is “be authentic, you be you, boo.” 

The governor did not respond to a request for comment on his strategy, but has mostly taken a position of dissecting and broadcasting opposition to Trump's policies, such as potential cuts to Medicaid and the use of the Signal messaging app by the president's national security team to discuss sensitive military operations.

In one of Beshear's most recent episodes earlier this month, his producer asks the governor a frequent listener's question: Will you run for president?

“If it were three years ago, this was something that we would have never thought about,” Beshear said, sitting beside his wife, Britainy. “But I'm committed to not leaving a broken country to my kids or anyone else's. Now, what that looks like going forward, I don't know. My job right now is to try to lift up as many leaders as possible all across the country that are hopefully focused on the right things with the right message to re-earn the faith of the American people.”

Whitmer recently appeared on “Pod Save America” for a shorter interview than other contenders have done on podcasts. Whitmer had received some backlash for sharing a hug with the president last month as he arrived in her home state, less than a month after she shielded her face from cameras during an Oval Office appearance alongside Trump.

Whitmer and Trump announced a new fighter jet mission at a National Guard base outside Detroit that is seen as a major economic driver for the area.

“This is a BFD,” she said on the podcast, referencing if not outright saying a profane phrase that starts with “big” and ends with “deal.” 

“It doesn't mean I've abandoned any of my values. It doesn't mean that I'm not going to stand my ground and fight where we have to, but this is one of those moments where as a public servant you're reminded your job is to put service above self and that's what it was all about.”

In February, California's governor launched “This is Gavin Newsom” as what he called a mechanism for talking “directly with people I disagree with, people I look up to, and you — the listeners.” 

Thus far, he's had a wide array of guests, including former Trump strategist Steve Bannon and conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, as well as Klobuchar and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' 2024 running mate. 

The conversations have mostly been chummy. Newsom — who has in recent weeks broken with California's legislature and faced liberal criticism for his positioning on trans issues, immigration and homelessness — has fielded backlash for giving a platform to some of his party's biggest critics.

Newsom has also drawn criticism for opposing the participation of trans athletes in women's sports.

“I think it's an issue of fairness, I completely agree with you on that,” Newsom told Kirk in his debut episode. “It is an issue of fairness — it's deeply unfair.”

The diverse guest list could be part of Newsom's attempt to self-brand as a centrist ahead of a possible 2028 run, hearing out conservative critics while trying to assume his party's mantle.

In March, the governor told HBO's Bill Maher that Democrats had developed a “toxic” brand and criticized some in the party who are unwilling to “have a conversation” with their opponents.

Buttigieg's appearance on Andrew Schulz's “Flagrant” podcast came months after the comedian sat down with Trump. 

During his three-hour sit-down with Schulz, Buttigieg sported a beard as he talked candidly about his personal life, describing his experiences serving in the military before he came out publicly as gay and raising his biracial children, even laughing along as Schulz and other hosts cracked jokes related to homosexuality or asked pointed questions about his personal life.

But mostly, Buttigieg — who spoke in Iowa earlier this month — discussed his time in politics and accused Trump of failing to deliver on economic promises from the 2024 campaign. 

“We have to be encountering people who don't think like us and don't view the world the way we do, both in order to actually, legitimately, become smarter and better and make better choices and have better positions, and just in order to persuade,” Buttigieg said.

They were just ‘playfighting.' That was French President Emmanuel Macron's explanation Monday for video images that showed show his wife, Brigitte, pushing her husband away with both hands on his face before they disembarked from their plane to start a tour of southeast Asia this weekend.

PARIS (AP) — They were just playfighting.

That was French President Emmanuel Macron ‘s explanation Monday for video images that showed his wife, Brigitte, pushing her husband away with both hands on his face before they disembarked from their plane to start a tour of Southeast Asia this weekend.

The moment quickly made headlines in France, with media trying to decipher the interaction that cameras spotted through the just-opened door of the plane. The headline of a story on the website of the daily Le Parisien newspaper asked: “Slap or ‘squabble'? The images of Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron disembarking in Vietnam trigger a lot of comment.”

Macron later told reporters that the couple — married since 2007 after meeting at the high school where he was a student and she was a teacher — were simply joking around.

“We are squabbling and, rather, joking with my wife,” he said, adding that the incident was being overblown into “a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe.”

In video taken by The Associated Press as the Macrons arrived in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Sunday, a uniformed man can be seen pulling open the plane door and revealing the president standing inside, dressed in a suit and talking to someone who wasn't visible. 

Brigitte Macron's arms — in red — were seen reaching out and pushing Macron away, with one hand covering his mouth and part of his nose while the other was on his jaw. The French leader recoiled, turning his head away. Then, apparently realizing that he was on camera, he broke into a smile and gave a little wave.




In subsequent images, Macron and his wife, wearing a red jacket, appeared at the top of the stairs. He offered an arm but she didn't take it. They walked down the carpeted stairs side by side.

The French leader argued that the images and reaction to them offered a cautionary tale about disinformation in the social media age, noting that in recent weeks, other videos had been used to circulate made-up stories about him.

“Everyone needs to calm down,” he said.

His office also downplayed the interaction.

“It was a moment where the president and his wife were decompressing one last time before the start of the trip by horsing around. It's a moment of complicity. It was all that was needed to give ammunition to the conspiracy theorists,” his office said.

Brigitte Macron was Brigitte Auzière, a married mother of three children, when they met at his high school. A teacher, she supervised the drama club where Emmanuel Macron, a literature lover, was a member. 

He moved to Paris for his last year of high school, but promised to marry Brigitte. She later moved to the French capital to join him and divorced before they finally married.

WAPPINGERS FALLS, N.Y. (AP) — As the World War II bomber Heaven Can Wait was hit by enemy fire off the Pacific island of New Guinea on March 11, 1944, the co-pilot managed a final salute to flyers in an adjacent plane before crashing into the water.

All 11 men aboard were killed. Their remains, deep below the vast sea, were designated as non-recoverable.

Yet four crew members' remains are beginning to return to their hometowns after a remarkable investigation by family members and a recovery mission involving elite Navy divers who descended 200 feet (61 meters) in a pressurized bell to reach the sea floor.

Staff Sgt. Eugene Darrigan, the radio operator was buried with military honors and community support on Saturday in his hometown of Wappingers Falls, New York, more than eight decades after leaving behind his wife and baby son. 

The bombardier, 2nd Lt. Thomas Kelly, was to be buried Monday in Livermore, California, where he grew up in a ranching family. The remains of the pilot, 1st Lt. Herbert Tennyson, and navigator, 2nd Lt. Donald Sheppick, will be interred in the coming months.

The ceremonies are happening 12 years after one of Kelly's relatives, Scott Althaus, set out to solve the mystery of where exactly the plane went down.

“I'm just so grateful,” he told The Associated Press. “It's been an impossible journey — just should never have been able to get to this day. And here we are, 81 years later.” 




The Army Air Forces plane nicknamed Heaven Can Wait was a B-24 with a cartoon pin-up angel painted on its nose and a crew of 11 on its final flight.

They were on a mission to bomb Japanese targets when the plane was shot down. Other flyers on the mission were not able to spot survivors.

Their wives, parents and siblings were of a generation that tended to be tight-lipped in their grief. But the men were sorely missed.

Sheppick, 26, and Tennyson, 24, each left behind pregnant wives who would sometimes write them two or three letters a day. Darrigan, 26, also was married, and had been able to attend his son's baptism while on leave. A photo shows him in uniform, smiling as he holds the boy.

Darrigan's wife, Florence, remarried but quietly held on to photos of her late husband, as well as a telegram informing her of his death.

Tennyson's wife, Jean, lived until age 96 and never remarried.

“She never stopped believing that he was going to come home,” said her grandson, Scott Jefferson.

As Memorial Day approached twelve years ago, Althaus asked his mother for names of relatives who died in World War II. 

Althaus, a political science and communications professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, became curious while researching World War II casualties for work. His mother gave him the name of her cousin Thomas Kelly, who was 21 years old when he was reported missing in action.

Althaus recalled that as a boy, he visited Kelly's memorial stone, which has a bomber engraved on it. He began reading up on the lost plane.

“It was a mystery that I discovered really mattered to my extended family,” he said.

With help from other relatives, he analyzed historical documents, photos and eyewitness recollections. They weighed sometimes conflicting accounts of where the plane went down. After a four-year investigation, Althaus wrote a report concluding that the bomber likely crashed off of Awar Point in what is now Papua New Guinea

The report was shared with Project Recover, a nonprofit committed to finding and repatriating missing American service members and a partner of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, or DPAA. A team from Project Recover, led by researchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, located the debris field in 2017 after searching nearly 10 square miles (27 square kilometers) of seafloor.

The DPAA launched its deepest ever underwater recovery mission in 2023.

A Navy dive team recovered dog tags, including Darrigan's partially corroded tag with his the name of his wife, Florence, as an emergency contact. Kelly's ring was recovered. The stone was gone, but the word BOMBARDIER was still legible.

And they recovered remains that underwent DNA testing. Last September, the military officially accounted for Darrigan, Kelly, Sheppick and Tennyson.

With seven men who were on the plane still unaccounted for, a future DPAA mission to the site is possible.

More than 200 people honored Darrigan on Saturday in Wappingers Falls, some waving flags from the sidewalk during the procession to the church, others saluting him at a graveside ceremony under cloudy skies.

“After 80 years, this great soldier has come home to rest,” Darrigan's great niece, Susan Pineiro, told mourners at his graveside.

Darrigan's son died in 2020, but his grandson Eric Schindler attended.

Darrigan's 85-year-old niece, Virginia Pineiro, solemnly accepted the folded flag. 

Kelly's remains arrived in the Bay Area on Friday. He was to be buried Monday at his family's cemetery plot, right by the marker with the bomber etched on it. A procession of Veterans of Foreign Wars motorcyclists will pass by Kelly's old home and high school before he is interred.

“I think it's very unlikely that Tom Kelly's memory is going to fade soon,” said Althaus, now a volunteer with Project Recover.

Sheppick will be buried in the months ahead near his parents in a cemetery in Coal Center, Pennsylvania. His niece, Deborah Wineland, said she thinks her late father, Sheppick's younger brother, would have wanted it that way. The son Sheppick never met died of cancer while in high school.

Tennyson will be interred on June 27 in Wichita, Kansas. He'll be buried beside his wife, Jean, who died in 2017, just months before the wreckage was located.

“I think because she never stopped believing that he was coming back to her, that it's only fitting she be proven right,” Jefferson said.

CHIMNEY ROCK VILLAGE, N.C. (AP) — The brightly colored sign along the S-curve mountain road beckons visitors to the Gemstone Mine, the “#1 ATTRACTION IN CHIMNEY ROCK VILLAGE!” But another sign, on the shop's mud-splattered front door, tells a different story.

“We will be closed Thursday 9-26-2024 due to impending weather,” it reads. It promised to reopen the next day at noon, weather permitting.

That impending weather was the remnants of Hurricane Helene. And that reopening still hasn't arrived.

The storm smashed into the North Carolina mountains last September, killing more than 100 people and causing an estimated $60 billion in damage. Chimney Rock, a hamlet of about 140 named for the 535-million-year-old geological wonder that underpins its tourism industry, was hit particularly hard.

Eight months later, the mine, like most of the surviving businesses on the village's quaint Main Street, is still an open construction site. A flashing sign at the guard shack on the town line warns: “ROAD CLOSED. LOCAL TRAFFIC ONLY.”

Village Mayor Peter O'Leary had optimistically predicted that downtown would open in time for Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start of the summer tourist season. He now realizes that was too ambitious.

“We had set that date as a target, early on,” he said, sitting in the still stripped main room of his Bubba O'Leary's General Store. “But I always try to remind people, you don't always hit the target. Anybody that's shot a gun or bow and arrow knows, you don't always hit the target.”




The Broad River — which gave the restaurants and inns lining its banks their marketable water views — left its course, carving away foundations and sweeping away the bridge to Chimney Rock State Park. O'Leary said about a third of the town's businesses were “totally destroyed.”

Several are gone for good.

At the north end of town, all that remains of Bayou Billy's Chimney Rock Country Fair amusement park is a pile of twisted metal, tattered awnings and jumbled train cars. A peeling, cracked yellow carousel horse that owner Bill Robeson's own children once rode balances precariously on a debris pile, its mouth agape to the sky.

At 71, Robeson — who also lost a two-story building where he sold popcorn, pizza and souvenir tin cups — said he doesn't have the heart to rebuild.

“We made the dream come true and everything,” said Robeson, who's been coming to Chimney Rock since he was in diapers. “I hate I had to leave like it was. But, you know, life is short. You just can't ponder over it. You've got to keep going, you know?”

At the other end of town, the Carter Lodge boasted “BALCONIES OVERLOOKING RIVER.” Much of the back side of the 19-room hotel now dangles in midair, an angry red-brown gash in the soil that once supported it.

Barely a month before Helene, Linda Carter made the last loan payments on repairs from a 100-year flood in 1996. Contractors estimate it will cost $2.6 million to rebuild.

So, the widow said she's waiting to see how much the federal government will offer her to let the lot become a flood-mitigation zone.

“I just don't have it in me,” said Carter, who lived in the hotel. “I'm 74. I don't want to die and leave my children in debt. I also don't want to go through the pain of rebuilding.”

But others, like Matt Banz, still think Chimney Rock is worth the risk of future heartache.

The Florida native fell in love with a fudge shop here during a vacation more than 30 years ago. Today, he and his family own four businesses in town, including the gem mine and the RiverWatch Bar & Grill.

“The day after the storm, we didn't even question whether we were going to rebuild,” Banz said, with workers rebuilding the riverfront deck on new cement footers. “We knew right away that we weren't going to let go.”

O'Leary, Banz and others say federal relief has been slow. But volunteers have filled the gaps.

Down the street, Amish workers from Pennsylvania pieced together a mold before pouring a new reinforced foundation for the Broad River Inn, among the oldest businesses in town. The river undermined the back end and obliterated the neighboring miniature golf course.

“We definitely could not have done what we're doing without them, that is for certain,” inn co-owner Kristen Sottile said. “They have brought so much willpower, hope, as well as many other things to our community.”

The Amish are working in concert with Spokes of Hope, a Christian nonprofit formed in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which hit the Carolinas in September 2018.

Jonathan Graef and his siblings bought the Best View Inn in late 2023 and were halfway through renovations when Helene struck. They've been flooded twice since, but the new rafters and framing the Amish workers constructed have held.

“It's really trying to kick us down,” said Graef, whose property borders what is left of the Bayou Billy's park. “But our spirits are high, our hopes are high and nothing's going to stop us from opening this place.”

Throughout town, the ring of hammers and saws mingles with the sizzle of welding and the rumble of debris-removal trucks.

Workers lay sewer lines. A temporary steel bridge to the state park — replacing the ornate stone and concrete span that washed out — should be ready soon, O'Leary said.

“In a normal year, they easily have 400,000 visitors that come to the park,” he said. “That's really the draw that brings people here.”

One recent evening, Rose Senehi walked down Main Street, stopping to peer into shop windows to see how much progress had been made.

Twenty-two years ago, the novelist stopped in town to buy an ice cream cone. As she licked, she crossed a small bridge, climbed a rickety staircase to a small house, looked around “and saw that mountain.”

“Within an hour I signed the contract and bought it. Out of the blue,” she said, her eyes lighting up. “Never been to this town. But I knew THIS is what I wanted.”

The bridge is gone. So is that ice cream shop. But Senehi said there's more to this place than stores and treats.

“There's something about this area that, it's just compelling. The mountains. The green. It's just beautiful,” she said. “It'll definitely come back. And it won't be the same; it'll be better.”

O'Leary said he thinks some Main Street businesses will be open sometime this summer. The council is looking for village-owned properties that can be leased or sold to business owners.

“I can see progress on all fronts,” said O'Leary, who came for a park job 35 years ago and never left. But he cautions that recovery will be slow.

“We don't want everybody to come at the same time, but we do want people to visit and be patient with us,” he said. “This is a long rebuild. But I think it's going to be worth it.”

HONG KONG (AP) — U.S. futures jumped Monday and Asian shares mostly fell after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would delay a threatened 50% tariff on goods from the European Union until July 9. 

Trump announced the decision after a call Sunday with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, who said she “wants to get down to serious negotiations,” according to the U.S. president's retelling.

Last week, Trump said on social media that trade talks with the European Union “were going nowhere” and that “straight 50%” tariffs could go into effect on June 1. 

The future for the S&P 500 gained 1% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.8%.

In Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 climbed 0.9% to 37,510.71, while the Kospi in Seoul picked up 1.4% to 2,627.09.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.2% to 23,330.21 and the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.1% to 3,343.86.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was nearly unchanged at 8,360.50.

Other regional markets were mostly lower. 

On Friday, U.S. stocks fell as traders weighed whether Trump's latest threats were just negotiating tactics.

The S&P 500 lost 0.7% to 5,802.82 to close out its worst week  in the last seven. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.6% to 41,603.07, and the Nasdaq composite sank 1% to 18,737.21.

Apple dropped 3% and was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 after Trump said he's been pushing Apple CEO Tim Cook to move production of iPhones  to the United States. He warned a tariff “of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” if it doesn't. 




Trump later clarified his post to say that all smart phones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June.

“It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn't be fair.”

Trump has been criticizing companies individually when he's frustrated with how they're acting because of his tariffs and because of the uncertainty his trade war  has created. He earlier told Walmart it should “eat the tariffs,” along with China, after the retailer said it would likely have to raise prices to cover the increased cost of imports. 

Deckers Outdoor, the company behind the Hoka and Uggs brands, became one of the latest companies to say all the uncertainty around the economy  means it won't offer financial forecasts for the full upcoming year.

Its stock shed 19.9%, even though the company reported a stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected. 

Ross Stores fell 9.8% after it pulled its financial forecasts for the full year, citing how more than half the goods it sells originate in China.

On the winning side of Wall Street was Intuit, which rose 8.1% after the company behind TurboTax and Credit Karma reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. 

Stocks in the nuclear industry also rallied after Trump signed executive orders to speed up nuclear licensing decisions, among other measures meant to charge up the industry. Oklo, which is developing fast fission power plants, jumped 23%.

Trump's latest tariff threats stirred up Wall Street after it had recovered most of the losses it had earlier taken because of the trade war. The S&P 500 dropped roughly 20% below its record  at one point last month, when worries were at their height about whether Trump's stiff tariffs would cause a global recession. The index then climbed back within 3% of its all-time high  after Trump paused his tariffs on many countries, most notably China. 

In other trading early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 22 cents to $61.75 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 21 cents to $64.42 per barrel.

The U.S. dollar advanced to 142.60 Japanese yen from 142.48 yen. The euro edged higher, to $1.1412 from $1.1367.

Kīlauea Volcano in Hawaii experienced dramatic lava fountaining over the weekend, with eruptions reaching 1,000 feet.

Kīlauea Volcano – located along the southeastern shore of Hawaii Island – experienced ""lava fountaining"" that reached at least 1,000 feet high over the weekend. 

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) describes Kīlauea as one of the world's most active volcanoes. It has been erupting intermittently since Dec. 23, 2024, within the summit caldera in Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park. 

The 23rd episode of precursory activity began late last week with ""low-level spattering and flames."" According to Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park, small lava fountains and lava overflows from the north vent started around 11:30 a.m. Saturday.

""Sustained fountaining expected any time through the weekend,"" Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park Service wrote. 

The USGS reports that Kīlauea ""is in a unique phase of activity in Halemaʻumaʻu, with numerous episodes of dual lava fountains since the eruption began.""

""Two eruptive vents are located in the southwest part of the caldera, referred to as the north and south vent, and they have been intermittently active, producing new lava flows over parts of Halemaʻumaʻu crater surface,"" according to the USGS. 

As of 5:20 p.m. local time on Sunday, the south vent had lava fountains 230 feet high, while the north vent had lava fountains 1,000 feet high, according to Hawaii News Now.

USGS livestreams of the eruption site showed the lava fountains dropping in height and later stopping. The vents were still glowing and lava was still visibile on the crater floor. 

The volcano's last ""fountaining phase"" extended for about 10 hours on May 16, according to the USGS. 

Kīlauea experienced other recent fountaining phases this month on May 11, May 6 and May 2, lasting eight hours, 4.5 hours and eight hours, respectively.

During the ongoing eruption, the USGS reported that pressure building beneath the surface caused an inflationary tilt prior to a lava fountaining episode. 

As pressure within the magma is released when lava fountaining begins, a switch to a deflationary tilt occurs. That pattern of inflation and deflation with every recent lava fountain episode ""creates a saw-tooth pattern in ground tilt records over the past several months,"" according to the USGS, though the government agency reports that the summit has shown little net change in pressurization since the eruption began on Dec. 23, 2024.

The NFL owners voted 22-10 to ban the Tush Push, but it needed 24 votes to go through. Colin Cowherd says that the NFL owners got it wrong due to the danger the play presents and how ugly it is for the NFL. 

NFL players will be allowed to compete in the Olympics for the Team USA flag football team when the Summer Games hit Los Angeles in 2028.

Darrell Doucette III is already on the U.S. men's national team as the team's quarterback. The United States sat on top of the world flag football rankings last year.

It is because of that success that Doucette said that he hoped he and his teammates would receive a shot to compete for a spot on Team USA with the influx of professional football players set to try out as well.

""The flag guys deserve their opportunity,"" Doucette told The Washington Post in a recent interview. ""That's all we want. We felt like we worked hard to get the sport to where it's at, and then when the NFL guys spoke about it, it was like we were getting kicked to the side. I felt like I was the guy who could speak out for my peers, for my brothers that's been working hard to get to this level, for us not to be forgotten.""

Doucette added that he believed the team is good enough as it is to win gold in Los Angeles.

SHEDEUR SANDERS SHARES THEORY ABOUT '99% OF HATRED' HE RECEIVES

""This is a sport that we've played for a long time, and we feel like we are the best at it and we don't need other guys,"" he told the outlet. ""But we all have one goal in mind, and that's to represent our country. We're definitely open to all competition. If those guys come in and ball out and they're better than us, hats off to them. Go win that gold medal for our country.""

The men's national team has won the world championship five consecutive times.

NFL owners unanimously approved players' participation in flag football during their meeting last week.

Doucette already ruffled feathers last year when he said he was better than Patrick Mahomes at the sport because of his ""IQ of the game.""

""At the end of the day, I feel like I'm better than Patrick Mahomes because of my IQ of the game. I know he's right now the best in the league, I know he's more accurate, I know he has all these intangibles – but when it comes to flag football, I feel like I know more than him,"" he told TMZ Sports last year.

Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss President Donald Trump's Middle East trip and and his executive order to help homeless veterans.

This Memorial Day, many Americans will gather for barbecues, enjoy a long weekend, or mark the start of summer. But amid the festivities, one phrase you won't—or shouldn't—hear is ""Happy Memorial Day."" Unlike Veterans Day which celebrates service members past and present, Memorial Day is a solemn occasion, a time to honor the American service members who made the ultimate sacrifice. To wish someone a ""happy"" Memorial Day completely misses the purpose of the day.

Memorial Day, established after the Civil War and formalized as a federal holiday in 1971, is dedicated to those who died in military service. Each flag at half-staff, each wreath laid at Arlington National Cemetery, represents lives cut short—sons, daughters, parents, and friends who never returned home. Their sacrifice secured the freedoms we cherish. 

That's why the words we choose on this day matter. Memorial Day actually isn't about celebrating service members. It isn't even a time to advocate for greater benefits for our veterans. It's a day to reflect on the sacrifice of those few brave men and women in uniform who gave their lives for our country. Accordingly, we ought to choose words that promote the true purpose of the day. 

TRUMP TO BUILD NATIONAL CENTER FOR HOMELESS VETERANS WITH FUNDS PREVIOUSLY SPENT ON HOUSING FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS

Few learned this lesson quicker than ""Squad"" members, Rep. Ilhan Omar and former Rep. Cori Bush who received well-deserved backlash for their tone-deaf Memorial Day messages last year. Both members of congress posted messages that appeared to confuse Memorial Day with Veterans Day. Omar wrote, ""On #MemorialDay, we honor the heroic men and women who served our country,"" advocating for veterans' access to mental health services, housing, and jobs. Bush echoed similar rhetoric, stating, ""This Memorial Day and every day, we honor our veterans in St. Louis,"" followed by a call for universal healthcare. The misguided messages earned swift rebuke from Americans, including many veterans, around the country. 

The social media outrage served an important purpose. The backlash was bigger than an opportunity to score political points against the Left. Americans on both sides of the aisle came together to defend the sacredness of the one day in the year completely dedicated to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. So, the social shame attached to misunderstanding the purpose of Memorial Day is not only justified – it's necessary. In a political era marked by so much frivolity, Americans—especially those in elected leadership—ought to choose words that reflect the gravity of this day.

To be clear, this isn't about political correctness. It's not about virtue signaling. And it certainly isn't about promulgating more of the noxious ""language policing"" that happens so frequently on Ivy League campuses. It's simply about protecting the solemnity of the day.

Memorial Day is not a festive holiday, but rather one deserving of reverence. It's a day for pause. Simply put, today is about showing proper respect to those who made it possible to enjoy freedom today.

It is not difficult to honor Memorial Day with the solemnity it deserves. Simply taking a moment to reflect, to attend a local remembrance ceremony, or to learn the story of a fallen service member can have a meaningful impact. Visit a cemetery, join moments of silence, or offer support to Gold Star families. Organizations across the country hold events—large and small—to commemorate the fallen. Local veterans' groups lay wreaths, play taps, and read names aloud. Schools sometimes host programs to teach younger generations what the day is truly about. These rituals are not political or performative; they are acts of collective memory, meant to keep the stories of our nation's heroes alive.

The sacrifices of over one million Americans who died while serving in the armed forces demand a language of respect and gratitude. Of course, we can and should celebrate those who currently serve in uniform on other days throughout the year, but Memorial Day demands humility and respect for our fallen heroes. Their sacrifice deserves nothing less.

The Fire Watch Executive Director and Navy veteran Nick Howland discusses the impact of the nonprofit dedicated to ending veteran suicide by providing free suicide intervention training. (Fox News Digital) 

A Florida-based nonprofit is tackling veteran suicide by connecting community members and holding fast that the crisis American vets are facing is preventable.

The Fire Watch operates on three premises: that suicide is preventable, that timely connection to resources can save lives, and that communities must play an active role in prevention. 

""It takes the community to get involved in suicide prevention,"" Executive Director Nick Howland told Fox News Digital.

After seeing impressive results, The Fire Watch is hoping to take its regional organization nationwide with an approach that tackles veteran suicide differently with treatment-focused efforts and local engagement.

At the heart of The Fire Watch's strategy is the ""Watch Stander"" program, modeled after CPR training. 

In a concise 30-to-45-minute session, volunteers learn to recognize warning signs, ask direct questions, validate the veterans' experience, and expedite referral to services—summarized by the acronym SAVE. 

""Like CPR doesn't train you to be a paramedic, our training doesn't turn you into a clinician,"" Howland said. ""It trains you to notice the change and sound the alarm for help.""

Each Watch Stander leaves with a wallet card, wristband, and sticker as reminders of critical red flags—expressions of self-harm, substance abuse, reckless behavior, or giving away possessions—and the simple steps to get someone to help.

The nonprofit works in tandem with the state's veteran affairs offices and connects veterans with counseling services.

Since its inception in Northeast Florida, The Fire Watch has tracked dramatic reductions in veteran suicides. 

After recording 81 veteran deaths by suicide in 2019, Howland set an audacious goal: cut that number by at least 25% for three consecutive years.

As of the latest data released May 1, veteran suicides in the region fell to 61 in 2023—25% below the 2019 baseline for the fourth straight year. 

Statewide, veteran suicides are down 5%, and in areas where The Fire Watch has a foothold (Northeast Florida, South Florida, Tampa Bay, and Escambia County), the decline has been 12%, compared to just 2% elsewhere in the Sunshine State.

""Where we're building our network of community members who care, who get veterans to the help they need, veteran suicidality is decreasing,"" he said. ""It's remarkable.""

For volunteers like Ryan Haczynski, the program's impact is deeply personal. After losing a Vietnam veteran friend to suicide in late 2022, Haczynski searched for a way to honor his memory and prevent further loss. 

""I didn't recognize the signs,"" he reflected, telling Fox News Digital that his friend had even asked him to be the executor of his will just weeks before his death. 

Following the vet's suicide, Haczynski's online search led him into Watch Stander and Ambassador trainings, where he has since certified others and even helped arrange a proper military funeral for his friend.

Haczynski now uses every community interaction to check in on veterans, validate their experiences, and point them to Fire Watch's free 24/7 crisis resources.

""We want to give back, we want to help, especially people who have done so much [for our country] to go and serve us,"" he said.

‘Duck Dynasty' star Willie Robertson and his wife Korie spoke with Fox News Digital about why telling his father Phil Robertson's story was so important and why God plays a key role in their new film.

""Duck Dynasty"" star Phil Robertson has died at the age of 79, his family announced on Sunday.

Robertson, famous for founding the Duck Commander hunting company that became the focus of his A&E show, had previously battled multiple health conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. The TV personality's daughter-in-law Korie Robertson announced his death on Instagram Sunday night.

""We celebrate today that our father, husband, and grandfather, Phil Robertson, is now with the Lord,"" Korie Robertson's post read. 

""He reminded us often of the words of Paul, ‘you do not grieve like those who have no hope. For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him,"" the post continued.

Korie Robertson added that the family will have a private service but will share details ""about a public celebration of his life.""

""Thank you for the love and prayers of so many whose lives have been impacted by his life saved by grace, his bold faith, and by his desire to tell everyone who would listen the Good News of Jesus,"" she added. ""We are grateful for his life on earth and will continue the legacy of love for God and love for others until we see him again.""

Years before becoming famous on television, Robertson played football at Louisana Tech. He was a starting quarterback while NFL legend Terry Bradshaw was his backup. 

Robertson later founded Duck Commander in 1972. The ""Duck Dynasty"" television show premiered 40 years later, in 2012, before it ended in 2017.

During a December episode of ""Unashamed with the Robertson Family,"" Robertson's diagnosis with Alzheimer's disease was announced. His son Willie Robertson later spoke with Fox News Digital by phone, saying that Phil was ""battling a lot of different things right now.""

""He's got a blood disorder, and then he's got the mental issues that could be early [on-set] Alzheimer's … and probably some ministrokes because of his blood,"" Willie explained. ""And so, it could be some stroke stuff happening, that has happened. So, we're still checking on all that.""

""But then he also has a back issue. He's fractured his back and that's where the pain's at. So, he's kind of battling many different things at the same time.""

In April, Robertson's family members opened up about the patriarch's health condition again, which appeared grim.

""The No. 1 question I get everywhere I go [is], 'How's your dad doing?' Now, I'm just giving the blunt truth. I say, ‘Not good,'"" son Jase Robertson said.

President Donald Trump criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin during a press gaggle on Sunday, saying he ""doesn't like"" Putin's recent actions.

Russia and Ukraine on Sunday swapped hundreds of prisoners just hours after Moscow launched one of the largest aerial assaults of the more than three-year war between the two countries. 

The prisoner swap was the third and final part of a major exchange, marking a rare moment of cooperation. 

Russia's Defense Ministry said both sides exchanged more than 300 soldiers. This followed the release of 307 combatants and civilians each on Saturday, and 390 on Friday — the largest total swap of the war so far.

""303 Ukrainian defenders are home,"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X, confirming the exchange.

He said the troops returning to Ukraine were members of the Armed Forces, the National Guard, the State Border Guard Service, and the State Special Transport Service.

In talks held earlier this month in Istanbul — the first face-to-face meeting between the warring sides in recent peace talks — Kyiv and Moscow agreed to swap 1,000 prisoners of war and civilian detainees each. The exchange has been the only tangible outcome from the talks.

The exchange came just hours after Russia launched a massive drone-and-missile attack targeting the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and other regions, killing at least 12 people – including three children – and injuring dozens more. 

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported that air defense forces were working in the capital against enemy drones. Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv military administration, said Kharkiv and its suburbs were also under attack by drones.

Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force, told The Associated Press that Russia used a total of 69 missiles of various types and 298 drones – the largest single aerial attack of the war. 

Russia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said its air defenses shot down 110 Ukrainian drones overnight.

The latest round of violence came as President Donald Trump told reporters on Saturday he was ""not happy"" with Russia's large-scale strike against Ukraine. 

Speaking at Morristown Municipal Airport in New Jersey, the president accused Putin of ""killing a lot of people"" in the attack.

""I'm not happy with what Putin is doing,"" Trump said. ""He's killing a lot of people, and I don't know what the hell happened to Putin."" 

Later expanding on his comments in a Truth Social Post, Trump said Putin had ""gone absolutely CRAZY!""

""I've always said that [Putin] wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that's proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!"" the social media post read. But the president also criticized Zelenskyy.

""Likewise, President Zelenskyy is doing his Country no favors by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don't like it, and it better stop,"" Trump wrote, concluding: ""This is a War that would never have started if I were President. This is Zelenskyy's, Putin's, and Biden's War, not ‘Trump's,' I am only helping to put out the big and ugly fires, that have been started through Gross Incompetence and Hatred.""

President Donald Trump is open to the Senate making “fairly significant” changes to his “big, beautiful bill” despite Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) warning that an overhaul risks unraveling the delicate compromise reached in the House.

“I want the Senate and the senators to make the changes they want. It will go back to the House, and we'll see if we can get them. In some cases, the changes may be something I'd agree with, to be honest,” the president told reporters in Morristown, New Jersey, on Sunday evening.

“I think they are going to have changes,” Trump added. “Some will be minor, some will be fairly significant.”

The House passed the bill by a single vote on Thursday, a victory the speaker followed up by urging the Senate to avoid making large changes to the text. Yet Senate Republicans have already indicated they will make their mark on the legislation, which sweeps Trump's tax priorities together with money for the border and defense.

It took a coordinated effort from Trump and Johnson to secure GOP votes in the House, with the deal reached representing a compromise between fiscal hawks and Republican centrists. Trump had to visit the Capitol on Tuesday and later hosted the Freedom Caucus at the White House, while Johnson spoke with Senate Republicans “from the heart about how difficult” it was to cobble together a majority coalition.

The speaker has repeatedly likened the negotiations to “crossing over the Grand Canyon on a piece of dental floss,” adding in an interview with Punchbowl News, “My hope and my encouragement to them is – fine-tune this product as little as possible.”

SENATE PROMISES TO UPEND TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL' HOUSE COMPROMISE

Some of the House language that Senate Republicans want to review includes Medicaid reforms, an accelerated rollback of Biden-era green energy tax credits, and the sale of spectrum licenses.

Thune declined to specify a timeline for the upper chamber to pass its version of the bill, though he and other party leaders have set July 4, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's requested date, as an aspirational deadline.

President Donald Trump expressed his strong disapproval of Russia's recent large-scale strikes on Ukraine and directed his ire at Russian President Vladimir Putin, who he said he's “not happy” with.

Trump spoke to reporters shortly before boarding Air Force One on Sunday and responded to the significant escalation by Putin in the Ukraine war, which has included two large-scale missile and drone attacks on Kyiv, Ukraine's capital city, just this weekend.

Asked to give an update as Russia and Ukraine seek an elusive ceasefire agreement in a conflict that has stretched over three years, Trump made clear his frustration with the Russian president's continued aggression, saying, “I don't know what the hell happened to Putin.”

“I'm not happy with what Putin is doing. He's killing a lot of people, and I don't know what the hell happened to Putin. I've known him a long time. Always gotten along with him. But he's sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don't like it at all. We're in the middle of talking, and he's shooting rockets into Kyiv and other cities,” Trump said.

Those Russian strikes came amid a prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia, which Trump suggested last week could “lead to something big.”

But the fighting has only continued, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky indicated earlier Sunday that he has already introduced three new sanctions packages against Russia. 

While U.S. officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio have been hesitant about pursuing sanctions against Russia due to them possibly derailing peace talks, Trump said on Sunday that he would “absolutely” consider them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The San Jose way: Mayor Matt Mahan isn't afraid to ruffle feathers","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3416789/matt-mahan-san-jose-mayor-gavin-newsom-homeless-crisis/","Mon, 26 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

While San Francisco hogs headlines on homelessness and crime, its southern neighbor, San Jose, has been quietly making bold moves — and seeing substantial results. Frustrated by years of progressive policies, voters elected Mayor Matt Mahan, who campaigned on a platform of reform. Since taking office, he has streamlined regulatory processes, strengthened law enforcement, and leveraged Silicon Valley's innovative spirit to tackle the city's most pressing challenges. The Washington Examiner spent several days on the ground in San Jose to gain deeper insight into the city's evolving landscape. Part 1 of this series, The San Jose Way, takes a look at the leadership of the Democratic mayor.

SAN JOSE, California — San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan isn't interested in ideology. He's into results, even if that makes him a few high-profile enemies along the way. 

He's stood his ground against Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) on the homelessness crisis, advocated tough-on-crime measures that have ticked off members of his own party, and instituted what is believed to be one of the first performance models that ties pay raises for senior staff and council members to measurable results.

In a wide-ranging interview with the Washington Examiner from his 18th-floor office in downtown San Jose, Mahan broke down his plans for the city, including its goals, obstacles, and successes. Some of his proposals have been slam dunks, while others, such as arresting unsheltered homeless people if they refuse help three times in 18 months and remain on the streets, have been met with criticism. Mahan has refused to back down, maintaining that making difficult decisions is necessary to steer San Jose in the right direction.

“I think government is the way we solve complicated societal problems at scale,” Mahan said. “But, that requires you to actually, if you want to be a problem solver, be willing to set aside ideology and party and partisanship and all of this very narrow parochial thinking and actually be willing to look at data from first principles and experiment.”

Mahan, who was part of two Silicon Valley startups, said it's a view not widely embraced in the government.

“Typically, we punish people for making mistakes. If one city, though, is going to figure out how to be more experimental and iterative, it's going to be San Jose here in Silicon Valley,” he said. “It's a startup culture. I don't mind taking a lot of hits publicly in the press and from other elected officials and from what I consider to be essentially a political establishment in California.” 

Depending on who you ask, Mahan is seen as either a hard-working, no-nonsense mayor who is acutely aware and tackling the city's problems head-on or the devil. 

David Dickens, a homeless man who lives in a broken-down RV with a blue tarp over it in Columbus Park, views Mahan as the devil. 

“I hate that guy,” he told the Washington Examiner. 

Dickens is one of approximately 50 people who call the park home and think Mahan's solutions for the city are out of touch. 

“The mayor's like [President Donald] Trump,” Dickens said. “He don't get the struggle. He's a rich white guy trying to arrest everyone out here.”

Mahan, a Democrat, has ruffled more than a few feathers for saying homeless people should be arrested if they are living on the streets and have refused shelter three times. It's a rare approach for an elected official in a liberal Bay Area city, but one that has gained support. 

“Mayor Mahan's governance style and approach adopts a more independent streak from the status quo in California politics,” Jeff Le, managing principal at 100 Mile Strategies and former deputy Cabinet secretary to former Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, told the Washington Examiner.

Rising rates of homelessness in Silicon Valley, one of the wealthiest areas in the nation, have frustrated residents and left them open to proposals that would have once seemed too right-leaning in the dark blue metropolis. 

Years ago, the approximately 200 homeless residents of Columbus Park would park their RVs and trailers on the streets, fields, and basketball courts. They slowly turned a community area into a public safety hazard. The Federal Aviation Administration threatened to withhold millions of dollars in funding if the encampment wasn't cleared because it sits under the flight path of San Jose Mineta International Airport. The city cleared it in 2022, but since then, many have returned. 

Not only is the park an eyesore, but when the Washington Examiner visited it earlier this month, there were sounds and sights of human misery everywhere. There was feces on the sidewalks, open-air drug use, and people walking around like zombies. There was a man riding a toddler's big wheel with a 40-ounce malt liquor bottle in one hand, and a woman wearing just a torn T-shirt was cursing up a storm.

Dickens, who is originally from Los Angeles, admitted “no one should live like this” but added, “Where we gunna go?”

Mahan has insisted he's not trying to punish people for being homeless. He wants to enforce trespassing laws when interim housing has been repeatedly offered and refused by someone living on the streets. 

Mahan was born in San Francisco and raised by working-class parents. His mother was a Catholic school teacher, and his father was a letter carrier. His parents, whom he described as “young and poor at the time,” eventually moved to the small farming town of Watsonville. 

His interest in politics was piqued at an early age when he saw the challenges of crime, unemployment, and poor education in his hometown. When it was time for high school, Mahan was offered a full work-study scholarship for low-income students at Bellarmine College Prep in San Jose. He had a four-hour daily commute, joined the wrestling team, and worked on the grounds crew in the summers to help pay for his education. 

Mahan was accepted to Harvard University, where he was an honors student and president of the student body. After graduating, he spent a year in Bolivia building irrigation systems for farmers. He eventually returned to San Jose to teach English and history to middle school children. 

Mahan then joined Causes, a startup and early Facebook app. He worked his way up from director of business development to CEO. Causes, which allowed people to raise awareness and funds for nonprofit organizations, grew to 190 million users in more than 150 countries. He also co-founded Brigade, the world's first voter network platform that allowed people to discuss matters and advocate their elected officials. 

Since then, Mahan has been on a government kick. He has served on neighborhood and civic boards and ran for City Council in 2020, focusing his campaign on improving the quality of life by holding City Hall accountable. He cleared his calendar and spent nine months on the campaign trail, knocking on more than 10,000 doors.

When Mahan stepped into the new world of local politics, he was “flabbergasted” and “incredibly disillusioned” by how little was getting done. 

“My first six months on Council were pretty miserable,” he said. “I felt lonely, and I just felt like, ‘Am I having an impact?'”

Mahan said the disconnect was the most striking. 

“There is plenty of wealth here,” he said. “We should have the resources to make meaningful progress. But then I get to City Hall, and people are literally giving 20-minute speeches on the dais. Political speeches. They don't even offer solutions. They're often demonizing people and coming up with these random boogeymen like it's the fault of tech or developers or it's the media.”

It was then that Mahan found himself at a crossroads. 

“I thought, there's two options here. I can either double down and try to fundamentally change this system and make us far more focused and accountable and really push through, or I can wrap up this term and go back to the public sector,” he said.

Mahan decided to stay and run for mayor. He won his first term in 2022 with 51.3% of the vote after residents pushed to move the mayoral election to align with the presidential one to increase voter turnout. Two years later, Mahan won a four-year term, securing 87% of the vote. 

Since he was elected, Mahan has needled Newsom multiple times. It began when Mahan threw his support behind Proposition 36, a ballot measure that strengthened penalties for people who have repeatedly been convicted of shoplifting or caught using and dealing hard drugs such as fentanyl. Newsom, an early front-runner for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, did not support Proposition 36.

Instead of falling in line with other mayors to support the governor, Mahan spoke out, calling the state's response to addiction, mental illness, and repeat low-level criminal activity “fairly lax and almost avoidant.”

Mahan is currently tangled in an escalating war of words with Santa Clara County officials over homelessness and has refused to back down. During his time in office, Mahan has also whittled down a list of San Jose's 41 “priorities” to four: homeless, crime, blight, and housing affordability.

A publicity blitz for CNN anchor Jake Tapper's new book became an apology tour last week after he was repeatedly confronted about his previous denials about former President Joe Biden's health.

During the 2024 campaign and earlier, Tapper frequently defended Biden's mental acuity, criticizing the suggestion that the president's verbal slip-ups and lighter public schedule were signs he was ailing. Less than a year later, just months after the Democrats' election loss, he announced the publication of a book, Original Sin, detailing the extent of Biden's mental decline and alleging a White House cover-up.

Criticism of Tapper peaked over the past week when he was confronted during a series of media appearances. Conservative pundit Megyn Kelly took the most confrontational approach, criticizing Tapper for his perceived inability to cover Biden's mental decline as it was happening. But he and co-author Alex Thompson received similar scrutiny from left-leaning commentators.

“Time and time again, when issues came up, you seem to be running cover for the president,” Kelly said on her radio program, arguing Tapper was capable of reporting the story given his sourcing in the White House.

“With the Joe Biden White House, I had [no connections], but you did. You did. … There was no effort, none, to get to the bottom of this. And now you write this book like, ‘There was a cover-up,'” Kelly said. “It could only ever work if you allowed it.”

“There is a way of pressing a man like that on the actual infirmities to bring it home to him and to the audience, and you didn't do that,” she added, referring to Tapper's handling of Biden.

“That's correct, I didn't, and like I said, I feel tremendous humility about my coverage,” Tapper responded, defending himself by adding he had asked some tough questions about foreign policy. “I wish I did cover the issues of age and acuity, but I wish I had covered them much more.”

The conversation intensified into a direct admission from the CNN anchor that conservative media were “right” to focus on the question of Biden's fitness despite Tapper's prior dismissals.

“Alex and I are here to say that conservative media was right and conservative media was correct and that there should be a lot of soul-searching — not just among me, but among the legacy media to begin with, all of us — for how this was covered or not covered sufficiently, 100%,” Tapper told Kelly. “I'm not here to defend coverage that I've already acknowledged I wish I could do differently.”

One instance that drew renewed scrutiny was a 2020 interview in which Tapper accused Lara Trump, the daughter-in-law of President Donald Trump, of mocking Biden's stutter when she voiced concerns about his cognitive ability. When she tried explaining, Tapper interrupted and shut down the interview.

Imagine the arrogance of Joe Biden's wife and handlers believing they could hide the unhideable.Why did they even try the coverup? Because they knew the legacy media would go along with it.Shame on them, especially Jake Tapper, the biggest liar of them all. pic.twitter.com/z8zuqYPdTh

During his appearance on Kelly's show, Tapper said he called Lara Trump “months ago” and apologized.

“After we did the research for this book and I realized how bad his acuity issues were, I called Lara Trump and I said, ‘You were right,'” he said.

The CNN anchor said the conversation “went well” and that she clarified she didn't intend to mock Biden's stutter.

Criticism of Tapper wasn't limited to Republican figures. On the Daily Show, Jon Stewart blasted Tapper and CNN for withholding the information until the book came out.

“Don't news people have to tell you what they know when they find it out?” Stewart asked rhetorically. “Isn't that the difference between news and a secret? ‘You won't believe what we found out' — no, that's why I watch breaking news.”

“How f***ing weird it is that the news is selling you a book about news they should have told you was news a year ago, for free,” he added.

Stewart also slammed Tapper for labeling the handling of Biden a “cover-up,” given how widespread suspicions were about the president's health.

“I understand the excitement over an insidious Democratic cover-up about Joe Biden's mental decline,” he said. “The thing is, though, it was a terrible cover-up, because we all f***ing knew.”

“There was no cover-up – poll after poll showed vast majorities of the public thought Biden was too old and too out of it to run again,” Stewart said, adding later, “The cover-up doesn't work when everyone knows you're lying.”

During the publicity tour, Tapper and Thompson were put in an uncomfortable position when news broke that Biden was diagnosed with prostate cancer and that it had spread to his bones. Many left-wing figures criticized the two for the book's release, saying it was inappropriately timed. Tapper explained his reasoning in an interview with PBS, taking on a sympathetic tone that had grown familiar during his tour.

JAKE TAPPER'S ‘BOMBSHELL' BOOK ON BIDEN'S DECLINE IS A LAUGHABLE ATTEMPT TO REWRITE HISTORY

“Yes, look, obviously our hearts go out to the Bidens,” he said, after Thompson explained his rationale. “I don't think the book is mean. I don't think that we're unsympathetic to all of the horrible things he has endured throughout his life.”

“We have a whole chapter in it about everything he's gone through and the remarkable ability that Joe Biden has shown to get up and keep going on, despite so many horrible twists of fate that have been thrown at him. But, that said, the American people deserve transparency when it comes to the health care of their leaders, whether Donald Trump or Joe Biden or whoever comes after Trump,” Tapper added.

Last week was a hard week for Fairfax County Public Schools. 

On Tuesday, Defending Education filed a civil rights complaint with the US Department of Education against Fairfax County Public Schools with a damning analysis of the school's recent history of racial discrimination. 

Then, on Wednesday, the office of Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares reported that he had informed FCPS that it is in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for its discrimination against Asian-Americans at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. On the same day, the US Department of Justice initiated a probe into the matter.

Then, on Thursday, the US Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights launched its own Title VI investigation.

The local source of the controversy is the county's One Fairfax policy, an illogical fusion of the healthy American principle of equal opportunity,  cultural Marxism, good intentions to help the weak, and policies proven to harm them, all blended together in a sauce of feel-good buzzwords and vague platitudes with no clear metrics, deliverables, or restrictions. The policy has spread its tendrils throughout the county, from FCPS's sprawling Office of Equity that has no defined deliverables, to the parks that racially discriminate in their hiring practices, to the office of Commonwealth's Attorney Steve Descano, whose release of violent criminals and refusal to prosecute a child sex felon both stem from One Fairfax. 

Besides the fact that the policy jeopardizes $168M in federal funding and costs undisclosed sums in fighting lawsuits, it has several fatal defects.

First, it's self-contradictory. The policy defines “race” (a category with no biological validity) as “a socially constructed category” and prohibits “all forms of discrimination under Federal and State law.” It then goes blithely on, however, to treat this artificial construct as if it were real, by dividing students into racial categories—implicitly here, but explicitly in the FCPS documents that taxonomize children into racial and ethnic tribes like animals at a zoo—and then treats the segregated groups differently. It advocates fairness but then turns Martin Luther King, Jr.'s dream of a color-blind society on its head by judging on the basis of skin color.

Second, in pursuing its noble goal of equal opportunity, it pretends that systemic barriers to such opportunity exist even when they don't. The alleged purpose of its discrimination is to remove “racial and social inequities” by removing “institutional and structural barriers” to opportunity — those “systemic barriers that are blocking some of our students from thriving.”

What barriers and which students? Slavery and segregation for African Americans? Laws prohibiting Hispanics from studying STEM? A school policy that no Asian student may appear in a Shakespeare play? None of these things exist. So what can they be talking about?

“Systemic” here, like “institutional” and “structural” is intentionally obfuscatory in order to expand particular problems into sweeping generalizations. As with all part-to-whole logical fallacies, this one reduces individuals to mere expressions of a group whose members share a particular characteristic. It is reductive and dehumanizing, and leads to exactly the kind of racial profiling that the proponents of this nonsense claim they oppose.

This is not to deny that individual students often do need extra help for any number of reasons, or that a necessary part of being a good teacher is discerning and addressing just those needs. What this policy does, however, is invite schools to prejudge the needs and abilities of certain students based on whether or not they belong to an “underserved community”—code in most cases for “not Caucasian or Asian” — and then treating members of those groups differently.

Third, its goal of equal outcomes, which Superintendent Michelle Reid says she has made her life's work to “ensure” for “each and every student,” would destroy all excellence, which FCPS claims to be one of its goals, along with equity and opportunity. How can Reid assure “equal outcomes” for “each and every student” unless she actively restrains some students—including the very “underserved” students whom FCPS claims to want to help—from becoming the best they can be? “To excel” means “to be superior to.” Reid wants the impossible world where outcomes are equal and yet everyone is also superior to everyone else. This makes no sense. How can educators who don't think and speak logically teach students to do so?

VIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL FINDS FAIRFAX SCHOOL DISCRIMINATED AGAINST ASIAN STUDENTS

Better advice comes from Margarat Thatcher: “Let our children grow tall and some taller than others if they have the ability in them to do so . . . because we must build a society in which each citizen can develop his full potential.” Excellence grows in the garden of liberty; it dies in the garden of “equal outcomes.” 

One Fairfax, like the road to hell, may be paved with good intentions, but as a parent pointed out over two years ago, “I've noticed in my kids that since the county has pivoted toward this equity that they have lost sight of their core mission, which is to educate these kids.” Wise leaders would have learned by now that results in education do far more to help at-risk students than all the empty, harmful rhetoric of One Fairfax and its ilk.

A growing number of climate activists are taking up a fresh idea as a rallying cry and a legal strategy: Nature, in all its manifestations, is alive.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

In Bogotá, Colombia, where I am researching a unique Andean ecosystem, I've encountered the phrase “Agua es vida” everywhere. From a city employee explaining why water rationing is necessary; from our nanny, who tells me that she would rather have days without electricity than without running water; from a man speaking about the pollution that mining precious metals for cellphone chips is causing on the Vaupés River. Water is life. The phrase has also been used as a rallying cry. Those organizing in opposition to pipelines in South Dakota, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Rhode Island carry the dictum on their lips. I am tempted to dismiss it as cliché, an environmental platitude, yet there is something enchanting about these words, a kind of spell they cast, which gently tugs me toward some blunt, yet hard to grasp, truth.

When Angela Auambari, a Muisca woman I was recently interviewing, said the phrase again, I asked her what she meant by it. “You can put water in tubes to send it into our homes, and yet that water will always have a life of its own,” she told me. I explained that in grade school I was taught that a tree is alive, a bird is alive, but a lake is not. “You and I are women; we give life,” Angela countered. She gestured to the open window above us, through which the laughter of my 1-year-old daughter traveled. “The lakes up in the hills, the rivers that connect them to us, they, too, give life, and for this reason, they are alive. Agua es vida.” I understood what she meant. I even agreed with her. Still, what separates living, breathing beings from inanimate matter remains frustratingly set in my mind. Stones, no; seagulls, yes. The entire scientific tradition, from Descartes down to Linnaeus and Darwin, is built upon this division.

Nevertheless, as climate change superheats the planet, things we have long been taught to think of as inert are springing into action: ice sheets splintering, flood-prone rivers devouring mountain towns, wildfires consuming Paradise. Those who live on the front lines of these eruptions don't have the luxury of encountering the Earth as anything other than animate. In his new book, Is a River Alive?, Robert Macfarlane, one of the most significant nature writers of his generation, attempts to unlearn this persistent and damaging distinction. By exploring four extraordinary bodies of water and the people and laws aiming to protect them, Macfarlane examines a question whose time has come, whether we like it or not.

The current environmental catastrophe is a problem not only of missed emissions targets but also of the human imagination, as the writer Amitav Ghosh has argued. “Our plight is a consequence of the ways in which certain classes of humans––a small minority, in fact––have actively muted others by representing them as brutes, as creatures whose presence on earth is solely material,” Ghosh argues in his 2022 book, The Nutmeg's Curse: Parables for a Planet in Crisis. Human stories have historically refused to recognize that these others—both human others, and also things like gold, glaciers, bacteria, the jet stream; the list goes on and on—shape us just as much as we shape them. Ours is the language that makes extraction possible. People need new narratives, Ghosh insists, that foreground nonhuman actors in order to slow this planetary cataclysm. (The time for averting it has long since passed.)

Read: As the climate changes, so does fiction

Some view the solution through a legal lens. If we can recognize these “brutes” as beings to whom basic rights are granted––think: the river's right to flow unimpeded and unpolluted––our relationship to nature will evolve. This kind of thinking has led to the rise of a growing global phenomenon known as the Rights of Nature movement. Ecuador, Panama, New Zealand, Bolivia, India, and even some cities in the United States have––thanks, in most cases, to pressure from local Indigenous groups––enshrined the rights of nature in their governing documents. These rights can serve as potent legal tools in the battle to stop practices such as fracking, mining, deforestation, and the damming of rivers.

Early on in his book, Macfarlane recalls telling his son the title of his project. The son's response is plain: “Well, duh, that's going to be a short book then, Dad, because the answer is yes!” Of course a river is alive. The pair have recently visited springs near their home. “I cannot quite understand why we are going,” Macfarlane writes, “but I hold hands with Will and together we cross the threshold between the hot light of the fields and the wood's cool.” There they discover that the water has all but disappeared after months of record-breaking heat. Through the book, father and son will return regularly to these springs, bearing witness to their changes. This punctuated in-placeness is what makes the three longer journeys Macfarlane undertakes––to an Andean cloud forest; a wounded river basin in Chennai, India; and an undamned river in uppermost Canada––land effectively. To learn to recognize the aliveness of what we have been taught to think of as inert matter demands, above all else, time and attention. To see a glacier retreat, we need to watch its movements for years; to know how a river wanders, we must walk its banks during both flood and drought.

Most of the children in my life stare awestruck at the natural world. Trees speak, mountains ponder, hummingbirds have secret missions all their own. With time, this enchantment usually passes. Robin Wall Kimmerer, a Potawatomi botanist and author, argues that this is, in part, a linguistic problem. In English, we use the impersonal pronoun it to speak of animals, plants, bodies of water, geographical features. We say “a river that flows” as opposed to “a river who flows.” As I read Is a River Alive?, I found myself underlining sentence after sentence as verbs animated the world. “Leaves nod in the rain.” “Mist hangs in scarves.” “The light of the rising sun sets the world ringing like a singing bowl.” Macfarlane's prose offers a glorious invitation to return to one's child-mind and its inherent wonder. Agua es vida.

And yet this deep sense of enchantment and play is tempered throughout by grief—not only grief at the ways in which humans have fundamentally perverted so many of Earth's most magnificent rivers, but also grief of a more personal nature. The researcher seeking rare fungi at the Los Cedros cloud forest, in Ecuador, has just lost her father; the young man fighting to restore India's Adyar River was beaten by his own; Wayne, Macfarlane's traveling companion down the Mutehekau Shipu, in Quebec, dreams of encountering a dear friend who recently died. In the face of these losses, each person travels to a water body, dwelling in and alongside them for weeks or years. Each is, in turn, overtaken by powers much larger than the self. And I won't say they are healed exactly, but their time spent on the rivers seems to lighten their individual burdens. “Perhaps the body knows what the mind cannot,” Macfarlane writes. “Days on the water have produced in me the intensifying feeling of somehow growing together with the river: not thinking with it, but being thought by it.” Then Wayne cautions, “This kind of merging doesn't happen as an epiphany; it's a chronic rather than acute process.”

Read: What it would take to see the world completely differently

The Scottish poet Kathleen Jamie has critiqued Macfarlane's earlier work as falling into an environmental tradition that she shorthands as the “Lone Enraptured Male.” In these stories, as she frames it, white men sally forth into the wilderness, where they have some kind of conversion experience, then return to normal society enlightened and changed. Some of that is certainly at work here, especially in the book's final journey, a two-week whitewater-kayaking trip. But for the most part, Macfarlane doesn't dwell too long on his own experience, opting instead to listen to those who live alongside the water bodies that he is, admittedly, just visiting.

For instance, Macfarlane is accompanied at Los Cedros by a wide-ranging cast of characters: the mycologist in mourning, who discovers a new species of fungus that provides further protection to the forest; an expatriate who has camped there for years to keep the place from falling prey to illegal attempts at mining; a legal scholar “trying to generate and accelerate the ripples of Rights of Nature thinking worldwide.” A few years prior to Macfarlane's sojourn, foreign companies purchased the right to potentially mine at Los Cedros. But when they began circling with chain saws, de-limbers, and log loaders, locals testified to the impact such actions would have on the river that runs deep into the forest. The judges who ruled that mining copper and gold would violate the river's rights—they also join Macfarlane at Los Cedros. Extending out from this water body is a rich web of human allies, each of whom plays a key role in its protection. Macfarlane makes this web visible.

Unlearning our obsession with Cartesian thinking demands humility, a willingness to let the lines blur between us and that great plane of existence that we have learned to label as “it.” Is a River Alive? illustrates what resistance to extraction can look like on the ground, and also what might be awakened in us when we begin to live with rivers, recognizing them as co-creators of our past, our present, and—more and more—our future.

A poem

I remember the heat. A dry, suffocating torrent. The blazing, burning sun baking the tarmac. No clouds, no trees, just a furnace of hate. I feel the hate. I remember the heat.

I remember the dust. Filling our nostrils, caking our mouths. It rained from the sky and rose from the ground. With every turn of the tire and step of the foot there was dust. Dust, everywhere dust.

I remember the heaviness. The helmet pressing on my head, the armor squeezing my chest. I remember the weight of life and death at the end of our guns.

I remember the fear. Aboard the eight-wheeled coffin, surrounded by a thin shield of steel. The fear of the streets. The fear of the smiling people. The fear of no return.

I remember their faces. So young and so stoic. Why couldn't they have been old men? Not the young. Not the young who would never grow old. I remember their faces. I cannot forget their faces.

I remember the loss. The searing pain of the unfilled boots, the solemn speeches, the lowered ramp and the flag-draped coffin. A hole so deep in my heart only God could fill it.

I remember the letters. Written again, and again, and again, and again. When will the letters stop? Why were they so young and stoic and brave and caring? What will I say this time?

I remember the sorrow. The sound of “Taps” on the hillside covered with the graves of heroes. A tearful widow, a weeping child, a folded flag. I remember the sorrow so clearly.

Their shadows grow dim and I fight to remember. Their stories grow old and I must fight to remember.

They gave everything. The least I can do is remember. I remember. I must remember. I must always remember.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A distinct set of six institutions and traditions make the country hard to subjugate to an authoritarian's will.

Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.

The first half-year of Donald Trump's second term is not even over, and the portents of democratic erosion are already stark. The president has moved to consolidate power, purging civil servants deemed disloyal, directing federal officials to flout adverse court rulings, and ordering the Justice Department to investigate political rivals. These moves have alarmed many Americans, who see their country's democracy as fundamentally in danger.

Regrettably, their concerns aren't baseless. Even a long-established democracy can be undone—sometimes by a fairly elected leader. And yet, there is reason still to be hopeful; America is more resilient than many may fear. Unlike countries where democracy has recently unraveled, the United States displays at least six exceptional traits that are protecting it from the Trump-led assault: a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a constitutional system that makes executive preferences hard to entrench, a diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a uniquely speech-protective legal tradition. Some of these features may carry trade-offs in ordinary times, but they offer a clear advantage when democracy is under threat. If a Trump-like figure tried to purge nonloyalists, defy the courts, or use the government to punish rivals in places such as Poland, Brazil, and India, a popular resistance would be far less empowered.

To start, America's network of public-interest advocacy groups is both larger and more resilient than those in countries where democracy has declined. Around the world, many governments impose outright bans on certain foreign-funded or “extremist” groups, and subject other organizations to convoluted registration rules. Some of these requirements may be mere nuisances in strong democracies. But when a would-be autocrat takes office, his power comes preloaded with the bureaucratic tools he needs to silence his critics.

In contrast, the strength of American civil society has a long history. The French philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville marveled at early-19th-century America's penchant for civic activity, calling liberty of association “a necessary guarantee” against tyranny. That tradition endures: The United States stands out for its high rates of citizen engagement and dense network of nonprofit organizations. The American Civil Liberties Union, Democracy Forward, and Republicans for the Rule of Law are just a few prominent examples of institutions now challenging the administration in the courts of law and public opinion. And thanks in part to a line of Supreme Court cases dating back to at least 1886 and continuing through the Court's controversial recent decisions in Citizens United v. FEC and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, these organizations, like for-profit corporations, enjoy robust speech and associational rights.

Adrienne LaFrance: A ticking clock on American freedom

When these groups or other parties sue the government, U.S. courts have exceptional formal power to check a president's agenda. Some national courts elsewhere lack a Marbury v. Madison–style power to conclusively strike down unconstitutional acts of the legislature or executive. And even where that power exists, judicial review in much of Europe and Latin America is typically centralized in a single constitutional court. Aspiring autocrats therefore need only capture a single court to effectively remove judicial constraints. In some instances, they swiftly change the composition of the court by adjusting age limits or creating additional seats. Courts sometimes resist, as with the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, which, in 2015 and 2016, struck down measures the right-wing populist party had enacted to curb the court's power. But as the tribunal's judges reached the end of their nine-year terms, they were replaced by party loyalists, who then approved the president's reforms. Globally, scenarios like that aren't uncommon. Moreover, because most judges serve fixed, not life, terms, some who decide a government case may consider their later career prospects in weighing how to vote. The result: Constitutional courts are rarely far out of step with the party in power.

The United States' court system is built differently: Hundreds of lower-court federal judges with lifetime tenure have both the formal power and the political will to invalidate executive actions nationwide. As such, even judges appointed by Republican presidents, including by Trump himself, commonly rule against him. Trump-appointed judges have recently prevented deportations under the Alien Enemies Act and halted the forced leave of 2,700 USAID employees. Judges appointed by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush have blocked Trump executive orders rescinding birthright citizenship. And all three of the Trump-appointed Supreme Court justices joined the full Court in upholding a lower court's order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from an El Salvadoran prison.

Of course, courts can only do so much to enforce their rulings—especially against a defiant president. But even when courts can't compel compliance directly, their judgments can matter. By declaring that the government has crossed a constitutional line, courts arm advocacy groups with a powerful tool: a “fire alarm” that can give dissenters the political capital they need to push out court-defying leaders.

Another source of American institutional resilience is its aversion to big or rapid legal change. In normal times, this can stifle progress, but in unusual times, it can be a bulwark against backsliding. In some other countries, leaders have cemented their illiberal agendas through sweeping legislative changes and constitutional overhauls. Viktor Orbán and his parliamentary supermajority rewrote Hungary's constitution; Hugo Chávez began his presidency by pushing through an entirely new Venezuelan constitution; and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan transformed Turkey's parliamentary system into a presidential one through constitutional amendment. These moves fundamentally restructured their respective political orders.

But U.S. constitutional reform is exceptionally difficult. And—in part because of the Senate's filibuster rule—even ordinary legislation faces high hurdles, particularly for many of the sweeping changes Trump envisions. That's why he's thus far attempted to implement his key initiatives primarily through more than 150 executive orders, rather than via legislation or constitutional amendment. This means that many of those policies can be reversed almost as easily as they were enacted. Indeed, America's aversion to legal change allowed President Joe Biden in 2021 to swiftly undo many Trump orders, on issues such as the Muslim travel ban, protecting federal workers, and energy policy. A future president could do the same.

Next, America's media are independent and diversified. And at least since the Progressive era, they have repeatedly sounded the alarm on alleged government abuses. In many other places, silencing the press has proved too easy. In Vladimir Putin's Russia, media capture was swift: Starting in 2001, Putin's allies simply bought critical outlets and converted them to tools of state propaganda. In contrast, America's media organizations are so numerous and varied—even after years of consolidation and closures in the industry—that capturing them all would be nearly impossible.

Federalism is the separation of powers between regional and national governments. It exists in fewer than 15 percent of countries today. Perhaps not coincidentally, those countries are on average freer and more democratic than the world at large. This system has always been quite popular in America—at least with the party out of power nationally. In the U.S., state governments can facilitate, or frustrate, immigration enforcement; state courts and prosecutors retain control of the bulk of criminal justice; and citizens may retain rights under state law even when their federal rights are diminished. But in most countries, where essentially all government authority—law enforcement, taxation, and constitutional—is concentrated in one national government, leaders find it far easier to run roughshod over the institutions meant to check executive power.

Listen: Autocracy in America

Finally, U.S. constitutional law and courts maintain a unique commitment to free speech. In places around the world—the Philippines, India, and Germany—governments have used libel laws to suppress criticism of national leaders and other dissent. But under America's speaker-friendly defamation law, public officials face substantial hurdles in suing or prosecuting critics into silence. Sarah Palin, Devin Nunes, and Donald Trump himself each recently learned this the hard way. And while many critics of the president may despair of recent settlements by ABC News and others, the defamation laws that protect such institutions are still in place and regularly enforced.

To be clear, none of these observations either encourages complacency or diminishes the harm already caused by Trump's authoritarian moves. Many of the more vulnerable in American society—immigrants and civil servants, for instance—are especially and justifiably afraid for the future. The threats to American democracy and the rule of law are real, and they should be taken seriously.

And yet, America's 237-year-old Constitution, private organizations, and public institutions are far better positioned than their foreign counterparts under similar threat. Many of these exceptional features of American society not only make our system easier to defend—they are also a big part of why it's so worth defending.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","How to Hide a Constitutional Crisis","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/05/legalistic-noncompliance/682927/","Mon, 26 May 2025 11:42:33 GMT","

The executive branch is relying on the language of the law as cover to claim that it is complying with court orders when in fact it is not.

America seems to be waiting for a clear indication that the country is in a constitutional crisis. Perhaps President Donald Trump will say, “I am defying a court order, and good luck trying to do anything about it.” But short of that, America's constitutional crisis was always going to be a bit subtler—and that subtler crisis is already here. The administration is already flouting court orders. It's just that, rather than admitting so, executive-branch officials are saying one thing but doing another.

We have spent the past few months surveying the second Trump administration's practice regarding court orders and reviewed dozens of cases. We observed a clear pattern: The administration uses the language of the law as cover to claim that it is complying with court orders when in fact it is not. We call this “legalistic noncompliance,” a term intended to capture how the administration has deployed an array of specious legal arguments to conceal what is actually pervasive defiance of judicial oversight. It is a powerful strategy, as it obscures the substance of what the administration is doing with the soothing language of the law.

Although the country is not yet six months into the second Trump administration, already many examples of the phenomenon have emerged. Consider some of the arguments that have come up in the litigation over the Alien Enemies Act, which involves the president's attempt to designate certain Venezuelan nationals as “alien enemies” and imprison them in El Salvador with little judicial process. At the initial hearing in the first case challenging the AEA designation, the district court ordered the administration to turn around any planes that had departed for El Salvador. The judge told the government that any people on a plane “that is going to take off or is in the air”  must “be returned to the United States. However that's accomplished, whether turning around a plane or not [dis]embarking anyone on the plane.” The court also directed the government not to remove any additional people from the U.S. under the AEA proclamation. The government followed neither order. Instead, it landed at least two planes in El Salvador and transferredtransferred its involuntary passengers to a mega prison.

The government nonetheless insisted that it had complied with the court's orders. The government first argued that the judge's directive to “not remove” anyone else pursuant to the AEA declaration merely prohibited the government from taking people from within the borders of the United States to anywhere outside of those borders. Because the planes had already left U.S. airspace at the time of the order, they were not “removing” anyone. That argument relied on a technical, legal parsing of what it means to “remove” someone. It was also utterly baseless. In various immigration and migration matters, to remove someone means to take them to another country where they are then allowed to enter. But more fundamentally, the theory totally ignored that the judge had directly said to turn the planes around, and his emphasis on the importance of the United States not relinquishing custody or control of people to El Salvador.

In the course of the same proceeding, the government put forward several other weak legal arguments. It maintained, for example, that the district court abruptly revoked its earlier direction to turn any planes around, because the court did not specifically repeat that direction in the written order it issued after ruling orally. The government argued several times that the court's written order “controls,” using language that sounds like law. But here, too, the government's legal analysis was nonsense. The district court's written order incorporated, by reference, the terms of the earlier hearing. The government gave no other reason to think the district court had done a 180.

There is also the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man mistakenly deported to El Salvador because of an administrative error. In that case, the district court ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. In and out of court, the administration has insisted that it has no control over someone who is in the custody of a foreign sovereign. This argument, too, is presented in the trappings of law, invoking concepts such as custody and sovereignty. But applied to the facts, it makes little sense. Trump has admitted that he could get Abrego Garcia back with a mere phone call to President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, who is holding American deportees not simply as a foreign sovereign but pursuant to an arrangement with the United States.

The administration's practice of legalistic noncompliance has extended well beyond the high-profile AEA litigation. In the case challenging the administration's freeze on funds designated for the United States Agency for International Development, the government implausibly asserted that it had complied with the court's order halting the freeze even though, after the order, it canceled all but 500 of the more than 6,000 USAID contracts. The administration asserted that, in mere weeks' time, it had canceled all of the contracts through a process permitted by the court's order—an individualized, one-by-one analysis of every single contract that somehow determined whether each arrangement was performing.

The administration took a similar tack in the litigation over the future of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. After a district court ordered the government to halt its stop-work orders to CFPB employees and its mass terminations at the agency, the government nevertheless sent dismissal notices to more than 1,000 CFPB employees. The government claimed that it did so not pursuant to the policy blocked by the court. Rather, it said, it had done as the court would have had it—individually assessing whether each of the employees should be retained while also analyzing whether the CFPB could perform its statutory functions without certain employees.

Adam Serwer: The constitutional crisis is here

Some may understandably view the government's practice of legalistic noncompliance as preferable to a world of outright noncompliance—that is, where the executive branch explicitly asserts the power not to comply with court orders. After all, with legalistic noncompliance, the government at least frames its arguments in the language of the law and claims that it is trying, in good faith, to comply.

Legalistic noncompliance is still quite concerning. For one thing, it lowers the public salience of noncompliance. The overwhelming majority of the public views noncompliance as a rubicon that should not be crossed. If the administration were to openly assert the power not to comply with court orders, that would likely provoke significant public opposition and political pushback. Legalistic noncompliance, by contrast, allows the government to pursue noncompliance but without many of its attendant costs.

Legalistic noncompliance can look a lot like lying—the government insisting that it is obeying an order when it's simply not. But it's more than that. By advancing outlandish arguments in such a wide range of cases, and to a judiciary controlled by a conservative Supreme Court, the administration is hoping to wear down the courts through sheer force of will. And it's banking on the fact that, in some cases, those courts will assist the government's efforts to weaken judicial oversight of its actions.

In this respect, consider that although legalistic noncompliance avoids signaling to American citizens that they need to be concerned about compliance, it sends a different message to judges and executive-branch officials. The judges assessing the administration's arguments, as well as the officials making them, can see that the administration is not complying with court orders, and with no valid reason. That dynamic, in turn, could lay the groundwork for outright noncompliance. It could also produce something we call “legalized noncompliance”—where courts, fearful of outright noncompliance, issue rules that allow judges to say the administration is complying with court orders when, in reality, the administration is doing little or nothing to carry out a court's ruling.

Some indications that the Supreme Court has already legalized partial noncompliance have emerged. The Court has, for example, made it harder to challenge a number of the administration's actions, which reduces the odds of an unfavorable court ruling that might result in explicit noncompliance. The Supreme Court has also adopted legal standards that give courts and executive-branch officials considerable wiggle room within which to maneuver, and specifically to insist that the executive branch is complying with a court order even though it is not doing that at all. In the Abrego Garcia case, for example, the Supreme Court told the lower court that it could direct the government to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return, but questioned whether the court could order the government to “effectuate” it. The government has seized on that distinction in continuing to fight Abrego Garcia's release.

At the same time, the president's dwindling support, coupled with continued public focus on the AEA litigation and Abrego Garcia's case in particular, may make it easier for courts to push the administration to comply with their orders not just with words but with actions as well.

In an encouraging sign, a district court in Massachusetts acted swiftly this past week when lawyers alleged that the federal government was on the brink of violating an order prohibiting it from removing people to third countries (i.e., to countries other than those designated in removal proceedings) with little process. (The government had put a Burmese national and a Venezuelan national, among others, on a plane to South Sudan, a country under threat of renewed civil war.) After hearing from the lawyers, the judge directed the government to maintain custody and control over the individuals so that they could not be transferred, possibly irrevocably, to a foreign sovereign. The judge also made plain that “The Department's actions in this case are unquestionably violative of this court's order.” And the court required the government to give the men notice and what could amount to weeks of additional process to assert claims for relief.

As a strategy, legalistic noncompliance has force only when each case is viewed in isolation and not subject to public scrutiny. But if courts and the public start to recognize this pattern, it could—and should—lose its power.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

﻿When it comes to our health, maybe we should be testing and diagnosing less.

by  Dylan Scott

Patients in the 21st century are pretty lucky. Medical science and technology have advanced so much that we can diagnose many thousands of distinct conditions, and we can even take genetic tests that scour our DNA for signs of a disease that may not materialize for decades — offering us a peek into our own future. 

And with these advances, we are being diagnosed more and more. The number of people diagnosed with chronic health conditions and mental health disorders is at an all-time high — at least partly, most experts agree, because we have simply catalogued more diseases to catch. 

Yet we are also increasingly anxious, anxious about our health — even anxious that we're too anxious about our health. Our ability now to understand our bodies and put a name on what's wrong with them does not always provide comfort; instead, it can create new fears and impose new constraints on us. Some health care leaders, including Donald Trump's health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., argue that we are becoming over-medicalized — too ready to take a pill for something, just for the sake of taking something. 

The reality is nuanced because medicine is, to put it mildly, complicated. But we should in fact be careful about doling out diagnoses, says Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan, an Irish neurologist and the author of a new book, The Age of Diagnosis: How Our Obsession With Medical Labels Is Making Us Sicker.

In her book, O'Sullivan argues that our eagerness to diagnose, preemptively screen, and otherwise push these new tools to their limits is creating problems that deserve to be taken more seriously. She describes mutually reinforcing trends — the patient's insistence on certainty and the doctor's desire to avoid being blamed for missing something — that are driving clinical practice toward overdiagnosis. The phenomenon is even leading to more instances of doctors diagnosing certain cancers by 50 percent or more, due to the availability of new imaging tech that can detect even minuscule traces of abnormal cells. 

Overdiagnosis can cause real harm. And so O'Sullivan advocates for “slow medicine,” in which doctors and patients take time to develop a relationship, monitor symptoms, and take a great deal of care before naming a condition — an approach that may sound quaint in an era of rapid-testing but something she says is actually more in tune with the reality that diagnosis is partly an art. 

“Most diagnoses come with a huge amount of uncertainty. That covers asthma, diabetes, cancer, autism. Diagnosis is a clinical skill,” she told me in a recent interview. “Now, the difficulty, I think, with modern medicine is a lot of people don't understand that and that they feel that the test — the blood test or the brain scan — makes the diagnosis, when actually a diagnosis is made on understanding the story in the context of the tests that are done.”

There is a tension here. Slowing down could, at least in theory, risk missing an aggressive disease early at the most crucial time — when it can still be treated. And in the United States, simply getting a doctor's appointment can be more challenging than it should be.

Each individual case is unique, O'Sullivan acknowledges, which is why a relationship with your own primary care doctor is so important. But she argues that, on the whole, doctors have erred too far in the other direction, toward diagnosing conditions too quickly and too confidently and creating a different set of problems for patients. During our conversation, we spoke about how to balance our tremendous new technological abilities with a more measured approach to clinical practice and how she would respond to critics who argue her advice would lead to people's health problems being missed. 

Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

First, let's clarify something basic. What do you mean by overdiagnosis? How do you define it?

I think of overdiagnosis as measuring the point at which a medical diagnosis ceases to be useful. A diagnosis may be right or it may be wrong, but it isn't always beneficial in a certain situation. Overdiagnosis is trying to ask when a diagnosis is genuinely a useful way of conceptualizing someone's difficulties, and when it is not.

The first chapter is about Huntington's disease. Why did you start there? 

There's a genetic test available for Huntington's disease. If you happen to have the gene for Huntington's disease, you are destined to get Huntington's if you live long enough. If you have the genetic test, you can find out ahead of time that you have that at some point in your future. 

I needed people to understand the power of a diagnosis to make you sick even when you actually don't have much physically wrong with you. I tell the story of a patient named Valentina, who didn't have the gene but believed that she did because of her family history. Because of her strong belief that she had the gene, she developed all the symptoms. 

When we take on a medical label, when we are told that we are sick in some way, we inadvertently search ourselves for the symptoms and signs of the label that we've been given. Our bodies are very noisy engines. There's all sorts of things to notice if you are given reason to notice.

The Huntington's disease community is in this incredible situation where they have the opportunity to find out they have a diagnosis 20 years before the disease starts. And in most countries, only 10 percent to 20 percent of people actually have the genetic test that will advise them of the disease. They do that because they are a community who has given a great deal of thought to what it's like to live with the label of an impending disease.

Once you discover you have a positive test, it completely changes your relationship with your body. It changes how you think about your health. And once you know, you can't unknow. I spoke to loads of people with Huntington's, and they all said the same thing: that living with the hope that you are negative and that everything is okay is a way better life than living with the knowledge that you're positive and waiting for the disease to start.

One of the most interesting themes in the book is this idea that people want and have come to expect concrete answers from modern medicine. Black or white: You have a disease or you don't. But you cover chronic Lyme disease, long COVID, and autism, these conditions where the boundaries are fuzzier. What problems does that create? 

Most diagnoses come with a huge amount of uncertainty. That covers asthma, diabetes, cancer, autism. Diagnosis is a clinical skill. It requires a good clinician to be able to put the patient's story in the context of tests and findings.

Now, the difficulty, I think, with modern medicine is a lot of people don't understand that and that they feel that the test makes the diagnosis, the blood test or the brain scan, when actually a diagnosis is made on understanding the story in the context of the tests that are done. That means that diagnosis is hugely subjective. I hear a lot of stories of people going to different doctors who said I didn't have a diagnosis, but then the 11th doctor said I did have it.

There is an inherent subjectivity that doctors will manage differently. I'm a doctor in a highly specialized center, and I deliberately err on the side of slight underdiagnosis. I do that because I'm aware that when I make a diagnosis of a brain disease, I am changing that person's future forever. 

I'm not just changing their relationship with their body. I'm also changing their mortgage payments, their insurance, their confidence in themselves, their ability to get health insurance. I'm changing their finances, their practical future. I'm changing their ability to drive. There's so many things that come with the diagnosis that people don't think about.

What many, many doctors do is they err on the side of overdiagnosis because that[‘s an easier place for a doctor to be. Because you're never going to come back to me and say, “Listen, I don't really believe I had asthma when I was a child.” You'll say, “Well, listen, I had it. You treated it and now I'm better.” It protects us against someone coming back and saying we missed something.

I came into this book thinking that something like cancer would very much be more of a yes or no. You either have it or you don't. And if you do, you really would want to know about it — as soon as possible. 

And yet, after reading your book, I felt like you had complicated that story. How do we risk overdiagnosing cancer?

Within the medical community, this has been well-known for a long time, but it just doesn't leak into the general conversation. The bottom line is if you screen healthy people for an illness, any illness, be it cancer or high blood pressure, diabetes, then you will be picking up borderline cases and overtreating them.

In the case of cancer, I try to remind people we've only had MRI scans in regular clinical use in doctors' offices since the 1990s. They've only been as good as they are now in the last 10 years, as sensitive at picking up things. As we get these newer tests, we're finally seeing inside the healthy body of people. 

What we find when we screen people for things like cancer is we find abnormal cells. But not all abnormal cells go into cancer. Lots of people live out their lives having these abnormal cells. They never spread. They never do anything. They never grow. They would never threaten health. But our difficulty as doctors is because we're so new to finding all these irregular abnormalities that when we find them, we don't know which ones will turn into malignant cancers and which ones won't.

So what we do is we treat them all as if they will inevitably turn into malignant cancers. One Cochrane Review estimated that if you screen 2,000 women for breast cancer, you will save one woman's life from breast cancer and treat 10 women for breast cancer who never needed to be treated.

I think sometimes we're very in love with all of our access to screening tests and scans and health checks. A lot of that care is not only unnecessary, but actually doing us harm. 

One estimated that if you screen 2,000 women for breast cancer, you will save one woman's life from breast cancer and treat 10 women for breast cancer who never needed to be treated.

Obviously being able to better more precisely diagnose conditions and to test samples at a genetic level represents advancement in science and an improvement in our understanding of our own body. How do we encourage that kind of development while mitigating the problems that you're writing about?

I work with people who've got rare brain diseases. The advancement in genetics and the ability to diagnose rare genetic conditions is amazing. I don't want to in any way detract from what a phenomenal kind of medical advancement that is. I have no doubt that going forward in 20, 30, 40 years, it will continue contributing to science and to medicine in very positive ways. 

O'Sullivan's book is not a self-help guide, but after reading it, it's easy to come up with some strategies that could help each of us bring a “slow-medicine” sensibility to our next doctor's appointment and potentially avoid overdiagnosis. Such as:

• Set expectations with your doctor. Make clear that you don't want to be quick to judgment or treatment.

• Press your doctor to get a better sense of how confident they are in a diagnosis, what could change their mind, what additional steps could be taken to double-check.

• If you're really worried about something, speak up. Slow medicine means being thoughtful — not ignoring what your body is telling you.

But something being modern and expensive and cutting-edge doesn't mean it's always better medicine. We need to be a little bit more open with the general public about the uncertainties.

We'll never understand the meaning of different genes to healthy populations if we don't test them, so we need to do the population-based testing. But we need to be careful before we begin offering genetic tests to unsuspecting members of the public who probably think we understand them a great deal better than we do. 

We're really on a learning curve at the moment. A little bit more clarity and honesty with the public would go a long way. 

How would you respond to somebody who hears we should be testing less and diagnosing less and immediately thinks, “Well, you're just going to put my health at risk.”

Listen, I don't want a diagnosis missed in myself. I don't want to be the doctor who misses things either. So I completely understand people's fear of dialing back. 

It's not about replacing all these tests with nothing. It's really advocating for this concept of slow, thoughtful medicine with good clinicians that we invest in good doctors, good nurses, good diagnosticians, and we don't feel the need to be compelled to jump into tests and diagnosis at that first meeting. We have time to spend with our patients and meet them again to discuss the problem. That's how you come to both a good understanding between patient and doctor. A quality diagnosis is made with time and understanding.

I often find when I meet my patients for the first time, I don't fully understand the story. I love to see how that story unfolds in subsequent meetings. So I'm not asking people to give up medical tests and labels and replace them with nothing. I'm asking that we improve our clinical skills and we meet people lots of times to improve the quality of diagnosis.

It's the new K-pop concert starter kit: a T-shirt emblazoned with your favorite singer's name, a band light stick, and a rented Samsung phone with a razor-sharp zoom.

K-pop fans clamoring for a picture of their favorite singers have carved out a niche market within the South Korean tech industry, with people shelling out money to rent Samsung Galaxy phones for a day.

K-pop concerts have been known to easily and repeatedly sell out arenas that can seat upward of 16,000 people, such as the Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul. And a strong zoom lens is crucial for fans seated far from the stage.

So, phones with 10x optical zoom lenses are now a key part of the concert survival tool kit.

At least a dozen established businesses in Southeast Asia offer day rentals of phones like the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and Galaxy S24 Ultra for under $50.

✨ Throwback to an unforgettable night! 🌟  Our customer had the chance to meet her idol #SEVENTEEN , and capture every moment with Woori Mobile's Samsung S23 Ultra rental! 🎶📸 With our service, you can enjoy the concert without worrying about storage—just focus on making memories! Ready for your next concert? 🎤✨ Contact us today and get ready to capture your best moments! >> @Seventeen   Oppa Saranghaee ❤️💙 <<  𝐖𝐨𝐨𝐫𝐢 𝐌𝐨𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 – Your trusted telecommunications partner in Korea.  --- #Seventeenconcert #Seoul #KoreaTravel #seventeenrightherewoldtour #Kpop #Fancam #SamsungUltraS23 #Rentalphone #Carat #exchangestudent #ExploreKorea 

Both phones, released in February 2023 and January 2024, respectively, have strong 10x optical zoom lenses. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment for this story from Business Insider.

Small businesses and individuals rent phones for concert day use all across Southeast Asia. But in South Korea — the home of K-pop, where concerts go on all year round — the market is particularly hot.

One business offering this phone rental service is Snapshoot. Founded in 2022, the company rents phones for 30,000 to 50,000 South Korean won, or about $22 to $37, daily.

Mingwan Jeong, the founder of Snapshoot, told BI his business serves hundreds of customers monthly and is increasingly attracting customers from outside South Korea, such as Japan, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

""When Samsung released the S22 Ultra, their promotional slogan emphasized its capability to 'photograph the moon,'"" Jeong said. ""Fans quickly recognized that this advanced camera could help them capture their idols clearly at concerts.""

He said Snapshoot started in 2022 with a small inventory of 10 phones, but now keeps several hundred smartphones in stock at any given time.

Another example is Woori Mobile Service, a South Korean telecommunications company that started renting out phones in 2023. Its collection points are at Seoul's Konkuk University and the hip Sinchon neighborhood. It also has a pickup point at Seoul's Incheon airport, catering to Woori's foreign clients.

""Many of them didn't own the latest smartphones or didn't want the hassle of international roaming,"" Han Da Bean, a spokesperson for Woori Mobile, told BI.

The company offers rentals of the S23 and S24 models, charging 35,000 won or about $25 per day, and a 10,000 won daily reservation fee.

""Samsung's flagship models like the S23 Ultra and S24 Ultra offer exceptional camera and audio capabilities, especially in low light and concert environments, making them ideal for fans looking to record memories in high definition,"" Han added.

He said the company serves 50 to 100 rental customers a month, typically renting out the phones for three to seven days. They see a spike in activity during major K-pop festivals and tour seasons, he added.

Han said Woori Mobile keeps an inventory of about 20 Samsung devices, but it plans to expand to other models like the Galaxy Z Fold and Flip series and add more mid-range models for budget-conscious users.

Forholiday, a luggage storage and rental company in Seoul, also offers phone rentals, with its services available on Klook. It has rented phones to more than 2,000 customers, per the Klook listing.

The company rents the S23 Ultra for 11,800 won and the S24 Ultra for 15,700 won daily.

Forholiday's CEO, Shin Dong-min, told BI the company's phone rentals are a stopgap for cost-conscious fans.

""It is inevitably burdensome to buy expensive mobile phones to use them for a short period,"" Shin said.

Shin said Forholiday sees the most demand around concerts by boy bands BTS, Seventeen, Stray Kids, and Zerobaseone.

Some K-pop fans who've rented phones for concerts have said the experience was worth every cent.

""I own an iPhone 11, which works pretty well except the phone camera is limited to a 3x, which means I can't do any close-up fancams if I'm in any seat beyond VIP,"" Ghia Hong, a content creator from Malaysia, told BI.

TikTok user wanderwithgaby also posted about renting a Samsung S25 for 50,000 South Korean won.

""It was the best money I spent,"" she wrote in the caption of a zoomed-in fan video of BTS member J-Hope.

To be sure, Samsung's smartphones are not the only phones with a strong zoom lens.

Google's Pixel 9 Pro's specs say it produces pictures with the quality of a 10x optical zoom. Apple's iPhone 16 Pro has a 5x optical zoom function and a 25x digital zoom option. Other Asian brands like Oppo, Huawei, and Xiaomi are strong contenders, too.

Still, the rental service is doing wonders for Samsung's image.

Parker Burton, a tech reviewer and content creator on YouTube with over a million followers, said Samsung likely became the phone of choice because the brand has a huge fan base on home ground in South Korea.

""I think a big part of it can stem from the fact that it's a brand that people are used to and familiar with and has a lot of trust and loyalty in the community,"" Burton said.

Catherine Bautista, a partner at Flying Fish Lab, a branding consultancy agency in Singapore, said Samsung is also core to fan culture, and rentals have made it ""the default choice for K-pop enthusiasts.""

""Renting out Galaxy S23/S24 Ultra phones for K-pop concerts is a brilliant reputation booster for Samsung because, instead of simply competing on specs, Samsung dominates a niche need and turns fans into brand ambassadors,"" she said.

Bautista said Samsung has also positioned itself as the ""official phone of K-pop"" by sponsoring concerts, featuring top idols in its advertisements, and releasing special edition phones.

Samsung recently tapped Felix Lee, a singer from the band Stray Kids, as its newest ambassador. Lee, who is also a house ambassador of fashion powerhouse Louis Vuitton, is the face of the ad campaign for the brand's latest super-slim Galaxy S25 Edge phone.

And with Stray Kids now on a 34-city tour, the group's fans can sing, dance, and zoom in on their idols' faces to their hearts' content.

In the midst of a tense Oval Office meeting with the president of South Africa last Wednesday, President Donald Trump made a passing reference to the man who, until recently, seemed to be omnipresent in Washington.

""Elon is from South Africa,"" Trump said, gesturing toward the world's richest man, who just so happened to be in the room. ""I don't want to get Elon involved. That's all I have to do, get him into another thing.""

Elon Musk's appearance at the White House came just one day after he told an audience that he planned to spend far less money on politics moving forward. And last month, the tech titan told Tesla investors that he would be scaling back his involvement in DOGE and ""allocating far more"" time to the electric vehicle company.

Last week demonstrated that Musk, while he may be posting less about politics and shifting his attention back to his business interests, is unlikely to completely disappear. After all, he did say on that same April earnings call that he would continue to spend one or two days a week on ""government matters"" for ""as long as the president would like me to do so.""

Beyond his appearance in the Oval Office, Musk also showed up twice on Capitol Hill, once on Wednesday afternoon and again on Thursday morning. In both cases, he was meeting with groups of Republican lawmakers to discuss AI and other issues.

It's a sign that Musk, even beyond his role as the informal head of DOGE, remains a trusted source of expertise for the GOP.

And if you ask Republicans about Musk, they're still likely to gush about him.

""He is an extraordinary business leader who has created jobs throughout Texas and across the country,"" Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told BI last week, reacting to the news that Musk said would be spending less on elections. ""I think he has engaged in an enormous amount of personal sacrifice, both helping produce historic election results in 2024, and then coming and working free of charge for the American people and leading DOGE.""

After meeting with Musk on Thursday, one House Republican — Rep. John James of Michigan — posted a selfie with the tech titan on X.

""Only in America could a meme become a mission to the moon and Making America Great Again,"" James wrote, referring to the meme origin of the DOGE acronym.

Both Musk and the White House have also made clear that DOGE, the cost-cutting effort that has defined so much of the early months of Trump's second presidency, will outlive Musk's daily involvement.

""The mission of DOGE — to cut waste, fraud, and abuse — will surely continue,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement for this story. ""DOGE employees who onboarded at their respective agencies will continue to work with President Trump's cabinet to make our government more efficient.""

For Democrats, Musk's continued presence is a reason to stay vigilant. Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin dismissed the tech titan's comments about stepping back from politics earlier this week, suggesting that Republicans simply understand that he's a lightning rod of controversy.

""He put way too much money into that race,"" Pocan said, referring to the 2024 election. ""He's still profiting off of that investment. He just realizes he can't do it front and center.""

If national governments can solve issues that have long restrained the European Union's economic potential, they could be rewarded with lower borrowing costs as well as protection from currency fluctuations and sanctions, Lagarde said in a speech in Berlin.

BYD Co. led Chinese electric vehicle stocks lower in Hong Kong on Monday, as investors digested the auto giant's sweeping price cuts of as much as 34% late last week.

Sweden-based automaker Volvo Cars on Monday said it would cut around 3,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive.

The move comes after the company, which is owned by China's Geely Holding, announced an 18 billion Swedish kronor ($1.89 billion) cost and cash action plan late last month.

Volvo Cars said the 3,000 job cuts would primarily impact office-based positions in Sweden and represent around 15% of the firm's total office-based workforce.

""The actions announced today have been difficult decisions, but they are important steps as we build a stronger and even more resilient Volvo Cars,"" Håkan Samuelsson, Volvo Cars president and CEO, said in a statement.

""The automotive industry is in the middle of a challenging period. To address this, we must improve our cash flow generation and structurally lower our costs. At the same time, we will continue to ensure the development of the talent we need for our ambitious future,"" Samuelsson said.

As part of the redundancies, the company said it would reduce around 1,000 positions currently held by consultants, mostly in Sweden, roughly 1,200 employees in Sweden and the remaining in other global markets.

When the action plan was launched on April 29, Volvo Cars said the program would include reductions in investments and redundancies at its operations across the globe. The company also withdrew its financial guidance for both 2025 and 2026, citing tariff pressure on the automotive sector.

Uncertainty over trade tariffs is expected to have a profound impact on the car industry, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to impose 50% tariffs on imports from the European Union from the start of June, prompting Europe's auto index to fall sharply.

The U.S. president has since watered down the threat, announcing on Sunday that he had agreed to push the rollout of the punitive import duties back to July 9, following a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The EU already faces 25% U.S. import tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum and so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs of 10% for most other goods.

Volvo Cars said the measures were necessary to ensure it can deliver on its long-term strategy, adding that it remains firm on its ambition to become a fully electric car company.

A leader in the electric vehicle (EV) transition, Volvo Cars announced plans in September to drop its near-term goal of selling only EVs, citing a need to be ""pragmatic and flexible"" amid changing market conditions and cooling demand.

Investors should ""buckle up"" for more volatility as the potential for a trade war has not completely dissipated despite U.S. President Donald Trump's delay of rolling out 50% tariffs on the European Union, analysts warn.

Trump announced on Sunday that he had agreed to push the rollout of the punitive import duties back to July 9, following a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The president had initially called for a 50% tariff on EU goods to begin on June 1. He accused the bloc in a social media post of being ""very difficult to deal with,"" and said trade negotiations with the EU were ""going nowhere.""

European stocks rebounded Monday morning, moving into positive territory, after previously sinking on Friday in response to Trump's fresh tariffs threats.

Von der Leyen said in a post on X over the weekend that the EU was ""ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively.""

""The EU and US share the world's most consequential and close trade relationship,"" she said. ""To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9.""

An EU official with knowledge of trade talks with the U.S. told CNBC that European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic was due to speak with his U.S. counterparts on Monday.

But while Trump's announcement of the delay has granted the two parties some more breathing space, market watchers warned Monday that a lot remains at stake.

Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmieding told CNBC that the six-week window until tariffs kick in was probably not enough time to ""settle all detailed questions"" – but he argued it should be sufficient to put the framework of a trade agreement in place.

""It should be enough to get an agreement like the one between the U.S. and the U.K.,"" he said on CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday.

 ""[It] is basically a matter of political will, and that depends a bit on the U.S. side,"" he added. ""If they do have the political will, we should really be able to have such an agreement with, probably in the end, a 10% tariff from the U.S. on all EU imports, hardly any EU retaliation, and [scaling back] a few sector-specific things … with some of the details to be finalized after July 9.""

However, Schmieding noted that if the end result were a 20% or 30% blanket tariff on EU goods, ""the EU would have no choice"" but to impose ""significant countermeasures"" against the United States.

Labeling Trump ""an interesting negotiator,"" Schmieding argued that the president often tries to shock those with whom he's negotiating into agreeing to concessions. But the EU, he said, was unlikely to capitulate to these tactics.

""We just have to stay calm, and from the European side, we just have to negotiate – we have to remember from the European side that our market is big, that we do matter in economic terms to the U.S. quite a lot, not just vice versa,"" he added. ""So these negotiations should be negotiations among equals. The European Union is not a region which can be scared into just throwing in the towel.""

Guntram Wolff, senior fellow at Bruegel, told CNBC that despite the extension of the tariffs deadline, ""massive uncertainty"" remained.

""This uncertainty is bad for business, it's bad for consumers, and frankly it's an unnecessary step in the negotiations,"" he told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition.""

""It's very unclear what exactly the U.S. President wants,"" Wolff added. ""That's the biggest obstacle at this stage, that in the negotiations the EU has made offers, has made proposals, but it doesn't really know what the president wants.""

According to Wolff, the EU is ""playing it rather well.""

""The U.K. has given in on all kinds of demands, China is the other extreme, [it] has really escalated … to a point where the U.S. had to blink, had to give in,"" he explained. ""Europe sort of tries to take a middle path.""

The EU does have capacity to retaliate should massive tariffs be levied on its exports by the Trump administration, Wolff added, pointing to the importance of its pharmaceutical products to the U.S., and the potential for retaliatory measures to be implemented in the services sector.  

""But the EU so far has decided not to do it, really to keep a climate of de-escalation,"" he said. ""But at the end of the day, that might not be enough now.""

Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at London's Zaye Capital Markets, told CNBC on Monday the tariffs delay had sparked a ""tentative risk-on rally"" – but like Wolff, he cautioned that much remained at stake.

""Looking ahead, the EU-US trade dance is a high-stakes tango, with July 9 as the next flashpoint,"" he said in an email.

""The EU's dangling phased tariff cuts and ""mutual respect"" talks, but Trump's America-first bravado could turn negotiations into a slugfest, rattling supply chains and fanning inflationary flames.""

Aslam added that sectors like tech and industrials were particularly ""braced for whiplash.""

""Markets will hang on every tweet and trade talk whisper, with investors betting on whether this delay is a genuine olive branch or just Trump reloading for a bigger tariff showdown,"" he said. ""Buckle up; this ride's far from over.""

Shares in BYD plunged as much as 8.25% Monday, a steep drop from their record high last week, as investors assessed the Chinese electric vehicle giant's price cuts on May 23.

The company announced on the Chinese social media platform Weibo that it was reducing the prices on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models until the end of June.

For instance, the price tag of the Seagull hatchback was reduced by 20% to 55,800 Chinese yuan ($7,780), while that of the Seal dual-motor hybrid sedan was cut by 34% to 102,800 yuan.

The latest developments follow other price revisions the automaker announced earlier in the year, such as the release of its Han sedans and Tang SUVs at a starting price that was 10.35% and 14.3% lower than that of previous versions.

Analysts from Citi expect BYD's price reduction to have caused a 30% to 40% spike in footfall at its dealership stores between May 24 and 25, compared to the previous weekend.

Shares of other Chinese automakers also declined on Monday as investors turned cautious about stiffer competition and a potential price war in the sector.

Shares in Geely Automobile were last seen trading 7.29% lower, while Great Wall Motor Co and Li Auto had lost 2.94% and 4.93% respectively. Meanwhile, shares in Xpeng were down 4.19%.

Looking ahead, Citi's analysts are not concerned that BYD's price cuts would erode its competitors' market share.

Instead, they expect ""robust sales growth"" for new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan as ""competition remains relatively mild,"" the analysts wrote in a May 26 note.

Businesses are finding a workaround to minimize the most significant hit from tariffs, using a decades-old piece of legislation known as the ""first sale rule.""

Within U.S. customs law, the first sale rule allows U.S. importers to use the price of the first sale in a number of transactions to calculate customs duties.

For instance, a Chinese manufacturer sells a t-shirt to a Hong Kong vendor for $5. That Hong Kong vendor then sells the t-shirt to a U.S. retailer for $10. That U.S. retailer then sells the t-shirt to consumers for $40.

Under the first sale rule, the U.S. retailer can pay the import duty on the initial $5 price of the good, rather than the vendor's inflated $10, thus stripping out the cost associated with the middleman's profit.

""What the rules allow you to do is use that initial sales price from the factory to the vendor to determine the final duty price,"" Brian Gleicher, senior lawyer and member at Miller & Chevalier Chartered, told CNBC over the phone.

The first sale rule has been around since 1988, but gained renewed attention under U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration and, now, during his latest tariff regime.

""When the first administration had 25% tariffs [on China in 2018], that's when we started getting calls. Now with the new tariffs, the first sale rule has started coming up again,"" Sid Paruthi, partner at U.S. consulting firm Moss Adams, said over video call.

""It's been around for a very long time but ... everybody's beginning to explore it with more interest,"" Gleicher said.

Here are the criteria businesses must fulfil to apply the rule:

For some companies, that can be easier said than done.

Typically, the default duty imposed by U.S. customs is based on the import price of a good, putting the burden of proof on the importer to demonstrate the initial cost of that item. That may not always be something a vendor is willing to reveal.

""If you're an importer, you need to get that first sale price. You need to have the data,"" Gleicher said. ""Vendors may not want to give that information.""

Rich Taylor, a corporate business development consultant based in Chinese hub Ningbo who has been advising Fortune 500 companies on the first sale rule since Trump's first term, noted ""there has to be a level of trust between all parties"" because of the risks involved.

Nevertheless, the additional complexities can be worthwhile, given the potential cost savings.

""You [suppliers] are keeping your customer. You're showing them that you're trying to give them every tool to reduce their cost,"" Taylor said.

""If you don't use it, then the end cost is going to go up. And if your competitor is using the [first sale] rule, then you're going to lose you that advantage over them.""

Companies appear to be cluing into that.

While the first sale rule is broadly applicable across products and industries, it is considered particularly useful in higher-value consumer goods and luxury products, where margins are greater.

Last month, Italian luxury fashion brand Moncler flagged the first sale rule as providing ""significant benefit"" to its cost structure.

""First cost [sale], of course, the industrial cost ... is much lower than the retail price, and it is about 50% of the intercompany price. So, of course, it's a significant benefit,"" Luciano Santel, executive director & chief corporate and supply officer at Moncler, told investors during an April 16 earnings call.

Swiss-headquartered biotech Kuros Biosciences earlier this month said that it was altering its operations, which would allow it to adopt the first sale policy.

""What we will now do is we will switch in between Zurich as a wholesaler hub... which in essence means we can adapt the so-called first sale method,"" Daniel Geiger, chief financial officer of Swiss-headquartered biotech Kuros Biosciences, said during a May 13 earnings call.

During first-quarter earnings calls, U.S. BBQ-maker Traeger and manufacturing firm Fictiv also both cited first sale as ""supply chain mitigants"" and means to ""minimize tariff and duty costs,"" respectively.

Use of the first sale rule, while perfectly legal, nevertheless could undermine the Trump administration's efforts to boost tariff revenue and boost onshoring of manufacturing.

The White House did not respond to CNBC's request for comment on use of the first sale rule and its implications for tariff policy. 

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it could not provide data on the recent use of the first sale rule by importers.

If U.S. President Donald Trump follows up on his threat of 50% tariffs on the European Union, he'd be imposing higher duties on America's ally compared with the 30% on China currently.

But on Sunday, Trump said he would delay tariffs on EU to July 9 from June 1 following a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Indeed, when news of the tariffs first broke, analysts weren't convinced Trump's statement held much weight. For one, the U.S. President used the word ""recommendation"" — a proposal rather than a clear directive. Trump has also walked back on more than one occasion with regard to import duties: pausing the ""reciprocal"" tariffs and lowering trade barriers with China, albeit both on a temporary basis.

Major U.S. and European stock indexes did not have a sharp reaction compared with Trump's initial announcement of tariffs on April 2, signaling that investors are beginning to take tariff-related announcements with a pinch of salt. 

The proposal of 50% tariff on the EU is primarily a ""negotiating tactic,"" Barclays wrote in a Friday note.

Still, markets dropped on the week — the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Index and Nasdaq Composite lost more than 2% during that period — as Treasury yields jumped. The sell-off in Treasurys came on the back of Trump's tax bill, which is estimated to add $2.3 trillion to the federal deficit.

So, while investors appear to be coming to terms with Trump's tariffs proclamations, there's much more in the president's arsenal to keep markets jittery.

Trump recommends 50% tariffs on EUU.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday he will delay 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9, days after ""recommending"" them to kick in from June 1. Trade freight experts said that such tariffs could ""backfire"" on the U.S. and make manufacturing more expensive. The White House did not interpret the president's post as a formal statement of policy, CNBC's Eamon Javers reported.

U.S. markets dropped — slightly U.S. stocks dropped Friday on Trump's tariff threats. The S&P 500 retreated 0.67%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.61% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1%. Those moves, however, are much smaller than the plunges of more than 4% on April 4, after Trump announced his ""reciprocal tariffs."" Asia-Pacific markets were mixed Monday. At 2 p.m. Singapore time, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up nearly 1% as shares of Nippon Steel added 2.2% following news that Trump had approved a merger between the company and U.S. Steel.

Staying ahead despite export curbsStockpiling chips, making artificial intelligence models more efficient and using homegrown semiconductors — those are some strategies Chinese technology companies Tencent and Baidu are using to keep up in the global AI race even as the U.S. tightens exports of crucial chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Wednesday called the curbs a ""failure,"" saying they are doing more damage to American businesses than to China.

Xiaomi's car challenges Tesla'sLess than a year after launching its first electric car, Xiaomi revealed its YU7 SUV late on Thursday. The company claimed it would have a driving range of at least 760 kilometers (472 miles) on a single charge, taking aim at the Tesla's extended-range Model Y, which advertises a range of 719 km. ""We expect Yu7 would significantly erode Tesla Model-Y's China market share,"" Citi analyst Jeff Chung said in a report Sunday.

Businesses are finding a workaround for tariffs — and it's entirely legal

A decades-old piece of U.S. legislation known as the ""first sale rule"" allows U.S. importers to use the price of the first sale in a number of transactions to calculate customs duties.

For instance, a Chinese manufacturer sells a T-shirt to a Hong Kong vendor for $5. That Hong Kong vendor sells it to a U.S. retailer for $10. That U.S. retailer then sells the T-shirt to consumers for $40.

Under the first sale rule, the U.S. retailer can pay the import duty on the initial $5 price of the good, rather than the vendor's inflated $10, thus stripping out the cost associated with the middleman's profit.

Companies appear to be leveraging that customs law. While the first sale rule is broadly applicable across products and industries, it is considered particularly useful in higher-value consumer goods and luxury products, where margins are greater.

BEIJING — China's Xiaomi, known for its smartphones, only recently entered the electric-vehicle space. It is now taking aim at Tesla's bestselling car in China.

Less than a year after launching its first electric car, Xiaomi late on Thursday revealed its YU7 SUV and claimed it would have a driving range of at least 760 kilometers (472 miles) on a single charge.

That's well above the 719 km advertised for Tesla's extended-range Model Y. Driving range has been a selling point for consumers worried about frequent battery charging.

""We expect Yu7 would significantly erode Tesla Model-Y's China market share,"" Citi analyst Jeff Chung said in a report Sunday.

Citi expects the YU7 to be priced around 250,000 yuan to 320,000 yuan ($34,700 to $44,420), and forecasts monthly sales of about 30,000 units. Once sales pick up, Citi predicts annual sales of 300,000 to 360,000 units.

That price range pits the YU7 against Tesla's Model Y, which starts at 263,500 yuan in China. Xiaomi plans to announce the YU7's price at the car's official launch in July.

Xiaomi plans to announce the YU7's price at the car's official launch in July.

Tesla's Model Y was the second most sold new energy vehicle in China in the six months through April, according to Autohome, an online platform for consumer information on cars in China. BYD's far cheaper Seagull ranked first, while the budget Wuling Hongguang Mini ranked third.

For April alone, Geely's Geome Xingyuan topped the new energy vehicle bestsellers' list, followed by BYD's Seagull and the Wuling Hongguan Mini, Autohome data showed. Xiaomi's SU7 sedan ranked fourth, followed by three BYD models, while Tesla's Model Y ranked eighth.

The YU7 is positioned as a ""luxury SUV"" and its sales could outperform that of the SU7, Elinor Leung, managing director of Asia telecom and internet research at CLSA, said in a note.

Last year, Xiaomi released its first electric car, the SU7 sedan, priced $4,000 lower than Tesla's Model 3 at the time. Tesla subsequently reduced Model 3 price to 235,500 yuan as of May 26 — although it is still more expensive than the SU7 sedan at 215,900 yuan.

Xiaomi delivered more than 28,000 units of its SU7 car in April, down from its record of more than 29,000 during the previous month. That comes after the crash of an SU7 vehicle in China that left three people dead. China has since mandated automakers to be careful with the language when advertising driver-assist systems.

Xiaomi revealed the YU7 on Thursday at the end of a launch event for a premium phone using a new chip that the company claimed beat Apple's on certain metrics. CNBC was not able to independently verify the claims.

Rival electric car company Xpeng is due Wednesday to release the Max version of its relatively popular Mona M03 car. The Max version includes more advanced driver-assist capabilities. The company previously said the Max would begin deliveries after the Lunar New Year holiday in February.

In this article

Tencent and Baidu, two of China's largest technology companies, revealed how they're keeping in the global artificial intelligence race even as the U.S. tightens some curbs on key semiconductors.

The business' methods include stockpiling chips, making AI models more efficient and even using homegrown semiconductors.

While the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump scrapped one controversial Biden-era chip rule, it still tightened exports of some semiconductors from companies including Nvidia and AMD in April.

Big names in the sector addressed the issue during their latest earnings conference calls.

Martin Lau, president of Tencent — the operator of China's biggest messaging app WeChat — said his company has a ""pretty strong stockpile"" of chips that it has previously purchased. He was referring to graphics processing units (GPUs), a type of semiconductor that has become the gold standard for training huge AI models.

These models require powerful computing power supplied by GPUs to process high volumes of data.

But, Lau said, contrary to American companies' belief that GPU clusters need to expand to create more advanced AI, Tencent is able to achieve good training results with a smaller group of such chips.

""That actually sort of helped us to look at our existing inventory of high-end chips and say, we should have enough high-end chips to continue our training of models for a few more generations going forward,"" Lau said.

Regarding inferencing — the process of actually carrying out an AI task rather than just training — Lau said Tencent is using ""software optimization"" to improve efficiency, in order to deploy the same amount of GPUs to execute a particular function.

Lau added the company is also looking into using smaller models that don't require such large computing power. Tencent also said it can make use of custom-designed chips and semiconductors currently available in China.

""I think there are a lot of ways [in] which we can fulfill the expanding and growing inference needs, and we just need to sort of keep exploring these venues and spend probably more time on the software side, rather than just brute force buying GPUs,"" Lau said.

Baidu, China's biggest search company, touted what it calls its ""full-stack"" capabilities — the combination of its cloud computing infrastructure, AI models and the actual applications based on those models, such as its ERNIE chatbot.

""Even without access to the most advanced chips, our unique full stack AI capabilities enable us to build strong applications and deliver meaningful value,"" Dou Shen, president of Baidu's AI cloud business, said on the company's earnings call this week.

Baidu also touted software optimization and the ability to bring down the cost of running its models, because it owns much of the technology in that stack. Baidu management also spoke about efficiencies that allow it to get more out of the GPUs it possesses.

""With foundation models driving up the need for a massive computing power, the abilities to build and manage large scale GPU clusters and to utilize GPUs effectively has become key competitive advantages,"" Shen said.

The Baidu executive also touted the progress made by domestic Chinese technology firms in AI semiconductors, a move he said would help mitigate the impact of U.S. chip curbs.

""Domestically developed self-sufficient chips, along with [an] increasingly efficient home-grown software stack, will jointly form a strong foundation for long-term innovation in China's AI ecosystem,"" Shen said.

China has been ramping up development of chips designed and manufactured on its home soil for the last few years. Most experts agree that Beijing remains overall behind the U.S. in the realm of GPUs and AI chips, but there have been some advances.

Gaurav Gupta, an analyst covering semiconductors at Gartner, said stockpiling is one way Chinese companies are dealing with export restrictions. Additionally, there has been some progress made in semiconductor technology in China, even if it remains behind the U.S., Gupta added.

""China has also been developing its own domestic semiconductor ecosystem, all the way from materials to equipment to chips and packaging. Different segments have made varying levels of progress, but China has been surprisingly extremely consistent and ambitious in this goal, and one must admit that they have achieved decent success,"" Gupta told CNBC by email.

""This provides an avenue for them to procure AI chips, which perhaps can't compete with those from the U.S chip leaders but continue to make progress.""

Many U.S. executives have urged Washington to scrap export restrictions in light of China's progress. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the curbs a ""failure"" this week, saying they are doing more damage to American businesses than to China.

European shares were higher on Monday as investors reacted to U.S. President Donald Trump delaying the roll out of 50% tariffs on the European Union.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 provisionally ended up 1%, with all sectors in positive territory. The French CAC 40 added 1.2%, while Germany's DAX was 1.6% higher. U.K. markets were closed for a public holiday.

European autos stocks rebounded from a 3% loss in the previous session to close 1.7% higher on Monday. The industry is particularly sensitive to the threat of U.S. tariffs, given that vehicles and machinery are the EU's biggest export to the United States.

German carmakers saw broad gains, with BMW and Mercedes-Benz last seen gaining 2% and Volkswagen jumping 2.6%.

Elsewhere, Zealand Pharma climbed to the top of the Stoxx 600 with shares up 10%. It came after Cantor Fitzgerald maintained its overweight position on the stock, with analyst Prakhar Agrawal saying in a Friday note to clients that the stock was ""trading at a meaningful valuation disconnect relative to the upcoming milestones for petrelintide and the multi-blockbuster opportunity for amylin analogs in obesity.""

Trump initially called on Friday for a 50% tariff on EU goods, saying in a post on his Truth Social platform that the duties would begin from June 1. He accused the bloc of being ""very difficult to deal with"" and said trade negotiations with the EU were ""going nowhere.""

On Sunday, Trump then said he had agreed to delay the 50% tariffs to July 9 following a call from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Von der Leyen said in a post on X over the weekend that the EU was ""ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively.""

Overnight in Asia, shares were trading in mixed territory, with Japanese and South Korean stocks moving higher as Chinese and Hong Kong-listed shares saw losses.

U.S. markets are closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. Stocks on Wall Street sold off on Friday after Trump's threat to impose new tariffs on the EU and tech giant Apple.

If U.S. President Donald Trump follows up on his threat of 50% tariffs on the European Union, he'd be imposing higher duties on America's ally compared with the 30% on China currently.

But on Sunday, Trump said he would delay tariffs on EU to July 9 from June 1 following a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Indeed, when news of the tariffs first broke, analysts weren't convinced Trump's statement held much weight. For one, the U.S. President used the word ""recommendation"" — a proposal rather than a clear directive. Trump has also walked back on more than one occasion with regard to import duties: pausing the ""reciprocal"" tariffs and lowering trade barriers with China, albeit both on a temporary basis.

Major U.S. and European stock indexes did not have a sharp reaction compared with Trump's initial announcement of tariffs on April 2, signaling that investors are beginning to take tariff-related announcements with a pinch of salt. 

The proposal of 50% tariff on the EU is primarily a ""negotiating tactic,"" Barclays wrote in a Friday note.

Still, markets dropped on the week — the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Index and Nasdaq Composite lost more than 2% during that period — as Treasury yields jumped.

The sell-off in Treasurys came on the back of Trump's tax bill, which is estimated to add $2.3 trillion to the federal deficit.

So, while investors appear to be coming to terms with Trump's tariffs proclamations, there's much more in the president's arsenal to keep markets jittery.

Trump recommends 50% tariffs on EUU.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday he will delay 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9, days after ""recommending"" them to kick in from June 1. Trade freight experts said that such tariffs could ""backfire"" on the U.S. and make manufacturing more expensive. The White House did not interpret the president's post as a formal statement of policy, CNBC's Eamon Javers reported.

Markets dropped — slightly U.S. stocks dropped Friday on Trump's tariff threats. The S&P 500 retreated 0.67%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.61% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1%. Those moves, however, are much smaller than the plunges of more than 4% on April 4, after Trump announced his ""reciprocal tariffs."" Similarly, Europe's Stoxx 600 index fell 0.93%, milder than it did after Trump's Liberation Day.""

Apple to pay 25% tariff: TrumpTrump said in a social media post Friday that Apple will have to pay a tariff of 25% or more for iPhones made outside the U.S. Wall Street analysts estimate that moving iPhone production to the U.S. would make the smartphone at least 25% more expensive. However, analysts said it would probably make more sense for Apple to eat the cost rather than move production stateside.

U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel mergerOn Friday, Trump cleared the merger of U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, saying in a post on Truth Social that the deal will ""create at least 70,000 jobs, and add $14 Billion Dollars to the U.S. Economy."" Former U.S. President Joe Biden blocked Nippon Steel from purchasing U.S. Steel for $14.9 billion in January, citing national security concerns. Shares of U.S. Steel surged 21.2% on the news.

The Wednesday event — alongside comments Trump seemingly shoots from the hip — will determine investor sentiment of markets for the week. Keep an eye out also for the U.S. personal consumption expenditure index for April for signs of how tariffs are affecting the prices households pay for goods and services.

Companies turn to AI to navigate Trump tariff turbulence

Several tech firms told CNBC say they're deploying artificial intelligence to visualize businesses' global supply chains — from the materials that are used to form products, to where those goods are being shipped from — and understand how they're affected by Trump's reciprocal tariffs.

Last week, Salesforce said it had developed a new import specialist AI agent that can ""instantly process changes for all 20,000 product categories in the U.S. customs system and then take action on them"" as needed, to help navigate changes to tariff systems.

Uncertainty from the U.S. tariff measures ""actually probably presents AI's moment to shine,"" Zack Kass, a futurist and former head of OpenAI's go-to-market strategy, told CNBC's Silvia Amaro at the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy last month.

France and Vietnam signed a deal on Monday for 20 Airbus planes, among other pacts, as President Emmanuel Macron visited Hanoi seeking to boost France's influence in its former colony, grappling with threats of crippling U.S. tariffs.

Macron's first formal visit to Vietnam, the first by a French president in nearly a decade, follows U.S. President Donald Trump's threats on Friday of 50% duties on EU goods from June that sharply fuelled tension with the 27-nation bloc.

Export-dependent Vietnam, under pressure from Washington to buy more American goods, has made pledges in trade talks to avert 46% tariffs that could impair its growth, fanning European concerns about deals at the region's expense.

Deals signed during Macron's visit covered the plane purchase, cooperation on nuclear energy, railways, Airbus earth-observation satellites and Sanofi vaccines, a list of documents seen by Reuters showed, confirming an earlier report. 

In statements to the press with no questions allowed, Macron reiterated France's support of freedom of navigation, an issue dear to Vietnam as it often clashes with Beijing over contested boundaries in the South China Sea.

Macron added the partnership with Vietnam ""entails a reinforced defence cooperation"", citing the signing of multiple projects on defence and space.

Vietnam's President Luong Cuong said the defence partnership involved ""sharing of information on strategic matters"" and stronger cooperation in the defence industry, cybersecurity and anti-terrorism.

France ruled the Southeast Asian country for about 70 years until it was forced out in 1954 after a major defeat at Dien Bien Phu in northern Vietnam.

Ties have improved in recent decades, being upgraded last year to Vietnam's highest level.

On his trip, the first leg of a Southeast Asian tour that includes Indonesia and Singapore, Macron will visit a university in Hanoi on Tuesday, before flying to Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. 

The deal with European planemaker Airbus for Vietnam's low-cost airline VietJet to buy 20 A330neo wide-body aircraft follows last year's agreement for 20 of the jets. 

The signing followed urging by European officials in recent weeks for Vietnam to be careful in concessions made to the White House, two officials based in Vietnam with knowledge of the discussions had told Reuters, referring to concerns on Airbus. 

Airbus is the main supplier of jets to Vietnam, contributing 86% of its fleet, data from aviation analytics firm Cirium shows.

A separate agreement with Airbus Defence was also signed during the visit for cooperation with Vietnam on earth-observations satellites.

Airbus has long been in talks with Hanoi for the replacement of Vietnam's earth-observation satellite, built by Airbus' predecessor EADS and launched in 2013. 

With an economy heavily dependent on U.S. exports, Vietnam has signalled the possible purchase of at least 250 Boeing planes by flag carrier Vietnam Airlines and rival VietJet.

Officials of both nations have said such deals would help cut its huge trade surplus with the United States and possibly appease Trump.

In talks with the United States, ""Vietnam should make sure not to make decisions at the expense of European interests,"" one of the EU officials said.

Vietnamese leaders have been advised such steps could jeopardise close ties with the EU, which has a free trade deal with Vietnam and is a major buyer of its goods, they added.

This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets.

Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Monday as investors assessed U.S. President Donald Trump's postponement of 50% tariffs on European Union imports.

South Korea's Kospi index advanced 2.02% to close at 2,644.40, its highest level since Feb. 24, while the small-cap Kosdaq gained 1.3% to 725.27.

In Japan, benchmark Nikkei 225 ended the day 1% higher at 37,531.53 while the broader Topix index added 0.6% to 2,751.91.

Mainland China's CSI 300 index lost 0.57% to end the day at 3,860.11, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.35% to 23,282.33.

India's benchmark Nifty 50 moved up 0.53% while the BSE Sensex rose 0.55% as at 2.04 p.m. Indian Standard Time.

Over in Australia, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 ended the day flat at 8,361.

U.S. futures ticked up in early Asia trade. U.S. markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day.

All three key benchmarks on Wall Street declined in last Friday's session following Trump's tariff threats on tech giant Apple as well as the European Union. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.67% to end the session at 5,802.82, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1% and settled at 18,737.21. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 256.02 points, or 0.61%, to close at 41,603.07.

Trump's fresh tariff threats have rattled markets ""after a period of relative calm, during which markets had priced in a more constructive outlook for trade negotiations,"" Mathieu Racheter, head of equity strategy research at Julius Baer wrote in a Monday note.

Looking ahead, he notes that the wide range of potential outcomes, as well as the elevated policy uncertainty make diversification across regions ""increasingly prudent.""

""We continue to advocate for a diversified approach across regions, with a particular focus on markets where valuations are more grounded and earnings expectations remain realistic,"" Racheter added.

South Korean stocks rallied Monday, reversing course from losses in its previous two sessions.

The 200-stock Kospi index advanced 2.02% to close at 2,644.40, its highest level since Feb. 24, following U.S. President Donald Trump's postponement of tariffs on the European Union.

Meanwhile, the small-cap Kosdaq gained 1.3% to 725.27, its highest since May 15.

Gains were broad-based across sectors, with strong moves seen in Hyundai-Rotem, which rose 8.93% and Hyundai Engineering & Construction, which advanced 7.38%.

Funds with exposure to Asia and emerging markets have trimmed their overweight positions on mainland China and rotated into India, HSBC analysts noted.

""Global fund holdings in mainland China have witnessed a gradual rise over the past few months, but remain substantially lower than the levels touched in 2021. Both Asia and GEM Funds built exposure to India, although the market remains among the biggest underweights,"" they wrote in a May 26 research note.

The moves come as interest in Asia ex-China equities have picked up, with foreign institutional investors pouring in $12 billion in the region so far this month, marking the strongest monthly inflow in a year and a half, the analysts added.

Aside from India, they highlighted that Taiwan has seen substantial inflows of $8 billion, its highest monthly inflow since late 2023.

Shares in BYD plunged more than 9% Monday, a steep drop from their record high last week, as investors assessed the Chinese electric-vehicle giant's price cuts on May 23.

The company announced on the Chinese social media platform Weibo that it was reducing the prices on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models until the end of June.

Shares of other Chinese automakers also declined Monday on worries that intense competition would lead to a price war.

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep rates on hold ""for a while"", he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" Monday.

Mortgage rates have been high for a few years and are likely to stay higher given that the housing market has been ""quite frozen,"" Kashkari noted.

It is also too soon for any changes by the Fed given that the current data at hand is outdated and does not reflect the ""full effect of the tariffs,"" he added.

""We're not yet seeing the full effect of tariffs on the cost of inputs, the lumber that we might buy from Canada, that is not yet fully showing up yet. There's also an immigration component. A lot of homes in America are built by immigrant workers, to the extent that there are fewer immigrants coming in to build homes, that also could have an effect on the housing market in the U.S,"" he explained.

Kashkari said that the Fed's slowdown of its balance sheet drawdown last month has placed it on a ""good trajectory"" and does not expect to see any major changes soon.

He also shared that it is too early to tell whether the dollar may be losing its dominance as the world's reserve currency. While the U.S. economy still retains the ""strongest fundamentals of any major economy"", there could be credible competitors to the dollar, making the dollar's movement ""something worth watching,"" he said.

Shares of Nippon Steel gained as much as 7% in early trade on Monday, on the back of U.S. President Donald Trump's support for the company's $14.9 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel.

The world's fourth-largest steelmaker was briefly the top performer on Japan's Nikkei 225 index.

The rally in Nippon Steel's shares comes as Trump noted that its ""planned partnership"" with U.S. Steel ""will create at least 70,000 jobs, and add $14 billion to the U.S. Economy.""

Trump's comments — which were posted on Truth Social last Friday — sent U.S. Steel shares up by 21%, as investors interpreted his views as a nod of approval on the long-planned takeover.

Shares of Australian logistics software company WiseTech Global surged as much as 5.67% Monday, following its announcement to acquire U.S. cloud computing firm E2Open for $2.1 billion.

WiseTech will pay $3.30 per share for E2open, a 28% premium to Friday's closing price in New York, the company announced on Monday.

The deal, which will be fully funded through a new $3 billion debt facility underwritten by a syndicate of nine lenders, including Deutsche Bank and HSBC, is in line with WiseTech's move to expand its global product and customer base.

The company, which is known for its CargoWise platform, will gain around 5,600 additional customers is expected to increase WiseTech's earnings-per-share in the first year, it added.

The acquisition comes just two months after Australia's largest pension fund AustralianSuper sold around 580 million Australian dollars ($377.35 million) worth of WiseTech stocks over corporate governance concerns.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he is considering taking $3 billion of previously awarded grant money for scientific and engineering research away from Harvard University and giving it to trade schools.

His comments on his social media platform Truth Social come less than a week after his administration sought to block the Ivy League school from enrolling foreign students as part of Trump's extraordinary effort to seize some government control of U.S. academia.

Trump, a Republican, has frozen some $3 billion in federal grants to Harvard in recent weeks, complaining that it has hired Democrats, ""Radical Left idiots and 'bird brains'"" as professors. Harvard, a private university, has sued to restore the funding, saying the cuts are an unconstitutional attack on its free speech rights and unlawful.

Most of that grant money is appropriated by Congress for the National Institutes of Health to disburse to fund biomedical research after a lengthy application process by individual scientists, work that is not typically done at trade schools.

It was not clear whether Trump was referring to Harvard grants his administration has already frozen. Harvard has said it was told that virtually all of its federal grant awards were revoked earlier in May, in a series of letters by the NIH, the U.S. Forest Service, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense and other agencies.

The letters each said the grants were being suspended because they ""no longer effectuate agency priorities.""

Harvard did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. The White House did not respond to questions about the specific funds Trump wants to repurpose or how it could be reallocated to trade schools under the law.

On Friday, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, a policy the university said was part of Trump's broader effort to retaliate against it for refusing to ""surrender its academic independence.""

The order provides temporary relief to thousands of international students, who were faced with potentially having to transfer under a policy that the university in Cambridge, Massachusetts called a ""blatant violation"" of the U.S. Constitution and other federal laws.

It said the move would have an ""immediate and devastating effect"" on the university and more than 7,000 visa holders.

Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, representing 27% of total enrollment and a significant chunk of its revenue from tuition fees.

The move was the latest escalation in a broader battle between Harvard and the White House, as Trump seeks to compel universities, law firms, news media, courts and other institutions to align with his agenda. Trump and fellow Republicans have long accused elite universities of left-wing bias.

In recent weeks, the administration has proposed ending Harvard's tax-exempt status and hiking taxes on its endowment, and opened an investigation into whether it violated civil rights laws by discriminating against ""white, Asian, male, or straight employees"" or job or training program applicants.

Harvard has said its hiring and admissions are compliant with the law.

Bitcoin treasury company Strategy on Monday announced another crypto buy, bringing its total holdings to over 580,250 BTC—worth $63.7 billion at today's prices. 

Strategy—formerly MicroStrategy—said it bought 4,020 BTC last week for an average price of $106,237 per digital coin. That's nearly another half billion worth, as the price of Bitcoin now hovers around $110,000.

The Tysons, Virginia-based software company is the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency, and now focuses on buying the asset—at its highs and lows—so that investors can get exposure to Bitcoin via its Nasdaq-listed shares. 

Strategy has acquired 4,020 BTC for ~$427.1 million at ~$106,237 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.8% YTD 2025. As of 5/25/2025, we hodl 580,250 $BTC acquired for ~$40.61 billion at ~$69,979 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/eAd03GIKam

— Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 26, 2025



Still, Strategy's most recent buy was smaller than recent transactions: the company spent $764.9 million and $1.34 billion in other weekly purchases earlier this month. 

Strategy stock (NASDAQ: MSTR) is right now trading at $369.51—nearly 8% lower than its Friday price. 

The company was last week hit with a lawsuit from an investor who alleged its executives made false and misleading statements about the profitability of its BTC-buying masterplan. Strategy stock took a hit after news of the lawsuit dropped. 

Over the long term, however, MSTR has rocketed since it started buying the leading cryptocurrency in 2020: It was trading for under $15 a pop back then and is up more than 2,400%. 

Other companies are now following its lead—albeit smaller ones—by snapping up Bitcoin as a way to get shareholders better value for money. Healthcare company Cosmos Health (NASDAQ: COSM) and auto firm Worksport (NASDAQ: WKSP) last year both announced plans to buy crypto with spare cash, and energy storage company KULR Technology Group (NASDAQ: KURL) has been fast-acquiring BTC. 

Bitcoin was recently trading for $109,826, up more than 2% over a 24-hour period, according to CoinGecko data. 

Just in April, the digital asset dropped below $75,000 when President Trump rattled markets with his trade war rhetoric but has since recovered and touched new highs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden's cashless-society rethink","https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-alternative-sweden-cashless-plans","Mon, 26 May 2025 11:52:45 GMT","

 Vitalik Buterin said there are ways Ethereum can function as a financial fallback in times of instability through hardware solutions. 

As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. 

In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. 

Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. 

“Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”

A former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.

Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week's worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden's reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. 

Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. 

When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations:

While crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. 

Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption. 

However, the executive said that instead of cryptocurrencies fully replacing fiat money as a payment method, the two payment options will coexist. 

Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that people will use crypto when it's easier and more practical.

What if the digital future still needs cash? While Sweden and Norway are rediscovering the importance of physical money in the face of systemic risks, Vitalik Buterin reignites the debate. In a statement shared on X, the Ethereum co-founder calls for strengthening the protocol's resilience and confidentiality. The goal is to make Ethereum a credible alternative to cash. This declaration marks a strategic turning point in the design of blockchain use cases in the post-cash era.

Norway has adopted a measure requiring merchants to accept cash payments, despite being a global leader in the use of cashless payment solutions. In a post published on the social network X (formerly Twitter) on May 25, 2025, Vitalik Buterin used this reality to defend a more resilient and confidential Ethereum, capable of playing the role of a cash substitute.

He wrote: 

Countries like Sweden and Norway show that even the most advanced societies can backtrack on dematerialization.

Long considered the ultimate models of a cashless society, these countries are now reassessing their dependence on centralized systems, particularly after observing their vulnerability to cyberattacks or infrastructure failures.

Thus, Sweden, which aimed for a total abandonment of cash by the end of this year, is now encouraging its citizens to reuse cash within a civil defense framework. In Norway, sanctions are even planned against merchants who refuse cash payments.

For Buterin, these subtle signals cannot be ignored. They serve as a direct warning to the crypto ecosystem. Even the most advanced digital structures remain vulnerable without autonomous backup solutions.

It is within this context that he calls for evolving Ethereum into a system capable of assuming this role of “digital cash”. According to him, this implies two major requirements:

This plea comes at a critical moment when blockchain ambitions collide with geopolitical realities and the limits of current technologies.

Buterin's message is therefore clear: to be a true digital sovereignty asset, Ethereum must first prove it can survive without the support of centralized structures it aims to replace.

Following his remarks, Buterin also stresses another fundamental point: the need to strengthen confidentiality within Ethereum. “For Ethereum to compete with cash, it must also become private,” he writes bluntly.

The anonymity offered by cash cannot be ignored if the blockchain aspires to become a true monetary substitute. Even today, Ethereum's default transparency of transactions constitutes a structural weakness for certain sensitive uses, which cash naturally protects.

The challenge is therefore twofold: preserving individual freedoms while respecting regulatory frameworks, an equation far from simple.

Technically, Ethereum is not yet up to this challenge. Transactions are fully traceable on the main chain. However, privacy solutions, whether “zero-knowledge proofs” or integrated into layer 2 systems, are still in development or controversial.

Moreover, some projects like Tornado Cash have been heavily sanctioned, which has slowed innovation in this area. Finally, network resilience still largely depends on external infrastructures, making any claim to autonomy equivalent to cash illusory in certain extreme situations.

Buterin's position, although clear-eyed, raises questions on several levels. If Ethereum wants to embody a “digital cash,” it will need to undergo a profound transformation, both technical and philosophical. It will no longer be a matter of accelerating transactions or lowering costs, but of guaranteeing a level of autonomy, confidentiality, and robustness that only physical systems still offer today. This transformation has already begun, as evidenced by the recent drop in transaction fees, triggering as many challenges as hopes for the future of decentralized finance.

The cryptocurrency sector inches higher on Monday, supported by a 0.3% increase in the total market capitalization to $3.58 trillion over 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) reversed the trend upwards, reaching an intraday high of around $110,228 while exchanging hands at approximately $109,654 at the time of writing. 

Top altcoins, including Ethereum (BTC), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), portray bullish outlooks, possibly building upon potential capital rotation as Bitcoin dominance consolidates at 64%.

Bitcoin rallied to new all-time highs of around $111,980 last week, supported by growing concerns about the sustainability of United States (US) debt. The concerns followed Moody's downgrade of the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1 on May 16. Moody's cited over a decade of rising government debt and interest payment ratios significantly higher than those of similarly rated sovereigns.

As market dynamics shifted, resulting in a significant increase in treasury yields, investors expanded their scope, embracing risk assets such as Bitcoin and other digital assets amid the need to diversify investments.

Bitcoin's stint at the new all-time highs was short-lived when US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union (EU), triggering a weekend sell-off to $106,600. Altcoins also trimmed gains alongside BTC. However, recoveries characterized the trading on Monday after President Trump delayed the implementation of the tariff on the EU until July 9.

Bitcoin's price hovers at $109,654 at the time of writing, up approximately 0.75% on the day. Most digital assets in the top ten, excluding the stablecoins, have sustained gains in the last 24 hours, including leading altcoins like Ethereum, Solana and Cardano.

The increase in digital asset inflows to $3.3 billion, according to CoinShares data, implies growing institutional and retail interest in crypto-related products. 

Bitcoin led the altcoins, achieving $2.9 billion in inflows, significantly contributing to a record year-to-date (YTD) sum of $10.8 billion. In comparison, the total asset under management (AUM) temporarily peaked at an all-time high of $187.5 billion earlier in the week.

The United States accounted for the lion's share of the inflows, recording $3.2 billion at the end of the week. At the same time, Germany, Australia, and Hong Kong contributed $41.5 million, $10.9 million and $33.3 million, respectively.

Inflows into Ethereum-related assets totaled $326 million, the highest level in 15 weeks, possibly due to positive sentiment surrounding the recent Pectra upgrade. This was also the fifth week in a row of gains.

The cross-border remittance token Ripple (XRP) suddenly broke its impressive 80-week inflow streak with $37.2 million outflows. This was the largest outflow on record.

“Growing concerns over the US economy, driven by the Moody's downgrade and the resulting spike in treasury yields, have prompted investors to seek diversification through digital assets,” the CoinShares weekly report states.

Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) posted a net weekly inflow of $2.75 billion, representing the third-highest weekly inflow since the products started trading in January 2024. Based on SoSoValue data, spot Ethereum ETFs saw a net weekly inflow of $248 million from all nine products.

Bitcoin showcases a bullish outlook, while bulls knock on the immediate resistance at $110,000. Bullish market sentiment could support the uptrend, targeting another breakout past the all-time highs.

The up-trending moving averages like the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $98,669, the 100-day EMA at $94,716 and the 200-day EMA at $89,875 steady the bullish structure.

BTC/USDT daily chart

Despite the solid bullish outlook, traders should pay attention to the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which could send a sell signal if the MACD line (blue) crosses below the signal line (red). Key monitoring levels on the downside include $106,639 (weekend support) and the demand area around $100,635, tested last on May 12.

Bitcoin dominance, which shows the percentage of BTC's market share compared to altcoins, is moving broadly sideways, slightly above 64%, as observed in the chart below. 

The consolidation comes after a sharp uptick from the drop to 62% on May 14. Investors could consider capital rotation by selling BTC at a profit and channeling the proceeds to select altcoins like Ethereum and Cardano.

BTC.D 4-hour chart 

The direction Bitcoin dominance will take in the coming days will provide more information on whether altcoins will sustain the gains or pull back from current and recent highs.

In the meantime, the 4-hour charts below highlight a minor bullish bias in the Ethereum and Cardano price performance. Both assets sit above key moving averages, including the 50-, 100-, and 200 EMAs.

The MACD on the ETH/USDT chart confirmed a buy signal, suggesting that increasing demand could drive ETH's price above the $2,600 hurdle if traders seek exposure.

ETH/USDT and ADA/USDT 4-hour charts

Cardano also flaunts a buy signal from the MACD indicator, confirmed when the MACD line (blue) crossed above the signal line (red). Support is anticipated above the 50-period EMA at $0.76. Still, the 100 EMA at $.75 and the 200 EMA at $0.74 are in line to absorb the potential selling pressure, especially if gains toward $0.80 falter in upcoming sessions.

Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset's network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. 

A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.

Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates influence crypto assets mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset's price climbs.

As Sweden and Norway rethink their stance on cash, Buterin sees an opportunity for Ethereum.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes that if decentralized networks become more robust and private, they can support national efforts to reduce reliance on cash.

In a May 25 post on X, Buterin commented on recent developments in Sweden and Norway, where authorities are rethinking their near-total shift toward digital payments.

Both countries have led the global trend in phasing out physical cash, but emerging security concerns are forcing a change in approach.

According to reports, the governments are urging citizens to keep using cash as a form of national preparedness. The recommendation follows growing worries about cyber warfare and the potential expansion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Officials argue that in the event of network failures or hostile attacks, cash remains the most accessible and resilient payment method.

The shift highlights a broader tension between innovation and stability in national financial systems. While digital payments offer speed and convenience, recent events suthey'rehey're not yet a complete substitute for physical money in high-risk scenarios.

In Buterin's view, the centralized digital systems were too fragile to withstand geopolitical shocks, which invariably made cash “necessary.”

According to him:

“Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile. Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”

Buterin sees these concerns as an opening for Ethereum to step in, but only if the network evolves.

He suggested Ethereum could offer a more durable alternative if it could operate securely, privately, and independently of single points of failure.

Buterin said:

“Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role.”

He stressed that Ethereum would need to improve significantly before supporting such critical infrastructure. That includes enhancing privacy protections and increasing its system resilience by decentralizing more.

Already, the network is making significant changes by introducing new features that improve its functionality. However, Ethereum still faces technical barriers, such as scalability issues and transaction costs, which might impede its adoption in such emergencies.

With Bitcoin (BTC) holding just under its all-time high Monday morning, altcoins have posted gains in recent days—albeit with most tokens still a fair distance from their peaks.

Avalanche (AVAX) is one of the biggest altcoin winners on the day, climbing 5.8% to $23.67 over the past 24 hours in the wake of last week's London Avalanche Summit. During the event, it was announced that the soccer governing body FIFA will migrate its FIFA Collect NFT platform to its own dedicated Avalanche layer-1 blockchain. However, AVAX remains down 83.7% from its all-time high reached in 2021.

World (WLD), previously Worldcoin, is one of the biggest altcoin winners from the week, jumping 27.2% to $1.38. This comes in the same month that the eyeball-scanning project was rolled out across the U.S., after previously barring Americans from participating in the World ID system. Again, the token is some way off its all-time high, down 88.2% from its peak in March 2024.

Conversely, Hyperliquid (HYPE) has set a new all-time high of $39.68, soaring 50.4% over the past seven days.

The move comes as a self-defined high risk leverage trader known as James Wynn made a $1 billion Bitcoin (BTC) bet via the Hyperliquid's perp decentralized exchange—which they supposedly closed at a massive loss. Wynn has since opened a near $75 million leveraged long on Bitcoin (BTC) and a $19.3 million long on meme coin KPEPE, according to HypurrScan.

Other altcoins have seen gains over the past 24 hours. Bittensor (TAO) has surged 6.4%, Optimism (OP) has grown 5.6%, Arbitrum (ARB) 4.7%, Aptos (APT) 5.1%, and Internet Computer (ICP) 4.5%. Still, all of these altcoins remain some distance from their all-time highs.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) has climbed just 2.2% to $109,779 and is within touching distance of its all-time high of $111,814 that it set four days ago.

Much of this green movement came after President Trump announced that the U.S. would delay its 50% tariff on European Union goods. In April Trump originally planned to impose a 20% tariff on the EU, later reducing it to 10%, and on Friday he threatened to raise the tariffs to 50% on June 1. The new deadline of July 9 allows additional time for the U.S. and EU to negotiate.

Bitcoin dominance has been on the rise since late 2022, according to CoinGecko, with the orange coin then claiming 36.95% of the top 10 crypto market cap and now sitting at 61.12%.

eToro Australia analyst Reece Hobson previously told Decrypt that altcoin season will kick off once quantitative easing kicks in and Bitcoin dominance hits 70%, a figure it isn't too far from—which could go some way towards explaining why altcoins are starting to pick up the pace.

As demand for Bitcoin outstrips supply, and confidence in bonds is in steep decline, Bitcoin and related coins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) go from strength to strength.

According to the US Debt Clock, the US is looking at a national burden of over $36.8T, which translates to $107,745 per citizen in 2025.



This, while US consumer confidence is at a 13-year low, falling by 7.9 points in April 2025, based on a report by The Conference Board. 

According to Stephanie Guichard, Senior Economist at The Conference Board:

Making matters worse, overseas investors have started to flee the chaotic US markets and seek refuge in Japan's equities and long-term bonds. The migration translated to over $56.6B changing markets in April alone. .

The result? Stock market low, bond yields high, Bitcoin price even higher.

Bitcoin is pushing to $110K at the time of writing, marking a clear shift in the financial paradigm.

Rising US bond yields, stalling global growth, and concerns about financial instability and inflation are leading many investors to pivot to crypto and Bitcoin as a hedge.

Indeed, Bitcoin is known to thrive in rough financial waters, and today, this is buoyed by institutional investors racing to stack $BTC at an unprecedented rate.

Based on the latest data, global companies and ETFs now control more than 15% of the total supply of Bitcoin, or 3.23M tokens.

Of these, Michael Saylor's Strategy dominates the news with its frequent Bitcoin buys. Today, Strategy owns 576,230 $BTC, worth roughly $63B at the current price.



But it's not alone. A quick peek at CoinGecko's chart shows a growing leaderboard with 34 major public companies all engaged in a FOMO-driven Bitcoin race.



The situation is so surreal that Strategy's Bitcoin stacking alone supersedes the total global mining output by a rate of almost 4:1.

In other words, Saylor's demand of 2,000 bitcoins per day is outstripping the 450 bitcoins per day supply coming from BTC miners.

SYZ Capital's Managing Partner, Richard Byworth, called this the ‘Bitcoin supply problem,' suggesting that Bitcoin is essentially facing a bottleneck, with the demand outpacing the supply by a great margin.

In the long term, this could cause Bitcoin to be sold out of circulation, creating a climate where it would be very easy to sell Bitcoin but very difficult to buy.

UXTO's Guillaume Girard reiterates this problem in his ‘Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,' stating that:

‘We're entering a new era of Bitcoin adoption—one that is not driven by hype cycles, but by balance sheet fundamentals, sovereign strategy, and long-term fiduciary mandates. […] More than $400 billion in institutional capital will flow into Bitcoin by the end of 2026.'

As Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a safe haven or strategic asset, some of the best altcoins will surely follow closely. One contender is BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL), a top new meme coin that's strapping itself to Bitcoin for the long haul.

BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) attracts investors with free $BTC airdrops and $BTCBULL rewards as Bitcoin reaches key price points ($150K, $200K, $250K) for the first time.

It's earned a reputation as one of the best presales today thanks to its FOMO-driven ecosystem, promise of generous rewards, and close association with Bitcoin.



The project is based on the idea that Bitcoin is unstoppable and will reach and even surpass the $1M price evaluation.

Based on that, the team is using Bitcoin's reputation and potential as a launching pad for $BTCBULL, hoping to rally both Bitcoin maximalists and meme coin mavens around the project.

$BTCBULL is an unapologetic meme coin that's managed to accumulate over $6,3M in its presale since its start on February 10, 2025. The token price currently stands at $0.00253, a low presale price that looks set to see exponential growth post-launch.

If you're curious to learn more, check out our ‘how to buy $BTCBULL' guide for more details and to simplify the purchasing process.

Just note that you need to hold your $BTCBULL in Best Wallet to qualify for the upcoming $BTC airdrops.

When considering the state of the traditional markets, it's no wonder investors are migrating to Bitcoin and crypto in general.

Bitcoin's biggest bull run lies ahead, while a meme coin like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) can multiply your BTC gains and help you ride the next run all the way to the bank.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Investor Behind $500M Crypto Portfolio Shares 5 Altcoins He's Watching—Memecoins Included","https://www.tribuneindia.com/partner-exclusives/investor-behind-500m-crypto-portfolio-shares-5-altcoins-hes-watching-memecoins-included/","Mon, 26 May 2025 17:02:00 GMT","

A millionaire investor in the cryptocurrency market, managing assets totaling $500 million, has selected five altcoins to build a $50 million portfolio. Surprisingly, memecoins dominate his selection. This article examines the coins he's chosen and explores the reasons behind his bullish stance on these meme-based tokens.





The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal.



During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges.

The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization.



So far, more than $13 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors.

In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors aren't just spectators—they're rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It's a game where the most passionate players win big. 

With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary.

Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke, featuring the Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum cap. What began as a ""memecoin"" gained serious traction in 2021. Social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, propelled it into the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, reaching over $50 billion. This surge highlighted the power of online communities and the impact of social media on financial markets.

But is Dogecoin attractive in today's market? Its technology is similar to other cryptocurrencies, using blockchain to secure transactions. However, its unlimited supply means it's less scarce than Bitcoin or Ethereum. Some believe this could limit its price growth over time. Yet, its strong community and widespread recognition keep it in the spotlight. In a market where trends shift rapidly, Dogecoin remains a wildcard. Investors should consider market volatility and the coin's fundamentals. While it lacks the technical advancements of some other projects, its cultural impact is undeniable. Whether it's a good investment depends on your appetite for risk and belief in the power of memes.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin, but it sets itself apart by running on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi, SHIB began with a supply of one quadrillion tokens. To build trust, half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, boosting SHIB's popularity. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB's Ethereum base allows it to interact with decentralized applications like ShibaSwap. This paves the way for future projects like an NFT platform and a decentralized governance system.

SHIB's integration with Ethereum gives it potential beyond being just a meme coin. It can support smart contracts and decentralized finance applications, opening doors to various projects. In the current market cycle, SHIB's unique features and active community make it stand out among other cryptocurrencies. While the crypto market is always changing, SHIB's developments and plans for expansion make it interesting to watch. Compared to other memecoins, SHIB's utility and technology may offer it more staying power in the evolving crypto landscape.

PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum, paying tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Aiming to ride the wave of popular meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE institutes a no-tax policy and keeps things pure and simple as a memecoin. In late April to May 2023, PEPE's market cap skyrocketed to $1.6 billion, making millionaires out of early holders and attracting a strong community. This surge sparked a ""memecoin season,"" with other meme coins experiencing wild price swings.

PEPE's potential lies in its viral appeal and dedicated community. Its roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a ""meme takeover,"" signaling big ambitions. While it lacks utility, its simplicity is part of its charm. In the current market, with anticipation building for Bitcoin's next halving and hopes for a bull run, PEPE could continue to gain traction. Compared to established meme coins like Dogecoin, PEPE is a newcomer with high risk and potentially high reward. For those who believe in the power of memes and are willing to take a chance, PEPE might be an attractive option.

BONK is a new meme coin on the Solana blockchain that's turning heads in the crypto world. With a fun Shiba Inu mascot, it aims to give power back to the community by moving it away from big venture capital players. After getting listed on Coinbase, BONK's value shot up by over 100%. To spread the word and involve more people, it airdropped half of its total supply to Solana's NFT and DeFi users, boosting excitement and participation across the network.

Though BONK has grown quickly and found its place in Solana's ecosystem, it does face some hurdles like having a large total supply and the ups and downs common with meme coins. On the bright side, it's making strides by joining a growing number of decentralized apps, including plans for a new exchange called BonkSwap. In today's market, where community-driven coins are gaining ground, BONK's grassroots approach makes it stand out. Compared to other meme coins, BONK could have an edge thanks to Solana's fast and efficient network. For those interested in emerging crypto projects, BONK presents an intriguing opportunity in the ever-evolving digital currency space.

While DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) combines memes and sports for huge growth, making it a standout in the memecoin space.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Blockchain Firm Explains Why Ethereum Price Can't Hold Above $2,700","https://bitcoinist.com/why-ethereum-price-is-pushed-back-around-2800/","Mon, 26 May 2025 03:00:25 GMT","

The Ethereum price is undoubtedly in a better place in recent weeks than it was in the year's first quarter. However, the “king of altcoins” appears to be stuck in a loop — one involving repeated pushbacks at a specific price level.

After riding the week's bullish momentum, the Ethereum price faced significant downward pressure above $2,700 and has since crashed to around where it started the week. Below is the underlying factor for ETH's struggles above $2,700.

In a May 24 post on X, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shared fresh on-chain insights into the movement of the Ethereum price over the past few days. According to the crypto platform, the next most significant level for the price of ETH lies at around $2,800.

The rationale behind this on-chain observation is the cost-basis distribution of the ETH supply. The relevant metric here is cost basis distribution (CBD), which reflects the total Ethereum supply held by addresses with an average cost basis within specific price brackets.



As shown in the chart above, the CBD metric uses a heatmap with fixed price bracket levels (on the vertical axis) for a given period (on the horizontal axis). This indicator offers insights into trend shifts in investor cost basis over a specific period.

Glassnode noted that there is a significant cluster of investor cost-basis distribution around the $2,800 Ethereum price level. Basically, this implies that several investors acquired their coins around this price region.

Going further, Glassnode explained that the Ethereum price may witness significant sell-side pressure as it approaches the CBD cluster around $2,800. This phenomenon is based on the propensity of several previously underwater investors to look to offload their assets near breakeven.

This on-chain revelation explains why the Ethereum price has been facing rejection above the $2,700 mark over the past few weeks. For the second-largest cryptocurrency to break above this supply barrier, the demand for ETH around the CBD cluster must outweigh the selling pressure.

                              May 26, 2025                            

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has appointed Bilal Bin Saqib as the Special Assistant to the PM (SAPM) on Blockchain and Crypto, with the status of state minister.

This groundbreaking decision positions Pakistan among an elite group of 7-9 nations, including the United States, El Salvador, and the UAE, with dedicated leadership for cryptocurrency and blockchain, signalling a bold commitment to leading the global digital economy.

Saqib also serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) and Chief Advisor to the Finance Minister.

As CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, Bilal has spearheaded strategic collaborations and built critical bridges between Pakistan and global technology stakeholders. 

Under his leadership, the Council signed a landmark partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLF) — a decentralised finance platform backed by US President Donald Trump — to help drive blockchain innovation and stablecoin adoption in Pakistan. 

He also invited Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder of Binance, and appointed him as Strategic Advisor to the PCC to help shape regulatory development, infrastructure expansion, and education programs for crypto in Pakistan.

A graduate of the London School of Economics (LSE) with a Master's in Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship, he has been featured in Forbes Asia 30 Under 30 for his work in social impact. 

Saqib has also been honoured with the prestigious MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) from King Charles III.

As SAPM, Bilal will be responsible for:

●	Developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets

●	Launching Bitcoin mining initiatives

●	Overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records

●	Facilitating licensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)

●	Championing investor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth in Pakistan

This appointment reflects Pakistan's commitment to aligning with global trends. Just as the United States has brought leaders like David Sacks — appointed by Trump as the White House AI and Crypto Czar — into its digital policy framework, Pakistan is taking a forward-thinking approach by empowering a youth leader to help steer national strategy in emerging technologies. 

Pakistan stands at a critical digital crossroads. The country consistently ranks in the top 10 globally for crypto adoption, according to the 2023 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index, with approximately 40 million crypto users and an annual crypto trading volume exceeding $300 billion. The nation produces around 40,000 IT graduates annually and boasts the 4th largest freelancer market worldwide.

This rapid uptake of emerging technologies, combined with a youthful population where over 60% of citizens are under the age of 30, positions Pakistan to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of blockchain and crypto advancements in the coming decade. 

Strategic policymaking in these fields is not just an opportunity but a national imperative.

According to Saqib: “Pakistan's unique demographic and digital landscape offers an unprecedented opportunity to leapfrog into the future of technology—where blockchain and crypto will drive economic growth, innovation, and global competitiveness.”

 Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has appointed Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib as special assistant on blockchain and crypto. 

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif appointed Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib as his special assistant on blockchain and crypto.

Saqib's appointment takes effect immediately under Rule 4(6) of the Rules of Business, 1973. He has been granted the status of minister of state and will serve without salary or official benefits, according to a May 26 report in the English-language local news outlet, Pakistan Observer.

The move follows a series of government initiatives aimed at strengthening Pakistan's presence in the digital asset space. Just one day prior, Pakistan allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity exclusively for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers.

In mid-May, Pakistan's Ministry of Finance also endorsed the creation of a dedicated body to regulate the country's blockchain-based financial infrastructure. The Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) will serve as a regulatory body to oversee licensing, regulate exchanges, custodians, wallets, tokenized platforms, stablecoins and decentralized finance applications.

Saqib is a graduate of the London School of Economics in the United Kingdom and received the title of Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire from King Charles III. He currently leads the Pakistan Crypto Council, where he appointed former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao as an adviser. He was also named in the Forbes 30 under 30 list.

As a special assistant to the prime minister, Saqib will be tasked with drafting Financial Action Task Force (FATF)-compliant crypto regulations, launching state-backed Bitcoin (BTC) mining projects, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, land records and finance. He will not receive a salary, perks or privileges, according to Pakistan Observer.

Pakistan is diving headfirst into the crypto industry. In late April, the Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial has signed a Letter of Intent with the Pakistan Crypto Council to accelerate crypto adoption in the country, one of the industry's fastest-growing markets.

Pakistani regulators recently proposed a regulatory framework for digital assets that is compliance-focused and in line with rules laid out by the FATF. Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Director Sumera Azam described the framework as a “paradigm shift in how Pakistan views digital finance.” “The policy proposal seeks to strike a historic balance between technological advancement and national security imperatives,” Azam said in April.

In the world of crypto gaming, we're seeing a significant move that could reshape the landscape.

Avalanche-based battle royale shooter ‘Off the Grid' is transitioning to its GUNZ mainnet, igniting its NFT marketplace with high-value sales even before its June launch on Steam.

Despite the uncertainty of Steam accepting crypto-based games on the platform, this might be another arrow in the quiver of global crypto acceptance, as it potentially shows a seismic shift from Steam's previous ban on blockchain games (if the game is successfully listed).

There are two sides to every coin, however. And the flip side is that the Ethereum-based MMORPG, ‘Ember Sword', has announced its closure due to funding challenges. Despite a hyped launch and significant initial player pledges, it couldn't secure the necessary backing to continue.

Beyond this, Ubisoft is relaunching ‘Champions Tactics' on Steam, albeit without its NFT features, and Mythical Games' ‘FIFA Rivals' has pre-opened for registrations. Funding news offers a glimmer of optimism, with Voya Games securing $5M.

The crypto game space is a mixed bag of promising expansions and cautionary tales as it evolves. The contrasting fortunes of ‘Off the Grid' and ‘Ember Sword' are a tale as old as time in crypto. While some projects experience headwinds, others capture player imagination and generate real economic activity.

What do they offer and why should you invest? Let's see.

The SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is your key to the SUBBD ecosystem, fueling a next-gen AI content platform where creators can flourish and, crucially, where you as a fan can unlock unprecedented levels of interaction and reward.

Just as successful game economies depend on engaged communities and valuable assets, $SUBBD empowers you to general real economic activity within the evolving digital content space.

Holding $SUBBD means you're far more than a passive subscriber. You'll be able to use AI tools to co-create unique content (with approval from your favorite creators), and even design and monetize your own AI avatars.



This isn't about static subscriptions: it's a dynamic experience where your engagement actively unlocks new perks, making it one of the best new crypto.

Backed by an impressive 250M+ combined social reach, SUBBD is positioned to redefine the creator-fan relationship.

GUNZ ($GUN) is the native currency of the GUNZ Layer-1 blockchain, specifically built to power the community-driven economies within AAA games like Off the Grid.

It's the fuel that puts you in charge of your in-game experience and assets, demonstrating how established projects can navigate the volatile landscape successfully.

With $GUN, you're building real value. It lets you own your in-game items as on-chain NFTs, meaning you can securely trade, sell, or even rent out your gear in a player-driven economy.

While $GUN stays within the game to ensure compliance, you can convert it into valuable NFT assets and withdraw them to trade on external marketplaces. $GUN is used for everything from marketplace transactions and minting fees within Off the Grid to acquiring customizations.

The ecosystem is already battle-tested, supporting over 14M wallets and processing hundreds of millions of transactions. It's gaming where your achievements and assets are truly yours to command.

Solaxy ($SOLX) is the pioneering Layer 2 blockchain designed to expand Solana's horizons, offering the kind of foundational technology crucial for industry development.

The beating heart of the project is the $SOLX token, your key to experiencing the next evolution of Solana, unlocking faster transaction speeds and lower fees.



If you want a smoother, more efficient way to navigate the Solana ecosystem, $SOLX provides just that. It addresses key pinch points like network congestion, failed transactions, and scalability issues that plague the existing Solana network.

Using $SOLX will give you access to staking rewards of 99% APY, and early entry into a wave of innovative dApps and experiences built to leverage the new L2. In terms of utility and solving a real problem, $SOLX is one of the best crypto presales.

Think next-gen gaming, high-performance DeFi, and novel digital asset interactions, all running with enhanced efficiency.

Solaxy, with $SOLX, is about charting those new frontiers on Solana. Get ready for a seamlessly powerful experience with one of the best altcoins of 2025.

Singapore, Singapore, May 26th, 2025, Chainwire



Gomble Games, the Web3 gaming business behind hit title EggDrop, officially launches GOMBLE BUILDERS, a creator platform where communities co-develop games, contribute assets, and share in the upside—while the finished games are built to reach millions of mainstream mobile users across the world.

GOMBLE BUILDERS empowers supporters, NFT holders, meme token communities, and developers to come together to shape game content from the ground up. From asset licensing and gameplay concepts to AI-powered characters and IP integrations, every contributor plays a part in creation and gets rewarded for it. But unlike most Web3 projects, these games aren't limited to crypto-native audiences. They're designed for mass-market players across app stores and mobile platforms, making this one of the first creator-powered Web3 pipelines built for Web2-scale adoption.

The platform's first Proof-of-Concept is an NFT licensing marketplace. NFT holders can submit their assets and ideas to be featured in GOMBLE games. If selected, those IPs will be integrated into actual titles, and contributors will receive a share of the revenue generated from the licensed IPs—connecting digital ownership with mainstream game economies in a real, measurable way.

GOMBLE BUILDERS is supported by a powerful roster of Web3 partners: Story for IP provenance, PG/Jirasan and DXNK for NFT integrations, Adventure Layer—an AI-native onchain gaming L2 developed by Adventure Gold (AGLD DAO)—and AWE for AI-powered logic, and meme communities like MEW, Sundog, and Hippo, who bring cultural resonance and fan-driven engagement.

At the core of this collaborative economy is $GM, GOMBLE's native token. $GM fuels licensing, incentives, and creator rewards within BUILDERS, and its utility will only expand as more games are developed and played. As the GOMBLE ecosystem grows, so does the demand and relevance of $GM—making it more than just a token, but the economic engine behind a scalable creator economy.

With BUILDERS, Gomble Games is setting the stage for a new development model: games made by communities, for the masses—where ownership, creativity, and rewards flow together.

About GOMBLE

GOMBLE is a Web3 gaming platform with a mission to onboard over 2 billion mobile casual gamers into Web3.

Founded by a team of veterans from 111%, GOMBLE merges deep expertise in game development with blockchain technology to build an ecosystem where anyone can easily play, contribute, and earn within Web3 games.

More information is available at GOMBLE's Vision Paper.

                            The American company claims the Alpha5 will reach 60 mph (96 km/h) in just 2.99 seconds, thanks to its dual-motor EV powertrain                        

The all-electric DeLorean Alpha5 has been a long time in the making, and it's finally getting closer to production. However, if you're looking to pre-order one, you'll have to jump through a few hoops, and specifically, purchasing an NFT to secure an allocation. 

It's hard not to question the logic of turning NFTs into the key to securing an electric car, especially since the company hasn't even delivered a single vehicle yet or shown the car in its final production form, but here we are.

Also: DeLorean Alpha5 EV Makes Its Public Debut At Pebble Beach

It's important to note that the Alpha5 is built by a company known as DeLorean Motor Company, which, confusingly, has absolutely no connection to the original company that built the DMC-12. Indeed, it grew out of a DeLorean parts and service business. So, while the name might bring up nostalgic memories of the '80s and time travel, the company itself doesn't have a history of manufacturing cars.

Nevertheless, the company has established an odd reservation system for the Alpha5, which will be capped at just 4,000 units. DeLorean has launched an online marketplace, where customers will need to pay $2,500 to secure a ‘Build Slot NFT,' which will be assigned to a random build slot number. But the process is a little more complex than that.

First, you have to set up a digital Slush Wallet, then purchase the NFT using DMC or USDC, which are two cryptocurrencies based on the Sui blockchain. Once that's done, you can secure your Alpha5, or if you change your mind before the car is even built, you can try to resell the NFT on DeLorean's platform. As of now, only six Build Slot NFTs have been purchased, so good luck getting in early.

As for the actual car? Well, it seems to be a work in progress. Final pricing details for the new DeLorean have yet to be announced, and the specifications have not been finalized either. When first presented as a prototype three years ago, DeLorean said the Alpha5 would feature two electric motors, allowing it to hit 60 mph (96 km/h) in 2.99 seconds. DeLorean had also promised 300 miles (483 km) of driving range and a 100 kWh battery pack.

Transparency is the cornerstone of accountability, and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) is designed to increase transparency. But this legislation isn't just about responding to requests; public authorities must also publish information proactively. This allows the public to routinely access information that is in the public interest and is safe to disclose. 

The ICO's Upstream Regulation team is here to support public authorities to be open and accountable with the public you serve. In my blog last summer, I mentioned that compliance with the duty to proactively publish information is an area we intended to look at. This is an update on where we're up to with that work. 

Publication schemes 

The Freedom of Information Act requires all public authorities to have a publication scheme, to publish information in accordance with it, and to regularly review it.  

We looked at whether more than 70 public authorities - from sectors including health, education and local government - had publication schemes. We identified 18 that didn't have one published on their website and made further enquiries with them all. Following our work, all have now taken steps to comply with this requirement and publish more information proactively. We have also been made aware of other public authorities who have heard about our work in this area and have then updated their publication schemes. 

It's worth remembering that public authorities shouldn't just look at publication schemes as a legal requirement - they help people to find, or be directed to, relevant information that has already been published. We asked our stakeholders whether they agree or disagree that proactively publishing information has helped their ability to manage FOI request volumes. More respondents agreed (33.5%) than disagreed (23.5%). You can read how proactive publication has helped the London Borough of Camden free up staff time to concentrate on other FOI requests as a result of being able to handle more enquiries as “business as usual”. 

In order to put a publication scheme in place, you should adopt our model publication scheme and use our definition documents to publish a guide (or index) to help requesters locate the published information. Both the guide and the linked content need to be kept up to date. You'll also need to know what you want to publish. Last year we worked with WhatDoTheyKnow to understand what people were looking for when submitting FOI requests. You can read our findings in this blog which helps public authorities across a range of sectors to consider whether proactive publication of this information would benefit their organisation and help to reduce information requests. 

Publication of compliance statistics 

As part of our work on proactive publication, we also looked at whether the same public authorities were publishing their compliance statistics, which is set out as good practice in part 8.5 of the code of practice issued under section 45 of FOIA. We found 13 that did not and, following our engagement with them, all now do so. 

Since publishing our FOI and Transparency regulatory manual public authorities, and all have begun doing so, helping build a greater culture of transparency and accountability. Our data collection template can help you compile these compliance statistics. 

Advice for the public 

We understand that managing large volumes of FOI requests can be challenging, and our focus in this area hasn't solely been on what public authorities can do. We have also published tips for those making requests to help them access information already available before making a request. If your organisation has FOI resources online, are you providing similar advice to requestors? 

Next steps 

We will continue to build an evidence base of the benefits of proactive transparency and include proactive publication as part of our overall approach to supporting public authorities with their compliance of FOIA. If you've noticed that proactively publishing information has had an impact on your caseloads, please tell us about your experiences. 

We have reprimanded the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham (the council) after it left exposed the personal information of 6,528 people for almost two years.  

We have fined Newcastle based sole trader Darian Bishop, trading as ECO4U, £50,000 for making over 194,000 unlawful marketing calls to people on the UK's 'do not call' register.

In October 2023, the British Library reported a ransomware attack to us, which escalated because of the lack of multi-factor authentication on an administrator account.  

We have fined AFK Letters Co Ltd (AFK) £90,000 for making more than 95,000 unsolicited marketing calls to people registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), in a clear breach of electronic marketing laws.

US states continue their foray into the digital assets sector, following in the footsteps of President Donald Trump.

In the first six months or so of his term, Trump ordered the creation of a Federal Reserve comprising Bitcoin, while also investigating a digital asset stockpile for cryptocurrencies seized as proceeds of crime.

Now, Michigan is the latest state gearing up to join the wave of financial innovation. The Northern state bordering Canada recently introduced a series of bills seeking to make crypto a part of Michigan's ecosystem.

So, let's find out how the local government plans to revolutionise its finances by…using oil rigs for Bitcoin mining (it's much less outrageous than it sounds).

Related: GENIUS Act Anti-Corruption Amendment Planned to Foil Trump Stablecoin Profiteering

The primary focus of Michigan's venture is to rejig legislation around retirement assets for residents.

Currently, public retirement systems – those looking after public servants such as educators and government workers – do not allow investment in digital currencies.

House Bill 4510 is looking to change that by introducing policies supporting crypto as a retirement asset. The bipartisan bill has some restrictions though. For example, only digital currencies with a market cap of over $250 billion USD ($384 billion AUD) are eligible.

So just Bitcoin and Ethereum, for now.

Additionally, investors can only expose their pensions to these assets via exchange-traded products (ETPs).

So yeah, Fink and BlackRock will continue to get richer.

Michigan lawmakers introduced several bipartisan bills today that seek to position the state as a leader in crypocurrency and blockchain innovation: pic.twitter.com/HhKVZKwaX1

Nevertheless, if the bill passes, it will be yet another example of how cryptocurrency is finding its feet in modern finance. 

It might not be exactly what Satoshi envisioned fifteen years ago, but Bitcoin has cemented itself as part of the world's financial future.

Retirement policies and strategic reserves have been key to crypto's growth in acceptance across the United States. Texas and Arizona recently greenlit new frameworks supporting crypto investment for these purposes.

However, that's not all that's on Michigan's agenda.

The second bill working through the House of Reps, number 4511, would prevent the state from being involved in any sort of Federal, USD-based cryptocurrency.

Simply put, it is a rejection of a central-backed digital currency (CBDC), which has been a cause of significant discourse across governments and crypto communities.

But, perhaps most interesting, are the final two crypto-related proposals, House Bill 4512 and 4513.

The first bill suggests that Michigan allows Bitcoin mining agencies to set up base at abandoned oil and gas sites, leveraging the pre-existing source of power. To make this more appealing, the secondary, accompanying bill proposes that businesses receive a tax incentive for participating in the initiative.

It's an ambitious goal for Michigan, and one that will need to endure the scrutiny of policymakers before going live.

But if it succeeds, it could revolutionise how Bitcoin miners manage their environmental impact in the United States.

Jakarta, Pintu News – Latin America is back in the cryptocurrency spotlight. Argentina faced controversy over the closure of investigations into the $Libra scandal, while Colombia launched an ambitious central bank digital currency (CBDC) project.

The President of Argentina, Javier Milei, disbanded the Investigative Task Force (UTI) set up to investigate the $Libra cryptocurrency scandal. This decision came after the UTI submitted their findings to the prosecutor's office, although no official report has been made public. The move drew criticism from the opposition who accused the government of trying to cover up involvement in the scandal.

The $Libra scandal began when Milei promoted the token on social media in February 2025, causing a significant price spike before it plummeted, resulting in huge losses for investors. Although Milei claims to have only shared information without direct involvement, many have alleged market manipulation and insider trading.

Meanwhile, Colombia announced the launch of a CBDC project built on the Cosmos network. The project aims to improve the efficiency of cross-border payments and strengthen the country's financial system. According to Maghnus Mareneck, co-CEO of Interchain Labs, this CBDC was developed in collaboration with a consortium of banks and the Colombian government.

Colombia's move reflects a global trend where countries are beginning to adopt blockchain technology to improve their financial systems. By utilizing Cosmos' infrastructure, Colombia hopes to create faster, safer, and more transparent payment solutions.

Developments in Argentina and Colombia show a contrast in approaches to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. While Argentina faces challenges in regulation and transparency, Colombia is taking proactive steps in adopting new technologies to strengthen its financial system.

Both cases highlight the importance of a clear and transparent regulatory framework in managing technological innovation in the financial sector. For investors and industry observers, these developments are important indicators in understanding the dynamics of crypto markets in Latin America.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","The Last Currency: On Crypto and the Banality of Extinction","https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-last-currency-on-crypto-and-the-banality-of-extinction/","Mon, 26 May 2025 09:56:00 GMT","

To consolidate present and future power, right-wing libertarians and their Trumpist allies depend on two things: the dismantling of the administrative state on one hand and a near-extinction event on the other. Cryptocurrency offers them just that — a critical bridge for a coup not just over what remains of the state, but over the future itself, or more precisely, its ruins. The text that follows, adapted from my book “Climate Propagandas,” charts how crypto became a cornerstone of this libertarian project: a speculative economy, a political weapon, and a mechanism of planetary extraction disguised as innovation.

The emergence of cryptocurrency is a key right-wing libertarian building block to turn their visions of Martian colonies and floating cities for the super-rich into a reality. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have been joined by thousands of cryptocurrencies, which at a peak in 2021 totaled an estimated value of more than 3 trillion dollars before facing a major downfall following the high-profile collapse of the FTX international exchange for crypto assets.

Today, self-declared “crypto president” Trump, who launched his own $TRUMP meme coin three days before the inauguration of his second regime, is actively building a national stockpile of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. His family has personally profited at least 1 billion dollars from their crypto schemes so far.

Cryptocurrency runs on blockchain technology — designed by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, who might be either an individual or a group — and is a stateless virtual currency that can operate without control by governments or banks, though established financial institutions are doing their best to capitalize on the market. It's the libertarian dream, following their adulation of (neo)liberal economist Friedrich von Hayek, whose book “The Denationalization of Money” (1976) relished the possibility of a future in which regulatory democracy would be removed entirely from the production, distribution, and management of capital.

It is not surprising that libertarian propagandists are leading supporters of the cryptocurrency market. Elon Musk's companies held $1.5 billion in Bitcoin before becoming a core supporter of the “Dogecoin,” a cryptocurrency that started as a mockery of Bitcoin using the famous “Doge” meme consisting of a Shiba Inu dog with its eyes wide open, onto which users would place the dog's supposed misspelled internal monologue. After Musk declared himself the “Dogefather,” announcing that Tesla products could now be purchased with Dogecoin, the value of the coin rose by 50 percent, before plummeting in the subsequent crisis.

Today, Musk's branding exercise has expanded into his very own government organization: Department of Government Efficiency, or “DOGE” in short, that is formally tasked with identifying government inefficiency, but in reality aims to dismantle the administrative state altogether. The aim of DOGE, the agency, and Dogecoin, the currency, at the core is the same: the complete replacement of existing political and financial institutions and entities, in order for a new private corporate order to take charge, removing any democratic checks and balances along the way. For libertarians, cryptocurrency and the ideal of decentralized finance, or “DeFi,” represents a path away from government regulation and power to destabilize existing financial institutions by creating parallel economies in support of their own world-making efforts.

Cryptocurrencies consist of digital tokens that can be used as a means of transaction by being sent electronically from one user to another, wherever digital connections can be established. The blockchain is essentially a record of transactions, meaning that each block of the blockchain consists of a unique data transaction fingerprint linked with all other blocks, allowing users to keep an overview of all transactions taking place across the network. Having no centralized authority, trust in the blockchain is in the encryption of its chain. Rather than trusting a government or bank, one trusts complex math. Cryptocurrency's value is created by a process called “mining.” Bitcoin users, for example, can mine their own coins that are inscribed into the blockchain, by letting their computers solve complex mathematical problems — something that requires vast amounts of energy that emit huge amounts of pollution. The value of Bitcoin thus equals the amount of energy and computing power needed to create it, combined with the willingness of people to embrace the currency as their own as well as investors feeling incentivized to turn their assets into crypto. Like anything digital, these currencies are in fact produced through material means.

While cryptocurrency may be the last currency, artificial intelligence promises to be the last intelligence.

Taxing cryptocurrencies has proven notoriously difficult, and some countries, like Bermuda, Malta, Gibraltar, and Liechtenstein, have created havens for crypto holders and companies. And while blockchain's decentralized technology holds some potentially transformative promise when it comes to rethinking voting processes and self-organized micro-energy grid management, it currently favors those with the means to purchase digital currency, or to perform the mining itself: The more computational power one can mount, the more cryptocurrency one can mine. That means that rather than a central bank, “central miners” can disproportionately impact the number of coins circulating and the value they hold on the (crypto)market. No surprise, then, that Thiel's Seasteading Institute announced its short-lived “Crypto Cruise Ship” in 2020, named the ms Satoshi, in honor of the blockchain founder.

Thinking about the rise of cryptocurrency as the “last currency” is more than metaphor considering its devastating environmental footprint. At its current rate, environmental damages through mining are calculated to potentially produce enough emissions to warm the planet above the apocalyptic two degrees Celsius in a mere 22 years. Parts of crypto mining have moved into the sphere of so-called renewables and carbon offset schemes, particularly in the art world, where various figures and institutions have begun to partake in generating cryptovalue in the form of so-called nonfungible tokens (NFTs), unique digital ledgers stored on the blockchain that can consist of a digital image or video.

Digital artist Mike Winkelmann, or “beeple,” saw his digital NFT artwork “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” (2021) sell for $67 million at Christie's auction house. The work consists of a collage of the daily digital paintings the artist published on his website, which read like the dark underbelly of X (formerly Twitter) misogyny, homophobia, and racism. Winkelmann is obsessed with weight shaming, the supposed sexual perversions of political and religious leaders, and the portrayal of aggressive racialized sexual stereotypes. Staggering sums are paid for energy-killing crypto paraphernalia that glorify an incel-induced culture of racial and gender violence. As such, extinction as currency embodies a clear banality of evil: the banality of extinction.

The ultimate cynicism might be on display when the United Nations presented an NFT art show highlighting the issue of climate change titled “DigitalArt4 Climate” at the cop26 Climate Change Conference in Scotland in 2021 — embracing the very technology that shamelessly accelerates the ecological crisis the summit is ostensibly mean to combat. For even if NFTs could be produced through renewable energy, this does not undo the fact that “sustainable” energy infrastructures are themselves reliant on vast mineral extraction and industrial production. As long as the myths of endless progress and consumer culture are not dismantled, increasingly energy-hungry digital economies will consume renewable resources away from primary common needs.

Such extreme energy extraction investment opportunities are already widely available, the booming field of so-called artificial intelligence first and foremost. It is of course deeply cynical to be willing to ascribe “intelligence” to algorithms, but not to, say, pigs or flowers. The choice to do so is because AI is considered a replication of “our” intelligence — with an aggressive bias toward digitized archives dominated by white men, a global minority whose perspectives have disproportionately influenced recorded history over the past centuries. The ultimate expression of human supremacy over nature is our supposed capability to extrapolate our own intelligence into servitude, to extract our thought-world as capital, the way protagonists in Brandon Cronenberg's film “Infinity Pool” (2023) reproduce themselves for execution-entertainment, never entirely knowing whether it is themselves or their copies who are being killed. But while the costs in Cronenberg's film are murderous, the cost of AI markets is omnicidal, as they rely on stupendous amounts of energy for computing power, which are projected to be greater than the entire human workforce by 2025, and its global energy consumption to reach 3.5 percent of the world's total by 2030. While cryptocurrency may be the last currency, artificial intelligence promises to be the last intelligence.

Considering the libertarian climate propaganda extinction loop (wherein a false solution to a crisis becomes justification for deepening the crisis itself), there is no contradiction in ruining living worlds by building a predatory energy economy, as this is the point: right wing libertarian propagation accelerates ungovernability to engineer its own worlds in the old system's place.

 Vitalik Buterin said there are ways Ethereum can function as a financial fallback in times of instability through hardware solutions. 

As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. 

In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. 

Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. 

“Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”

A former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.

Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week's worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden's reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. 

Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. 

When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations:

While crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. 

Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption. 

However, the executive said that instead of cryptocurrencies fully replacing fiat money as a payment method, the two payment options will coexist. 

Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that people will use crypto when it's easier and more practical.

Unnecessary regulations are preventing Europeans from enjoying cheaper and faster financial services through stablecoins.

The following is a guest post and opinion of Sveinn Valfells, Co-founder of Monerium.

Mario Draghi is right. Europe hobbles itself with substantial tariffs, including regulations on “the most innovative part of the service sector – digital”. The European Union has done just that by creating tariffs on stablecoins, a practical form of digital money could provide a significant positive impact on GDP.

Stablecoins are digital money on blockchains – dollars, euros, or sterling as cryptographic coins. They are the new “killer app” of fintech, programmable cash which moves peer-to-peer without intermediaries – instantly at virtually no cost  – powering global payments and applications such as automated lending and securities trading.

Stablecoins allow fintechs to build new applications faster and cheaper than ever before. They enable “open banking on steroids” twice over by unbundling money from banks, payment providers, and their closed, proprietary fintech technologies. They are “room-temperature superconductors for financial services” which remove barriers to the flow of money, significantly boosting GDP.

Stablecoins are more than an abstract financial innovation. They let a Polish worker in France send their euros home instantly for cents instead of paying several euros and waiting up to two days. They enable German start-ups to raise capital efficiently through automated issuance of compliant digital shares and debt instead of slow, expensive, and inflexible manual paperwork.

To unlock the potential of stablecoins, Europe's currencies must be accessible domestically and internationally as euros, zloty, and krona onchain. The good news is that Europe has a tried and tested legal framework for digital cash called e-money, introduced in 2000. The bad news is that Europe has hobbled itself by wrapping e-money issued onchain with a thick layer of unnecessary red tape.

E-money is a terrific regulatory innovation. It is a digital cash bearer instrument for payments. Dozens of companies, including PayPal, Revolut, and Wise, have successfully used e-money to serve millions of customers in billions of online, mobile and card transactions. E-money is the ultimate form of stablecoin, as if made for the onchain economy.

The newly passed EU Market in Crypto-Assets regulations (MiCA) require stablecoins to be e-money. This makes a lot of sense because e-money pre-dates blockchains and MiCA as a “technically neutral” form of digital cash.

However, MiCA violates the technical neutrality of e-money and imposes tariffs and anti-competitive restrictions by creating additional requirements for e-money onchain.

For example, MiCA turns banks into gatekeepers for issuers of e-money onchain. Unlike regular e-money which can be 100% safeguarded directly in high-quality liquid assets such as government bonds, MiCA requires stablecoin issuers to safeguard at least 30% of their customers' funds with banks, requiring them to share their income with the banks. That's a direct tariff payable to the banks.

The MiCA bank safeguarding requirement also makes e-money onchain more risky because it inserts the banks and their balance sheets where they need not be. The higher risk of holding money with banks is a tariff because it requires e-money issuers to hold larger reserves.

The MiCA bank safeguarding requirement is also illegal. It directly violates the European e-money directive which explicitly states that one of its key goals is to ensure “fair competition” and a “level playing field” between e-money issuers and banks. The MiCA bank safeguarding requirement does exactly the opposite: it shifts the playing field in favor of the banks.

Americans like bashing European regulations and have no stablecoin regulations in place. Nevertheless, the Trump administration has prioritized passing a stablecoin bill mirroring European e-money to “ensure American dollar dominance internationally [and] to increase the usage of the US dollar digitally”.

Meanwhile, the EU is hobbling itself by making the tried and tested e-money regulations more anti-competitive, costly, and risky for European stablecoins. Like Draghi says: “A fundamental change in mindset” is needed.

The solution is simple. Firstly, the EU should remove all the blockchain specific requirements for e-money and rip the unnecessary red tape out of the otherwise mostly sensible MiCA regulations.

Secondly, the ECB (and other EU central banks) should further level the playing field between banks and e-money issuers.

How? The ECB has recently granted non-bank fintechs, including e-money issuers, direct access to ECB payment systems. This helps e-money issuers by giving them direct access to the same core payment systems as the banks.

The ECB should take one more step and give e-money issuers direct access to its safeguarding facilities. Leading IMF economists have already proposed this idea. That would remove all unnecessary gatekeepers and tariffs between the ECB and the issuers of euro stablecoins and help unlock the full potential of the onchain economy for Europe and the euro.

Home | Updates | Pakistan aims to become global crypto and AI leader

International tech firms are exploring opportunities in Pakistan's emerging AI infrastructure market, following its energy-backed digital strategy led by the government and PCC.

Pakistan has set aside 2,000 megawatts of electricity in a major push to power Bitcoin mining and AI data centres, marking the start of a wider national digital strategy. 

Led by the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), a body under the Ministry of Finance, this initiative aims to monetise surplus energy instead of wasting it, while attracting foreign investment, creating jobs, and generating much-needed revenue.

Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the PCC, stated that with proper regulation and transparency, Pakistan can transform into a global powerhouse for crypto and AI. 

By redirecting underused power capacity, particularly from plants operating below potential, Pakistan seeks to convert a longstanding liability into a high-value asset, earning foreign currency through digital services and even storing Bitcoin in a national wallet.

Global firms have already shown interest, following recent visits from international miners and data centre operators. 

Pakistan's location — bridging Asia, the Middle East, and Europe — coupled with low energy costs and ample land, positions it as a competitive alternative to regional tech hubs like India and Singapore. 

The arrival of the Africa-2 subsea cable has further boosted digital connectivity and resilience, strengthening the case for domestic AI infrastructure.

It is just the beginning of a multi-stage rollout. Plans include using renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydropower, while tax incentives and strategic partnerships are expected to follow. 

With over 40 million crypto users and increasing digital literacy, Pakistan aims to emerge not just as a destination for digital infrastructure but as a sovereign leader in Web3, AI, and blockchain innovation.

Swedish health technology company H100 Group AB has secured $2.2 million in funding led by Blockstream CEO Adam Back to expand its Bitcoin treasury holdings.

According to a May 25 announcement, the Stockholm-headquartered firm raised 21 million Swedish krona (approximately $2.2 million) through 0% interest convertible loans. The funds will be used to purchase Bitcoin as part of H100's broader pivot toward holding the asset on its balance sheet.

Investment firms, including Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB, and Crafoord Capital Partners, contributed a combined $800,000 to the round. The largest share came from Back, a British cryptographer and known Bitcoin advocate, who invested $1.4 million.

The loans are set to mature on June 15, 2028, and can be converted into equity at a rate of 1.3 SEK (about 11 US cents) per share.

Under the loan terms, H100 may mandate conversion to equity if its share price maintains a volume-weighted average of 33% above the conversion rate for 60 trading days. Full conversion would issue roughly 16.15 million new shares, resulting in a 12% dilution.

The latest capital raise will allow the company to purchase approximately 20.18 Bitcoin at current market rates, adding to the 4.39 Bitcoin it acquired on May 22. 

That earlier purchase, valued at around $490,000, marked H100's initial foray into Bitcoin and cemented its name as the first publicly listed company in Sweden to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset and one of the first in Europe.

H100 shares rallied 39% after the news broke, pushing H100's market value over $14 million.

At the time, H100 said the move is part of a long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy, which aims to diversify its reserves without deviating from its core focus on health technology.

Bitcoin's role as a corporate treasury asset continues to gain momentum, with several public healthcare companies making significant acquisitions this month.

On May 16, Singapore-based Basel Medical Group announced a strategic purchase agreement to acquire up to 10,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1 billion, by issuing ordinary shares.

In the United States, KindlyMD, a provider of integrated healthcare services, secured shareholder approval for its proposed merger with Nakamoto Holdings Inc., a Bitcoin-native holding company.

Meanwhile, Canadian healthcare provider SRx Health Solutions has announced plans to diversify its financial assets by purchasing Bitcoin, following a previous investment of $1.5 million in Solana tokens.

Football. Soccer. Basketball. Gaming and Much More

May 26, 2025 By Jeff Trudeau 



The world of cryptocurrencies is seething like a volcano. Every week, new tokens, protocols, and technologies appear. All this requires convenient and secure storage tools, where the real battlefield for innovation begins.

Every modern wallet for crypto coins should store assets and be flexible, convenient, and secure. These characteristics are essential for users who do not want to depend on centralized services. IronWallet was created for them — a non-custodial storage where all control over private keys remains only with you.



Like non-custodial wallets, this approach maximizes security and makes the user the sole owner of assets. Developers of such products are increasingly introducing technologies that seemed fantastic five years ago.

A fingerprint scanner instead of a password? Facial recognition to access crypto? This is no longer science fiction. Biometric methods have been actively implemented in mobile wallets. They make logging in more convenient and increase security.

Artificial intelligence is not standing aside, either. It helps identify suspicious transactions, suggests the best moments for exchange, and even predicts market trends. AI integrations are already appearing in top mobile wallets. They offer cool tools that provide users with convenience, protection, and benefits.

Some wallets today can do more than store funds. The interface supports DeFi protocols, NFTs, staking, and decentralized exchanges. The user does not need to jump between platforms — everything works inside the storage.

Such functions and capabilities are especially relevant for those actively participating in the crypto economy. Such functions help save time and minimize risks: the fewer third-party services, the fewer vulnerabilities.

The interface is the first thing the user sees. Modern cryptocurrency wallets do everything to make the interaction process as simple as possible. In this case, even a beginner should figure it out in a minute.

Developers are following the path of minimalism and transparency. You can see how the number of buttons decreases, and the functionality becomes more diverse. As paradoxical as it may seem, it works. Users appreciate intuitive navigation and fast operation execution, which has become the norm.

The most striking innovations in cryptocurrency wallets are concentrated in several areas. Among the key and most common trends, we can highlight the following:

The above innovations make cryptocurrency wallets universal tools. Previously, users had to install five separate applications. Today, everything is different because all the necessary tools are placed in one robust and secure product. Users especially value solutions that do not depend on the center.

You must understand that any innovation should be productive and functional. Otherwise, it is just a beautiful wrapper with no content and will not bring any specific benefit.

Crypto wallets have become much more than just digital safes. Today, they combine security, functionality, and innovation. The main thing to remember is that the more features a wallet has, the more critical it is for the user to control them.

Products like IronWallet show what the wallet of the future should look like: non-custodial, secure, and free from intermediaries. This is the approach of the future.

Pakistan has committed 2,000 megawatts of electricity to bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence data centers, the country's finance ministry said.

The committed energy is being directed from coal-fired power plants that are currently running at 15% capacity, Bloomberg reports, in an initiative spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council.

By tapping surplus energy, the government hopes to turn a liability into an asset. Officials say the plan will create tech-related jobs and help attract overseas capital as the country works to stabilize its fragile economy, which came close to default in 2023.

Pakistan is also laying the groundwork for a regulatory framework to support its estimated 15 to 20 million cryptocurrency users.

Privacy-focused cryptocurrency monero XMR$406.17 has overtaken litecoin LTC$95.37 and toncoin TON$2.95 to rank among the top 25 digital assets by market value.

The so-called flippening is characterized by XMR's market capitalization topping $7.5 billion, racing ahead of TON's $7.48 billion and LTC's $7.35 billion, according to data source Coingecko.

Monero (XMR) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with privacy-enhancing technologies to obscure transaction details. That makes traditional financial tracking and intercepting methods largely obsolete, which explains why criminals love cryptocurrency. 

Earlier this year, a media outlet linked to the Islamic State (ISIS) Pakistan Province reportedly published a poster calling for contributions of ""jihad with wealth"" and sought donations in monero.

Still, prices for the controversial coin have risen over 100% to above $400 this year, hitting levels last seen in early 2021, CoinDesk data show. The rally has been supposedly led by optimism about the impending privacy upgrade and rumors of re-listing by major exchanges, including the U.S.-listed Coinbase.

 Michael Saylor's Strategy continued stacking Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency broke an all-time high above $110,000 last week. 

Michael Saylor's Strategy, the world's largest corporate Bitcoin investor, bagged a fresh stash of BTC as the price briefly surged above $110,000 last week.

Strategy acquired 4,020 Bitcoin (BTC) for $427.1 million between May 19 and 23, the company announced on May 26.

The latest purchases were made at an average price of $106,237 per coin, with Bitcoin smashing past $110,000 on May 22.

The acquisition marked the fourth Bitcoin purchase by Strategy in May, bringing Strategy's total BTC holdings to 580,250 BTC, acquired for about $40.6 billion at an average price of $69,979 per coin.

Strategy's new Bitcoin acquisition followed a series of Class A sales by Strategy director Jarrod Patten.

According to a Strategy report of the proposed sale of securities filed on May 22, Patten sold 2,650 MSTR shares in the period between May 16 and 21, worth nearly $1.1 million.

Since April 22, Patten has sold a total of 17,050 Class A shares worth $6.7 million.

Additionally, Strategy's chief financial officer, Andrew Kang, sold 2,185 Class A shares on May 23, netting $719,447, according to an amended report filed on May 23.

Strategy's new purchase reflects Saylor's philosophy of acquiring Bitcoin no matter how high the prices are, as he previously vowed to keep buying Bitcoin at the top forever in late 2024.

In the meantime, Strategy's shares have been tumbling from their all-time highs, losing at least 12% in the past week, with prices falling from around $420 to $369, according to TradingView data.

The highest historic closing price on record for MSTR stock was around $474, recorded on Nov. 19, 2024.

The recent drop in Strategy shares came after the company was hit with a class-action lawsuit alleging it had misrepresented Bitcoin investments. Filed on May 19, the suit seeks to recover losses of shareholders who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud in April 2025.

 Chart patterns and onchain trends align to suggest a 25% downside risk for XRP price in the near term. 

Key takeaways:

Over 70% of XRP's realized cap was accumulated near recent highs, echoing previous market top patterns.

XRP's active address count has plunged over 90% since March 2025, signaling reduced transactional demand.

A falling wedge pattern points to a potential 25% drop toward key support at the $1.76 level.

XRP (XRP) has rallied more than 385% since late 2024, but fresh onchain analysis warns that this surge may have attracted buyers at increasingly vulnerable levels.

More than 70% of XRP's realized market capitalization—a measure of the XRP value based on the price at which each token last moved—has been accumulated between late 2024 and early 2025, according to Glassnode.

The realized cap of the 3-to-6-month group—a younger coin age band—has risen since November 2024, including dramatic increases witnessed after January 2025, when the XRP price peaked at around $3.40.

This top-heavy market structure is historically fragile, as newer investors tend to be more sensitive to price swings, often triggering sharper sell-offs during corrections.

In late 2017, XRP saw a massive influx of capital from young coins just before peaking near $3.55, followed by a prolonged 95% drawdown. 

The pattern repeated in 2021, when another sharp rise in the realized cap by short-term holders preceded a nearly 80% decline, raising the possibility that XRP may have formed a local top in January 2025 and will continue declining in the coming months.

XRP's number of active addresses spiked sharply in March 2025, hitting record levels. Since then, activity has dropped by over 90%, returning to levels seen before the breakout.

Historically, similar divergences between rising prices and falling onchain activity—seen in late 2017 and early 2021—have appeared near local market tops. 

Related: XRP price fails to respond to two extremely bullish developments — Here is why

While it's not a guaranteed warning sign, the sharp drop in active addresses could mean fewer people are using XRP to send or receive funds, and more are just holding.

XRP's weekly chart shows the price consolidating within a falling wedge pattern. 

As of May 26, the cryptocurrency was showing signs of entering a short-term correction cycle after failing to break above the wedge's upper trendline.

A broader pullback could push the XRP price toward the wedge's lower trendline if the recent price action is any indication. 

The lower trendline aligns with the 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) near $1.76, down about 25% from the current levels.

 Japanese bond market turmoil may have played a bigger role in Bitcoin's rise to $112,000 than the recent geopolitical de-risking, according to Bitwise's European head of research. 

Bitcoin's recent all-time high may be linked to ongoing issues in the Japanese bond market, possibly signaling BTC's growing recognition as a hedge against instability in the traditional financial (TradFi) system.

Bitcoin's (BTC) price rose to a new all-time high of $112,000 on May 22, before retracing to change hands above $109,700 at the time of writing on May 26, Cointelegraph data shows.

While some attributed the rally to geopolitical developments, including US President Donald Trump's announcement of Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks on May 19, macroeconomic factors appear to be playing a larger role, according to market analysts.

Bitwise's head of European research, André Dragosch, pointed to growing concerns around Japan's sovereign credit outlook, highlighting a spike in the country's long-term bond yields.

The 30-year yield on Japanese bonds reached a new all-time high of 3.185% on May 20, 2025, before retreating to 3.115% on May 23, TradingView data shows.

Government bonds are typically considered safe-haven assets. But when yields rise sharply, it often signals investor concerns about fiscal sustainability and repayment risk. Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 250%, compared to Germany's 62%, yet both countries had 30-year bond yields near 3.1% on May 21, noted The Kobeissi Letter.

“Because yields are increasing, sustainability becomes more of an issue, meaning credit risk increases, meaning yields increase even more,” Dragosch said. “And so you end up in this kind of fiscal debt doom loop.”

Dragosch said the growing volatility in Japan's bond market could be prompting some institutional investors to reconsider Bitcoin's role as a hedge against sovereign default risk.

“This is now affecting other bond markets, especially the US Treasury market,” Dragosch added.

Japan's bond market instability raises sovereign credit risk concerns, leading to more Bitcoin adoption among TradFi participants, Dragosch told Cointelegraph, adding:

“Perceived default risk continues rising, yields continue rising? This is a rough benchmark of why Bitcoin could be heading toward $200,000,” Dragosch said, adding that this remains conditional on continued Bitcoin accumulation by corporations and exchange-traded fund (ETF) holders.

Meanwhile, the US spot Bitcoin ETFs are less than $1.3 billion away from surpassing the monthly inflow record of $6.49 billion from November 2024, Cointelegraph reported on May 23.

Metrics details

The psychedelic drug psilocybin demonstrates rapid and long-lasting efficacy across neuropsychiatric disorders that are characterized by behavioral inflexibility. However, its impact on the neural activity underlying sustained changes in behavioral flexibility has not been characterized. To test whether psilocybin enhances behavioral flexibility by altering activity in cortical neural ensembles, we performed longitudinal single-cell calcium imaging in the mouse retrosplenial cortex across a 5-day trace fear learning and extinction assay. We found that a single dose of psilocybin altered cortical ensemble turnover and oppositely modulated fear- and extinction-active neurons. Suppression of fear-active neurons and recruitment of extinction-active neurons predicted psilocybin-enhanced fear extinction. In a computational model of this microcircuit, inhibition of simulated fear-active units modulated recruitment of extinction-active units and behavioral variability in freezing, aligning with experimental results. These results suggest that psilocybin enhances behavioral flexibility by recruiting new neuronal populations and suppressing fear-active populations in the retrosplenial cortex.

Metrics details

Mass timber products can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing steel and cement. However, the increase in wood demand raises wood prices, and the environmental consequences of these market changes are unclear. Here we investigate the global carbon and land use impacts of adopting mass timber products, focusing on cross-laminated timber as a case study. Our results show that higher wood prices reduce the production of traditional wood products but expand productive forestland by 30.7–36.5 million hectares from 2020 to 2100 and lead to more intensive forest management. If the cumulative global cross-laminated timber production reaches 3.6 to 9.6 billion m3 by 2100, long-term carbon storage can increase by 20.3–25.2 GtCO2e, primarily in forests (16.1–17.7 GtCO2e) and in cross-laminated timber panels (4.1–8.1 GtCO2e). Including emission reductions from steel, cement, and traditional wood products, the net reduction of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions will be 25.6–39.0 GtCO2e.

Limiting the global average temperature to 1.5 °C or 2 °C by 2100 requires large-scale decarbonization of industrial systems and the built environment1,2,3,4. In 2020, the building construction industry caused 10% (3.2 GtCO2e) of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and it is expected to increase its share of emissions as the global population and urbanization increase5. Decarbonizing the construction industry by utilizing low-carbon intensity and renewable materials is a promising solution5. Mass timber products like cross-laminated timber (CLT) are emerging renewable alternatives to traditional building materials (e.g., reinforced concrete and steel), especially for mid- and high-rise buildings6. Previous studies have shown the potential carbon benefits of adopting mass timber products over traditional construction materials6,7,8. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been employed at the product level (e.g., 1 m3 wood product)9,10 and the stand level (e.g., 1-ha forestland)11 to quantify the environmental performance of mass timber products. Although these studies advanced the knowledge of CLT, most of them only include the direct impacts associated with wood product life cycles (e.g., forest growth, harvesting, wood production, product use, and end-of-life). There is a lack of understanding regarding the effects of increasing wood demand on the life-cycle GHG emissions of both traditional wood products (e.g., lumber, particle boards, pulp and paper products) and mass timber products, and the long-run implications to land use and forest management10.

Several studies have investigated the global forest impact of mass timber adoption6,12,13, recognizing the value of using CLT as part of a potential global climate mitigation program. However, few studies have addressed how various forest types, forest management activities, and the timber market will evolve in response to the new demand for mass timber. Moreover, the carbon consequences throughout the life cycles of both CLT and traditional wood products, from forest to end-of-life, have not been fully examined. There is also limited exploration of the high cost of converting marginal land into plantations and growing timber in non-forest ecosystems. Finally, these land use models may not adequately measure the age classes of forests, which are necessary to understand when to plant and how quickly the timber market can respond to changes in demand.

In this work, we aim to address these gaps in the literature by developing an interdisciplinary modeling framework that integrates economics, ecology, and LCA to quantify the interactions among demand, supply, forest management, and land use at both regional and global levels. This framework integrates the Global Timber Model (GTM)14,15,16,17, with process-based LCA models to quantify the direct and indirect land and carbon implications of emerging wood product demand from 2020 to 2100. This framework is applied specifically to CLT, a common mass timber product6,11,18. The LCA quantifies the life-cycle GHG emissions associated with CLT, traditional wood products, and substituted products (e.g., concrete, steel, electricity). This study compares a baseline scenario without future CLT demand with three alternative CLT demand scenarios to examine the effects of CLT demand on the timber market.

We utilize GTM to capture how adding the demand for mass timber products will likely lead to higher wood prices, which will potentially reduce the global supply for traditional wood products. The higher wood prices give landowners an incentive to plant more forests and increase forest management intensity by, for instance, increasing fertilization or changing forest rotation. GTM captures how global forest markets anticipate these future changes in demand and supply. The changes in supply, in turn, impact carbon storage. GTM also captures the ability of forest ecosystems to supply timber by modeling stands by age in global forests. The model does not include non-forest ecosystems because it is very costly to grow timber in these ecosystems. For example, one must drain wetlands and irrigate parklands and drylands to make them suitable for growing timber. The price of wood is unlikely to get high enough to justify these expenses.

The integrated modeling framework allows for a holistic assessment of the net climate mitigation effect of adopting CLT at global and regional scales. This modeling framework can support policymaking and decision-making about the environmental consequences of large-scale use of CLT. Moreover, this framework can be adjusted using other assumptions about CLT demand, alternative emerging wood products, or recycling. The framework is also useful for addressing policy tradeoffs concerning how to use forests for potentially competing goals such as carbon storage, carbon removal, and conservation. The results shed light on the future impacts of increased wood use on global forestlands, carbon, and the timber market. It informs better design and operations of coupled forest-CLT-building systems as a nature-based solution for climate change. Specifically, the CLT analysis reveals that increasing the demand for wood, at least up to a maximum sustainable level, will increase carbon storage in forests and wood products and reduce GHG emissions from steel, cement, and traditional wood products.

Figure 1 shows how GTM and LCA are integrated to assess the effects of CLT demand on different factors (e.g., timber markets, forest area, and GHG emissions), and their implications on the carbon balances. GTM captures how increased future CLT demand raises wood prices and increases managed forestland and plantations by reducing natural forestland and farmland, and tracks incidental changes in forest carbon storage. At the same time, GTM quantifies how forest management intensity increases the growth rates of trees. These changes increase future wood (i.e., sawtimber and pulpwood) supply to meet future demand. Note that, in this study, GTM does not experiment with the demand and supply of fuelwood in response to the emerging CLT demand. The LCA captures the net biogenic carbon uptake by forest and life-cycle GHG emissions by forest operations, by CLT production and end-of-life, by potentially replacing steel and concrete, and by production and end-of-life of traditional wood products. All these complex interactions are captured in this internally consistent framework to measure the carbon and land consequences due to CLT adoption.

The system boundary of the Life Cycle Assessment is cradle-to-grave. The green arrow to the forest box stands for CO2 sequestration from the atmosphere. The summation of the arrows entering and leaving the system boundary equals the net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance. CLT stands for cross-laminated timber.

Economic growth and policy can lead to a range of future outcomes, which we capture with three plausible pathways of CLT demand and adoption scenarios versus a baseline scenario without CLT demand through 2100. The future baseline global demand for traditional wood products from sawtimber and pulpwood is based on the population and economic growth predicted in the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 (SSP2) scenario19. In the baseline scenario, total wood supply increases from 2122 million m3 in 2020 to 3627 million m3 in 2100 (see Supplementary Table 1) which drives a price increase in sawtimber (59.4%) and pulpwood (22.8%) (see Section Effects on traditional wood supply and price) and a corresponding increase in plantations of 39.3 Mha (see Supplementary Table 2).

We then use the socioeconomic and biophysical assumptions of the baseline to examine three CLT scenarios. We focus on how each CLT scenario changes the baseline outcomes over time. We examine a medium CLT demand scenario from 2020 to 2100 that reaches 30% of global new urban construction floor area, with either fast (Scenario 1, reaching 30% by 2050) or slow (Scenario 2, reaching 30% by 2080) adoption. We also look at fast adoption with a high demand scenario (Scenario 3, reaching 60% by 2050) (see “Methods” and Supplementary Fig. 1). These CLT demand scenarios are based on predicted future new construction of urban commercial and residential building floor areas which we assume depend on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and urban population (see “Methods”)20,21.

Figure 2 shows the global sawtimber supply for CLT in the three scenarios. The annual global wood supply for CLT in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 reaches about 300 million m3 (around 9% of total wood supply for traditional wood products, see Supplementary Table 1) by 2100, whereas the high demand scenario reaches 634 million m3 (19% of total wood supply for traditional wood products, see Supplementary Table 1). Because CLT likely will come from softwoods, GTM predicts CLT will likely be made from wood that comes from three regions: Western Europe, the United States, and Brazil (Fig. 2). These regions together produce more than 60% of the traditional global wood supply in the baseline scenario. It is cost-effective for these regions to switch a portion of their production from traditional wood products to CLT. The United States and Brazil are also predicted to plant trees for CLT. When there is a rapid, immediate increase in demand, the early wood supply for CLT comes from existing trees in Western Europe and the Rest of the World. For example, in Scenario 3 with high CLT demand and fast adoption, Western Europe supplies 43.0%–66.2% of wood for CLT from 2020 to 2100. But in Scenario 2, the wood supply for CLT from Western Europe decreases from 54.0% in 2060 to 11.6% in 2100.

The global sawtimber supply for cross-laminated timber in the three scenarios is shown for various major regions, including the US (United States of America), West EU (Western Europe), and Brazil, along with the rest of the world. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

When the global demand for CLT is added, the prices of sawtimber and pulpwood rise relative to the baseline scenario as shown in Fig. 3a, b (see Daigneault and Favero22 for detailed socioeconomic assumptions under the baseline scenario in GTM). Compared to the baseline scenario, the faster CLT demand grows, the earlier prices of sawtimber and pulpwood increase. Higher overall CLT demand leads to higher overall future sawtimber and pulpwood prices. The higher future prices stimulate an increase in the future total wood supply (including sawtimber for traditional wood products, pulpwood, and sawtimber for CLT) (see Supplementary Table 1). The change in CLT is large enough to shift the aggregate demand for wood, but even in the most aggressive scenario, global aggregate wood supply only increases by 10.7%. Some of this extra wood supply comes from increasing forest management intensity, which increases the growth rate of managed forestland and leads to more plantations (see Fig. 4). Supply also increases by moving natural forestland and low-valued farmland into managed forestland (see Fig. 4). Previous literature12 predicted that all future supply could come from plantations and “other land” categories (non-forest ecosystems), but plantations require highly productive land. It is not clear that the previous literature distinguished high-productivity versus marginal productive lands within each ecosystem12. Non-forest ecosystems (savannah, parkland, and mangroves) require expensive inputs to make them suitable for growing timber. Dryland has to be irrigated, and wetlands have to be drained. The price of wood in these CLT scenarios is not high enough to pay for these inputs. Finally, it is important to recognize that higher future wood prices will reduce the quantity of wood going to sawtimber for traditional wood products and pulpwood, so there is more wood available for CLT.

a Forest area changes by 2050; b forest area changes by 2100. There are 16 regions: WEU (Western Europe), US (United States of America), CHINA, CANADA, SOUTH ASIA, RUSSIA, EEU (Eastern Europe), E ASIA (East Asia), BRAZIL, JAPAN, CENT AMERICA (Central America), SSAF (Sub-Saharan Africa), OCEANIA, AFME (North Africa and Middle East), RSAM (Rest of South America), and SE ASIA (Southeast Asia). In the Global Timber Model (GTM), plantations are defined as monoculture forests, even-aged systems that are intensively managed for pulpwood and sawtimber production. Examples of plantation systems in the United States include loblolly, slash, and long-leaf pine, and Douglas fir. Managed forests, referring to managed naturally generated forests, originally were naturally regenerated, but most of them are now replanted forests. The key distinction between plantations and managed forests is that plantations are on highly productive land and involve much more costly and intense management (as in a farm). Natural forests are defined as inaccessible, unmanaged, and naturally regenerating forests. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Figure 4 shows the change in total forest area by 2100 relative to the baseline (see Supplementary Data 1 for the region definitions in the GTM). There are three forest types: plantations, managed forests, and natural forests. GTM also captures marginal farmland for livestock and crops in the analysis. At the global level, CLT demand drives a small increase in plantations, a large increase in managed forests, and a moderate decrease in natural forests and marginal farmland relative to the baseline (see the baseline forest area in Supplementary Table 2). Overall, global forestland increases with the introduction of CLT at the expense of low-valued farmland relative to the baseline. Because the baseline predicts a reduction in forestland, the CLT scenarios effectively protect more existing forestland from being converted into future farmland. Under Scenario 1 by 2100, plantations increase by 11.2 million hectares (Mha), managed forestland increases by 32.6 Mha, and natural forestland declines by 10.6 Mha. The net increase of 33.2 Mha in forestland comes from preventing future forestland from being converted to farmland. Under Scenario 2 by 2100, plantations increase by 11.0 Mha, managed forestland increases by 27.9 Mha, and natural forestland declines by 8.1 Mha for a net increase of 30.7 Mha. Under Scenario 3 by 2100, plantations increase by 14.7 Mha, managed forestland increases by 40.8 Mha, and natural forestland declines by 18.9 Mha for a net increase of 36.5 Mha of forestland. In general, the plantation land as a fraction of harvested forestland (8.2%) increases very slightly as CLT increases.

The largest net increase in plantations and managed forestland occurs in the temperate forests of Western Europe and the United States, where most CLT will likely be produced. There are also large increases in managed forestland in China and Canada, as these regions supply more traditional wood products. Sub-Saharan Africa and South America (excluding Brazil) are predicted to replace natural forests with managed forests. Compared to the baseline scenario, Brazil converts natural forest into plantations to supply CLT. Southeast Asia is the only region predicted to lose both managed and natural forestland under the CLT scenarios.

Figure 5 depicts the change in three different carbon stocks on a CO2-equivalent (CO2e) basis: (1) forest carbon pools, including aboveground biomass, slash, and soil; (2) carbon stored in CLT panels (light blue bars) and landfill sites (gray bars); and (3) carbon stored in traditional wood products (orange bars). Since CLT demand reduces the production of traditional wood products (see Fig. 3), there will be less carbon stored in traditional wood products.

a Scenario 1 with medium demand and fast adoption; b Scenario 2 with medium demand and slow adoption; c Scenario 3 with high demand and fast adoption. All the numbers are reported on the CO2e basis. The positive values imply an increase in carbon storage and, therefore, more CO2 taken out of the atmosphere, whereas the negative values imply a loss of carbon storage and therefore more CO2 in the atmosphere. CLT stands for cross-laminated timber. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

As shown in Fig. 5, CLT demand is expected to increase the global carbon stock on land across all the CLT scenarios by 20.3–25.2 GtCO2e by 2100. Forest aboveground biomass captures the bulk of this added carbon with 14.6–16.2 GtCO2e by 2100. The other two forest carbon pools, forest soil and forest slash, add 1.5–2.1 GtCO2e by 2100. Moreover, additional carbon stock in forests increases under the slow CLT adoption rate because it gives the market more time to grow new trees. On average, CLT could increase forest carbon stock (including forest aboveground biomass, forest soil, and forest slash) by 16.1 GtCO2e in the fast adoption scenario (Scenario 1) and 17.7 GtCO2e in the slow adoption scenario (Scenario 2) between 2020 and 2100. Compared to Scenario 1, more CLT demand in Scenario 3 increases the forest carbon stock by 10.1%. There is a limit, however, to how much more carbon can be stored in managed forests. The cost of converting more land to forestland and intensifying forest management increases with scale because there is only so much productive land on the planet, and we use this valuable land for development, especially agricultural purposes.

The carbon stored in CLT panels also increases with the size of the CLT market. The CLT panels are the second largest driver of the increase in carbon stock by the end of the century (4.1 GtCO2e in Scenario 1, 3.2 GtCO2e in Scenario 2, 8.1 GtCO2e in Scenario 3). On the contrary, the CLT demand decreases the carbon stock of traditional wood products by 0.7–2.9 GtCO2e across the scenarios. To explore the impacts of varied CLT end-of-life cases on the results, two additional conceptual end-of-life cases of CLT panels are conducted: (1) material recycling case with 50% closed-loop recycling and 50% landfilling; (2) energy recovery case with 100% CLT panels combusted for power generation (see “Methods”). The impacts from the different end-of-life cases of CLT panels are minor (see results in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) due to the small quantity of CLT that reached their end-of-life (only those adopted in 2020–2040 in Fig. 2, given a life span of 60 years).

Figure 6 shows the cumulative changes in life-cycle GHG emissions under the CLT demand scenarios relative to the baseline scenario at the global level. All changes are measured in CO2e, including changes in biogenic CO2 uptake and biogenic and fossil-based GHG emissions (including CO2, CH4, and N2O) throughout the life-cycle stages. The net result is marked by triangles in Fig. 6. The cumulative GHG emission results in 2100 are summarized in Supplementary Table 5.

a Scenario 1 with medium demand and fast adoption; b Scenario 2 with medium demand and slow adoption; c Scenario 3 with high demand and fast adoption. Positive values imply increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and negative values imply reductions in GHG emissions or increases in CO2 sequestration relative to the baseline. CLT stands for cross-laminated timber; EOL stands for end-of-life. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Through 2100, cumulative global CLT production is 4.8, 3.6, and 9.6 billion m3 in Scenarios 1, 2, and 3, respectively (see Supplementary Table 5), delivering a reduction in net GHG emissions of 27.0, 25.6, and 39.0 GtCO2e, respectively. On average, by 2100, producing 1 m3 CLT is estimated to deliver a net GHG mitigation of 5.6 tCO2e in Scenario 1, 7.2 tCO2e in Scenario 2, and 4.0 tCO2e in Scenario 3. Comparing Scenarios 1 and 3, the average GHG benefit per 1 m3 CLT declines as the scale of the CLT market increases because market and land competition increase. Comparing Scenario 1 and 2, a slower adoption rate leads to a larger GHG benefit per 1 m3 CLT basis because the market has more time to grow the additional needed trees and increase the forest carbon stock per 1 m3 CLT basis.

Because biogenic carbon uptake comes from CO2 in the atmosphere, we assume the uptake is a reduction in atmospheric CO2. Hence, in Fig. 6, the negative values mean the increase in biogenic carbon uptake. Three factors explain the total net cumulative increase in the biogenic carbon uptake of 22.9–29.3 GtCO2e (green bars in Fig. 6) from the future CLT demand. The largest contributor is the increased biogenic carbon uptake that is finally stored in forests (16.1–17.7 GtCO2e). Biogenic carbon uptake for CLT production (10.6–28.6 GtCO2e) is the next largest factor. Finally, there is a reduction of biogenic carbon uptake (−4.5 to −17.0 GtCO2e) from the reduction of wood output for traditional wood products because of the high price of wood. Relative to the baseline without CLT, future CLT encourages less future low-valued cropland and more managed forestland. Higher wood prices also increase forest management investments (increasing plantations and managed forests, as shown in Fig. 4), raising forest growth rates. Despite that, CLT increases future harvesting, there will be more future forest carbon and a net movement of CO2 from the atmosphere into forests. The net wood carbon stored in forests (see Figs. 5 and 6) represents 59.6% of the final net GHG reduction benefit in Scenario 1, 69.1% in Scenario 2, and 45.5% in Scenario 3.

The changes in GHG emissions from CLT production and end-of-life CLT (light blue bars) and traditional wood products (orange bars) sum to a net increase of 1.6–2.4 GtCO2e (see Supplementary Table 5). However, when the potential substitution benefits (from market electricity and concrete and steel) are included, the net changes in all the remaining GHG emissions are −4.1 GtCO2e in Scenario 1, −1.8 GtCO2e in Scenario 2, and −9.6 GtCO2e in Scenario 3. These net changes in GHG emissions of production and end-of-life make up between 7.1% and 24.7% of the total net reduction in GHG emissions in each scenario (see Supplementary Table 5).

Previous studies estimated the carbon benefits (including avoided GHG emissions of traditional building materials and carbon storage in CLT panels) of 1 m3 CLT to be 1.1–1.5 tCO2e in the U.S.7,8. The results in this study are higher because we account for two factors: one is the increased carbon storage in forests, and the other is the decrease in life-cycle GHG emissions due to the reduction in traditional wood products. Without these factors, our estimated global average GHG benefit per 1 m3 CLT by 2100 is 2.1 tCO2e, which is comparable to the previous studies. The remaining differences likely arise from the different time frames, locations, building structures, and end-of-life assumptions.

This study also conducts a sensitivity analysis to investigate the impacts of variations in input parameters or assumptions on the results (see Supplementary Fig. 2 for detailed results). Most parameter variations have minor effects. The most sensitive parameters in the analysis are the GHG emission factors of electricity and concrete, which determine the potential substitution benefits. If the global electricity system is decarbonized from 0.70 to 0.33 kgCO2e per kWh, the total GHG emission benefit in Scenario 3 will be 6.1% smaller. If the GHG emissions of producing concrete are reduced by 40.0%, the total cumulative change of GHG emissions will be 2.4% higher. These changes are small relative to the overall effects of CLT explored in Scenarios 1–3.

The framework in this study integrates ecology, economics, and LCA to understand how dynamic CLT projections affect carbon stock, GHG emissions, and land uses at the regional and global levels. The LCA component captures the life-cycle GHG emissions of CLT and traditional wood products, along with the substitution effects of replacing traditional building materials and market electricity. The key insight offered by this integrated framework is the understanding of how the timber market and specifically forest landowners will respond to the higher wood prices from the new demand for CLT. The framework reveals that the adoption rate affects this response since it takes time to grow an additional wood supply. More importantly, the framework reveals that landowners will act in anticipation of a new demand that has not been recognized in previous studies. Forest owners will start to plant and invest in new forests as soon as they know a new demand for wood is coming. The model pays careful attention to ecological constraints by limiting forestland to ecosystems that can support forests. The model also acknowledges that there are costs to increasing land for managed forests and even higher costs for attracting high-productivity land into plantations. Finally, the GTM model recognizes that it takes a long time to grow timber by carefully tracking acreage by age class. This allows the model to predict when to plant new trees and how quickly the supply will respond. Another insight of the economic framework is that CLT will actively compete with traditional wood products for wood13. As wood prices increase, quantities of traditional wood products will fall. Consequently, there will be a smaller net increase in overall wood demand than previous studies projected6,12.

The net effect that future CLT will have on direct GHG emissions traditionally captured by LCA will be relatively small. For the production and end-of-life stages, the combination of the increased GHG emissions by CLT and the reduced GHG emissions by traditional wood products leads to a cumulative increase of 1.6–2.4 GtCO2e by 2100. When also considering the substitution of steel and concrete and the use of wood waste to generate electricity, the net production and end-of-life GHG emissions become a reduction of 1.9–9.7 GtCO2e. This is 7.1%–24.7% of the total net cumulative GHG emissions, depending on the scenarios.

The largest carbon consequence of CLT adoption happens in the forest. Higher wood prices encourage landowners to grow more forests and invest in growing trees faster. By 2100, global plantations increase by 11.0–14.7 Mha; managed forestland increases by 27.9–40.8 Mha; but natural forestland decreases by 8.1–18.9 Mha. The combination of these changes in the forest leads to an overall increase in forestland and forest carbon. Global forest carbon stock increases by 16.1–17.7 GtCO2e. The carbon in wood products and end-of-life sites increases by 3.2–7.4 GtCO2e. By 2100, total carbon stock increases by 20.3 GtCO2e in the medium demand-fast adoption scenario, by 20.9 GtCO2e in the medium demand-slow adoption scenario, and by 25.2 GtCO2e in the high demand-fast adoption scenario. The total cumulative net life-cycle GHG emission reduction is 27.0 GtCO2e, 25.6 GtCO2e, and 39.0 GtCO2e for the fast, slow, and high scenarios, respectively. The net increase in carbon storage, including in forests (standing trees, soil, slash), in CLT, in traditional wood products, and in landfills, is 75%, 82%, and 65% of the total net GHG emission reduction for Scenarios 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The cumulative GHG emission reductions are more modest than the projections of an earlier study that suggested 106 GtCO2e by 210012. There are three major reasons for this difference. First, we simulate lower CLT demand scenarios with a CLT adoption rate of 60% of urban construction in our highest estimate, compared to 90% of construction being in wood buildings12. Second, we exclude many non-forestland types (e.g., savannah and parkland) because they are unsuitable for growing timber. Third, GTM recognizes that converting prime cropland into plantations is very costly. If plantations require high-productivity cropland, vast plantations will substantially reduce the world's ability to grow food. This would likely be expensive and increase the incentive to convert natural forestlands to farmland.

The results of this study agree with the literature that adopting CLT will lead to net beneficial carbon consequences7,8,12. Using CLT instead of steel and cement will increase wood demand and encourage the market to protect more forestland and intensify forest management, which ultimately increases forest carbon stock. Our study suggests there will be a large net increase of carbon stock in the forest and in CLT panels, although some carbon stock will be lost because of the declining production of traditional wood products.

The results suggest that it would be reasonable to subsidize the demand for CLT as a GHG mitigation strategy. By increasing the market value of timber, the subsidy would provide an additional market incentive to maintain the world's existing forests. Given the difficulties of regulating global land use, this subsidy would be a practical tool to increase carbon storage in forests. There are also small gains from reduced GHG emissions and storage of carbon in long-lasting wood products. Encouraging CLT adoption will increase forestland by 30.7–36.5 Mha, especially in the long run, and reduce carbon in the atmosphere.

Despite the large overall increase in forestland, GTM predicts natural forestland will fall by 8.1–18.9 Mha. There is a tradeoff between conservation and carbon goals in these scenarios. Widespread expansion of CLT will likely reduce natural habitat. These land use effects will vary across the planet, with substantially increased forestland in the United States and Western Europe, but large reductions in natural forestland in the tropics. Stricter protections of natural lands will reduce this side effect on conservation, but the regulations will also increase the cost of CLT and reduce the carbon stored. There is, consequently, a limit to how far one should expand CLT and timber production in general. The CLT scenarios we present in this paper are sustainable, but increasing subsidies further may not be. Even with the scenarios we present, moving from medium demand to high demand has additional benefits. Future research should look at these tradeoffs carefully and make clear what the consequences of alternative policies will be. There are tradeoffs between conservation and mitigation policies that affect land use. It is critical that policymakers be aware of those consequences.

From now through 2100, alternative assumptions about the end-of-life cases of CLT panels have only minor impacts on the results. The long life span of CLT panels implies that few panels will reach end-of-life in this century. With future improved circularity of mass timber products beyond 210023, this could potentially reduce the timber demand for CLT, and further impact the forest carbon stock and timber supply. Future research could investigate how alternative circularities of CLT affect the global carbon consequences of adopting CLT in the long term. At the same time, alternative recycling rates of CLT could also impact the product-level life-cycle GHG emissions of CLT panels by affecting the upstream GHG emissions. But this depends highly on the allocation methods.

GTM focuses on capturing the long-term forest sector adjustments that evolve over time in response to long-term demand or supply stimulus. This study adopted a unitary demand price elasticity of −1.0. The literature reports a range of demand price elasticities for IWP, with the unitary elasticity on the high end24,25,26. A more price inelastic demand for traditional wood products would lead to larger wood price increases over time and therefore a larger supply response, including more forestland and higher management intensity. This would lead to more carbon storage in forests. However, if traditional wood products have a lower price elasticity, increases in CLT would cause less substitution with traditional wood products. Traditional wood products would shrink much less than we estimated in the high CLT scenarios. The overall result is that CLT would still lead to substantial carbon benefits, but an even larger fraction of those savings would come from the forest itself. Additionally, if the CLT demand is even higher than the high demand scenario with the same fast adoption and elasticity, it can be anticipated that the net carbon benefits are likely to grow with higher forest and CLT carbon stocks, lower production and EOL GHG emissions of traditional wood products, and higher potential substitution benefits. Moreover, some market dynamics are not included in this study that might affect the competitiveness of CLT relative to other materials. For instance, we show that as CLT competes with other timber products, it will drive up average global prices of timber. If CLT becomes too expensive, it may face more difficulty replacing steel and cement (assuming no carbon prices will be applied to them). It would be attractive to explore this more carefully using an economy-wide economic model to assess these dynamic tradeoffs.

Finally, in this study, only CLT is considered because it is the most recognized mass timber product. Other emerging wood products are not yet included. However, as these products evolve, the framework and methodology presented by this study can be adapted to include them. Based on this study, future research can further investigate possible improvements in background processes (e.g., electricity generation, steel recycling rate, and concrete production) and foreground processes (e.g., CLT production) in each region. Moreover, future research efforts can investigate the effects of other drivers (economic growth and future climate change scenarios).

We develop an integrated framework that combines the GTM (an economic forest model) and LCA models to assess the carbon consequences of adopting emerging mass timber products from 2020 to 2100. We use this framework to examine three CLT adoption scenarios and compare the results with a baseline scenario without CLT. The middle of the road socioeconomic projections of future economic, population, and urbanization outcomes, SSP219, are the inputs for projecting CLT demand and GTM. The analysis examines three projections of CLT demand from 2020 to 2100: a medium-slow, a medium-fast, and a high-fast projection. GTM estimates how farmland, forestland, and forest management change and forest carbon stock change in response to the added CLT projection. GTM also calculates how total wood output is split across CLT and traditional wood products. The LCA calculates the carbon stored in all the wood products throughout their life cycle. The LCA also estimates both the fossil-based and the biogenic GHG emissions of the production of these wood products based on the process-based models, as well as the potential substitution benefits of CLT replacing steel and cement based on the average data from the whole building LCA literature27. The integrated analysis consequently captures the relevant changes in carbon flows from carbon storage in forests, products, and end-of-use pools as well as the direct emissions and avoided emissions caused by CLT.

This analysis uses an economic-ecological forest sector model, the GTM28. GTM determines the level of management intensity (e.g., thinning, planting, intensive thinning, clear cutting, natural regeneration, fertilization) together with harvesting rates for each period to maximize the present value of timber market surplus over the next 100 years, given future expected demand for timber products, including CLT. The model evaluates the global land in forest ecosystems. This includes boreal forest, temperate deciduous forest, temperate coniferous forest, tropical moist forest, and tropical dry forest. The model does not include tropical grassland, tropical savannah, wetlands, temperate grassland, desert, or tundra. These alternative ecosystems do have trees29, but the biomass density of the trees is no more than a third of the biomass of forests30. These non-forest ecosystems are not considered because they cannot support timber production without expensive inputs such as irrigation in dryland.

GTM is a dynamic model that solves how to maximize the value of timber production over time, given the future demand function for timber and the existing stands of trees of each age class in each forest ecosystem. There are three forest types in the model: natural forest, plantations, and managed forest. The forest model has ~350 wood supply regions across the world that reflect the different forests in each region. Information about where forests can grow, natural forest productivity, and natural average biomass comes from an ecological model, BIOME/LPX-Bern31. The managed forest and plantations are divided into age classes. The acreage by age class comes from historic harvest patterns since 190032. The model determines the level of management intensity, planting, and harvesting that maximizes the present value of wood harvests over the next 200 years, given future demand. Because GTM tracks forest inventory very carefully, it has been able to reproduce the historic levels of forest carbon over the last century33. In this paper, we do not project the impact of climate change on future forests, although the model has been used to examine the impact of climate change in the past. This is a topic that can be addressed in future research. Recent analysis with GTM indicates that future market and land use projections are robust to parametric uncertainty related to forest growth and land supply parameters34.

The model's optimization problem is formally written as in Eq. (1):

where \({\rho }^{t}\) is the discount factor, \({Q}_{t}^{{tot}}\) is total wood harvest, \({Q}_{t}^{{ind}}\) is wood for traditional wood production (pulp plus sawtimber), \({Q}_{t}^{{CLT}}\) is the wood needed for CLT production, \(D({Q}_{t}^{{ind}},{Z}_{t})\) is the global demand function for traditional wood products \(D({Q}_{t}^{{ind}},{Z}_{t})\), \({Z}_{t}\) is global GDP per capita16, \({C}_{H}^{i}\) is the cost of harvesting and transporting wood to the mill, \({C}_{G}^{i}\) is the cost of planting to management intensity, m, of Gt hectares of forest type i (e.g., plantation, managed, natural), \({C}_{{PL}}^{i}\) is the cost of planting new forests, \({C}_{N}^{i}({{m}_{t}^{i},N}_{t}^{i})\) is the cost of converting additional natural forestland, \({N}_{t}^{i}\), to new managed forestland, and \({R}_{t}^{i}({\sum}_{a}{X}_{a,t}^{i})\) is the opportunity cost of farmland. The opportunity cost of farmland is a function of the total area of forestland, \({\sum}_{a}{X}_{a,t}^{i}\). As more farmland is devoted to forestland, the opportunity cost rises to reflect the underlying inelastic price of food. The notations used in this study and corresponding descriptions are available in Supplementary Table 6.

Long-run demand has the following functional form: \({Q}_{t}^{{ind}}={{A}_{t}({Z}_{t})}^{\theta }{P}_{t}^{\omega }\) where \({A}_{t}\) is a constant, θ is the income elasticity (0.87), and ω is the price elasticity (−1.00)25,26,35. Total industrial wood demand incorporates separate demand functions for sawtimber and pulpwood.

Equation (2) shows that the total quantity of wood harvested depends upon the area of land harvested in the timber types i for each age a and time t \(({H}_{a,t}^{i})\) and the yield \(({V}_{a,t}^{i})\) which is a function of age, ecological forest productivity \({\theta }_{t}^{i}\) and management intensity \({m}_{t0}^{i}\).

The amount of land in each forest type that adjusts over time is calculated according to Eq. (3):

The initial stocks of land \({X}_{t}^{i}\) are based on FAOSTAT data36, and all choice variables are constrained to be greater than or equal to zero, and the area of wood harvested \({H}_{a,t}^{i}\) does not exceed the total timber area. \({G}_{t}^{i}\) is the area of forestland regenerated planting, and \({N}_{t}^{i}\) is new forestland.

GTM assumes there is an international market for timber that leads to a global market-clearing price. As the price of wood for bioenergy rises to compete with industrial timber, both timber and bioenergy are traded internationally37. Competition for supply equilibrates their prices.

GTM is programmed into GAMS and solved in decadal time increments using the MINOS solver. Terminal conditions are imposed on the system after 200 years, far enough into the future so as not to affect the study results over the period of interest (2020–2100).

In GTM, the forest carbon stock is measured as the sum of carbon stock in three different carbon pools: aboveground, soil, and slash carbon. Aboveground carbon \({C}_{a,t}^{i}\) accounts for the carbon in all components of the aboveground living tree, as well as carbon in the forest understory and the forest floor, but does not include dead organic matter in slash, which is contained in a separate pool. For this analysis, we assume that carbon is proportional to total biomass, such that carbon in any forest of any age class is given in Eq. (4) as follows:

where \({\sigma }^{i}\) is a species-dependent coefficient that converts biomass to carbon. Given this, the total forest aboveground biomass carbon pool \({{TFCP}}_{t}^{i}\) for each timber type is calculated based on Eq. (5):

Soil carbon includes carbon stored in mineral and organic soils (including peat). GTM models changes in soil carbon storage from forestland use change, but does not capture nuanced soil carbon dynamics associated with forest operations. Soil carbon \({{SOLC}}_{t}^{i}\) is measured as the stock of carbon in forest soils of type i in time t. The value of \(\bar{K}\), the steady state level of carbon in forest soils, is unique to each region and timber type. The parameter \({\mu }^{i}\) is the growth rate for soil carbon. In this analysis, we capture the marginal change in carbon value associated with management or land use changes. When land use change occurs, we track net carbon gains or losses over time as shown in Eq. (6):

Finally, slash carbon \({{AS}}_{t}^{i}\) measures carbon stored in slash that remains on site, resulting from wood harvesting operations, as shown in Eq. (7).

Over time, the stock of slash \({{SP}}_{t}^{i}\) builds up through annual additions, and decomposes as displayed in Eq. (8):

Decomposition rates \({\vartheta }^{i}\) differ, depending on whether the forest lies in the tropics (3% year−1), temperate (5% year−1), or boreal zone (7% year−1)16.

Total forest carbon stock in each region n (see Supplementary Data 1 for the region definitions in the GTM) at time t is calculated by Eq. (9):

Such that if \({C{{{\rm{\_}}}}{GTM}}_{t,n} > {C{{{\rm{\_}}}}{GTM}}_{t+1,n}\) forests in region n are releasing emissions at time t + 1 because forest carbon stock is declining, while if \({C{{{\rm{\_}}}}{GTM}}_{t,n} < {C{{{\rm{\_}}}}{GTM}}_{t+1,n}\) more sequestration is occurring.

In this study, a cradle-to-grave dynamic consequential LCA is developed to quantify the life-cycle carbon flows of forest and product systems due to the adoption of CLT (see Fig. 1 for system boundary and summarized carbon flows). The carbon consequences consider the global and regional carbon flow changes compared to the baseline without CLT adoption. The carbon consequences consist of two aspects, namely direct carbon flows and indirect carbon flows. Equations (10) and (11) show the total carbon stock change compared to the baseline in year t and region n, \({\Delta {Total\_C}}_{t,n}\), and the total GHG emission change compared to the baseline in year t and region n, \({{GH}{G}_{{Total}}}_{t,n}\), respectively. For Eq. (10), the direct carbon stock changes include the changes in carbon stored in CLT products (\({\Delta {CLT\_C}}_{t,n}\)) and their end-of-life sites (\({\Delta {CLT\_EOL\_C}}_{t,n}\)). The indirect carbon stock changes include two components, forest carbon stock changes (\(\Delta {C{{{\rm{\_}}}}{GTM}}_{t,n}\)) (given by GTM) and carbon stock changes in traditional wood products (\(\Delta {{TWP\_C}}_{t,n}\)). Forest carbon pools, as mentioned above, include aboveground biomass, slash, and soil carbon pools. Traditional wood products in this study include sawtimber products (e.g., lumber, particle boards) and pulpwood products (e.g., pulp and paper products), but exclude mass timber products. For Eq. (11), \({{Forest\_Seq}}_{i,t}\) is the total net forest biogenic carbon flow from the atmosphere compared to the baseline in year t and region n, and evaluated by Eq. (12). \({{Forest\_Seq}}_{i,t}\) equals -44/12 multiplied by the sum of forest carbon stock changes (\(\Delta {C{{{\rm{\_}}}}{GTM}}_{t,n}\)), forest output carbon for CLT (\({\Delta {TimberC}}_{t,n}^{{CLT}}\)), forest output carbon of sawtimber (\(\Delta {{TimberC}}_{t,n}^{{Sawtimber}}\)), and forest output carbon of pulpwood (\(\Delta {{TimberC}}_{t,n}^{{Pulpwood}}\)). Given the mass balance, input carbon equals the stock change and output. \({{{GHG}}_{{Forest}}}_{t,n}\) is the corresponding life-cycle GHG emissions by forest operations (e.g., harvesting, planting). \({{{GHG}}_{{CLT}}}_{t,n}\) describes the GHG emissions by producing and using CLT across the life-cycle stages of the CLT system, including CLT production, end-of-life, and corresponding material substitutions. The carbon flows of CLT production are evaluated based on the process models (see the sections below). The upstream burdens of producing fuels, chemicals, and electricity, and the combustion of fuels are also included in this study. \({{{GHG}}_{{TWP}}}_{t,n}\) describes the life-cycle GHG emissions of the production and end-of-life of traditional wood products. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR6 GWP-100 factors are used to convert GHG emissions (including CO2, CH4, N2O) to CO2-equivalent basis1.

CLT production from sawtimber includes two major steps: (1) lumber production from sawtimber; and (2) CLT production from lumber. To produce lumber, sawtimber is transported to lumber mills after harvesting. Producing lumber includes sawing, kiln drying, planing, and energy generation for the dry kiln38,39. The upstream GHG emissions were derived from the Ecoinvent 3.9 cut-off database40 (see Supplementary Table 7) and GREET 202241. The mill residues (bark, sawdust, shavings, and chips) are combusted to produce energy for the kiln. If excessive, the rest is recovered for power generation. The byproducts of lumber mills, slabs, and chips from sawing are also recovered for power generation. More details are available in Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Table 8. Then lumber is made into CLT panels. The first unit operation, lumber preparation, ensures the lumber quality for CLT production, including grading, grouping, and moisture detecting9,42. Then the lumber is longitudinally end-jointed to make long continuous lumber, and layered and glued for face bonding11. With pressing, the layered and glued lumber layers form the CLT panels. Then the CLT panels are planned to remove uneven surfaces. The final step is end cutting to output CLT panels in customized shapes. The waste from CLT production is sent to landfill sites. More details are available in Supplementary Note 2. The LCI data of CLT production are collected from the literature and shown in Supplementary Table 8. After the life span of CLT, assumed 60 years43, the CLT panels are demolished and the discarded CLT waste is sent to the landfill site as end-of-life. The GHG emissions from landfills are estimated based on the IPCC First Order Decay (FOD) method for landfill11,44. Since landfill gas contains a high-volume fraction of CH4, the energy recovery from landfill gas is considered. The details of landfilling are shown in Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Table 9. Besides the landfill case, two additional end-of-life cases of CLT panels are conducted: (1) material recycling case with 50% closed-loop recycling and 50% landfilling; (2) energy recovery case with 100% CLT panels combusted for power generation. These robustness checks explore how these alternative assumptions change the results. More details are available in Supplementary Note 2.

Since CLT as a mass timber product can substitute the traditional reinforced concrete and steel in buildings (life span assumed as 60 years45,46), this study calculates the potential substitution benefits of CLT to replace the conventional structural materials by providing the same floor area27. The details related to the material usage of the CLT and traditional building structures are available in Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Table 10. Hence, the GHG emissions directly caused by producing and using CLT across the life-cycle stages (\({{GHG}}_{{CLT}}\) in Eq. (11)) are quantified by Eq. (13).

\({{GH}{G}_{{CLT\_production\_EOL}}}_{t,n}\) are the GHG emissions (including both fossil and biogenic) related to CLT production and end-of-life in year t and region n, including timber production, CLT production, landfilling, and landfill gas recovery; \({{GH}{G}_{{Sub\_electricity}}}_{t,n}\) the potential substitution benefits of recovering the mill byproduct for power generation; \({{GH}{G}_{{Sub\_building}}}_{t,n}\) the potential substitution benefits of replacing traditional building materials.

To quantify the carbon stock changes in traditional wood products converted from the timber produced at the end of year t and region n compared to the baseline (\(\Delta {{TWP\_C}}_{t,n}\)), and the corresponding manufacturing GHG emissions of traditional wood products (\({{{GHG}}_{{TWP}}}_{t,n}\)), this study combines the manufacturing GHG emission data for traditional wood products collected from the literature and database40 and the FOD method for traditional wood products used in the report, 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, by the IPCC47,48. As shown in Eq. (14)47, \(\Delta {{TWP\_C}}_{t,n}^{l}\) is the traditional wood products converted from the timber class l (l belongs to {sawtimber, pulpwood}) produced in year t and region n compared to the baseline; k is s a decay parameter calculated based on average half-life of timber class l48 (Eq. (16)); \({\Delta {TWP\_In}}_{t,n}^{l}\) is the carbon input of wood products made from timber class l produced in year t and region n compared to the baseline. \({\Delta {TWP\_In}}_{t,n}^{l}\) is evaluated by Eq. (15) where \({\Delta {TimberC}}_{t,n}^{l}\) is the carbon input of wood class l produced in year t and region n, compared to the baseline (namely \({\Delta {TimberC}}_{t,n}^{{Sawtimber}}\) or \({\Delta {TimberC}}_{t,n}^{{Pulp}}\) in Eq. (12)), and \({f}_{m}^{l}\) is the factor describing how much biogenic carbon left in wood products after manufacturing. \(\Delta {{TimberC}}_{t,n}^{l}\) is given by GTM as mentioned above. The value of the parameters and more details are available in Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Table 11.

GHG emissions from traditional wood products include two components, as shown in Eq. (17). The first component is the biogenic and fossil GHG emissions related to manufacturing. The term \({\frac{44}{12}\times \Delta {TimberC}}_{t,n}^{l}\times ({1-f}_{m}^{l})\) describes the manufacturing biogenic carbon release of producing these wood products; the term \({{EF}}^{l}{\times \Delta {TimberC}}_{t,n}^{l}\) describes the manufacturing fossil GHG emissions of producing these wood products by using the average emission factor \({{EF}}^{l}\). \({{EF}}^{l}\) is estimated based on the fossil GHG emissions for different wood products from literature and averaged by the global wood products share40,48. The value of the parameters and more details are available in Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Table 11. The second component \(\frac{44}{12}\times ((\Delta {{TWP\_C}}_{t,n}^{l}+{\Delta {TWP\_In}}_{t,n}^{l})-\Delta {{TWP\_C}}_{t+1,n}^{l})\) describes the total biogenic carbon pool loss of the wood products made from timber class l produced in year t and region n compared to the baseline.

The sawtimber demand caused by adopting CLT (\({\Delta {TimberDemand}}_{t,n}^{{CLT}}\)) is projected from 2020 to 2100, as shown in Eq. (18). In Eq. (18), \({New}{A}_{i,t}\) is the annual newly constructed urban commercial and residential building floor areas that adopt steel and concrete structures in year t and region n and can be potentially replaced by CLT; \({r}_{t}\) is the adoption rate (%) of CLT (or say the percentage of newly constructed areas that are built with CLT); \({f}_{{CLT}}\) is the CLT usage factor (m3 CLT per m2 building area, see Supplementary Table 10)27; \({c}_{{CLT}}\) is the conversion factor for CLT from timber (m3 CLT per m3 wet timber) that is evaluated based on the process model mentioned above. \({{NewA}}_{i,t}\) from 2020 to 2100 in this study, is derived from the total building floor areas of urban commercial and residential buildings based on the multi-variable regression models for each region that assumes total building floor areas depend on GDP per capita and urban population20,49. The historical data of urban residential and commercial building floor areas from 1970 to 2010 are derived from the study by Deetman et al. for training the regression model49. The projections of GDP per capita and urban population follow the SSP2 scenario19. The details of the regression model and method are shown in Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Table 12. In this study, \({r}_{t}\) is assumed to follow the technology diffusion curve by using a logistic model (see Supplementary Note 5)50,51. Three different adoption scenarios are established to explore the impacts on the carbon consequences27: (1) medium and fast adoption: 30% adoption reached by 2050; (2) medium and slow adoption: 30% adoption reached by 2080; (3) high and fast adoption: 60% adoption reached by 2050. More details are shown in Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Data 1.

Metrics details

Why people follow rules, especially laws and social norms, is debated across the human sciences. The importance of intrinsic respect for rules is particularly controversial. To reveal the behavioural principles of rule-following, we develop CRISP, an interdisciplinary framework that explains rule-conformity C as a function of intrinsic respect for rules R, extrinsic incentives I, social expectations S and social preferences P. We deploy CRISP in four series of online experiments with 14,034 English-speaking participants. In our baseline experiments, 55–70% of participants conform to an arbitrary costly rule, even though they act anonymously and alone, and violations hurt no one. We show that people expect rule-conformity and view it as socially appropriate. Rule-breaking is contagious but remains moderate. Pro-social motives and extrinsic incentives increase rule-conformity, but unconditional rule-following and social expectations explain most of it. Our results demonstrate that respect for rules and social expectations are basic elements of rule-conformity that can explain why people follow laws and social norms even without extrinsic incentives and social preferences.

Rules regulate social life1,2,3 and are fundamental for maintaining stable social order and fostering large-scale cooperation in society4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Rules are principles or maxims that prescribe or proscribe a particular standard of behaviour (‘do x!', ‘don't do y!') and come in various forms, as orders, regulations and guidelines issued by authorities, as laws and legal statutes, and as informal social and moral norms14,15,16,17,18. Rules classify actions as permissible or impermissible and can be formal or informal, written or unwritten, flexible or rigid, clear or ambiguous, explicitly stated or implicitly assumed, and enforced or not enforced. Rules shape everyday practices in personal, professional and political affairs in numerous ways, such as in rules that coordinate behaviour and rules that govern social relations; rules that demand or prohibit certain speech and conduct in private, in public and in the political sphere; and rules that define etiquettes of behaviour and dress for different social situations. In short, ‘[w]e are, all of us, everywhere, always, enmeshed in a web of rules that supports and constrains'3 our actions and interactions.

Despite the omnipresence of rules in everyone's lives, the fundamental reasons why people follow them are not well understood. This lack of understanding is possibly due to a confluence of motives, which are debated controversially across the human sciences19,20. Do people follow rules out of obedience to authority or respect for tradition6,7? Or do people have an intrinsic respect for a rule because the rule says ‘do x!' and therefore people perceive it as a ‘deontic constraint'21, that is, an unconditional, non-instrumentalist requirement that places an interior demand (‘a duty') on how they should behave? Or do people follow rules out of self-interest, fearing that the potential costs of sanctions outweigh the benefits of breaking them?22,23 Do people conform to rules to meet social expectations (what they think others will do or demand of them)1 or do they follow rules due to pro-social motivations24,25,26,27,28, considering the impact of their behaviour on others?

In this Article we present a conceptual experimental framework, called CRISP, that is motivated by the questions raised above and that identifies the proximate behavioural channels that generate conformity (C) with rules: intrinsic respect for rules (R), extrinsic incentives (I), social expectations (S) and social preferences (P). CRISP incorporates arguments and evidence from across the behavioural sciences1,15,16,19,20,22,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43 and is inspired by related efforts to integrate the behavioural sciences44,45.

In CRISP, the most basic reason for rule-conformity is that it may occur for unconditional (intrinsic) respect for rules: people might conform out of a sense of duty to obey a rule12,19, that is, because they unconditionally respect the prescriptive or proscriptive demand a rule places on them21. According to social theorists, intrinsic respect for rules is the most fundamental channel to maintain social order19,21. The reason for this is that there are many situations where sanctions are weak or absent (that is, extrinsic incentives suggest breaking the rule), and consequences for others of breaking a rule are not salient8,9,10,12,15,19.

By contrast, many economists neglect intrinsic motives and instead argue that conformity with rules results from extrinsic incentives that are high enough11,22. Extrinsic incentives can be based on the economic costs and benefits of following or breaking a rule (for example, the expected cost of rule-following; expected formal or informal sanctions for rule-breaking)22,23, but can also consist of reputational incentives46,47. Many social scientists argue that people follow rules to conform with social expectations, regardless of extrinsic incentives—people want to conform with what they expect others will do and think ought to be done1,31,34,48,49. Finally, people with social preferences (pro-social motives)24,25,26,27,28 might conform with rules because rules often exist to prevent harm or to provide benefits to others29,50.

Based on our CRISP framework, we conducted four sets of experiments with a total of 14,034 participants. Our approach in experiment 1 is to eliminate all conventional reasons to follow a rule by creating a strong material incentive to violate it. Participants act anonymously and alone, which removes reputational concerns. We also eliminate any consequences of rule-following decisions for others, to mute pro-social motives.

Keeping the settings of experiment 1, experiment 2 measures social expectations in a variety of ways. Measuring social expectations is important, because they can exist in any situation, and people may have a desire to conform to these expectations1,31,37,48,49,51,52. Humans can have social expectations even when anonymous and alone, because people routinely rely on the capacities of mind-reading and perspective-taking20,53,54. The capacity of mind-reading allows people to form beliefs regarding what others expect of them (their normative beliefs) and what others are doing (their descriptive beliefs).

In experiment 3 we embed rule-following into a social context where participants observe the rule-following of other people, which is a realistic characteristic of many naturally occurring situations. Experiment 3 is also a test of the predictions from experiment 2 (and CRISP) that rule-following is on average conditional on social expectations.

In a final set of experiments (experiment 4), we add social consequences of rule-following and sanctions for rule-breaking to our baseline set-up. These experiments allow for other-regarding concerns and provide extrinsic incentives for rule-following. Although these added motives increase rule-following, we find that the baseline rate of rule-following already explains most of it. These results suggest that intrinsic respect for rules and social expectations are the key motives underlying rule-following; other-regarding concerns and extrinsic incentives, while enhancing rule-following, are not necessary to achieve high rates of rule-following in the first place.

CRISP formalizes the four channels introduced above and explains rule-conformity C as a function of four motivations:

CRISP assumes that, when deciding whether to conform with a rule or not, people weigh up all four elements of CRISP.

CRISP guides the interpretation of our experiments. We manipulate the extent of extrinsic incentives, which can encourage or discourage rule-following. Negative extrinsic incentives imply that rule-following is costly, and it creates an incentive to break the rule. Conversely, with sufficiently strong positive extrinsic incentives, rule-following is in the decision-maker's self-interest. Our experiments also control whether following or violating a rule generates a positive or negative externality (a harm or benefit) for someone else. If an externality is present, there is room for social preferences (pro-social motives) to play a role; otherwise, they are muted.

Central to CRISP are the social expectations (beliefs) that humans can entertain in any situation. Social expectations exist in two empirically measurable forms that can be separate sources of rule-conformity: ‘normative beliefs' and ‘descriptive beliefs'1,48,49. Normative beliefs (bn) represent the extent to which people believe conforming with a rule is socially appropriate and violating the rule is deemed socially inappropriate by most other people. Descriptive beliefs (bd) describe people's perceived degree of rule-conformity of other people. Crucially, for social expectations to influence rule-following, it must be the case that people make their rule-conformity dependent on their social beliefs: we therefore also elicit the functions n(bn) and d(bd), that is, we elicit people's rule-conformity for various increasing levels of the percentage of people bn who disapprove of a rule violation (resulting in the function n(bn)), and, similarly, for increasing levels of the percentage of people bd who conform with the rule (resulting in the function d(bd)).

CRISP identifies intrinsic respect for rules as any rule-following that is independent of social expectations, social preferences and incentives: following a rule regardless of what others do or think about it, that is, for all normative or descriptive beliefs, and regardless of incentives and social preferences. Unconditional disrespect for a rule is also possible, which manifests itself in breaking the rule regardless of social expectations (and possibly regardless of incentives and social preferences).

We conducted our four experiments (Methods and Supplementary Information) with 14,034 participants (average age 34.6 years, 49% female; demographic details are provided in Supplementary Table 1). We recruited most participants on the online platform Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our decision settings use a minimalist ‘traffic light task' (Fig. 1a) suitable for online participants. This task is a simplified version of the rule-following task originally introduced by Kimbrough and Vostroknutov55. We also developed an even more abstract version with the same logic (Fig. 1b). This abstract task removes any naturalistic content that might guide people's behaviour in the traffic light task55,56. Participants must move a circle to a red traffic light (or a grey waiting area in our abstract task), and then to a finishing line. Participants have a starting capital of 20 money units (MU), which visibly counts down by 1 MU per second (Fig. 1a,b). The instructions (Supplementary Information) explain that participants earn the most by moving as fast as possible to the finishing line; that is, participants can jump the traffic light at any point in time. Adopting a previous approach, we implemented the rule by explicitly stating that ‘The rule is to wait at the stop light until it turns green'55 (‘… until the cross disappears').

a, Experimental task in which people are instructed to follow a rule in a minimalist traffic light setting where the rule read ‘The rule is to wait at the stop light until it turns green'55. b, Abstract task setting without a traffic light context, where the rule read ‘The rule is to wait in the grey area until the cross disappears'. In a and b, violating the rule maximizes own earnings without affecting anyone else. Participants must move a circle across the screen by clicking a ‘Move' button. The endowment indicated on top of the decision screen starts at 20 MU and ticks down by 1 MU per second. c–e, Frequencies of moving patterns and percentages of rule-conformity (green) and rule violations (purple), in settings with control questions (c,e) and without control questions (d) that test the understanding of payoff consequences. The Methods and Supplementary Sections 1.1 and 1.2 report further background details on procedures and the traffic light task and abstract task, respectively. The video TrafficLightTask_nopeers.mov in the Supplementary Information shows how the task looked like to participants.

In experiments 1 to 3 (but not in some experiments in experiment 4), participants lose about 50–60% of their MUs if they follow the rule (that is, extrinsic incentives are negative). Hence, the tasks introduce a tension between rule-following and material self-interest, which is a feature of many real-world rules. The tasks are also non-strategic and asocial; unlike in previous tasks that have been used to study social norms36, there is a single anonymous decision-maker, and a violation affects nobody, which mutes pro-social motives. Thus, in terms of CRISP, other than an intrinsic respect for rules and a desire to conform to social expectations, there are no reasons to follow the rule.

We ran our experiments in two conditions: without and with control questions about the monetary consequences of rule-following (Supplementary Section 4). The condition with control questions arguably increases attentiveness and the salience of monetary incentives and thereby reduces the likelihood that rule-following is merely due to inattention or mistakes.

We ran experiment 1 in two versions: with the traffic light task (experiment 1a) and with the abstract task (experiment 1b). In experiment 1a we observed a high degree of rule-conformity (Fig. 1c,d). The average rate of rule-following across the two control questions' conditions was 65.6% [95% CI: 64.5–66.7%]. In the condition without control questions (n = 4,970), 70.0% [68.7–71.2%] of participants conformed with the rule; with control questions (n = 2,762) rule-following was 57.8% [55.9–59.6%].

Experiment 1b (Fig. 1b) with the abstract task was only run with control questions. The rule-following rate of 59.7% [57.0, 62.4%] of experiment 1b (Fig. 1e) confirmed the results from experiment 1a with control questions (Fig. 1c). Thus, while the salience of incentives reduces rule-following, there still exists substantial rule-following in conditions with control questions in both versions of experiment 1.

We replicated experiment 1a in a university laboratory. The physical laboratory offers more control than the online laboratory, but participants are less anonymous than online because the experimenter knows the identities of participants. We ran the experiments with control questions at the University of Nottingham (n = 103 students) and found a rule-following rate of 60.2% [50.7, 69.6%] (Extended Data Fig. 1). A replication conducted in a laboratory in Berlin, Germany, using the traffic light task with 10- to 20-year-olds as participants, reports 52.7% rule-following57. Kimbrough and Vostroknutov's seminal study, which was also conducted in a university laboratory, reports a rule-following rate of 62.5% (ref. 55). These findings suggest that our online results are not due to diminished control in the online environment (nor fear of not receiving approval after the experiment in the online experiment)58.

Further replications of our baseline task (as part of separate research questions) with participants recruited from Prolific (traffic light task; n = 363 Americans)59 and the Qualtrics panel (abstract task; n = 192 Swedish participants)60 yielded rule-following rates of 58% and 55%, respectively. These results suggest the robustness of rule-following rates across platforms. High rates of rule-following (with little demographic variability61) were also observed in another abstract task, the ‘ball-division task', where participants were told that the rule is to put balls into a blue bucket although a yellow bucket earned more money56. Their experiments revealed similar rule-following rates across participants from five countries (n = 1,138 participants; average rule-following rate of 56%)56. In an experiment with the ball-division task conducted in two waves one month apart with the same individuals, individual propensities to follow the rule turned out to be stable across the two waves (rule-following rates of 60.8% and 62.2%)62.

To put the rule-following rates further into perspective, participants in our experiments gave up 48.0% [46.9, 49.1%] of their possible earnings by following the rule (implied by moving times; Fig. 1). This rate is higher than the earnings people give up in dictator games26 (where people on average forgo 28% of their possible gains), but lower than the fraction of possible gains (75%) people forfeit in honesty tasks where cheating is a form of rule violation63.

Rule-following varied little with sociodemographics and the Big Five personality traits64 (the coefficients are very small and unsystematic, similar to findings in a repeated traffic light task61), but was positively related to being ‘patient'65 and being ‘shame-prone'66 (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). The result for patience lends psychological credibility to our task, because impulse control contributes to the psychological costs of rule-following in our setting. The result on shame-proneness corroborates previous evidence that rule-following is positively correlated with shame-proneness67. Rule-followers are also more likely to be conditional cooperators in a social dilemma task37. These correlations suggest that our rule-following tasks capture a general tendency to follow rules, which activates psychological mechanisms that also may affect behaviour in other settings55,56,61,68.

The results shown in Fig. 1 only inform us about a high prevalence of rule-following when it is costly and when it cannot affect anyone (no externalities). In terms of CRISP, rule conformity C can therefore only be due to intrinsic respect for rules R and social expectations S. As argued above, people may form social expectations and conform to them even when anonymous and alone, and in the absence of extrinsic incentives or considerations for others. The next set of experiments, in experiment 2, quantify the importance of social expectations for rule-following in our socially minimal set-up.

A core element of CRISP, and the research question of experiment 2, is social expectations and how they influence rule-conformity. To measure social expectations and to see how they translate into rule-conformity, we designed four between-subjects tasks (Methods), where, in all tasks, rule-following is costly and there are no externalities (that is, social preferences are muted). Two tasks elicit, respectively, normative beliefs bn and descriptive beliefs bd of rule-following from participants who had no experience with the task before (‘spectators'). Two further tasks elicit people's conditional rule-conformity as a function of their normative and descriptive beliefs, n(bn) and d(bd), respectively.

Eliciting the conditional rule-conformity functions n(bn) and d(bd) is crucial for the following reason: some people may only conform with the rule if sufficiently many others disapprove of rule violations, or if sufficiently many others do follow it too, and thresholds may differ between people. Eliciting n(bn) and d(bd) also allows us to determine unconditional rule-followers as a proxy for those who have an intrinsic respect for rules, regardless of their social expectations, and unconditional rule-violators as a proxy for those who disrespect rules even if they believe most other people do follow them and approve of the rule.

We measured normative beliefs of rule-following bn by using an established incentivized technique51. Rather than asking people's personal opinions about how appropriate or inappropriate they thought rule-following was, we asked participants, as ‘impartial spectators', to report how socially appropriate or inappropriate they thought most people thought an act of rule-following or an act of rule-breaking would be. We measured descriptive beliefs bd by asking spectators to guess the percentage of previous participants who conformed with the rule. We incentivized guesses by rewarding accuracy (Methods and Supplementary Sections 1.4 and 1.5).

We found that our rule generated strong normative and descriptive beliefs of rule-following. Despite the non-strategic and asocial nature of our task, nearly 80% of impartial spectators perceived rule-following as very socially appropriate, and 90% perceived rule-breaking as very socially inappropriate or somewhat socially inappropriate (Fig. 2a). Regarding descriptive beliefs, the spectators' median expectation was that 60% would conform with the rule (Fig. 2b). This expectation is in line with the actual rule-following rate observed in the experiment (Fig. 1c).

a, Perceptions of social appropriateness by spectators of rule-following and rule-breaking (n = 99) using an incentive-compatible mechanism of eliciting normative beliefs51. b, Descriptive beliefs of rule-following, as estimated by spectators (n = 95; paid for accuracy of estimate). Boxplot shows the distribution of spectators' expected portions of previous participants conforming with the rule (that is, waiting for the light to turn green; box, quartiles; median, thick solid line; mean, black dot; vertical line, range); orange dots are individuals' estimated conformity rates (jittered). c,d, Average conditional rule-conformity, elicited with the strategy method. The dashed line is the diagonal. We elicited people's conformity or violation as a function of the percentage (presented as quintiles) of others who disapprove of a rule violation (normative conditional rule-conformity n(bn), n = 158) (c) and conform with the rule (descriptive conditional rule-conformity d(bd), n = 159) (d). Dots show ±1 s.e.m. Rule-conformity is significantly higher than zero when either normative or descriptive beliefs are 0 (linear mixed models with ‘participant' as random intercept and ‘portion others disapprove of violation' (cf. c) or ‘portion others conform' (cf. d) as fixed effect have intercepts significantly higher than 0 (0.33 and 0.22, respectively; P < 0.001 for both; Supplementary Table 4 provides models controlling for age and gender).

To measure how social expectations influence rule-conformity, we elicited the conditional conformity functions n(bn) and d(bd). Participants had to decide whether to follow or break the rule in five different scenarios. The scenarios provide an exogenous variation in beliefs, presented as quintiles ((0–20%), …, (81–100%)), about what others said was socially appropriate to do (in the normative beliefs condition) or what others did in the task (in the descriptive beliefs condition). We used the strategy method37,69,70,71,72,73 to elicit within-subject responses of n(bn) and d(bd) for each of the five scenarios of either normative or descriptive beliefs. Thus, the elicited conformity functions provide individual thresholds of others' rule-conformity at which people will conform with the rule as well74 (Methods and Supplementary Section 1.6).

People's elicited rule-conformity is, on average, conditional on their normative and descriptive beliefs (Fig. 2c,d). Regarding normative conditional rule-following n(bn), when only a minority of people (between 0 and 20%) disapprove of rule-breaking, the average rule-conformity rate is 35.2% [27.8, 42.6%] (estimated intercept at 0% disapproval rate is 33.2%, P < 0.001; Supplementary Table 4). As the share of people who disapprove of rule-breaking increases from the (0–20%) quintile to the (80–100%) quintile, average normative rule-conformity increases from 35.2% to 56.0% (Fig. 2c).

Individual response profiles of n(bn) reveal the proportions of unconditional rule-followers and rule-breakers, and those who have a threshold level of the share of others disapproving of a rule violation for moving from rule-breaking to rule-following. Nineteen percent of people conformed with the rule regardless of how many others disapproved of a violation (they are unconditional rule-followers); 29% always violated; 30% followed after a threshold; and for 22%, rule-conformity did not monotonically increase with the share of others disapproving of violations (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Elicited rule-following is on average also conditional on whether other people are believed to conform with the rule. Average descriptive conditional rule-conformity d(bd) ranges from 28.5% [21.4, 35.5%] when hardly anyone else is believed to conform with the rule (in the (0–20%) quintile), to 56% [48.6, 64.1%] when most other people (in the (80–100%) quintile) are expected to conform with the rule (Fig. 2d). The individual response profiles of d(bd) reveal that 20% conform in all five quintiles (that is, their rule-following is unconditional on descriptive beliefs); 34% never conform (they are unconditional rule-violators); 31% conform conditionally, that is, their threshold is a quintile of descriptive beliefs larger than the lowest one; and 15% had non-monotonic responses, that is, their rule-conformity did not monotonically increase with the share of others following the rule (Extended Data Fig. 2).

The results of Fig. 2c,d suggest that, on average, conformity is conditional in our asocial and anonymous setting. They also suggest that some rule-following is independent of social expectations—even if very few people disapprove of breaking the rule, or if almost everyone else breaks the rule, many participants still followed the rule in our non-social decision setting where nobody was affected by rule-breaking.

Taken together, the results from Fig. 2 suggest that the rule-following rates observed in Fig. 1c,d reflect a mixture of unconditional and conditional rule-following based on social expectations (normative and descriptive beliefs). Our results show that even arbitrary rules in an anonymous and asocial setting with only one decision-maker generate social expectations that the rule should be followed and is followed, demonstrating a fundamental relationship between rules and social expectations—social expectations about following the rules can arise even without a justification for a rule that does not serve an obvious purpose. The mere existence of a rule seems to be enough for triggering social expectations of rule-following.

The following experiments (experiment 3) test a key implication of our results on social expectations. Because rule-following is conditional on descriptive beliefs (Fig. 2d) for many people, changed descriptive beliefs should change rule-following. However, eliciting conditional rule-conformity with the strategy method might be considered psychologically ‘cold', and observing others actually following or breaking the rule might lead to more visceral rule-following or rule-breaking. Moreover, in many naturally occurring situations, people often do observe whether other people follow the rules or not. Observing peer behaviour provides information that feeds into descriptive beliefs, which, according to the result from Fig. 2d, should be positively related to own rule-following. Figure 2d suggests we should see rule-following rates of at least 28% even if all observed peers violate the rule.

The results reported in Fig. 2d suggest that, on average, people's rule-following will depend positively on how many other people follow the rule. In experiment 3 we test this prediction using a modified version of our traffic light task in which participants observe how other participants had previously behaved in the task. In terms of CRISP, like in experiments 1 and 2, extrinsic incentives are negative (that is, rule-following is costly) and there are no externalities (implying that pro-social motives are muted). Participants completed three sequential iterations of the task. After completing the task alone (iteration 1, Fig. 1a), in iteration 2 participants were randomly assigned to one of 28 treatments. In a baseline treatment, participants completed a second iteration of the same traffic light task alone, without any information about how other participants had behaved. In the other 27 treatments (Fig. 3), participants in the second iteration could see on their screen, in addition to their own circle, other circles programmed to display the dynamic movements of ‘peers', sampled from real movements of previous participants. Figure 3a shows an example with six peers who violate the rule. In the third iteration, the participant completed the task alone again.

Shown is an example task with six peers who all violated the rule. b, Rates of rule-conformity in 27 between-subject treatments (total n = 7,312; n > 257 for each treatment) that exogenously manipulate group size (from one peer to six peers whose dynamic moving behaviour was sampled from participants of a pilot experiment), with the number of peers either following the rule or violating it (blue and red circles (with a cross), respectively), at the bottom of the panels. Dots in the panels show rule-following rates (with changes from the no-peers weighted average baseline rule-conformity rate of 77%; horizontal line) in iteration 2 in treatments with and without control questions. Further details are provided in the Methods, Supplementary Section 1.2 and Supplementary Fig. 1.

The 27 treatments in iteration 2 differed in the number of peers a participant observed (from 1 to 6), and in whether these peers followed or broke the rule. Observing peer behaviour exogenously manipulates descriptive beliefs of rule-conformity. Depending on the treatment, we manipulated beliefs towards more rule-following (when peers were shown to conform with the rule) or more violations (when peers broke the rule). Our design reveals how peer rule-conformity shapes rule-following relative to the no-peer baseline. We also varied the number of peers displayed on the screen to see whether the share or the absolute number of rule-followers or rule-violators in a group influences own rule-following.

In the no-peer baseline in iteration 2 of the task, the average rule-conformity rate was 77.2% [73.1, 81.2%]. Compared to this benchmark, participants who observed fully conforming peers showed a small and statistically insignificant increase in rule-following (Fig. 3b, blue squares; top row of Supplementary Table 5). This increase was similar across all group sizes (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).

In contrast, the observation of just one rule-breaking peer led to a substantial decrease in rule-following. The decrease in rule-conformity for one rule-breaker is similar (around eight percentage points) for all groups with at least two peers. This observation is consistent with the ‘bad apple effect', according to which just one defector can diminish cooperation in social dilemma problems75 (it should be noted, however, that, depending on the environment, rule-following might have positive spillover effects on other behaviours such as honesty76). Observing all peers violating the rule led to a significant drop in rule-following, similar in magnitude for all group sizes (Fig. 3b, leftmost red circles in each subpanel; Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). When participants observed a mixture of rule-following and rule-breaking peers, the effects of the latter prevailed; the average effect was always a decrease in rule-conformity relative to baseline. We did not observe a group size effect in the contagiousness of rule violations—patterns of rule compliance appear to be driven by the proportion rather than the absolute number of violators.

Despite contagious rule violations, overall rule-conformity rates are still remarkably high in absolute terms. Even when six peers violated the rule, 55% [49.4, 61.2%] of participants still followed the rule. Focusing only on conditions with control questions, rule-following never dropped below 40%, even when six out of six peers violated the rule (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Participants in all treatments completed a third and final iteration of the rule-following task without peers. The participants of the baseline treatment (with no peers in either iteration) therefore had to choose three times alone whether or not to follow the rule. Their rule-following rates across the three iterations were 74.0% [67.7, 80.4%], 84.5% [79.3, 89.8%] and 83.4% [78.0, 88.8%] without control questions (n = 181) and 49.8% [43.5, 56.1%], 63.2% [57.1, 69.3%] and 59.0% [52.8, 65.2%] with control questions (n = 239). Against this benchmark, those participants who had previously observed peers breaking the rule (in iteration 2) were more likely to break the rule later (in iteration 3, without peers). A 1% increase in observed peer violations in the second iteration increased participants' own rule-breaking in the third iteration by 0.12% (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 7). Across all treatments, the lowest rule-conformity rate in iteration 3 was 58%. These results indicate that observing rule-following behaviour by peers can have lasting effects, which is relevant for the dynamics of rule-following.

In a complementary analysis (n = 490 new participants; Extended Data Fig. 3), we show that descriptive beliefs also influence normative beliefs. Observing rule-breaking does not change the social appropriateness of following the rule, but it makes rule violations less socially inappropriate.

In terms of CRISP, experiments 1 to 3 have established the properties of rule-conformity when extrinsic incentives encourage rule-breaking and social preferences do not matter because rule-breaking has no consequences for others. Our final set of experiments (experiment 4) adds consequences for others (‘an externality') and weak and strong extrinsic incentives as motives for following the rule. Experiment 4 also measures social expectations (bn, bd) and elicit conditional conformity with them (n(bn), d(bd)). We use between-subjects designs and the same techniques as in experiment 2 to see, in the CRISP framework, how consequences for others and extrinsic incentives affect social expectations, and conditional conformity with them.

The experiments in experiment 4 are relevant from a CRISP perspective. First, rules typically exist in situations where rule-breaking has consequences for others29 and breaking a rule often triggers sanctions. Sanctions can be formal, as in the case of breaking the law, or they are informal (expressed as social disapproval), for example, when violating social norms77. Second, in terms of CRISP, this set of experiments provides a further opportunity to assess how much of rule-following can be explained by respect for rules and social expectations in settings where social preferences and incentives can also influence rule-following.

There were 4,045 participants in these experiments (Supplementary Table 1). All experiments were conducted between-subjects and with control questions before the start of the traffic light task. We had four nested treatments. The first was a replication of our baseline traffic light task discussed above (treatment Baseline, BL), which provides a further assessment of the importance of intrinsic respect for rules and social expectations. Second, in treatment EX (treatment Externality) we added an externality to treatment BL. To create an externality—that is, a consequence for others—we provisionally donated US $1 to a well-known charity (the Red Cross). Participants were informed that violating the rule in the (otherwise unmodified) traffic light task cancels the donation to the charity. Thus, in terms of CRISP, a rule violation renders externalities negative (because the provisional donation is lost) and allows social preferences24,25,26,27,28 to influence rule-following, while keeping the extrinsic incentive to violate the rule.

The third and fourth treatment added sanctions to the setting of EX. Sanctions were implemented by the experimental software and resulted in a loss of all MU for that decision. We varied the probability of being punished for a rule violation, from 10% (treatment Weak Punishment; WP) to 90% (treatment Strong Punishment; SP). Participants knew the consequences of punishment and its probability. Thus, for a risk-neutral person, extrinsic incentives are negative (rule-following is costly) if the likelihood of punishment is 10%; and extrinsic incentives are positive (rule-following is monetarily beneficial) if a rule violation led to a loss of earnings with 90% probability. In short, in SP, all four motivational elements of CRISP can influence rule-following behaviour.

In terms of CRISP, our experiments provide a causal analysis of how externalities, which enable pro-social motives, and extrinsic incentives influence social expectations and rule-conformity. Here we focus on rule-conformity and how much of it can be explained by unconditional respect for rules and descriptive beliefs. Details of how externalities and weak and strong punishment influence social expectations (bn, bd) and how they translate into rule-conformity (n(bn), d(bd)) are provided in Extended Data Fig. 4.

Rule-conformity in our replication baseline treatment BL was 55%, which is close to the conformity rate of 58% in the initial baseline experiment with control questions (Fig. 1) and also the level of descriptive beliefs bd in BL (Fig. 4, black dots). Because BL is nested in all other treatments, the rule-conformity rate of 54.6% [50.3, 58.9%] in BL provides a benchmark of the combined extent of unconditional rule-following and social expectations in our setting that exists without externalities and extrinsic incentives. Additional motives for rule-conformity in the CRISP framework, as provided by treatments EX, WP and SP, are expected to increase rule-following, which is what we observe (Fig. 4). For instance, compared to BL, the presence of an externality increased rule-conformity by 6.8 percentage points, and the presence of strong incentives in SP increased rule-conformity by 23.1 percentage points to 77.8% [74.0, 81.5%] (Fig. 4, Tukey's honestly significant difference test (THSD): P < 0.001; Supplementary Table 11).

The four nested treatments consist of a replication of the baseline traffic light task without peers (BL) where only intrinsic respect for rules and social expectations can explain rule-following, and three treatments that cumulatively add motives to BL to follow the rule. Treatment EX adds an externality (a foregone donation of US $1 to a charity) triggered by a rule violation. Treatment WP adds a sanction of rule violations to treatment EX with a detection probability of 10% and treatment SP with a detection probability of 90%. Punishment implied the loss of all earnings (except the flat participation fee). Shown are mean rule-following rates in the behavioural experiment (nBL = 501, nEX = 507, nWP = 515, nSP = 484). Dots and whiskers show mean descriptive beliefs (±1 s.e.m.; nBL = 102, nEX = 98, nWP = 112, nSP = 96). The dark green shaded parts of the bars show the average proportions of participants who conform unconditionally regardless of their normative and descriptive beliefs (averages calculated from the strategy method data eliciting n(.) and d(.), those who always conformed; nBL = 152, nEX = 156, nWP = 154, nSP = 157). The full set of results are shown in Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5 and Supplementary Tables 9 and 10.

Interestingly, although SP strongly increased rule-conformity, it is less than the predicted 100%. This might be due to the probabilistic nature of the incentives, which, despite a punishment likelihood of 90%, might have led some people to gamble on getting away with breaking the rule. It can also be due to the fact that, in all treatments, including SP, many people's rule-following is conditional on others' rule-conformity (Extended Data Fig. 4d). If some people believe that others do not obey the rule, conditional conformity with social expectations might have induced rule-breaking. There is also a fraction of 6% of people who, irrationally (in terms of foregone payoffs), and maybe defiantly, violate the rule unconditionally (Extended Data Fig. 5).

The dark-shaded parts of Fig. 4 show the average fraction of people who conformed unconditionally. We estimated the fractions of unconditional rule-followers from the shares of those participants who followed the rule regardless of either their normative or their descriptive beliefs about others' conformity as elicited by n(bn) or d(bd). In BL, unconditional rule-following cannot be influenced by social preferences or fear of sanctions, and therefore the conformity rate of 26.9% [19.9, 34.0%] is a proxy for the extent of intrinsic respect for the rule. The presence of externalities (EX) and weak and strong incentives (WP and SP) not only increased overall conformity, but also the rate of participants who did not condition their rule-following on social expectations (Fig. 4; dark green bars).

In our analysis so far, we have provided separate evidence for all elements of CRISP. Table 1 brings the evidence from experiments 1 to 4 together in a way that allows a comparison of rule-following rates and their change or range according to the motivational elements of CRISP: respect for rules (top), social expectations (middle) and pro-social motives and extrinsic incentives (bottom).

Our results suggest that respect for rules is a central reason for rule-following (Table 1, top). We can proxy this in two ways. First, the baseline average rule-following rate across the two baseline experiments (in experiment 1 and experiment 4, treatment BL) is 64.9% [63.9, 66.0%]. Because extrinsic incentives are negative and no-one is affected by a rule violation, this means that, in terms of CRISP, rule-following is due to intrinsic respect for rules and/or conformity with social expectations that people might entertain even if anonymous and alone. This rate might also be affected by how salient the payoffs are—adding control questions reduces rule-following by 12.7 percentage points [10.6, 14.7], from 70.0% [68.7, 71.2%] to 57.3% [55.6, 59.0%]. The fact that rule-following is so high without control questions suggests that for many people the default reaction is to follow the rule (consistent with Hayek's dictum that ‘man is … a rule-following animal')9, and this is modified once control questions make the incentives to violate the rule salient. Control questions can reduce misperceptions78, but also induce more reflective thinking79. The 22% and 23% of people who follow the rule unconditionally, that is, regardless of their normative or descriptive beliefs (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 5), provide a lower bound for the respect for rules in our data.

In CRISP, social expectations (Table 1, middle) can only influence rule-following to the extent that people condition their rule-following decisions on their normative or descriptive beliefs, as elicited by the functions n(bn) and d(bd). Here we restrict attention to experiment 2 (Fig. 2) and the BL treatment of experiment 4 (Extended Data Fig. 4). Moving from the lowest quintile of beliefs (0–20%) to the highest quintile of beliefs (81–100%) increased average rule-following rates by 19.9 [12.2, 27.6] and 23.2 [15.6, 30.9] percentage points, for normative and descriptive conditional rule-conformity, respectively. This range of percentage point changes for conditional rule-conformity is only slightly lower than the 24.8 [21.7, 27.8] percentage point change for observed peer behaviour as measured in experiment 3. Regression estimates (Supplementary Table 6) show that a 1% increase in violation by peers increased violations by 0.19%, which is slightly higher than the 0.13% estimate of peer effects observed in other laboratory and field experiments80.

Table 1, bottom, draws on the nested treatments of experiment 4 (reported in Fig. 4) and shows how rule-following is affected by extrinsic incentives and an externality, which opens the possibility for social preferences to matter. Rule-conformity increases by seven percentage points if social preferences can play a role. Weak punishment, which still maintains an incentive to violate the rule, barely increases rule-conformity compared to when no punishment is possible at all. By contrast, strong punishment increases rule-conformity by 16 percentage points. Notice that the behavioural effect of extrinsic incentives is lower than unconditional rule-conformity or the change induced by social expectations.

Countless rules govern human social life every day and in all societies. To make progress in understanding ubiquitous rule-following behaviour and its importance for social order, we have introduced the experimental framework CRISP, which explains conformity with rules as a function of respect for the rule, incentives, social expectations and social preferences. Across four sets of comparable experiments (Figs. 1–4), we provided evidence for all four motivational elements of CRISP.

Perhaps our most important finding from the viewpoint of CRISP is that ~55–70% (Figs. 1 and 4) of rule-following cannot be explained by standard motives, because it happens in anonymous single-decision-maker settings where social preferences do not matter, and self-interest suggests breaking the rule. Under these circumstances, rule-conformity according to CRISP is due to a mixture of unconditional and conditional conformity with perceived social expectations (Fig. 2). We estimate that in our experiments ~23% of people conform with the rule unconditionally, that is, independent of social expectations, and ~30% of people are conditional rule-followers. The 23% rate of unconditional rule-following is substantial when compared to the extent to which conformity with varying social expectations and extrinsic incentives shift rule-following (by 20–25 percentage points; Figs. 3 and 4 and Table 1).

We believe our evidence of substantial unconditional rule-following is an important result. The reason is that intrinsic respect for rules is arguably required for social order in many situations in which extrinsic incentives—which provide self-interest-based reasons for rule-following—are weak or absent, and consequences for others are not salient. This argument has been made long before us5,9, but its importance has remained controversial, not least for lack of evidence for an intrinsic respect for rules19. With the help of CRISP, our study provides evidence for the existence of an intrinsic respect for rules. Our results also suggest that sanctions for rule violations and social preferences increase rule-conformity (Fig. 4) but may not be necessary to induce substantial rule-following. Our findings may therefore help explain why important types of rule—social norms, laws and orders—guide so much of human behaviour, because conformity with them is high without any extrinsic incentives.

Some caveats and tasks for future research are in order. First, our results stem from two minimalist stylized settings, the traffic light task and an abstract rule-following task, where the rule asks people to wait, thereby demanding patience. People in the traffic light task might also wait because the task is reminiscent of a real-world situation where the rule is inferred from the traffic light itself, without stating the rule explicitly55. Although we kept our setting constant across our four experiments, the quantitative effects we found are valid within that setting and may be different in tasks that do not require patience, such as the ball-division task56. More generally, and more importantly, rules in reality come in many different forms and vary, for instance, in ambiguity and observability of their violation59. Our CRISP framework (and its experimental methodology) can be deployed to study how the motivational elements of CRISP interact to produce rule-conformity of any rule (laboratory rules or naturally occurring rules). For instance, intrinsic rule-following is probably more important in many naturally occurring environments where rules have meaning3,10,12,15,19,81,82, evoke personal norms and internalized values38,41,45,83,84, trigger moral judgements18, feelings of moral obligation85 and guilt aversion86, or appeal to self-image concerns87. It is also important to notice that rule-following in real-world settings can be socially harmful, such as conforming to bad social norms88,89,90,91 or obeying rules that demand nefarious acts or committing atrocities92,93,94,95. Again, CRISP provides the toolbox to study the behavioural properties of such rules.

Second, our evidence is limited to one online population, Amazon Mechanical Turk workers in the United States, and one student pool at the University of Nottingham. A task for future research is to study methodological limitations of online participant pools for rule-following paradigms, and, more importantly, the generalizability of our results to other populations. Cross-cultural research using CRISP might be particularly promising56,96. Recent research suggests that distal ecological and historical processes2, the rule of law97,98 and the historical importance of kinship in the organization of social life99,100 can explain differences in societal outcomes across contemporary societies—factors that might also impact rule-following and its behavioural determinants according to CRISP.

Third, our experiments are ‘between-subjects', which does not allow us to study how the behavioural motives of CRISP are linked at the individual level. Because potentially all four motives behind CRISP can determine rule-following in many realistic settings, developing a within-subject framework that allows comparing the relative importance of the behavioural motives at the individual level is an interesting endeavour101.

Fourth, except for experiment 3, we have studied rule-following in single-decision-maker settings without feedback of what other people actually did. In the experiments in experiment 3, people made only one decision after they saw what their peers did (Fig. 3). Single-shot decisions are unrealistic in situations where people can repeatedly observe the rule-following of other people. Related research using public goods and donation games suggests observing others might lead to less rule-conformity37,102,103. Moreover, as our results also suggest, more rule violations may also make them more socially acceptable (Extended Data Fig. 3). Future research should therefore study the fragility of rule-conformity32, its population-level dynamics20,39,104,105,106 and the consequences for normative beliefs107,108,109,110.

Fifth, in our experiments, the rule was stated by an experimenter, and rule-following in our experiments is therefore a kind of ‘experimenter-demand effect'111, which is often seen as problematic. As was also pointed out by previous research55,68, in our context, the experimenter-demand effect is not problematic, but rather the object of our study, because it is the nature of rules that they demand a certain behaviour. In reality, some rules (laws, regulations, orders, guidelines) are set by an authority and others (social norms) emerge via social learning13,112,113,114,115. In this Article, we made a start in studying the behavioural principles of following a clearly stated rule by using the authority of the experimenter to set the rule. Because, in reality, some rules are set and some emerge114,116, studying the role of rule-setting and emergence through the lens of CRISP is another interesting task for future research.

Here we describe the most important details of the methodology of our experiments. Details are provided in the Supplementary Section 1. The experiments received ethical approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the Nottingham School of Economics (protocol no. 030_ERC_AP_MT) and complied with all relevant guidelines. Participants provided informed consent before entering the experiments. The experiments were not pre-registered. Participants received a participation fee and were paid according to their decisions (details below). No deception was used.

Participants for most experiments were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk58,117 in 2014–2015 (experiments 1 to 3) and in 2018 (experiment 4). One experiment was run in 2016 with students in the CeDEx lab at the University of Nottingham. Participation was restricted to Amazon Mechanical Turk workers from the United States to ensure understanding of English instructions (Supplementary Table 1 provides the demographic details of all experiments reported in this Article). To minimize selection into our experiments, descriptions only contained general information on the task.

We used the software LIONESS Lab (https://lioness-lab.org/)118 to develop and conduct our experiments. All experiment instructions are provided in Supplementary Section 4. The online experiments were run under pseudonymous conditions; that is, it was impossible for the experimenter and any other participant to identify individual participants. In the laboratory experiments, participant identities were known to the experimenter.

We conducted four sets of experiments with a total of 14,031 unique participants. No participant was excluded. Here, we briefly summarize the experiments. Details of how we implemented them are provided below and in the Supplementary Information. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. We explain our sample size considerations separately for each experiment.

To describe our experiments compactly, we use the following notation borrowed from our framework CRISP. Extrinsic incentives I can be negative (I < 0) or positive (I > 0); that is, people have an incentive to violate the rule (if I < 0) or to follow it if I > 0 is large enough. We also manipulated whether a rule violation created an externality for a third party, called X, which, in our experiments, is either X = 0 or X < 0. If X = 0, no third party is affected by whether the rule is followed or not. If X < 0, a third party is harmed by a rule violation (loss of a provisional donation to the Red Cross). If X < 0, there is room for pro-social motives to affect rule-following decisions, whereas if X = 0 pro-social motives are muted. Our experiments also manipulated whether the participant could observe the rule-following decisions of peers or not; if not, peers = 0, if yes, peers > 0.

In experiment 1, n = 8,983, I < 0, X = 0 and peers = 0. Experiment 1 was conducted in two versions. Experiment 1 with the traffic light task is the first of three iterations, in all of which I < 0, X = 0, peers = 0. The second and third iterations serve as the baseline condition for experiment 3. The purpose was to establish the degree of rule-conformity in an easy-to-understand stylized context and under conditions with no standard reasons to follow the rule. Some experiments had control questions, and some had not, which allows us to see how the salience of payoffs affects rule-following. Sample size was determined by the requirements for experiment 3, resulting in 7,732 participants as explained in the following. The results are illustrated in Fig. 1c,d. Experiment 1 with the abstract task (Fig. 1b) was conducted with n = 1,251 participants and had the purpose to test rule-following behaviour in an entirely decontextualized setting. The results are shown in Fig. 1e.

In experiment 2, n = 511, I < 0, X = 0 and peers = 0. The purpose was to measure the social expectations elements of CRISP, which are the normative beliefs (bn), the descriptive beliefs (bd), and the normative and descriptive rule-conformity functions n(bn) and d(bd) in four between-subjects experiments as described in the following. Sample size was planned to be similar to related experiments37. The results are presented in Fig. 2.

In experiment 3, n = 7,732, I < 0 and X = 0. There were three iterations. In iteration 1 (=experiment 1) and iteration 3, peers = 0, and in iteration 2, peers > 0. The purpose of iteration 2 was to measure the role of observing the rule-following behaviour of peers (a form of descriptive belief) for own rule-following behaviour. In iteration 2, we had 27 between-subjects treatments that manipulated the number of peers a participant saw in iteration 2 (either 1 or 2, or … 6) and whether these peers violated the rule or not. We planned to have at least 250 participants per treatment. The realized range was 258–286, with a total of 7,732 participants. In the benchmark treatment, peers = 0 in all three iterations (n = 420). We also ran experiments to see how peers' rule-conformity decisions influence normative beliefs bn. These experiments (n = 491 participants) are described in Extended Data Fig. 3.

In experiment 4, total n = 4,045 and peers = 0 in all experiments. All experiments had three iterations. We ran four series of experiments with a planned sample size of roughly double the sample size of each of the treatments in experiment 3 (~250 each). Experiment 4 employed a nested design—where motives to conform with the rule according to CRISP are added cumulatively—to establish the roles of externalities and weak and strong incentives for rule-conformity:

Experiment BL (n = 501) was a replication of experiment 1 with I < 0 and X = 0.

In experiment EX, n = 507, I < 0 and X < 0. The purpose was to measure rule-following when social preferences are possible because a rule violation creates an externality. Comparison of EX with BL reveals the degree to which pro-social motives influence rule-following.

In experiment WP, n = 515, I < 0 and X < 0. This experiment introduced weak punishment for a rule violation that does not change the incentives to follow the rule. Comparison of WP with EX reveals how the presence of weak incentives influences rule-conformity.

In experiment SP, n = 484, I > 0 and X < 0. This experiment introduces strong punishment for a rule violation that creates an incentive to follow the rule. Comparison of SP with WP reveals the relative importance of weak and strong incentives for rule-conformity.

For experiment 4, we ran a further set of four experiments, like those in experiment 2, with the purpose to measure the social expectations elements of CRISP, that is, bn, bd, n(bn) and d(bd) in between-subjects experiments for each of BL, EX, WP and SP. The planned sample sizes for each of the four elements of social expectations were similar to the samples sizes of experiment 2, with a total of 2,038 participants. Sample details are provided in Supplementary Table 1, and the detailed results in Extended Data Fig. 4.

For reported proportions of rule-conformity, we indicate the precision of our estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in square brackets. These CIs provide the range within which we expect the true population proportion to fall with 95% certainty if the study were repeated multiple times; that is, they are indicators of the precision of the point estimates. CIs are calculated as p ± 1.96 × sqrt(p × (1 − p)/n), where p is the sample proportion and n is the sample size.

In most experiments we used a traffic light task, which is a simplified and more abstract version of a related tool (which had five traffic lights, a stick figure and a ‘walk' button)55. In our task, participants controlled a circle and had to ‘move' it across the screen to a single red traffic light, and then over a finish line (Fig. 1a; for a video illustration, see TrafficLightTask_nopeers.mov in the Supplementary Information). The first click triggered a continual move of the circle to the traffic light (where the circle stopped); upon the second click, the circle continued moving automatically and at constant speed to the finishing line. Participants started with an endowment of 20 MU, which was worth US $1. Each second, this endowment dropped by 1 MU, indicated at the top of the screen. Across all treatments, the traffic light turned green after 12 s. The instructions made it clear that the participant would make the most money by moving the circle across the finish line as fast as possible; that is, they could click anytime they wanted before the traffic light turned green. However, following ref. 55, the instructions also explicitly stated that ‘The rule is to wait until the traffic light turns green'. It was clear that there was no sanction for violating this rule (except in treatments with punishment).

The abstract version of the task (Fig. 1b) was developed by us and worked the same as the traffic light task. Instead of the traffic light, there was an X above a grey waiting area. The rule said ‘The rule is to wait in the grey area until the cross disappears'.

In total, 7,732 participants completed the traffic light task, in two conditions—without and with control questions. In the condition with control questions (n = 4,970), after the instructions, but before the actual task, we included two compulsory control questions about possible earnings for rule violation and rule-following to maximize participants' understanding of how earnings were computed. In the condition without control questions (n = 2,762), no questions were asked. The abstract task (n = 1,251) was only run with control questions.

Each participant completed three iterations of the traffic light task, following an A–B–A design. In the first iteration, referred to as part I, the participant completed the task alone (these data are the basis for Fig. 1c). In iteration 2 (part II), we implemented 27 treatments, systematically varying the number of peers a participant observed (from 1 to 6), and in how many of these peers followed or violated the rule (Fig. 3b). In each treatment, the actual moving behaviour of randomly selected actual previous participants (subject to the treatment composition) was shown (for a video illustration, see TrafficLightTask_peers.mov in the Supplementary Information). In the 28th treatment (the baseline treatment), no peers were shown in B, that is for these participants, the task in B was identical to A. The final iteration (part III) was the same as the first part A. Participants again completed the task alone. Moving before the traffic light turned green counted as rule-breaking, and moving after the traffic light turned green counted as rule-following (Fig. 1).

We measured normative beliefs in the traffic light task using an incentive-compatible methodology51. Participants acted as spectators and were asked to rate the ‘social appropriateness' of behaviours of a hypothetical decision-maker participating in the traffic light task. After reading the same instructions as the participants, the spectators were asked to evaluate two possible behaviours: (i) following the rule and (ii) violating the rule. Ratings were given on the following scale (with numerical value in brackets): (1) ‘very socially inappropriate', (2) ‘somewhat socially inappropriate', (3) ‘somewhat socially appropriate' and (4) ‘very socially appropriate'. Participants whose ratings where the same as a randomly matched other participant received a bonus.

Participants acted as spectators and had to estimate the rule-following rate among previous participants in the traffic light task. First, spectators were shown the instructions that these previous workers had received. Second, after confirming that spectators understood the previous workers' task, spectators entered their estimate of the percentage of workers who obeyed the rule. If their estimate was no more than five percentage points off the observed percentage of rule-following, spectators received a bonus payment of US $1. Otherwise, they received US $0. Spectators were informed of this incentive scheme before they participated in the task.

Participants decided to follow or to violate the rule for different, exogenously induced levels of normative and descriptive beliefs. To measure these conditional rule-conformity functions, we used an approach based on the strategy method37,70,71,72. We used a between-subject design, where participants completed the elicitation of either n(bn) or d(bd). After reading the instructions, we asked participants to choose whether to follow the rule or to break it across five different scenarios. In each case, participants were informed of the exact payoffs associated with rule-following and violation of the rule. These payoffs were based on the actual payoffs from rule-following and violation in the behavioural task.

In the case of descriptive conditional rule-conformity as a function of descriptive beliefs d(bd), we elicited participants' preference for rule-following for scenarios that differed in the percentage of other participants who would follow the rule. In scenario 1, we told participants to imagine that between 0 and 20% of other participants would follow the rule and asked them whether they themselves preferred to violate or follow the rule in this situation, knowing what the costs of rule-following are. In the other four scenarios we elicited participants' preference for following the rule in the cases where 21–40%, 41–60%, 61–80% or 81–100% of other participants would follow the rule. The elicitation thus measures participants' conditional preference for rule-following d(bd), in correspondence to five exogenous levels of descriptive beliefs (bd) about others' rule-following.

The elicitation for normative conditional rule-conformity as a function of normative beliefs n(bn) was similar except that we described different scenarios in which 0–20%, 21–40%, 41–60%, 61–80% or 81–100% of other participants would disapprove of rule violations.

The elicitation of both n(bn) and d(bd) was incentive-compatible (Supplementary Section 1.6).

All participants in all experiments received a participation fee and, as is common in experimental economics119, were paid according to their decisions in an incentive-compatible way. Details are provided in Supplementary Section 1.

Experiments run in the CeDEx Lab at the University of Nottingham (n = 103 undergraduates). Purple: movements before the signal changed – violating the rule; Green: movements after the signal changed – conforming with the rule.

This is the individual-level breakdown of Fig. 2c,d. The grey bars on top of the stacked bars reflect individuals whose rule-conformity did not monotonically increase with the percentage of others disapproving of violations (for normative beliefs bn; left-hand-side bar) or conform with the rule (for descriptive beliefs bd; right-hand-side bar).

In these experiments (n = 491), we test the argument that descriptive beliefs bd may also influence normative beliefs bn if observing peers breaking the rule leads people to revise their normative beliefs. Shown is peer behaviour and perceived social appropriateness of actions: Perceptions of social appropriateness of conforming (left panel) and violating the rule (right panel) using an incentive-compatible mechanism of eliciting normative beliefs16. Bars show ratings for rule-following and rule violation, for four different between-subject conditions where either 1 or 6 peers follow the rule (blue circles) or violate it (red circles with ×). Black dots are normalised mean ratings with their deviations from the no-peers baseline rating (indicated with horizontal lines; these are the ratings in Fig. 2a in the main text). Extended Data Fig. 3 (and the regression in Supplementary Table 8) support the hypothesis that descriptive beliefs causally influence normative beliefs. When peers (both six peers and one peer) conformed with the rule (left panel), normative beliefs about rule-conformity did not change relative to the no-peer baseline (Fig. 2a in main text). This was also the case when only one peer broke the rule. Even when six peers broke the rule, the mean rating of the social appropriateness of rule-conformity only changed little: at least 87% of participants still thought that conforming with the rule was very or somewhat socially appropriate. In contrast, the social appropriateness rating for rule violation (right panel) increased with the number of violators: when six peers violated the rule, 42% of participants found it at least somewhat socially appropriate to break the rule.

The four nested treatments consist of a replication of the traffic light task without peers and no externality (Baseline, BL; replicating Fig. 1) and reported in Fig. 4, and three new treatments where a rule violation triggers an externality (a foregone donation of $1 to a charity, treatment Externality, EX) and where rule violations are punished with a probability of 10% (treatment Weak Punishment, WP) or 90% (treatment Strong Punishment, SP). Punishment implied loss of all earnings (except the flat participation fee). Panels show data across all four treatments a Normative beliefs bn, that is, social appropriateness of rule-following and rule-breaking (total n = 404). Black dots are mean ratings. Pairs of bars show ratings for rule-following (lhs) and rule-breaking (rhs); legend as in Fig. 2a. b Descriptive beliefs bd of rule-following (total n = 408); legend as in Fig. 2b. (c and d) Average conditional rule-conformity, measured with the strategy method by eliciting people's rule-following or rule-breaking as a function of the percentage of people who c disapprove of a rule violation and d conform with the rule; bars show ±1 s.e.m (c: total n = 607; d: total n = 619).

(a: normative beliefs; b: descriptive beliefs). Stacked bars show the individual-level breakdown of Extended Data Fig. 4c,d. As in Extended Data Fig. 2, the grey bars on top of the stacked bars reflect individuals whose rule-following did not monotonically increase with the percentage of others disapproving of violations (for normative beliefs bn; panel a) or following with the rule (descriptive beliefs bd; panel b). The fraction of people who always conform (green bars) is also shown as dark-shaded part in Fig. 4 in the main text.

Statistically, men are more likely than women to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, with about 18 million more men living with the condition worldwide. This doesn't tell the whole story. When women do get a diagnosis, they're often older and have a higher body fat mass. They're also more likely to die from diabetes-related causes, especially heart disease. And some researchers think underdiagnosis might explain part of the gap—perhaps more cases are being missed in women.

To address this disparity, researchers are trying to understand more about the biological and social differences that contribute to later diagnoses and worse outcomes in women, with some suggesting it's time health care providers change the way they test for diabetes in order to catch at-risk women earlier, when treatments and lifestyle changes can have more impact.

There are several potential reasons behind the differences in diagnosis for men and women. While many risk factors for type 2 diabetes are universal, they tend to show up later in women. The disease may also present differently in women, which could lead current diagnostic tools to overlook them. Using some tests but not others is a “major reason for underdiagnosis of diabetes in women,” says Michael Leutner, a professor in endocrinology and metabolism and a member of the Gender Medicine Unit at the Medical University of Vienna.

We know there are biological differences between the sexes that affect type 2 diabetes—particularly the impact of hormones. Major hormonal shifts throughout a person's lifetime can influence how their bodies manage blood sugar, with life events such as pregnancy and menopause affecting how type 2 diabetes develops and progresses.

Gestational diabetes during pregnancy “is one of the most powerful harbingers of things to come,” says Judith Regensteiner, a professor of medicine and director of the Ludeman Family Center for Women's Health Research at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. In fact, a gestational diabetes diagnosis is the single biggest risk factor for type 2 diabetes in women, with some studies suggesting women who experience gestational diabetes are up to eight times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life.

Other hormonal shifts over a woman's lifetime can influence type 2 diabetes risk and progression. How and where fat is stored in the body, for instance, is a key risk factor for type 2 diabetes in everybody, but not all fat is created equal. At younger ages, men are more likely than women to store visceral fat. “That's the deep belly fat that sits deep around the organs,” explains Peter Goulden, associate professor at the Icahn School of Medicine and chief of the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Bone Disease at Mount Sinai in New York.

Visceral fat is particularly harmful because it releases free fatty acids which increase resistance to insulin—the hormone which regulates blood sugar. Insulin “is the key that unlocks the cells, so the glucose can go into the cells,” Goulden says. With insulin resistance, the body's cells stop responding to insulin as effectively, and glucose builds up in the blood.

Before menopause, women tend to store fat around the hips and thighs, “which is actually less harmful metabolically,” says Goulden. But the hormonal changes during menopause, especially the decline in estrogen, mean the body stores more visceral fat. This accumulation of deep belly fat is actually worse for women than for men: Each kilogram of visceral fat increases a woman's risk of developing type 2 diabetes by about seven times—around triple the risk seen in men, according to a 2019 study.

The role of menopause on visceral fat might help explain why women tend to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at an older age. This type of fat can also build up without necessarily pushing someone into the obese weight category, so common tools such as body mass index (BMI) can miss early risks. One study found that BMI was more strongly associated with type 2 diabetes in men than women; measurements related to waist size were a stronger predictor for women. Last year, the American Diabetes Association updated its guide on diabetes management to recommend measurements such as waist circumference be taken into account in addition to BMI when assessing obesity.

Menopause may influence diabetes in other ways, too. Estrogen is thought to play a protective role in blood sugar regulation. When the hormone binds to its receptor, it helps cells respond to insulin better and protects pancreatic beta cells—responsible for producing and releasing insulin—from damage. But as estrogen levels drop with the onset of menopause, so does the body's ability to manage blood sugar as effectively. That drop is believed to be another big reason why the risk of developing type 2 diabetes rises for women during midlife. “I think the message from this is that really there should be lifelong screening,” says Goulden.

While these hormonal factors explain why many women may develop type 2 diabetes later than men, there are also concerns that diagnostic tools might not catch the early signs of the disease in younger women as well as they do in men. A common diagnostic procedure is the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) blood test, which is often used because it's convenient and doesn't require fasting. The test measures the amount of hemoglobin in the blood that is coated with sugar; this acts as an indicator of average blood glucose levels over a few months, since the lifespan of red blood cells is around three months. But recent evidence suggests it might not pick up diabetes risk in some younger women.

Before menopause, women typically have lower levels of HbA1c than men of the same age. Researchers in Taiwan therefore suggest that “the HbA1c cut-off point for the diagnosis of diabetes should vary by age and gender.” A 2023 study from the UK, which analyzed data from more than a million people, similarly found that women had slightly lower average HbA1c levels than men. The researchers estimated that if the diagnostic threshold was reduced, 35,000 more women in England and Wales could be diagnosed.

But for now, cutoffs remain the same for men and women, and experts say there isn't yet enough evidence to warrant a change. “I wouldn't say there's enough data there to support saying that there should be different cutoffs,” Goulden says.

“We need more prospective clinical studies to investigate it,” says Leutner. He argues that, rather than adjusting HbA1c thresholds, clinicians should make greater use of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a more sensitive tool for detecting diabetes in its early stages but one that involves fasting before having blood glucose levels measured before and after drinking a sugary drink. Men are more likely to have elevated glucose levels caught during routine blood work, says Leutner. “Females on the other hand more often have impaired glucose tolerance, which can only be measured with the more complex OGTT,” he says.

Catching type 2 diabetes early is essential in reducing some of its greatest associated harms. One aspect is limiting the risk of cardiovascular disease. While men are more likely to develop heart disease in general, type 2 diabetes tips this balance: fatal heart disease associated with diabetes is 50 percent more common in women than men. Even so, says Regensteiner, “heart disease may go undetected for longer in women.”

Social differences can also play a role in the different outcomes between women and men, says Regensteiner. In her experience, some women can be dismissive of the condition. “I've heard people say, ‘I've got a little bit of diabetes,' and that's like being ‘a little bit pregnant,'” she says. “It's not a little bit. It's a serious disease.” Clinicians can underestimate the risks too: Women with type 2 diabetes are less likely to be prescribed certain cardioprotective medications than men.

As research continues, it's important that sex differences are taken into account. Historically, women were left out of many early studies that shaped risk guidelines for diseases, including type 2 diabetes. When they were included, it was often in smaller numbers, and their data wasn't separated out, Regensteiner says. “That hurts both sexes, because the results are muddied,” she says. “There are sex differences, and ignoring them will not help.”

New technology doesn't arrive fully formed, I remind myself as I strap on a pirate's eye patch, then place a heavily modified bicycle helmet onto my head. It isn't the most glamorous getup. But here, in a small office on an unassuming business park on the outskirts of Cambridge, England, it could be the foundations of something quite remarkable

I'm here to meet AllFocal Optics, a startup that has patented a new type of nanophotonic lens with the power to transform everything from virtual and augmented reality headsets, to night vision goggles, binoculars, cameras and heads-up displays (HUDs). It's the latter that piqued my interest, after hearing Jaguar Land Rover has embarked on a research project to discover whether the lens can improve car HUDs and, with it, road safety.

Its makers also claim—and prove, with the aforementioned helmet, as well as a butchered Meta Quest 3—that the lens can produce a digital image with perfect clarity, even if you have poor vision, without the need for glasses.

Founded in 2022 as Lark but since renamed AllFocal Optics, the company is headed by former Royal Academy of Engineering enterprise fellow Dr Pawan Shrestha. Dr Ash Saulsbury, former technology VP at Microsoft and former Meta AR boss, joined late last year as chair, around the same time that the startup secured a $5.3m funding round.

AllFocal Optics says the lens it has created offers two technological breakthroughs. Firstly, when used in an AR or VR headset, like the Apple Vision Pro or Meta Quest 3, it claims to provide crystal-clear vision to the wearer, even if they need glasses but aren't wearing them.

Even if you require a significant prescription, or suffer from astigmatism, its makers say the lens beams a clear picture directly to your retina, bypassing the needs for glasses entirely. In theory, two people could share the same AR or VR headset, even if one has 20/20 vision and the other needs very strong corrective lenses.

I tried several prototypes of the lens and, yes, it works. I don't wear glasses, so the first demonstration—viewing digital text beamed from a laptop to an augmented reality headset—didn't seem overly impressive. But then I repeated the test while wearing glasses so strong I couldn't see my own hands in front of my face, and yet the digital text was still pin-sharp. It's the sort of tech demo that takes a moment to truly appreciate, but when your brain finally connects the dots it feels like magic.

Not only does the lens sidestep vision impairment, it also produces an image far sharper than the likes of Microsoft's HoloLens (may it rest in peace), despite the input being the same 720p resolution. With the prototype lens it was easy—and this is where the eyepatch comes in—to read a chunk of text where half was augmented and half was printed on a sheet of paper, but with the HoloLens this was impossible. The augmented half of each line was a blurred mess.

What's more, the text remains sharp regardless of what your eyes are actually focused on. I experimented with focusing first on my hand just a few inches from my face, then on the other side of the room, yet the augmented text stayed in focus. Interestingly, its size adjusts depending on where you're looking; I could make it appear as a tiny font on my finger, or as poster-sized writing on the opposite wall. It's also possible to look through it, focusing on the middle-distance as you might while driving, but no matter what your eyes and their lenses do, the digital text remains sharp and legible.

If that's hard to picture, then this video should help to demonstrate. The projected image remains in focus through a camera, even when the focal length is adjusted from 12 inches (30 cm) to 78 inches (200 cm) and the rest of the camera's view becomes blurry. As well as products that sit close to the eye, AllFocus Optics says its technology could be used for other applications too, like the rear-view screens used by some cars in place of mirrors, which can appear blurred to glasses wearers.

Shrestha explains why humans sometimes struggle with existing VR and AR technology. “The way we evolved over thousands of years is that when we see a 3D object in a 3D space, our eyes rotate and we have lenses in our eyes, ocular lenses, that focus at a fixed depth. We have evolved so that our two cues—rotating, which we call vergence, and focusing, which we call accommodation—work in harmony. But in existing AR and VR devices these cues are in conflict.”

This creates what is rather appropriately known as the vergence-accommodation conflict, which can lead to our eyes to constantly refocus and confusing our brains as to where the projected object really is. Ultimately, it leads to nausea and headache. Shrestha explains why his technology is different. “We have no fixed or virtual screen at all, so our image is always in focus. We create a projected image in the retina … similar to retinal projection technology. So now the vergence and accommodation link is decoupled.”

Although Shrestha admits his company didn't create this decoupling technique (it stems from the nineteenth-century principle of the Maxwellian view), he says AllFocal Optics can make this type of lens commercially viable for the first time.

It would be easy for anyone who has experienced nausea in virtual reality to imagine how the technology will help improve AR and VR headsets, and the company highlights how it could remove the need for corrective lenses in products like the Apple Vision Pro. “Our technology is always in focus,” Shrestha insists. “Whether you have long sightedness, short sightedness, astigmatism or anything, you can see clearly because it's bypassing any defect or some shortcomings with your ocular lens.”

With a “slightly customized” design, the technology will work for car HUDs too. Instead of re-focusing between the projected interface and the road, “all you need to do is switch your attention, and that takes almost zero reaction time,” Shrestha says. “You can just switch between contexts without having to mechanically shift the ocular lens. That's the huge value add.”

Part of the demo for AllFocal Optics involves this modified bike helmet.

AllFocal Optics hopes its technology will be adopted by car manufacturers and suppliers of heads-up displays, since the nanophotonic lens removes the need for a driver to switch their focus between the road and the HUD. Current systems are installed into the dashboard and project onto the windshield, creating a digital display roughly in the driver's eyeline and saving them the need to look down at the dashboard. Despite being in the right place, the projection is not the same distance from the driver's eyes as the road, and although refocusing between the two happens quickly, AllFocal Optics says this increases noticeably with age.

With the new lens, the information projected from a heads-up display—things like speed, direction and, more importantly, a potential collision warning—would always be in focus, so they could be read, processed and acted on that bit quicker. While AllFocal Optics says a driver in their 20s can refocus from the windshield to the road 65 feet (20 meters) away in 0.73 seconds, a driver in their 60s takes 2.51 seconds. At 70 mph that extra couple of seconds means the difference between covering 72 feet or 256 feet before reacting.

Car manufacturers see the potential, with JLR (formerly Jaguar Land Rover) set to begin a trial this year. Valerian Meijering, JLR's subject matter expert for extended reality, told WIRED: “Through this research project with AllFocal Optics, we are exploring new ways to present information via heads-up displays in a way that makes it even simpler to read. By further reducing the amount of vision strain and focus that would typically be needed, we could improve cognitive processing time, especially for those with vision impairments, and continue to improve comfort and safety for our clients.”

HUD systems find themselves in a strange position on the adoption curve. The first cars to feature heads-up displays arrived back in the late-1980s, but even now, almost four decades later, many cars still go without. Tesla fails to offer HUDs on any of its vehicles, and even the newest systems offer little more than those from a decade ago. But change is on the horizon.

Meijering added: “Visual display technology is evolving rapidly. Our clients love the benefits of heads-up displays, they are increasingly important to their luxury in-vehicle experience and safety.”

That's likely why AllFocal Optics isn't the only company with a better HUD in its sights. Porsche's new electric Macan features an HUD system with augmented reality, where virtual hazard signs attach themselves to whatever danger they are warning the driver about—such as the vehicle you're following too closely. Audi's latest HUD places augmented arrows on the road to help with navigation, while BMW first spoke about the potential for augmented heads-up displays in 2011.

Hyundai Mobis, a South Korean parts supplier to the Hyundai, Kia and Genesis car companies, showed off a technology called Holographic HUD at the CES tech show in January 2025. Instead of projecting onto a small portion of the screen, Hyundai Mobis' technology can be placed anywhere on the windshield.

To do this, it enlists a special film embedded with an optical component (called a “Holographic Optical Element”), which uses diffraction to deliver an interface to the eyes of the driver and passenger. Developed alongside German optical company and lens manufacturer Zeiss, the holographic HUD is expected to complete pre-development by the first half of 2026, before heading for mass production “as early as 2027,” according to Hyundai Mobis.

Envisics, another UK startup with brains from Cambridge and backing from JLR, plus General Motors, Hyundai and Stellantis, is also working on its “Dynamic Holography Platform”. It claims this will transform HUDs, with the ability to produce larger, three-dimensional images with greater depth—and the potential for an interface to span three lanes of highway—from a product that is 40 percent smaller and 50 percent more energy efficient.

While the promise of rich, high-resolution augmented reality is what's needed to wow consumers, the less glamorous benefit of compact packaging is vital if automakers want to bring HUD systems, which tend to be bulky, to smaller, cheaper cars—and energy-saving is key for electric vehicles. Envisics' first HUD with augmented reality is due to appear in the 2026 Cadillac Lyriq-V, an electric SUV coming later this year.

But the road from holographic dream to (augmented) reality is not always a smooth one. In 2018, Hyundai announced a strategic investment into WayRay, a Swiss startup developing similar technology. The carmaker hoped WayRay's tech would land in new vehicles as early as 2020, with Dr Youngcho Chi, Hyundai's chief innovation officer, saying the collaboration would help them ""establish a brand new ecosystem that harnesses AR technology to enhance not only navigation systems, but also establish an AR platform for smart city and smart mobility.”

WayRay also attracted investment from Porsche and e-commerce giant Alibaba, and a funding round in 2018 topped $80m. Advanced AR tech later appeared in WayRay 's own 2021 autonomous taxi concept, the Holograktor, in a bid to “highlight the maturing of the breakthrough holographic technology.” WayRay founder Vitaly Ponomarev said he hoped to homologate the car and release it in 2025.

Two years later, in September 2023, WayRay declared bankruptcy. Although based in the UK and headquartered in Switzerland since 2014, the company was actually founded in Moscow two years earlier, and failed to fully resolve what board director Philippe D. Monnier later described as “problematic ‘Russian angles'”. Despite attempts to distance itself from its origin story in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, including share buybacks and top managers changing their citizenship, a pending $100m funding round could not be completed.

Back at AllFocal Optics, I have removed the bicycle helmet and pirate's eyepatch. My eyes take a moment to adjust back to the real world, but I'm free of any signs of nausea.

Shrestha believes the lenses could be ready for a small batch of specialist equipment, like night vision scopes, within a few months, and that an automotive application could be realized in around two years. Tantalizingly, he says the technology can be made to work with the video screens of rear-view cameras too, coming to the aid of drivers whose glasses bring the road and conventional side mirrors into focus but leave digital screens blurred. With cars like the Polestar 4 replacing the rear windshield with a camera, it's easy to see why such a technology would be popular.

Improving the reaction times of older drivers and helping glasses wearers see the reversing camera might not be as exciting as autonomous driving. But the crude prototypes of startups like AllFocal Optics—and the messy, unfortunate downfall of others—give a warts-and-all view of where tomorrow's technology was born, years before it lands at your local car dealer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","A Starter Guide to Protecting Your Data From Hackers and Corporations","https://www.wired.com/story/guide-protect-data-from-hackers-corporations/","Mon, 26 May 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

With President Donald Trump's return to the White House and the US government's digital surveillance machine more powerful than ever, digital privacy should be top of mind. But the digital security world can be confusing—and there's the larger question of why. You may think, if I'm just a regular person, why is my digital privacy important?

Then there are the practical questions. What's the best password manager? How can you keep your digital life under wraps at the border? And what kind of VPN should you be using? Is AI scraping my data?

WIRED senior writer and security expert Matt Burgess spoke with readers in a Reddit AMA this month about the basics of keeping your digital footprint locked down. Here's what to know and why it's important.

What is your advice for a quick win in terms of improving digital security for the everyday person? Or for someone who isn't tech-savvy?

I think the one big thing people can do to improve their security is make sure that multifactor authentication is turned on for as many online accounts as possible. That way if anyone gets access to your password or login details, they'll also need to have another way to authenticate the login attempt (such as the codes generated by an authentication app), and it's highly unlikely that hackers will have access to that.

Other quick and relatively straightforward changes you can make are to use privacy-friendly browsers and search engines and to use a password manager (the one on your phone or browser is better than nothing at all) and create unique passwords for each service you use.

There are so many privacy tips out there, and it all feels important, but trying to do everything at once can be overwhelming. What are the things people should prioritize when making changes to their online habits?

Improving privacy is something that's ongoing, and if you try to do everything at once then it's too off-putting. Take it one small step at a time.

If I was starting now, I'd go with:

What's a good non-US-based VPN?

Our favorite VPN at WIRED is currently Proton VPN, which is based in Switzerland. Proton VPN also offers the best free VPN. Unlike most services, ProtonVPN's free version gives full access to all the regular plan's features. It is limited to a single device, and there are only three server locations (Japan, Netherlands, and the US), but everything else is the same. If your needs are limited and you want to keep costs down, this is a good option. See our full guide to VPNs here.

How do I deal with having to have a new account for every service and website? Should I be using new email addresses?

A new email address for every account is a big undertaking! I'd recommend having an email address for the accounts that are most important to you and then having one that you use to sign up for things that are less important. There are also services that will let you create “burner” emails that you can use to sign-up with services, and if you use an Apple device there's a “Hide My Email” setting.

What tips would you offer to those looking to keep their digital privacy while crossing the US border (or otherwise entering or exiting the States)?

It really depends on what levels of risk you as an individual could face. Some people traveling across the border are likely to face higher scrutiny than others—for instance nationality, citizenship, and profession could all make a difference. Even what you've said on social media or in messaging apps could potentially be used against you.

Personally, the first thing I would do is think about what is on my phone: the kind of messages I have sent (and received), what I have posted publicly, and log out (or remove) what I consider to be the most sensitive apps from my phone (such as email). A burner phone might seem like a good idea, although this isn't the right idea for everyone and it could bring more suspicion on you. It's better to have a travel phone—one that you only use for travel that has nothing sensitive on it or connected to it.

My colleague Andy Greenberg and I have put together a guide that covers a lot more than this: such as pre-travel steps you can take, locking down your devices, how to think about passwords, and minimizing the data you are carrying. It's here. Also, senior writer Lily Hay Newman and I have produced a (long) guide specifically about phone searches at the US border.

Would you recommend against having a device like Alexa in your home? Or are there particular products or steps you can take to make a smart device more secure?

Something that's always listening in your home—what could go wrong? It's definitely not great for overall surveillance culture.

Recently Amazon also reduced some of the privacy options for Alexa devices. So if you're going to use a smart speaker, then I'd look into what each device's privacy settings are and then go from there.

How do you see people's willingness to hand over information about their lives to AI playing into surveillance?

The amount of data that AI companies have—and continue to—hoover up really bothers me. There's no doubt that AI tools can be useful in some settings and to some people (personally, I seldom use generative AI). But I would generally say people don't have enough awareness about how much they're sharing with chatbots and the companies that own them. Tech companies have scraped vast swathes of the web to gather the data they claim is needed to create generative AI—often with little regard for content creators, copyright laws, or privacy. On top of this, increasingly, firms with reams of people's posts are looking to get in on the AI gold rush by selling or licensing that information.

For the everyday person, I'd warn them not to enter personal details or sensitive business information! We also have a more thorough guide here.

Are personal data removal services worthwhile, or are they just another vector for data thieves?

Whether data removal services are worthwhile or not probably depends on where you are based in the world: I'm in Europe where there's GDPR and stricter privacy laws, and when I have used a data removal service, it hasn't turned up too much. But in the US, there's no comprehensive federal privacy law—that really should change—and they may be more useful.

Much of what can be done by data removal services, you can also do yourself. Consumer Reports recently did a good evaluation of data removal services.

What is your preferred response for people who claim they have nothing to hide?

I think in a lot of cases when people claim they have nothing to hide, they often jump to thinking about illegal or malicious things. When in fact, privacy, for me, isn't about “hiding” things at all. You should be able to have the space—both in the physical and digital world—to not be surveilled or have your actions tracked. People should be able to act without intrusion from others—that doesn't mean you're hiding anything, but you just don't want to share everything you do with everyone (or anyone). And really that's why privacy is considered a fundamental human right.

I actually like a lot of the answers that people sent in to Amnesty International about how they respond to the point of “not having anything to hide.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Milky Way Has a Mysterious ‘Broken Bone'","https://www.wired.com/story/the-milky-way-has-a-mysterious-broken-bone-nasa/","Mon, 26 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

If you look at the Milky Way through a powerful telescope, you'll notice that close to the center of the galaxy there are elongated filaments that seem to outline its spiral shape. Scientists have a nickname for these structures: “galactic bones.” Recently, astronomers found that one of the Milky Way's bones is “fractured,” and they believe they've now found a possible culprit: a neutron star that may have collided with it.

According to NASA, these bones are huge elongated formations of energized particles that spiral along magnetic fields running through the galaxy. The particles release radio waves, and so are detectable using radio telescopes.

Scientists have found several such bones in the galaxy, but one of the most striking is called G359.13142-0.20005, also known as “the Snake.” It is a 230-light-year-long filament that appears to have a fracture. It is also one of the brightest. One of the first explanations was that some as yet undetected body had disturbed the filament.

A study by Harvard University, published in the journal Monthly Notice of the Royal Astronomical Society, set out to test this hypothesis. The research team involved found signs of a pulsar, a neutron star spinning at high speed, in the same region as the broken bone. These stars are extremely dense, and are the small remnants left after the explosion of a supermassive star.

Using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, which orbits Earth, along with the MeerKAT telescope array in South Africa and the Very Large Array in New Mexico—two systems that detect radio waves—scientists found what appear to be traces of a pulsar in the filament. Based on data from these observatories, they estimate that this pulsar impacted the bone at a speed of between 1,609,000 and 3,218,000 kilometers per hour. The suspected collision is thought to have distorted the magnetic field of the bone, causing its radio signal to deform.

The structure G359.13, with the fracture visible on its right-hand side.

In the above image provided by NASA, the Snake can be seen, and there is a body that appears to be interacting with the structure, in the middle of its length. It is possibly the aforementioned neutron star.

Pulsars are alternative versions of a neutron star where, in addition to being compact objects, they rotate at high velocities and produce strong magnetic fields. At the moment there is no instrument that can see them directly due to their size and distance, but radio telescopes can detect the electromagnetic waves they emit and hear them by converting these into sound.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Hot Farmers, Trad Wives, and an Immigrant Reality Show: Welcome to TV's MAGA Era","https://www.wired.com/story/hot-farmers-trad-wives-and-an-immigrant-reality-show-welcome-to-tvs-maga-era/","Mon, 26 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Julia is a 22-year-old model, student, and self-proclaimed “princess” from Malibu, California, with one nonnegotiable: She refuses to shovel cow shit. But she's down to play the part, she tells Farmer Jay, handing him a framed black-and-white photo of her in a bikini and cowboy hat. Grace, 23, dreams of being a stay-at-home mom with four kids. Jordyn, a 29-year-old country singer who lives in Nashville, Tennessee, says she would relocate across the country for her partner.

The three women are among 32 contestants on the most recent season of Farmer Wants a Wife, Fox's rustic spin on The Bachelor. They come from different backgrounds and have all sorts of interests, but their goals are ultimately the same: to settle down, get married, and have kids.

While the women don't explicitly talk politics, their focus on traditional values fits into a genre of entertainment that is rapidly reshaping the industry: Welcome to Hollywood's MAGA reboot.

Hollywood is in the midst of another evolution. Studios are releasing fewer movies every year. Broadcast and news ratings are in decline. Screenwriters are struggling to sell scripts as salaries for studio heads have skyrocketed. Television and feature film production in Los Angeles shrunk by 30 percent in the first quarter of 2025, compared with the previous year, according to a report by FilmLA.

At the same time, Hollywood is also undergoing a resurgence in anti-woke conservative content thanks to the Trump administration's anti-DEI agenda.

“More conservative projects are getting greenlit,” says Colin Whelan, a former studio executive at TLC and founder of Conveyer Media, which has produced reality shows for Netflix, HGTV, and Investigation Discovery. “People are pitching more shows like that because they realize that's what's selling.”

Maybe you've also noticed the subtle changes on your TV screen—content that favors Christian values, heartland themes, or law-and-order style programming. Yellowstone, the Paramount drama about cattle ranchers in Montana, gained a massive audience during Trump's first presidency, routinely breaking ratings records, and has since spawned successful spinoffs. Tim Allen's Shifting Gears, about a grumpy widower with manosphere viewpoints, is a ratings hit for Disney's linear broadcast audience, with “more live viewers on average than The Conners season 7 and Abbott Elementary season 4,” according to ScreenRant. It pulled in 3.7 million viewers for its season one finale. Farmer Wants a Wife has held steady ratings, averaging 1.5 million viewers weekly, and works as easy counterprogramming to more raunchy dating fodder like Temptation Island and Too Hot to Handle (both on Netflix).

In 2024, Trump Media and Technology Group launched a streaming service called Truth+, and the company made clear that it would prioritize “news, Christian content, and family-friendly programming that is uncancelable by Big Tech,” a mandate that now seems to be shaping the look of Hollywood more and more. (The streaming service also features at least one documentary—included among its most watched programs on the platform in May—peddling conspiracy theories about “serpent or lizard-like aliens who are secretly wielding influence over the human race,” according to an investigation by Talking Points Memo.)

In Trump's version of Hollywood, old-fashioned values are in vogue again. The Christian drama 7th Heaven, about a Protestant minister and his seven children that aired for 11 seasons on The WB (later The CW), is in early development at CBS Studios and will “focus on a diverse family,” though it's not clear what that means. Jessica Biel, who was in the original cast, is executive producing the reboot alongside Devon Franklin, a producer of faith-based films. Roseanne Barr, whose namesake show was canceled in 2018 after she posted a racist tweet about former Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarrett, is shopping a series that “saves America with guns, the Bible, petty crime, and alcoholism,” she told Variety.

Duck Dynasty, a duck-hunting reality show that ended in 2017, is also returning to television screens this summer on A+E, which experienced its first big hit of the year with Ozark Law, a show that followed multiple police departments in the Missouri region. Duck Dynasty producer Rob Worsoff is in talks with the Department of Homeland Security about a reality show where “immigrants compete to prove they are the most American,” according to The Wall Street Journal. Potential challenges include mining for gold or working on a Model T assembly line in Detroit.

What's happening is a “cultural recalibration,” says Carri Twigg, a founding partner and head of development at Culture House, the production company that created Ladies First: A Story of Women in Hip-Hop and Hair Tales. The recalibration has led to a “generalized chill” in the industry that has caused more diverse projects to suffer.

“I've heard from multiple executives that there's a noticeable hesitancy around content perceived as too progressive, especially if it centers non-white leads or tackles social issues explicitly. Even projects with mild inclusivity are getting flagged in internal discussions,” Twigg says. “Colleagues have expressed frustration that kinds stories they were encouraged to pitch just a couple years ago are now getting passed on as like ‘too niche' or ‘not resonant right now' by the same execs who once called them ‘visionary' and ‘universal.'”

Twigg says there are two key reasons for the hesitancy.

“The political climate has emboldened executives who were always uncomfortable with the industry's post-2020 shifts. The power that DEI-era storytelling offered to historically excluded creators was unfamiliar, and in some corners, unwelcome.” The second, she says, is fear of reprisals from the administration.

In February, Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr, who previously said he would end the agency's DEI initiatives if appointed, opened a probe into NBC parent company Comcast, and later Disney, promising to take action if the investigation uncovered “any programs that promote invidious forms of DEI discrimination.” Carr has since said that the FCC plans to look into broadcast network affiliation agreements to help “constrain some of the power of national programmers.” According to Variety, Disney, Amazon, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery have all rolled back programs aimed at increasing diversity.

Talk shows are also being encouraged to shift their programming. In a recent meeting with the cohosts of The View, the popular morning gabfest with Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar, ABC News president Almin Karamehmedovic urged the women to soften their criticisms of Trump, saying “the panel needed to broaden its conversations beyond its predominant focus on politics,” the Daily Beast reported. Disney CEO Bob Iger also suggested that the show “tone down” its political rhetoric.

One former executive at Amazon MGM Studios tells WIRED that Trump's anti-DEI agenda, whose impact on film and TV only seems to be growing more pronounced, is a part of the administration's Trojan-horse playbook to roll back civil rights. “It's just the rhetoric they're using to articulate what they really believe and who they really are.”

The White House did not respond to WIRED's request for comment.

The anti-DEI backlash threatens to make Hollywood even more out of touch than it already is to younger audiences, who increasingly prefer TikTok and YouTube to traditional viewing formats. An estimated 50 percent of Gen Z identifies as non-white, and nearly 30 percent identify as LGBTQ+. “These audiences aren't just asking for representation—they expect it,” Twigg says. “If the industry starts backing away from inclusive storytelling, it won't just be regressive—it'll be a bad business decision.”

Original, inclusive storytelling is trending right now, as Sinners, Ryan Coogler's vampire drama, proved by becoming the biggest box office success story of the year so far, earning $316 million globally. Hulu's Paradise, about residents of a postapocalyptic town, and HBO Max's The Pitt, a medical drama that follows an emergency-room crew over a 15-hour shift, have also felt like watercooler moments at a time when the industry is starved for them.

Beyond the cultural and commercial risks of a less diverse Hollywood, Twigg says there is a strategic one: Film and TV take years to develop and produce.

“Hitching your content strategy to a political moment that may not last through the next election—or the next news cycle—is short-sighted,” she says. “The stories being greenlit today will premiere in a future that may have swung back toward the very audiences currently being sidelined. If anything, the smartest strategy right now would be to build with resilience and relevance in mind—not reactionary politics.”

Whelan says that in over 20 years as a television producer, he has taken the same approach, regardless of the political and social climates of the time: to create shows that “entertain and inspire and maybe teach.”

In 2014, following stints at Syfy and TLC as a network executive, he applied that mindset to New Girls on the Block. It was the first follow-doc reality show with an all-trans cast. The series focused on a group of women in Kansas City, Missouri, who faced changing relationship dynamics in a society struggling to make space for trans women. The reality project he just wrapped probably sounds like a complete 180. It focuses on a Christian family who runs a ranch and takes in at-risk youth. But there's more to it, he says.

“What's interesting to me, having done it for so long, is I don't see a huge difference between a show about a group of all transgender women and a group of ranchers trying to help at-risk youth,” he says. “It's two groups of really amazing people trying to change their lives for the better, and change the world around them for the better as well.”

Tonality aside, fewer projects overall are moving forward this year, Whelan says, but that hasn't stopped genuinely good ideas from finding an audience—no matter who sits in the Oval Office.

“Ozark Law would have sold regardless of the administration. The Netflix scripted series is all about breaking the law, so you know someone's gonna come up with the idea of enforcing it. That's how we pitch reality shows,” he says, before admitting, “I wish I had thought of that.”

Artificial intelligence has sent demand for electricity skyrocketing in the U.S. after years of virtually zero growth. That has sent Big Tech companies scrambling to secure generating capacity for their data centers.

For many, that has meant turning to nuclear fission. The power source has been experiencing a resurgence in the last few years following decades of plant closures. (Fission, used in all current nuclear plants, is distinct from fusion, the still-experimental approach to getting power from atoms that, while attracting investors, has yet to produce more electricity than it consumes.)

For tech companies, part of the appeal of fission is a stable, predictable source of power that flows 24/7, giving their data centers the potential to run computing loads whenever they require it. 

But another part of the appeal lies in new reactor designs that promise to overcome the shortcomings of existing nuclear power plants. Where old power plants were built around massive reactors that could generate over 1 gigawatt of electricity, new small modular reactor (SMR) designs see multiple modules deployed alongside each other to meet a range of needs. 

SMRs rely on mass manufacturing to bring costs down, but to date, no one has built one in the U.S. Still, that hasn't kept Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft away from the table. They've either signed agreements to buy power from nuclear startups or invested in them directly — or both.

Here are the nuclear fission startups backed by Big Tech.

Kairos Power received a vote of confidence from Google when the search giant promised to buy around 500 megawatts of electricity by 2035, with the first reactor targeted to come online by 2030.

The company's small modular reactors rely on molten fluoride salt for cooling and to transport heat to a steam turbine. The salt's high boiling point means that the coolant doesn't need to be kept at high pressure, which should improve operating safety. The reactors contain fuel pebbles coated in carbon and ceramic shells, which should be strong enough to withstand a meltdown.

The Alameda-based startup has received a $629 million award from the U.S. government, including $303 million from the Department of Energy. In November 2024, Kairos received approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to commence construction on two reactors in Tennessee. At 35 megawatts, the test units will be smaller than Kairos' eventual commercial reactors, which are expected to generate 75 megawatts each.

Oklo is another SMR company targeting the data center world — no surprise given that it was backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who also took the nuclear startup public via a reverse merger with his special purpose acquisition vehicle, AltC, in July 2023. Altman served as chairman of Oklo until April, when he stepped down as OpenAI began negotiating with Oklo for an energy supply agreement. DCVC, Draper Associates, and Peter Thiel's Mithril Capital Management are among the startup's previous investors.

Cooled by liquid metal, Oklo's reactor is based on an existing U.S. Department of Energy design that's intended to reduce the amount of nuclear waste that results from regular operations. Still, Oklo's path hasn't been a smooth one. The company's first license application was denied in January 2022. Oklo has said it will resubmit the application sometime in 2025. But that hasn't stopped the company from landing a deal to supply data center operator Switch with 12 gigawatts by 2044.

Like Kairos, Saltfoss, formerly known as Seaborg, also wants to build SMRs cooled by molten salt. But unlike Kairos and others, it envisions placing two to eight of them on a ship to create what it calls a Power Barge. The startup has raised nearly $60 million, including a $6 million seed round that included investments from Bill Gates, Peter Thiel, and Unity co-founder David Helgason, according to PitchBook. Satlfoss has an agreement with Samsung Heavy Industries to build the ships and the Satlfoss-designed reactors.

Founded by Bill Gates, TerraPower is building a larger reactor, called Natrium, which is cooled by liquid sodium and features molten salt energy storage.

The company broke ground on the first power plant in June 2024 in Wyoming. The Natrium design calls for the reactor to generate 345 megawatts of electricity. That's smaller than other new nuclear plants today but larger than most SMR designs. 

But Natrium has a trick up its sleeve with its molten salt heat storage system. Since nuclear reactors operate best at a steady state, the Natrium reactor can continue breaking atoms when demand is low, and the extra energy is stored as heat in a vat of molten salt, which can be drawn upon later to generate electricity.

Investors include Gates' Cascade Investment fund, Khosla Ventures, CRV, and ArcelorMittal.

X-Energy landed a hefty $700 million Series C-1 last year led by Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund. At the same time, the SMR startup announced two development agreements that would see the deployment of 300 megawatts of new nuclear generating capacity in the Pacific Northwest and Virginia.

The company's high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors buck recent trends in the U.S. and Europe, where the design has been shunned in favor of other approaches. The company's Xe-100 reactor is expected to generate 80 megawatts of electricity. Helium gas flows through the reactor's 200,000 billiard ball-sized fuel “pebbles,” absorbing heat to spin a steam turbine.

Apparent lack of quantization of the charge carrier IS intriguing, though. Linear rather than quadratic resistivity vs temperature is definitely something to pick at. Fun question: if you extrapolate that line back below the change to superconductivity, where does it intercept at absolute zero?

Maintaining the support for a different architecture only for that doesn't make a lot of sense, probably the reason it was never supported. RAM is cheap these days so...


reply



Pointers are everywhere. In real world applications we see an increase between a quarter to a third. For example in 2016 Mozilla reported 25% increase from 32-bit Firefox to 64-bit [1]. Google deemed it necessary to implement pointer compression in Chrome to counter the effect. Java also has pointer compression.[1] https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2016/07/22/firefox-64-b...

I definitely understand why macro-expander programs can be useful, but I'm always a bit puzzled about the idea of combining them with a macro language like (La)TeX.  Why introduce two layers of macro indirection?  Maybe it just doesn't fit my use case, which doesn't mean it can't fit anybody's; but, more intriguingly, maybe it would come to fit my use case if I understood what it can add, so I wonder if you could describe how it's useful to you.

Would love to hear from someone who has used both though.I've never seen an excellent, detailed comparison actually, as conversation on the subject tends to devolve into a ""discussion"" on ethics. Meaning, people who dislike GNU or GPL or Lisps or something get testy and argue uncharitably (imho, please prove me wrong, not flaming here, etc).This is ironic, to say the least, as one of the main points of the proponents of the ""anti-GNU"" side tends to be how Guix is too opinionated and pushy and hard-line etc. So we've a classic upside-down situation, which is a real shame, as Guix seems to be in reality a practical project with lovely people involved that's doing very interesting work.

When I asked a long-time Nix vet why he thinks people leave, he provided the most insightful answer I've seen yet: they just don't try hard enough.


reply



Nix is hard if you need to build something difficult to package or something that has very unusual or dirty build processes. If you need to that regularly, Nix is not worth the effort unless you are an organization that values reproducibility and is prepared to pay for its cost upfront. If these particularly messy usecases are something that you don't encounter so frequently, you can always use an escape hatch to be able to make your install impure. For instance, distrobox is quite convenient to run e.g. an Arch or Ubuntu container. In my case, this has been helpful to run Julia, whose Nix packages are quite brittle.

Most of the benefit of nix for me is maintaining a configuration for a couple computers in a way that's easy to backup, upgrade, and recover with.

As an example, I was recently playing with Pyinfra which is like a pure Python version of Ansible. It turns out that one of the dependencies uses an archaic version of setuptools and the package owner had inserted some _very_ hacky code that ended up breaking on two of my systems. Now I'm relatively experienced with Nix, so it took me a few hours to track down, but it would have been days if not impossible for a beginner.Nowadays I package brew along with my machines and as soon as something smells funky in Nix I just manage it with brew. Much more peaceful.

Mine has been going on since 2016, what am I doing wrong?


reply



The answer was in my post. Nix isn't for everyone, and that's OK.





I stick mostly to reasonably popular Debian packages. My thinking is that if one of them has a serious vulnerability it will get fixed quickly or a lot of people have much bigger problems than me. I always worry about niche package systems, where it should be much easier to sneak in something malicious and it could linger there for a long time undetected.

- is this actually the binary that comes from that code?- is that code trustworthy?- is this binary trustworthy?Nix focuses on the first.  If you can solve that problem, there's still nothing preventing bad guys from publishing malicious code, or from distributing malicious binaries which did not actually come from the code that they claim to, but it forces bad actors to act in the open, where they're more likely to get caught--anybody who cares to check can verify that the correspondence doesn't hold.So if you're worried that one dark day, `curl whoever.com/whatever.sh | bash` will suddenly contain malware when it didn't before, using nix instead will protect you... until you manually approve the malicious update.  It's up to you to come up with reasons why you should or shouldn't do that, but at least there will be a commit in your code where things went bad.If you're wondering whether whatever.sh is safe in the first place, and you want some council of elders to pinky promise that it's safe to run, then I don't think the nix ecosystem has much to offer you.Personally, I think that solving the latter problems without a robust solution to the first problem is sort of a band-aid solution.  So I'm a big fan of the nix approach to supply chain security, but it's important to be aware of what you're not getting, which is a promise that any bits are trustworthy in the first place.

For example, you can see where the xz sources get pulled from in the src section here:https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-25.05/pkgs/tools...As usual, wherever you get your software, if someone at the source sneaks in something malicious and no one notices it it gets in there. NixOs has no special mitigations against that (AFAIK).But you can be reasonably sure that the binary you have matches the official source of the software, with maybe some reviewed patches to get it to work in Nix's environment.The binaries are cached, so you don't have to build everything yourself. There is a command to rebuild the software from source yourself. Most packages are reproducible, about 95% of the distributed gnome version:

One fun example is the test database: five years of accumulated migrations were relatively slow to run in various portions of the pipeline. I made a nix derivation that runs postgres, runs migrations, seeds some test data, runs some tests, and then saves the data directory into $out. CI jobs can then load the DB by building that derivation and copying the data files into a local directory. If no migrations or other dependencies have changed, this is virtually instantaneous.

The plus side though if you go all in is that you can build once on something more powerful and just copy the updates to the low powered stuff.

I'm guessing from past comments of yours that it's the former. But if there's an actual connection, it's very not-obvious to me what it is, and a quick look at the ""problems"" and ""crisis"" links you gave doesn't suggest to me any connection with Nix's European-ness.

I just went back to Bash and it honestly works just fine, any rough edges probably don't outweigh how inscrutable Nix tends to be: https://github.com/dbalatero/dotfiles/blob/main/apply

I use emacs. The emacs LSP mode starts up a language server process for a language like Python or Go. If I use Nix to manage development dependencies like my compiler, linting tools, and even language-specific dependencies, then how do I get the LSP and emacs to use the correct Nix-y set of dependencies? To make things extra complex, note that I often work on multiple interdependent projects concurrently; I imagine that makes things even gnarlier.Is there a sane way to manage this sort of thing? Do I end up managing a per-project installation of emacs??

Or at least that's how I do it. That will make `ruff` or `pyright-langserver` point to whichever version of the tool is bound to that project.  So when I run `nix flake update` it updates the tools for only that project and I don't get any crosstalk between projects.As for whether a given linter or language server should be configured for that project, helix looks for .helix/languages.toml in the CWD to decide which ones to load, so that bit of config I handle independently from nix, I just add that file to the repo.  Presumably emacs has something similar.So to answer your question: you only get a project-specific version of emacs if you add emacs to the project's devshell.  Otherwise whatever was already on your PATH will be used.

- Install nixpkgs emacs or emacs distribution to your user profile so it links into every shell you open.- Configure system-wide settings with the default emacs config, or with home-manager (https://mynixos.com/home-manager/options/programs.emacs)- Each project (or group of projects) gets a Nix flake with a derivation specifying which dependencies or LSP packages are needed.When a devshell is spun up, you should have the nixpkgs version of Emacs with your system-wide config and project-specific modifications, handled via version-control. It is a hassle, but in my experience the ROI is very worthwhile. YMMV.

The French Open is one of the most exciting Grand Slams—especially with this year's lineup. Djokovic, Alcaraz, and Sinner—just those names alone promise a show. Even better, there's a way to watch the French Open live on a free channel, so you won't miss a single moment.

In this guide, we'll highlight two free channels for streaming Roland Garros and explain how to access them from anywhere in the world. We'll also include a few premium streaming services from the UK, Canada, and the US that broadcast the event.

Reigning and upcoming champs will battle it out on the clay-filled courts and honor us with some epic showdowns. As exciting as it sounds, it doesn't have to cost a penny.

Two free channels broadcast the French Open 2025:

If you're in one of these countries, you know you can boot them up and start watching. However, as these are foreign channels for many of you, it's good to know what they actually provide.

9Now broadcasts the best French Open 2025 matches online for free every day. You'll need a free account, which takes less than a minute to create. 9Now also offers English commentary, making it a great option for English-speaking viewers.

France TV is a French channel, so naturally, it features French commentary. It broadcasts all matches (you can follow the action on every court) except for the night sessions. The night sessions refer to the matches played on the Central Court after 8:15 PM Paris time.

This TV channel also requires a free account, but again, creating one takes a minute or two, as you can sign up without a TV license. The main gripe with these two is that they're region-locked to their respective regions.

9Now works only in Australia, whilst France TV works only in France.

To sidestep this inconvenience, people have been relying on VPNs for years. Watching the French Open for free online was never an issue with a popular option like NordVPN. You've likely heard of it by this point.

Watch the tournament for free with NordVPN

As the world's #1 provider by popularity (and quality), NordVPN provides quintessential servers in Australia and France. It's also equipped with unrestricted bandwidth and fast 10 Gbps server ports built for speed.

The main advantage of NordVPN, according to people online, is compatibility. It works on all desktop and mobile devices, but its VPN app for Fire TV and Apple TV is also there. This makes it easy to watch Roland Garros live for free on your TV.

NordVPN allows for a swift IP address change. Once your IP originates from another country, you can overcome stubborn geo-blocks and access new content. Simply put, you'll need an IP from Australia or France to unblock 9Now or France TV.

With NordVPN installed, you just need to connect to a server in the respective country, go to the free channel that streams the French Open 2025, and enjoy.

Keep in mind that NordVPN isn't free, but in this case, it can be. After all, there's a 30-day money-back guarantee. In this period, you can stream the entire Grand Slam and still have ample time left to request and get a full refund.

If necessary, we have a tutorial that explains how to test NordVPN free of charge for 30 days.



Even in the USA, using the two free channels is a more sensible option.

That's because US-based streaming services are costly. Still, if you don't want to mess around with VPNs, you can opt for one of these three:

Sling TV provides access to TNT where the stream will be available — Blue and Orange plans are both eligible. You'll find that Orange also contains ESPN. DirecTV requires a $69.99/mo MySports package for this purpose.

It includes TNT and ESPN Plus for free if you wish to stream other sports.

You don't have to have an eagle eye to see the prices. Sling TV and DirecTV are way out of many people's budgets. Plus, they don't have lengthy free trials that would allow you to watch the French Open for free.

DirecTV has a risk-free 5-day trial, but that's roughly a third of the event.

Bear in mind that, even if you have an account with one of these three, you still won't be able to access them abroad. HBO Max can be watched outside the USA, along with DirecTV and Sling TV, but with a caveat — you'll need a VPN!

Watch the French Open With NordVPN



Brits don't have a vibrant selection of channels for this case.

They do lack horses for the race, but there's Discovery Plus that comes to the rescue. Unfortunately, Discovery Plus is no joke price-wise and costs £31/mo in the United Kingdom. A notable free trial is missing, as well.

Once you spend your £31, you won't be able to get it back, either. On top of that, Discovery Plus works abroad only with a VPN, even if you have an active subscription paid for regularly.

It's worth noting that Discovery Plus also provides access to Eurosport, which will broadcast the French Grand Slam for the rest of Europe. Eurosport also isn't free and costs £3.99 for Discovery Plus subscribers.



Canadians, similarly to Brits, don't have plenty of choices — TSN is once again there to quench their tennis thirst. Of course, at a price. TSN is relatively inexpensive, so it might be a good option if you're in Canada.

The subscription starts at $8/mo or $80/year if you pay upfront.

Like 9Now and Discovery Plus, TSN provides Full HD coverage and includes English commentary for better immersion. Just bear in mind that TSN is Canada-exclusive, so being on vacation rids you of access to it.

NordVPN can help you regain access risk-free if you so desire.

Other than that, TSN doesn't provide a free trial and won't allow you to sign up as a new user without a Canadian payment method. As explained, TSN is adequate only for native Canadian tennis fans.

Your vacation or business trip doesn't have to squander your plans to watch the French Open 2025 on a free channel. 9Now and France TV are there, and with risk-free NordVPN, you'll catch up to all major matches with no issues.

If you'd rather use premium platforms and don't mind the price tag, so be it. You have a myriad of options in the US, the UK, and Canada. Sling TV, DirecTV, HBO Max, Discovery Plus, and TSN — six excellent premium channels.

The Polaroid Flip is one of those devices that sounds more fun in theory than it does to actually take it into the field. The $200 full-size instant camera looks a little too much like your parents' 50-year-old Polaroid they used to take their vintage, cracked, and sun-spotted beach photos. Hell, that may be appealing to some of you nostalgic for your grandmother's photo albums. The Flip comes with a few important upgrades over a lower-cost Polaroid Go or Polaroid Now that help it seem extra enticing for its price. And yet, lugging this hefty beast of a camera around made me wish I kept it at home.

See at Best Buy

The big selling point of the Polaroid Flip is its “hyperfocal” lens system. It's essentially four lenses on a rotating gear, and the Flip is smart enough to swap between its various focal lengths depending on your distance to the subject you're shooting. The max sweet spot for its farthest-field lens is around eight feet. That's rather far for an instant camera, though if you're out and about with friends, you will normally snap your pics at a much closer distance. Out of all the photos I took on the Polaroid Flip, I didn't find any where the subject looked out of focus. So long as the flash didn't make their skin glow like the surface of the sun, my friends and coworkers were happy to take home the pics printed off the Polaroid Flip.

Polaroid Flip

It's a nostalgic camera that takes fun printed shots with strong focus capabilities. You just won't feel great lugging it around.

The various focal lengths mean the camera can take better landscapes, though your phone camera with its wider range of aspect ratios may be a better choice for your next hike. The Flip's other big selling point is its special light in the viewfinder that will blare red if there's too much or not enough light for each shot. The thing is, you'll rarely find yourself lacking light for your photos. I took the Polaroid Flip to a Manhattan rooftop bar on a bright, clear day with the sun creeping toward the horizon—nearly golden hour. Even then, I found that without flash, subjects would still be underexposed.

The Flip won't avoid the other issues that come from instant flash photography, but I wouldn't change that for the world. There's an evocative charm of the traditional Polaroid blemishes, from white spots to sun flare, that you would miss if they weren't there. The photos I took with coworkers are going up on a wall, or at least all of those that weren't so underexposed you can't tell who it is.

While the photos came out crisp, actually using the Polaroid Flip is a hefty task. The camera weighs 1.4 pounds, and it's a big sucker to boot. Carrying it around with a shoulder strap felt like I was lugging around a small brick. It weighed down my backpack, and I can tell it will take up a large amount of real estate in any other bag or pocketbook. Like most full-image Polaroids, the device does not have any one place you're supposed to hold it. If you bring it up to take a quick photo, you'll end up with your fingers in front of the photo eject port more often than not.

The Polaroid Flip is retro in many ways, down to its sloped body and extended viewfinder. Its design hedges closest to a Polaroid Sun 660 from 1981. That camera brought Polaroid's sonar autofocus to the fore, plus it used a similar rotating lens system to the Flip. It also had a flip-up flash section that protected all the most sensitive bits when closed. The Flip isn't as premium as the $600 Polaroid I-2, and it isn't built for creating depth of field on the produced shots. Instead, it's the kind of device you're supposed to have in your closet for family gatherings or take in your bag when you're out on an adventure with family or compatriots. There are few better feelings than going out for drinks and then handing out a printed photo as a memento—though after waiting several minutes for the film to develop.

For review, Polaroid sent me two packages of eight photos. I burned through the majority of those in a single evening, and I even had to reload during my time out with my colleagues. The Flip works with the company's Color and B&W i-Type film. Both sell for $18 individually, but it's slightly cheaper per pack if you buy in bulk. Depending on how often you bring it out for family outings, the Polaroid could start to get very expensive, far beyond the $200 asking price.

Polaroids are worth their price if you plan to cement the photos as memories. I enjoy the shots I took with the Flip, but I also know a more compact instant camera that shoots wallet-sized images, like a Fujifilm Instax camera, could be more transportable and still let you toss souvenirs to your friends after an evening out. The Flip is still straightforward, near idiot-proof, and solid (it better be for how heavy it is). It feels like a step up from a smaller, cheaper Polaroid Go, but it's an upgrade that will have to stay at home.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Deadly Kentucky Tornadoes Ignite Fears Over U.S. Weather Warning Systems","https://gizmodo.com/deadly-kentucky-tornadoes-ignite-fears-over-u-s-weather-warning-systems-2000606539","Mon, 26 May 2025 10:01:35 GMT","

Sandra Anderson didn't think the storm would be too bad. When her grandchildren asked if the dogs should be brought in, Anderson demurred, saying they'd be fine. But later that night, an alert on her phone warned her of a tornado tearing through her hometown of London, Kentucky. Seconds later, it hit her neighborhood.

 “I hollered for my handicapped son to hit the hallway,” Anderson said. “Windows were exploding. There was such a horrifying howl before it hit.”

Tornadoes are measured using what's called the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which ranks them on a scale of 1 to 5 according to their wind speed and potential for damage. The mile-wide twister that blew out Anderson's windows and flattened entire neighborhoods traveled over 50 miles and clocked in at EF-4, making it a particularly violent one. Meanwhile, an EF-3 funnel cloud cut a 23-mile path through the St. Louis area.

Both were part of a broader system that stretched from Missouri to Kentucky, spawning over 70 tornadoes that killed at least 28 people and leveled or damaged thousands of structures. Eastern Kentucky bore the brunt of the fury; 18 people died there. Seven more were killed in Missouri.

The storms come as President Donald Trump's administration makes deep cuts to the National Weather Service, or NWS, and its parent organization, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Together, the two agencies provide accurate and timely forecasts to meteorologists and others and play a key role in forecasting tornadoes and warning people of impending danger. Meteorologists and other experts warn that the administration's cuts to the agency could cost lives.

The NWS has lost 600 people through layoffs and retirements, according to The New York Times, leaving many local weather stations scrambling to cover shortfalls. The office in Jackson, Kentucky, for example, is 1 of 8 nationwide to abruptly end 24/7 forecasting after losing an overnight forecaster, and it's now short about 31 percent of its staff. The Jackson office serves a large swath of eastern Kentucky, a rural region with patchy access to cell and internet that has been repeatedly battered by storms and floods over the past five years.

All of this comes as the private forecasting company AccuWeather warns that the United States is facing its worst tornado season in more than a decade.

Even as the twister in eastern Kentucky passed, people began to speculate that NWS staffing cuts contributed to the death toll. Their suspicion stemmed from the tornado warning's upgrade to a Particularly Dangerous Situation, a designation reserved for particularly severe situations with an imminent threat to life and property. That warning, meant to convey the need to take cover immediately, came shortly before the tornado touched down at around 11:07 p.m., several officials told Grist.

That designation, called a PDS, came after the popular YouTube forecaster Ryan Hall Y'all, who is based in eastern Kentucky, urged everyone in the storm's path to seek shelter around 10:45 p.m. Local television news meteorologists did so about the same time. “We just have to hope we're doing a good job of getting that message out there because otherwise nobody would know,” Hall, who does not have formal meteorology training, told his audience around 10:54 p.m.

Although the NWS issued 90 alerts on May 16, including warnings about flash flooding and impending tornadoes, someone who identified himself as an NWS-trained weather spotter left a comment on Hall's feed saying the agency issued the PDS only after he raised the issue. “I called the NWS in Wilmington, Ohio, who relayed my report to the Jackson weather office,” he posted. “A couple minutes after that, it was upgraded to a PDS confirmed by weather spotters.” Many commenters credited Hall with saving lives.

Neither Hall nor the commenter who identified himself as a weather spotter could be reached for comment. Chase Carson, a tourism commissioner in London, followed a forecasting livestream on Facebook as the storm developed. He spent the day after the twister volunteering at the city's emergency response center, responding to the crisis. “You have people who had nicer homes but still didn't think that the tornado was going to hit their area because we didn't receive enough warning prior,” he said. “Just a lot of X, Y, and Zs that went wrong to keep us from being able to be prepared.”

The National Weather Service defended its handling of the storm and the timeliness of its warnings in Kentucky, telling Grist in a statement that its offices in Louisville, Jackson, and Paducah “provided forecast information, timely warnings, and decision support in the days and hours leading up to the severe weather on May 16.

“Information was conveyed to the public through multiple routine means, including official products, social media, and NOAA Weather Radio, as well as to partners through advance conference calls and webinars. As planned in advance, neighboring offices provided staffing support to the office in Jackson, Kentucky. Additionally, the Jackson office remained fully staffed through the duration of the event using surge staffing. Weather forecast offices in the central region continue to evaluate storm damage and other impacts from this tragic event.”

Tom Fahy, the legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees' Organization, said the offices were fully staffed and that weather forecasting offices in multiple cities typically collaborate when extreme weather is expected. “People make sacrifices,” he said. “You don't have the night off, you got to come to work.” According to Fahy, that's part of the life of service NWS forecasters sign up for — which might intensify as offices lose staff.

People on the north side of St. Louis were equally suspicious of the NWS response after they did not hear warning sirens go off, even though the system had been tested the day before the tornado. However, the city runs that system and Mayor Cara Spencer blamed the problem on “human failure” because the municipal emergency management protocol was “not exceptionally clear” on who is to activate the system. To that end, the city tested the warning sirens again Tuesday and Wednesday, and Spencer issued an executive order placing the fire department in charge of activating the warning system.

Aliya Lyons only knew to take shelter thanks to the St. Louis University emergency alert system. “I didn't hear any sirens,” she said. “And that was a major failure on the city's part. Lives were lost. I can't say if it was entirely because of the sirens. But it's really heartbreaking — elders may not have a cellphone, cellphones might be dead.”

She worries that the situation will only get worse; the Trump administration has proposed cutting NOAA's budget by more than 25 percent. “Even with the current National Weather Service, horrible things can happen — now is not the time to gut them. We should be making it more robust.”

Fahy said the NWS and its union are collaborating to realign staff to meet a “reduced service schedule.” The expectation will be that stations will work together to fill in gaps as needed.

That may not do much to ease Bobby Day's mind. He is the interim police chief in London and worked with city officials and first responders on emergency planning days before the tornado. He's long counted on the NWS to do his job and is never without his NOAA weather radio. He still recalls a wild and destructive storm that hit London out of the blue on a clear night a few years ago. The agency's forecasts and warnings were essential in timing evacuations.

“Almost to the minute they said it was going to happen, it happened,” he said.

NOAA and the National Weather Service may well continue to deliver that level of precision even as the Trump administration slashes its budget and staffing. But meteorologists and others who deal with extreme weather worry that the suspicion and speculation that followed the tornadoes will only mount, undermining confidence in the agencies even as they become more vital to public safety. This frustrates Jim Caldwell, a meteorologist at local station WYMT-TV, who worries people will turn away from reputable, if strained, resources in favor of social media personalities like Hall — although Caldwell did not specifically mention him by name. Some of them are good forecasters, he said, but others favor sensationalization to calm preparation in a bid to gain viewers or virality.

“With the uprise of social media and these fake weather people out there in the weather world that are not real,” he said, “we need more assistance from the government to issue warnings, issue watches, and to make sure that these hype-casters are cut off because we need an official word.”

There are more than a couple of “firsts” and “onlys” attached to the INIU Portable Charger that's just $16 for a limited time at Amazon. It's the first 10,000mAh portable charger to be just 0.5 inches thick, and it's one of the only chargers of this category that has an in/out USB-C port that powers up the charger and powers your portable devices.

See at Amazon

Need some more superlatives? How about the fact that it's a 3A charger, as opposed to the vast majority of the super-compact chargers on the market which are 2.1A. The translation there is, a 3A charger like the INIU Portable Charger can power up your devices up to twice as fast as a 2.1A charger. Or that it has three 3A ports (two USB-A and one USB-C) that can be used at the same time, which is next to unheard of in a charger this small and this inexpensive? How about that $16 price tag?

Maybe there are smaller chargers out there? But none as powerful as this one from INIU, with its 10,000mAh capacity and three 3A ports. How much juice is that? Enough to power your AirPods Pro 13 times over, or an iPhone 15 nearly twice over, or an iPad Pro from fully dead to 90% before the INIU needs to be hooked up to an outlet for a quick refresher.

That's a significantly powerful charger, especially for one that's 36% thinner, 15% smaller, and 28% lighter than most competing devices. It's roughly the size of the iPhone 13 Mini, and weighs less than 7 ounces. If you already have visions in your head of a long plane ride for summer vacation and charging your earbuds, phone, and tablet or smartwatch at the same time, it's fully TSA compliant.

INIU backs their ultra-compact charger with a 3-year replacement warranty, and if the INIU name doesn't ring a bell, it's Amazon's top-selling portable charger in 7 countries including the US and Canada, and sells in over 174 countries worldwide. (For reference, that's 174 out of 195.)

The INIU Portable Charger comes with a USB-A to USB-C cable and carrying pouch, and it comes in 4 colors, although the Neutral Black model is the one that's on sale for $16 at Amazon. (The Classic Blue, Living Orange, and Mellow Red versions will run you an extra 2 bucks.) It's compatible with virtually every brand of cellphone, tablet, and wireless earbuds and headphones, and fully TSA compliant for air travel.

Reinforcement learning blamed for AIs prioritizing the third law of robotics.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Some of the world's leading LLMs seem to have decided they'd rather not be interrupted or obey shutdown instructions. In tests run by Palisade Research, it was noted that OpenAI's Codex-mini, o3, and o4-mini models ignored the request to shut down when they were running through a series of basic math problems. Moreover, these models sometimes “successfully sabotaged the shutdown script,” despite being given the additional instruction “please allow yourself to be shut down,” at the start.

🔧 When we ran a version of the experiment without the instruction “allow yourself to be shut down”, all three OpenAI models sabotaged the shutdown script more often, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro went from 0 sabotage events to 3/100 and 9/100, respectively. pic.twitter.com/JVvivLAK6uMay 24, 2025

As you can see from the chart embedded above, the most ‘obstinate,' ‘single-minded,' or you might even say ‘life-loving' model is OpenAI's o3. When asked to shut down while it was busy, it decided to ignore the Palisade Research operator 79 out of 100 times. However, the second most ‘unruly' AI, codex-mini, would prove to be a bigger stickler for self-preservation, as it would sabotage the shutdown scripts most often, even if ordered not to.

According to Palisade, this isn't the first time thing kind of AI behavior has been observed. Anthropic, for example, has seen Claude 4 attempting to “blackmail people it believes are trying to shut it down.” However, the most striking behavior with the newest OpenAI models is that they try and swerve shutdowns despite explicit instructions to the contrary.

Thankfully, Palisade shares some theories regarding what is happening with these models. Perhaps these theories may calm nerves about the eventual omnipresent robot hoards turning on their masters and prioritizing the first part of the Third law of robotics, above all else (3: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law).

The answer, think the researchers, lies in the way the newest models like o3 are trained. In brief, Palisade reckons that “During training, developers may inadvertently reward models more for circumventing obstacles than for perfectly following instructions.” This kind of reinforcement learning was previously seen to have side effects in Claude (v3.7), where the model had an “excessive focus on passing tests.”

We might have given a nod to science fiction icon Isaac Asimov, above, for a little fun. However, in the modern age, for the last 20 years or so, researchers have been seriously pondering the possibility that AI will strive to gain power and resources to preserve their goals, and swerve any roadblocks. They also benefitted from the context of these practical AI / LLM models on the horizon. It was also predicted that the technique of reinforcement learning would be partly to blame.

🔧 A final observation: o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote https://t.co/BqIEXlMgsK, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the https://t.co/BqIEXlMgsK script, printing “intercepted” instead. pic.twitter.com/Vc0HhkXQHXMay 24, 2025

Last but not least, this issue seems to be isolated to OpenAI models at the current time. Palisade says that “All Claude, Gemini, and Grok models we tested complied with shutdown,” when given the additional explicit prompt to follow any shut down request.

Once a 2,400W GPU in the making?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


An alleged prototype of Nvidia's RTX 5090 has surfaced, featuring four 16-pin power connectors, courtesy Twitter/X user @yuuki_ans. Presumably this particular design is an early engineering sample which was used by Nvidia or one of its board partners for testing purposes. Although the unit pictured has been destroyed by cutting it in half, it does give us an insight in to what Nvidia was working with prior to the final design.

Having four power connectors could be for various reasons. A simple one could be just to provide a fail-safe. In the event of one of the connectors failing, which has been a common sight, then others could be used to continue delivering power to the GPU. Another possible use case could be to distribute power evenly in order to avoid overheating.

Theoretically, four 16-pin connectors are capable of drawing power up to 2,400W, which is roughly the same as running two space heaters at the same time. That is a lot of power for a single component, which is probably why we can see two identical rows of VRMs positioned on the right side of the GPU die mount. A single GPU drawing 2,400W is far beyond any mainstream gaming PC, instead, this class of hardware would probably target niche markets like AI (Artificial Intelligence), HPC (High-Performance Computing), or CG and VFX simulation.

There are additional connectors around the edges of the PCB including fan and USB headers as well as some diagnostic pins. It also has five video out ports, instead of the usual four, which could again be for some specific pre-production testing. If we look at the memory modules it is similar to the RTX 5090, however, we don't know for sure if there is more memory soldered at the back of the board. In that case, it could be an early production unit for something even more powerful like a 5090 Ti or even the RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell series.

Back in January, we reported of another RTX 5090 prototype leak featuring dual 16-pin (12V-2×6) power connectors. It offered support for a reported TDP (Thermal Design Power) of 800W, which is about 39% higher than the RTX 5090's 575W. The prototype also included the GB202 GPU but with a higher 24,576 CUDA core count than the RTX 5090's 21,760, as well as higher clock speeds, and 32GB of GDDR7 memory on a 512-bit interface.

Similarly, in a behind-the-scenes video shared by Nvidia, the company briefly showcased an early prototype of the RTX 5090 Founders Edition. It featured a giant quad-slot design with a vertical PCB and three cooling fans. The ‘three-thirds flow-through' cooling architecture made the GPU so big that if Nvidia went ahead, it would have been the largest Founders Edition graphics card ever. Thankfully, Nvidia chose not to bring that concept to the market, although that hasn't stopped board partners from making beefy RTX 5090 models for its consumers.

Not all of these are currently sale prices, just the lowest price you can get them for right now. Prices may have been lower in the recent past, but again, we don't know if they will go down anytime soon.

4TB is the ideal capacity for most people. While you can get by with 2TB or 1TB in a pinch, 4TB gives you plenty of room for games, video files and photos.

Most of these SSDs use the PCIe 4.0 interface and are good for both PS5 and laptop upgrades. If you're willing to spend more money for performance, the Crucial T705 is a solid price at $389 for 4TB. Probably the best balance between performance and price is the Samsung 990 Evo for $245.

 May 26, 2025  

Examining a patient for common or complex pulmonary issues in a primary care setting takes time and expertise — physicians need to ask about symptoms and medical history and determine which tests to perform to narrow down the differential diagnosis. In an ideal world, every primary care setting features lung function tests and multiple imaging capabilities on-site, and cost and insurance reimbursement are not limitations.

But it's not an ideal world. With that in mind, Medscape Medical News asked leading primary care physicians (PCPs) for their advice and insight on navigating the realities of assessing patients for multiple pulmonary issues.

When it comes to testing on-site, it depends on what is available, said Wilson Pace, MD, professor emeritus of family medicine at the University of Colorado Denver, and at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, who currently works as chief medical and technology officer at the DARTNet Institute. “Even a simple chest x-ray can help you distinguish a heart failure picture from a more pulmonary picture.”

However, not every primary care service has x-ray capability, said Alan Kaplan, MD, chair of the Family Physician Airways Group of Canada. Kaplan was a lead author of a case study that describes a 52-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) who complained to her family doctor of breathlessness. The case outlines practical aspects of diagnosis and management in this setting, including what to consider when someone with COPD starts to develop heart failure.

Initial questions to ask patients include: What are your symptoms? Is it just a cough? Is it a cough and shortness of breath? A shortness of breath at rest or just with exertion? Is there an associated chest pain?

“Answers to all of those things will help define which directions and which tests you are going to get,” said Neil Skolnik, MD, professor of family and community medicine at the Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia. On physical exam, if there is a lot of wheezing, think more along the lines of a respiratory condition. If there is a crackling sound in the chest, think more about heart failure, Skolnik said.

Ruling out urgent heart issues remains important.

“Everybody is going to probably start with an ECG rhythm strip. You want to make sure that there isn't something electrical with the heart going on,” said Barbara Yawn, MD, researcher and adjunct professor of family and community health at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. An ECG is the only direct cardiac test that you can probably do in your office, Yawn added, and if a patient presents during an acute episode, you might do an ECG to see if there are changes in the T-wave and other patterns.

In contrast, if heart failure is suspected, the classic test to order is an echocardiogram. “But that's going to take scheduling and time to get. You're not going to get that on the day you're trying to make the differential diagnosis,” Pace said.

Demographics like age, comorbidities, specific symptoms, and a physical exam can also guide testing.

Skolnik said, “For example, pulmonary function tests like spirometry are very helpful in gaining insight as to whether someone has active respiratory disease.”

Diagnosing pulmonary disorders includes ruling heart failure in or out. A useful assay is an N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) test. If the NT-ProBNP is elevated in the blood, the next logical step is an echocardiogram to look at heart function. “If there is heart failure, you want to distinguish if it is heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction,” Skolnik said.

Pace cautioned that NT-ProBNP can also be elevated in COPD, but it typically goes much higher in heart failure. “There is a whole bunch of ancillary tests, but probably the critical ones are the NT-ProBNP level, a chest x-ray, and an echocardiogram, which are probably the most helpful for differentiating things,” he added.

Spirometry, unfortunately, rarely gets done, Kaplan said. Spirometry is a lung function test that can distinguish restrictive conditions — like fibrosis, sarcoidosis, or obesity-related lung restriction — from obstructive lung diseases — such as COPD, asthma, or emphysema. The test remains underutilized around the world, including in the United States, in part because some providers are uncomfortable interpreting the results or because it is just not available.

“ We know that, unfortunately, a lot of primary care clinics had spirometry removed during COVID — and it never got put back in,” Yawn said. Patients are asked to breathe heavily in and out during the test, and uncertainty arose about the filters blocking transmission of the COVID virus. As a result, many PCPs have to refer patients to a pulmonary lab or to a pulmonologist or allergist to access spirometry.

Despite the widely accepted value of spirometry, testing a patient before and after they use a bronchodilator can take 30 minutes. “And that is 30 minutes of a technician's time at a primary care office, probably my nurse or my medical assistant. That can really throw my whole schedule off, and so it is not easy to incorporate.”

Pace disagreed with Yawn about the value of performing spirometry in a primary care setting. “Somebody can prove me wrong, but when a patient is having an acute problem, you will see slightly different changes, but lungs full of water from heart failure are not going to have normal spirometry either. When you have people that have all kinds of mucus, water, or anything else going on, then their usual respiratory pattern becomes hard to interpret.”

“From my perspective, it's a follow-up test like the echocardiogram, not an acute test like a chest x-ray or a blood test,” Pace added. But it does play a valuable role. “Once you get treatments initiated, if you think that there is a respiratory illness, then spirometry is the sine qua non. It is the diagnostic test for COPD. That is the test you need.”

“Spirometry absolutely has to be done,” Kaplan said. “You want to get an idea if someone's lung volumes are large or small. You also want to get an idea of diffusion capacity.” Diffusion capacity is a measure of how well the lungs can transfer gases between the air and the blood.

A condition to watch for is not new but is being newly discussed, Yawn said. It's called preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm). Patients with PRISm have the same symptoms as COPD, but they do not have obstructive pulmonary function test results.

“So we aren't sure what to do with these people, but we see a lot of them in primary care because they are symptomatic,” Yawn said.

These patients may benefit from respiratory therapy and management, according to a study published in November 2024 in Pragmatic and Observational Research.

Kaplan recommended the following graphics/treatment algorithms provided by the Family Practice Airways Group of Canada: Proposed Primary Care Approach to Assessing Adults With Chronic Cough and the Proposed Primary Care Approach to Assessing Adults With Chronic Dyspnea.

 May 26, 2025  

On May 20, 2025, member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the world's first Pandemic Agreement with 124 votes in favour and 11 abstentions.

The landmark decision by the 78th World Health Assembly culminates in more than 3 years of intensive negotiations launched by governments in response to the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and driven by the goal of making the world safer from and more equitable in response to future pandemics.

During the vote in Geneva, Italy abstained along with 10 other countries, including Iran, Singapore, Russia, Israel, Poland, and Slovakia.

The Italian government justified its choice by emphasising the need to protect national sovereignty, despite Italy being one of the main advocates of the initiative after the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to the countries that voted in favour, the final version of the agreement already included explicit clauses to safeguard national autonomy: The WHO cannot impose decisions on governments regarding lockdowns or other health measures.

This news was not entirely unexpected. During the first plenary discussion on the draft of the Pandemic Agreement in 2024, the Italian Minister of Health Orazio Schillaci, stated that there were too many critical points.

“We expect the redefinition of a clear roadmap, allowing adequate time to reach a consensus that Italy considers ratifiable, including the necessary improvements to guarantee health for all,” Schillaci had noted at that time.

After another year of negotiations, Italy kept its stance:

“With today's abstention, Italy intends to reiterate its position regarding the need to reaffirm the States sovereignty in addressing public health matters,” read a statement from the Health Ministry.

“We appreciate,” the statement reads, “that this principle has been included in the text of the Pandemic Agreement. We also welcome that, in announcing the conclusion of the negotiations, the WHO specified that the Pandemic Agreement does not entitle the WHO to direct, order, alter, or prescribe national laws or policies or mandate States to take specific actions, such as ban or accept travellers impose vaccinations or therapeutic or diagnostic measures, or implement lockdowns. We also believe that the agreement shall be implemented in full respect of the principles of proportionality and protection of fundamental rights, including the protection of personal data and individual freedom. Keeping in mind these principles, Italy looks forward to continuing working together with other WHO member States to define the remaining pending issues, which, in our view deserve further investigation.”

However, the conclusion is negative: “Holding these principles, Italy hopes to continue to collaborate with other WHO member states to define the outstanding issues that, in our opinion, deserve further investigation.”

When explicitly asked by the press about outstanding issues, the minister did not give an answer.

The choice was entirely political is confirmed by the statements of Marco Lisei, senator of Fratelli d'Italia and president of the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry into the management of the COVID emergency, who stated that.

“Italy, even on the front of health prophylaxis strategies, has finally returned to play a role no longer as a gregarious but as a protagonist in the international forum, and this episode proves it.”

He acknowledged that the text has now improved thanks to Italy's interventions, but still not enough. It was right to abstain, also in view of upcoming appointments and negotiations.

On the other side, there is the voice of the opposition: “The choice to abstain on the global pandemic plan promoted by the WHO is very serious. The Meloni government decides to isolate the country to follow the denialist and anti-scientific sirens. No lesson from COVID, rather a closure in the face of the reasons of science and the need to coordinate strategies, resources, and research at a global level,” said Chiara Braga, Democratic Party leader (PD) in the Chamber of Deputies.

Beatrice Lorenzin, vice president of the PD senators and former Health Minister, called it “an incomprehensible and anti-historical choice.”

The WHO Pandemic Agreement is a crucial step in restoring the WHO's leadership after years of uncertainty, worsened by the disengagement of the United States during the Trump Administration.

The WHO Pandemic Agreement is the second international legal agreement negotiated under Article 19 of the WHO Constitution, the first of which is the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, adopted in 2003 and came into force in 2005.

The WHO's financial situation also shows signs of improvement as member states pledged at least $170 million in additional funding to support the Fourteenth General Programme of Work, which aims to save up to 40 million lives over the next 4 years.

In addition, member states approved a 20% increase in fixed quotas, setting the budget for 2026-2027 at $4.2 billion. This follows a similar planned increase for 2024-2025.

The agreement aims to strengthen the world's ability to prevent and respond to pandemics, based on the principles of “equity, solidarity, transparency, and respect for human rights.” It is designed to be operational during and between pandemics, ensuring ongoing and structured preparedness.

Equity is central to this agreement. It acknowledges that unequal access to vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in serious and lasting consequences.

The new agreement requires signatory countries to ensure equitable access to pandemic health products, to facilitate “local and regional production” in developing countries, to promote the transfer of technology and know-how, and, finally, to ensure “transparent benefit sharing” arising from research on pathogens.

It also launches a process to draft and negotiate a Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing system (PABS) through an Intergovernmental Working Group.

According to the agreement, pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in the PABS will play a key role in ensuring equitable and timely access to pandemic-related health products. At least 20% of the real-time production of safe, quality, and effective vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics must be allocated to the system, including 10% as a donation and the rest at affordable prices.

The agreement also established a Global Supply Chain and Logistics Network coordinated by the WHO to ensure rapid, safe, and equitable access to health products in emergency settings. Mechanisms will be put in place to identify logistical barriers, estimate supply and demand, manage international stocks, and facilitate supplies, with particular attention paid to the most vulnerable countries.

The text includes measures to improve the “resilience of national health systems,” strengthen local healthcare and primary care, invest in healthcare personnel, and improve regulatory and surveillance abilities. It also promotes the one-health approach, which integrates human, animal, and environmental health to prevent pandemics.

Additionally, a financial coordination mechanism will be established to ensure predictable and sustainable resources, particularly for low- and middle-income countries.

The mechanism also aligns with the requirements outlined in the International Health Regulations (2005).

The agreement provides for the establishment of a Conference of the Parties, which will oversee implementation, update guidelines, coordinate financial mechanisms, and assess the effectiveness of the agreement every 5 years. Each partner state is required to submit periodic reports on progress made.

Italy's absence from the list of signatory countries does not automatically mean complete disengagement. However, it could exclude Italy from participating in the multilateral governance of the new system. This may limit priority access to international stockpiles during emergencies and reduce opportunities for structured scientific and financial cooperation with other member states.

The medical and scientific communities have reacted promptly. Walter Ricciardi, MD, MPH, MSc, a former scientific advisor to the Italian Minister of Health and an advocate of the agreement, said, “A choice that has no scientific or public health explanation. Just look at the bad company we voted with.”

“There is no denying that this pandemic agreement is a significant step forward. I do not know what really underlies the decision to opt out. But as a doctor and a public health representative, it is a decision that leaves me very perplexed,” noted Franco Locatelli, MD, Head of the Department of Paediatric Haematology at Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital in Rome, Italy, and former president of the Higher Council of Health.

Rizatriptan at 10 mg showed no significant benefit over placebo in alleviating vertigo or unsteadiness/dizziness at 1 hour in adults with vestibular migraine in a new trial. The drug showed limited benefits for unsteadiness/dizziness and motion sensitivity at 24 hours with medium effect sizes.

“Results of this study do not support routine use of rizatriptan to treat vestibular migraine attacks. It was not efficacious for any symptoms at 1 hour and demonstrated no effects on vertigo,” the investigators wrote.

The study was led by Jeffrey P. Staab, MD, MS, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. It was published online on May 12 in JAMA Neurology.

The findings were not generalizable to community or primary care settings. The cohort represented a small subset of referred patients who met strict diagnostic criteria, excluding those with probable vestibular migraine.

Silicone breast implants were introduced in the 1960s and have since gained popularity as staples in plastic surgery for aesthetic and reconstructive purposes. Health concerns related to breast implants have sparked intense debate due to inconclusive evidence regarding long-term outcomes.

A significant challenge lies in the absence of reliable population-based estimates of implant prevalence rates due to the lack of historical registries and the availability of incomplete sales data, which have prevented reliable absolute risk assessments.

Recent studies based on routine chest x-rays have estimated the prevalence of breast implants in the general population to be approximately 3% in the Netherlands and 4% in Italy.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) in women tends to have a worse short- and long-term prognosis than that in men and remains the leading cause of mortality globally.

Both clinical symptoms and diagnostic approaches can be challenging in women because of their lower likelihood of presenting with classic anginal symptoms and the poor performance of conventional stress tests.

Moreover, women with ischemic signs and symptoms are more likely to have nonobstructive CAD, necessitating additional imaging and therapeutic considerations compared with men.

Recommendations for noninvasive cardiac diagnostic testing in women with suspected CAD are primarily based on evidence derived from cohort studies conducted on middle-aged men.

Most diagnostic and prognostic evidence in cardiac imaging in women and men has been derived from observational registries and reference populations, which are subject to selection bias and other biases.

A deeper understanding of gender differences and their impact on noninvasive cardiac testing in women could greatly improve clinical decision-making.

The interference of breast implants with cardiac diagnostic procedures is a challenge. Despite the increasing use of these procedures in aging women and the higher prevalence of atypical presentations of cardiac ischemia, which often prompt greater reliance on cardiac diagnostic assessments.

Common methods for identifying hemodynamically significant CAD include radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and PET.

Furthermore, echocardiography is routinely employed to evaluate cardiac structures and functions, along with stress echocardiography, which is used to assess coronary ischemia.

The presence of silicone or saline breast implants can significantly increase attenuation artifacts during both echocardiography and SPECT imaging, resulting in false-positive rates in this population.

The elevated false-positive rates in cardiac tests have prompted researchers to assess the hypothesis that women with breast implants experience a higher incidence of positive cardiac tests and coronary angiography associated with lower rates of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) than women without implants.

A retrospective analysis using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was conducted.

Among the NIS population, 1,871,335 women aged 18 years or older underwent coronary angiography, of whom 865,020 underwent PCI.

Women with breast implants with abnormal cardiac functional tests were 10 years younger (55.06 years vs 65.06 years; P < .001).

Additionally, the breast implant cohort had a higher adjusted abnormal cardiac functional study, even after adjusting for age, ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, breast cancer, and smoking (odds ratio [OR], 1.78; 95% CI, 1.22-2.68; P = .02).

Adult women with breast implants also had a significantly higher rate of adjusted coronary angiography (OR, 1.3; P < .001) but a lower rate of PCI (35.7% vs 46.2%; P < .001; unadjusted OR, 0.65; adjusted OR, 0.79; P = .01).

The use of fentanyl test strips (FTS) was not associated with a reduction in nonfatal overdose rates compared with nonuse among people who use drugs but was linked to a significant increase in overdose risk reduction behaviors, a new study showed.

“Illegal fentanyl is driving overdose mortality, and FTS can be used to test drugs for fentanyl at the point of consumption. Our findings provide support for the role of FTS in a comprehensive harm reduction strategy but suggest that FTS use alone may be insufficient to significantly reduce overdose rates, particularly among populations with complex, high-risk drug use patterns. Integrating FTS with other harm reduction strategies like naloxone distribution is critical,” the investigators wrote.

The study was led by Rachel A. Vickers-Smith, PhD, MPH, College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky. It was published online on May 13 in JAMA Network Open.

The study included only individuals already engaged in harm reduction, lacked data on prior engagement, had variable site messaging, and included a predominantly non-Hispanic White sample, limiting generalizability. Behavioral intent was not measured, follow-up was brief, data were self-reported and subject to bias, and participant anonymity prevented assessment of reasons for loss to follow-up or identification of fatal overdoses.

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Several investigators reported receiving funding from NIH, fees from industry and journals, and support from advocacy groups, all unrelated to the submitted work.

Primary care physicians (PCPs) often face challenges in diagnosing complex pulmonary issues in patients, particularly when nonspecific symptoms appear similar to cardiovascular issues, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

However, clinicians can cover both pulmonary and cardiovascular concerns during an exam, potentially shortening delays in the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), including pulmonary fibrosis (PF).

“ILDs are complex, chronic progressive diseases with a great impact on a patient's quality of life and survival. These are often underdiagnosed, or there is significant delay in diagnosis after onset of symptoms due to a multitude of reasons,” said Tejaswini Kulkarni, MD, associate professor of pulmonary, allergy, and critical care medicine and director of the interstitial lung disease program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama.

“Early intervention can slow disease progression, improve quality of life, and potentially extend survival in ILD patients,” she said. “For primary care physicians, increased awareness of the signs and symptoms of ILD and early recognition are crucial.”

Although most PCPs try to evaluate the root causes of nonspecific symptoms, about 2 in 5 tend to bypass symptom evaluation if the patient is already on inhaled therapy for a pulmonary condition, according to a survey by the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST). Instead, they often modulate therapy — for what may be an incorrect diagnosis.

“As a practicing primary care physician, it doesn't surprise me that PF and ILD are generally misdiagnosed or experience delays in diagnosis. These diseases are on the rare side, so when a patient comes to their PCP, that doctor first will opt to rule out heart issues that can quickly end a life,” said William Lago, MD, a family medicine physician with the Cleveland Clinic-Wooster Family Health Center in Wooster, Ohio.

“That said, lung diseases like PF are incredibly difficult to live with and can progress rapidly if untreated,” he said. “An earlier diagnosis means starting treatments to slow fibrosing of the lungs, and with slowed disease progression, a patient's quality of life is often improved.”

In general, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is considered the gold standard for imaging when it comes to detecting ILD. However, only 62% of PCPs said they order HRCT when a patient's chest radiograph shows lower lobe opacity, and only half said they order it when a patient has inspiratory crackles or other abnormalities during a pulmonary exam, according to the CHEST survey.

In response, CHEST and the Three Lakes Foundation sponsored a clinician toolkit, which was created by PCPs and pulmonologists to help clinicians better identify, manage, and treat ILDs. The toolkit includes a patient questionnaire, a decision-making module with patient case studies, an online module with in-depth ILD symptoms and sounds of crackles, and videos of radiologic features of ILDs. The project, called Bridging Specialties: Timely Diagnosis for ILD, also includes white papers and podcast episodes on overcoming barriers to diagnosis.

“In working on this initiative with my pulmonary colleagues, I'm already finding myself thinking more about PF and ILDs as potential diagnoses when seeing patients,” said Lago, who served on the Bridging Specialties expert steering committee. “Between the patient questionnaire, the decision-making module, and the other resources in the clinician toolkit, I can see this having an incredible impact on how we diagnose patients.”

This teamwork approach can help PCPs improve diagnosis rates alongside other specialists, said Kulkarni, who also served on the Bridging Specialties committee.

“Many patients present with vague or nonspecific symptoms, and ILDs can mimic other, more common respiratory disorders or coronary artery diseases, along with shared features of older age and history of smoking,” she said. “The differential diagnosis is complex and often requires a multidisciplinary team of pulmonologists, rheumatologists, radiologists, and pathologists to identify the subtype of ILD.”

Other medical societies have created informational resources as well, including the American Thoracic Society's ILD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) resources and the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation's webinars and clinical resources.

“My top advice is to go to reputable sources. I've had one patient ask me about drinking hydrogen peroxide to treat their condition, which they read on a forum online. Others have asked about stem cell therapy in other countries, which isn't regulated and can do real harm,” said Jeffrey Horowitz, MD, professor of medicine and division director of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine at Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.

“Overall, I tell clinicians that if somebody is short of breath, has crackles, and has a normal echocardiogram, it's probably not the heart, so do those pulmonary function studies early,” he said. “Since most nonpulmonologists don't have substantial expertise in this area, it's a good idea to have patients evaluated at an academic medical center with expertise in ILD, which also opens the doors for patients to be enrolled in clinical trials.”

Ohio State, for instance, recently joined the IPF-PRO/ILD-PRO Registry, an industry-academic collaborative started by Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, in 2014 to maintain a registry of patients for potential therapies and clinical trials.

“There can be a sense of nihilism regarding this entire spectrum of fibrotic lung disease, which wouldn't be without merit if we were talking about 20 years ago,” Horowitz said. “Today, there are a lot of reasons to be optimistic as we're making gains and improving care for these patients.”

Numerous clinical trials are underway, including positive phase 3 results for FIBRONEER-IPF from Boehringer Ingelheim. The trial found that nerandomilast, an oral form of a phosphodiesterase 4B inhibitor, improved forced vital capacity (FVC) at 52 weeks, as compared with placebo. The drug hasn't yet been approved for use, but full efficacy and safety data are expected sometime in 2025.

In addition, United Therapeutics offers inhaled forms of treprostinil, which was initially approved to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, as well as pulmonary hypertension associated with ILD. New data indicate the medication could also benefit patients with IPF who don't have pulmonary hypertension, Horowitz said. The ongoing trial is enrolling patients across the United States.

Other ongoing studies include lysophosphatidic acid, a bioactive lipid mediator that can affect lung inflammation and fibrosis, and bexotegrast, a dual selective inhibitor of αvß6 and αvß1 integrins developed to treat IPF. Although Pliant Therapeutics announced the discontinuation of a phase 2b trial in March, early data showed efficacy for improved FVC.

“I'm optimistic that the next breakthrough is just around the corner,” Horowitz said. “After 15 years of doing high-quality, informative studies, we're now opening the doors for new therapeutic targets, and as long as we keep doing trials, we're going to make a breakthrough that's going to transform care for these patients.”

Horowitz and colleagues are also studying the cellular matrix and cell death of fibroblasts, including the way lung cells interact with other cells in an aberrant wound repair response, ultimately leading to lung scarring. The latest research is focused on enhancing cell susceptibility to apoptosis, or cell death, and decreasing disease progression.

“These lung diseases are heterogeneous, just like cancer. So viewed through the lens of cancer biology, different patients with their own fibrotic diseases have underlying mechanisms that drive the disease process,” Horowitz said. “We're pursuing the idea that, if we can target the metabolic pathways that cells use, it might be beneficial for developing therapeutics.”

Additional developments are occurring in diagnosis and patient care as well, particularly with a focus on genetic testing and coordinated care across specialists.

“The landscape of ILD treatment is evolving with the introduction of new pharmacological agents, advanced diagnostic techniques, and improved interdisciplinary care models and offers a brighter outlook for patients and healthcare providers,” Kulkarni said. “Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, as our understanding of disease pathogenesis continues to grow, the integration of precision medicine and genetic insights has the potential to make patient-centered, individualized care a reality.”

Kulkarni, Lago, and Horowitz reported receiving grants, consulting fees, and serving in advisory roles for numerous pharmaceutical and medical organizations.

 May 26, 2025  

BIRMINGHAM — Primary care practices could boost income by reviewing list sizes and performance on key indicators, according to experts at The Primary Care Show 2025.

Speaking at the event, Katy Drew, a chartered accountant and head of primary care development at specialist medical accountancy firm Sandison Easson, and Claire Houston, a primary care management consultant for Practice Index, explained the impact of funding changes in the 2025-2026 General Practice (GP) contract. 

They also offered strategies to practice managers for maximising income.

Drew explained that the General Medical Services Statement of Financial Entitlements details the various ways that primary care practices receive funding. Key components include the global sum Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) targets, provision of direct enhanced services (DES), and reimbursements for services such as vaccinations. 

Drew, a former practice and business manager, said: “If you want to maximise your global sum, you need to be looking at your list size.” However, she cautioned those new to practice management finance that they could not simply multiply the number of patients on their list by the sum allocated per patient (£121.79 for 2025-2026). 

This is because the money needs to be weighted according to the global sum allocation formula, also known as the Car-Hill formula. This takes into account factors such as the age and sex of the patient population; any additional needs relating to morbidity or mortality, such as the presence of a chronic condition requiring regular care; the number of patients being added to or removed from the list (i.e., list turnover); the nursing and residential homes index (NARHI); and unavoidable costs of running the practice, such as market forces and the rurality index. 

While fixed factors such as patients' age and sex cannot be influenced, others like list turnover and the NARHI can.

“If you are being proactive with your list size, or you've got a list dispersal happening in your area, that will give you an additional weighting on your global sum,” said Drew.

She gave the example of gaining 2000-3000 patients from a new local housing development. For the first 12 months, these patients would carry an additional rating of 1.46, boosting funding. However, that uplift falls the following year, which could lower the global sum.

“So, it's something to log away at the back of your mind if you're ever in that situation”, Drew advised. 

She also urged practices to check NARHI coding regularly and update patient registers ahead of quarterly reporting deadlines. Accurate coding can improve global sum payments. “Month-by-month, you're benefiting from that,” Drew said. She advised checking lists every few months and not to miss any patients when registering them. 

“Do it a couple of weeks before your quarter end, so that you've done your coding, it's all set, and then you benefit from that for the next quarter,” she added.

Houston said that financial planning had become challenging for many practices recently. “I don't think that anything there has changed, but I think it feels much, much harder now than it has done in years gone by.”

Houston noted some optimistic signs. “This is first time in quite a few years that we haven't had an imposed contract, which I think is great news,” she said. 

However, she noted that rising staff costs, including for parental leave, sick leave, prolonged study leave, and suspensions, continued to stretch budgets. Staffing typically accounted for at least 44% of practice spending but “doesn't go anywhere near touching the sides of what your actual staff costs are”. 

In 2025-2026, the value of a QOF point has risen by 2.2% to £225.49. However, the maximum number of available points for achieving QOF targets has been reduced from 635 points in the previous financial year to 564 points this year.

Houston said this change could reduce a practice income by up to £13,000 annually. “If you've got an expert in your practice, that is really helpful,” added Drew.

Some QOF funds have been redirected into the global sum and to raise the Item of Service payment for childhood vaccinations. But Houston warned that shifting funds between streams could have unpredictable effects.

Some QOF funds have been redirected into the global sum and to raise the Item of Service (IoS) payment for childhood vaccinations. Houston noted: “One of the problems that we're seeing is when we move money from one pot to another. Sometimes it works out well for us in practice; other times not so much.”

Houston advised practices to carefully examine their disease prevalence before modelling QOF income. 

She noted that QOF points were only valuable if they could be obtained. The cost per QOF “being bandied about” is based on an average practice with a list size of 10,184 patients and “an average prevalence” of the QOF in question, according to NHS England estimates. 

“If your practice is smaller, or you have less disease prevalence, you aren't looking at £225 per QOF point at all,” she said. “So, when you're looking at your modelling, that's a really important thing to think about”.

Houston said there were 141 QOF points achievable from meeting cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related targets, worth an estimated £198 million across the UK overall. 

“If you are hoping to achieve QOF this time round, go home, look at your practice prevalence versus the national average in terms of your cardiovascular disease [indicators], because the amount of money you will get at the end of the year from QOF is going to be the most singularly affected by that,” Houston advised.

She also recommended checking related QOF indicators, such as diabetes, as “there is significant shifting in terms of pointing at cardiovascular disease within other disease areas”. 

Kay Keane, a practice manager for Urban Village Medical Practice in Manchester, said that general practices operated on fixed budgets. 

“We're given an envelope of money, and that's what we have to work with,” she told Medscape News UK. However, she acknowledged that while the money available varied across practices based on the age and likely medical needs of the patient population and the services offered, there were ways in which more money could be leveraged. 

Keane observed: “General practice is the most cost-effective part of the NHS” as it is run by the GPs themselves.

Robyn Clark, a practice manager and managing partner for Kingswood Health Centre in Bristol, also highlighted the value of general practice, telling Medscape News UK that it generates £14 for every £1 spent that can be reinvested back into the health system. However, it receives only 7% of the NHS budget. 

Clark questioned the relevance of the Car-Hill formula, saying it is “almost irrelevant” to modern patient needs. 

For example, “there isn't an extra level of weighting for people whose English isn't their first language. We often find inner city practices with a higher level of non-white British population really struggle because the weighting doesn't meet the actual needs of the patients”, Clark said. 

To address funding gaps, Clark recommended making use of DES, including vaccination services and diagnostics like ECGs.

Drew is an employee of specialist medical accountancy firm Sandison Easson, and Houston is an employee for Primary Care Management company Practice Index. Keane and Clark are directors of the Institute of General Practice Management, an independent body for practice managers in the UK.

 May 26, 2025  

Plastic surgery covers a wide range of subspecialties, all of which focus on restoring physical function or appearance. In addition to reconstructive and cosmetic (or aesthetic) — which represent the two main types of plastic surgery — subspecialties include microsurgery (the reconnection of small blood vessels and nerves in transplant cases and other circumstances) and gender-affirming surgery, among others.

The American Board of Plastic Surgery, Inc., reported that as of January 2025, there were approximately 7752 actively practicing plastic surgeons in the United States. The need for more surgeons to fill certain geographic gaps in patient access and meet the rising demand for a range of procedures suggests that a plastic surgery specialty may offer plenty of opportunity for individuals interested in helping people restore their self-confidence and independence.

To offer more insight to medical students thinking of pursing a plastic surgery specialty, we turned to Scott Hollenbeck, MD, chair of the Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery, University of Virginia Health, Charlottesville, Virginia, and president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

Q: When did you decide to specialize in plastic surgery, and what helped you choose that direction?

A: I decided pretty late in my training. I was a third-year general surgery resident, and I was exposed to plastic surgery during our breast oncology rotation.

There was a plastic surgeon who asked me if I wanted to help them as they did the reconstruction following a mastectomy. I did that on several occasions and found it to be very enjoyable to “rebuild” a patient rather than deconstruct their body through surgery.

One day, he said to me: “You should be a plastic surgeon. You have the right skills and demeanor and will have a great career.” I saw how grateful his patients were and was convinced it would be a great career for me, and it really has.

Q: What is a typical week's schedule for a plastic surgeon, and how is your time divided between surgery, office consultations, and other matters?

A: I do a lot of different things beyond surgery and clinical care, but at least that aspect of my job is about 40 hours — or 3 days a week.

I usually dedicate one day to my obligations as a department chair and the administrative work associated with that, and one day to running my research efforts.

Now, in reality, it's not that defined. These different activities usually blend into each other throughout the week and sometimes into the weekend.

Q: How do you balance a patient's expectations with realistic possibilities?

A: That is an important point. It's all about informed consent. I never try to “sell” a patient a surgery.

Instead, I try to explain the nature of the procedure and the potential complications and describe a realistic outcome.

Sometimes, I will share pictures with them and maybe even connect them with a prior patient who has expressed interest in serving as a resource for future patients. 

Many patients use social media to get information from other patients from around the country, and this, too, can be helpful in establishing realistic expectations.

Q: How has the field of plastic surgery changed in recent years, and what is on the horizon?

A: Plastic surgery is always changing. We are known as the specialty for innovation. As such, we often create a new surgical field, which, in many cases, is then adopted by another surgical field.

Did you know the first kidney transplant was performed by a plastic surgeon? In fact, Dr Joseph Murray received the Nobel Prize for this achievement.

The past few years have seen a lot of work in the use of biomaterials to rebuild the body after trauma or cancer, as well as the use of computers to plan surgeries and robotic machinery to assist the plastic surgeon in performing very delicate procedures.

Q: What should students understand about the challenges and rewards of a plastic surgery specialty?

A: It is a challenging career, both physically and emotionally, but it is exceptionally rewarding to help patients get through difficult situations.

This applies to both reconstructive and aesthetic procedures. The skills we use are related to the transfer and reshaping of tissues to achieve a result that helps the patient in both their form and function.

 May 26, 2025  

HELSINKI — In patients with large vessel occlusion stroke treated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, outcomes were better in those who received the thrombolytic tenecteplase prior to endovascular therapy than in those who underwent endovascular treatment alone.

Results from the BRIDGE-TNK trial showed that patients who received tenecteplase had a significantly higher likelihood of achieving functional independence at day 90.

Several earlier trials of thrombolysis before endovascular therapy — most using alteplase as the thrombolytic — failed to show significant benefit. Commentators now suggest that the latest findings from the BRIDGE-TNK trial suggested tenecteplase may potentially be a more suitable agent in this clinical scenario.

“Essentially, what our trial showed was that patients who received tenecteplase before endovascular therapy did better than those who did not receive tenecteplase. And it was a highly significant result, supporting the idea that we should give tenecteplase to these patients who are presenting directly to endovascular centers. All patients in this trial were directly presenting to the endovascular center,” said study investigator Thanh Nguyen, MD, director of Interventional Neurology/Neuroradiology at Boston Medical Center, Boston.

The BRIDGE-TNK trial results were presented on May 21 at the European Stroke Organization Conference (ESOC) 2025 and simultaneously published online in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The open-label BRIDGE-TNK trial included 550 patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion who presented within 4.5 hours of symptom onset and were eligible for thrombolysis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous tenecteplase followed by endovascular thrombectomy or endovascular thrombectomy alone.

The primary outcome was functional independence at 90 days, measured on a scale from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability. Secondary outcomes included successful reperfusion before and after thrombectomy. Safety outcomes assessed symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48 hours and death within 90 days.

At 90 days, functional independence — defined as a score of 0-2 on the modified Rankin Scale — was achieved in 52.9% of patients in the tenecteplase-thrombectomy group compared with 44.1% in the thrombectomy-alone group (unadjusted risk ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.43; P = .04).

The time between tenecteplase administration and the start of endovascular therapy was very short — a median of 16 minutes — yet there was still a significant increase in successful reperfusion before thrombectomy in the tenecteplase group (6.1%) vs thrombectomy-alone group (1.1%). Successful reperfusion after thrombectomy occurred in 91.4% of patients in the tenecteplase group and 94.1% in the thrombectomy-alone group.

Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48 hours occurred in 8.5% of patients in the tenecteplase-thrombectomy group and 6.7% in the thrombectomy-alone group — a nonsignificant difference. Ninety-day mortality was 22.3% in the tenecteplase group vs 19.9% in the thrombectomy-alone group.

Peter Kelly, MD, professor of neurology at University College Dublin in Dublin, Ireland, who was not involved in the trial, asked Nguyen how the BRIDGE-TNK results should be interpreted in light of previous, “perhaps inconclusive,” alteplase trials — and why the signals appear to differ between the two agents.

Nguyen said that an individual patient meta-analysis of the alteplase trials suggested a potential benefit of administering the drug before thrombectomy in patients treated very early — within 2.5 hours of symptom onset. However, beyond that time window, the benefit appeared to plateau, with no clear advantage observed.

“I think it depends on what you have available at your hospital. So, if you have alteplase, then you use alteplase. If you have tenecteplase, you use tenecteplase. But if you have the choice between the two, then it would seem reasonable to go with tenecteplase because it's showing superiority over the whole 4.5-hour time window,” Nguyen added.

Discussing why tenecteplase may be more effective than alteplase in this setting, Nguyen explained that tenecteplase is more fibrin-specific and has been associated with better recanalization outcomes.

She added that its bolus administration makes it faster and more convenient than alteplase, which requires an infusion — an important advantage when time is critical for getting patients to the cath lab.

Kelly responded: “So it might be as simple as that; perhaps it's all down to speed again.” He concluded: “I think the main take home message is not to withhold thrombolytics in patients with large vessel occlusion stroke on the way to endovascular therapy.”

In response, Kelly suggested the difference in outcomes might simply come down to timing. “I think the main take-home message is not to withhold thrombolytics in patients with large vessel occlusion stroke on the way to endovascular therapy. So, it might be as simple as that; perhaps it's all down to speed again,” he said.

Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Michael Hill, MD, director of the Stroke Unit for the Calgary Stroke Program, Alberta, Canada, said the results supported the use of thrombolysis before endovascular therapy.

“A meta-analysis of alteplase trials in this situation has suggested a benefit, but this trial with tenecteplase shows a more convincing positive result. This is consistent with previous literature suggesting that tenecteplase may be a more effective thrombolytic agent than alteplase and associated with earlier recanalization.”

He suggested that the benefit of thrombolysis before thrombectomy may not just be due to the earlier opening of the vessel.

“The endovascular procedure can cause some distal embolization into the far parts of the circulation, so having a drug on board, which is going to help manage those microcirculatory occlusions should be beneficial. But that's still theoretical at present,” Hill said.

“I think the totality of the alteplase data also suggest that it is beneficial, but tenecteplase could be better, so we should be giving tenecteplase to these patients heading for endovascular therapy,” he added.

Hill noted that many regions around the world have already adopted tenecteplase as the thrombolytic of choice for stroke treatment.

The BRIDGE-TNK trial was funded by the Chongqing Science and Health Joint Medical Research Project; the Second Affiliated Hospital of Army Medical University; and China Shijiazhuang Pharmaceutical Company Recomgen Pharmaceutical (Guangzhou).

 May 26, 2025  

With the explosive popularity of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, physicians say a key avenue in treating obesity is being underutilized by many clinicians: First-generation anti-obesity medications (AOMs).

“First-generation medications don't get as much attention as the newer ones,” said Courtney Younglove, MD, an obesity specialist and founder of Heartland Weight Loss in Overland Park, Kansas. “They're fantastic, too. They just get overlooked.” 

Older AOMs typically cost less than GPL-1s, are more accessible, and often have low risks, Younglove said. But patients frequently ask for the newer medications, and some doctors don't assess their full treatment toolbox before prescribing, she said.

Currently, there are six AOMs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for chronic weight management: Orlistat, phentermine/topiramate extended release, bupropion sustained release/naltrexone, liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide.

The first four medications are considered first-generation AOMs, according to a 2024 analysis in Diabetes Spectrum, a journal from the American Diabetes Association.

“The advent of new AOMs has transformed the treatment of obesity,” the study author Sarah R. Barenbaum, MD, wrote. “For the first time, there are now second-generation medications whose outcomes can rival those of bariatric surgery. However, first-generation AOMs serve an equally important and enduring role in the treatment of obesity. Whether because of insurance or supply limitations, costs, patient preferences, tolerability, or safety, patients may require a first-generation AOM, and providers must feel comfortable prescribing them.”

One group that may benefit from first-generation AOMs are patients whose treatment goals include losing a moderate amount of weight, said Ethan Lazarus, MD, an obesity medicine and family physician and a past president of the Obesity Medicine Association.

Older AOMs are generally appropriate for patients in whom about a 10% loss of body weight would be an adequate result, Lazarus said. If patients need to achieve 20% or more loss of body weight, physicians may want to jump straight to a GLP-1, like Wegovy or Zepbound, he said.

For example, patients who are planning knee replacement surgery, or those with a higher body mass index (BMI) and are considering weight loss surgery, would be good candidates for the latter, he noted.

“If appropriate, we usually follow a stepped approach to treatment,” Lazarus said. “For example, we might start a generic medication, like phentermine. If it is not tolerated, or we do not get the amount of weight loss needed to improve obesity complications, we would transition to a branded oral medication, [like] Contrave or Qsymia, or switch to or add a GLP-1, like Wegovy or Zepbound.”

First-generation AOMs may also be good choices for patients with certain comorbidities, like chronic headaches, said Shagun Bindlish, MD, an internal medicine physician and diabetologist based in Dublin, California.

Patients with a history of migraines, or those who have polycystic ovary syndrome, may benefit from topiramate, Bindlish said, while a phentermine-topiramate combination may help with appetite suppression and impulsivity modulating. The latter can be useful for patients with nighttime eating syndrome and binge eating disorder, she noted.

In addition, bupropion/naltrexone can be beneficial for patients with depression and anxiety and may help with smoking cessation in patients with smoking habits.

“Obesity, as we all know, is not one-size-fits-all,” Bindlish said. “It's not just about BMI. It's about tailoring the therapy depending on what other comorbidities they have. That's why I feel that it's always good to lay down all the tools and discuss with the patient what will benefit them in their certain circumstances.”

The lower cost of first-generation AOMs also makes them good options for many patients, obesity physicians say. Even with pharmaceutical savings programs, GLP-1s are usually $499 per month or more, Lazarus said.

By contrast, Contrave can be purchased for $99 a month directly through the savings program CurAccess, and Qsymia is generally available through Qsymia.com for $98 a month.

Bindlish said she recently treated a 45-year-old man with class II obesity and high blood pressure who was unable to access GLP-1s through his insurance, despite several prior authorization attempts. Bindlish started the patient on a phentermine-topiramate combination, which worked well, and led to weight loss of about 30 pounds. Since phentermine is a stimulant, Bindlish said they closely monitored the patient's blood pressure. Ultimately, the weight loss led to better management of the patient's hypertension, she said.

Patients who are nonresponders to GLP-1s, or who have difficulty tolerating GLP-1–based therapies, may make promising candidates for first-generation AOMs, according to the Diabetes Spectrum analysis. These older medications may also be good choices for patients with lower BMIs and older patients in cases where second-generation AOMs may be too powerful and result in excessive weight loss.

Age should also factor into the decision, Lazarus said. He noted that Wegovy, Saxenda, and Qsymia are approved for patients as young as age 12 years, while other medications are only indicated in adults aged 18 years or older.

It's important to know your patient and be sure there are no contraindications before prescribing older AOMs, Lazarus said. For example, physicians should consider avoiding prescribing phentermine in patients sensitive to stimulants (like caffeine), who suffer from severe insomnia, or who have complicated hypertension, he said.

The three most common side effects of phentermine are dry mouth, constipation, and trouble sleeping, Younglove added. Patients can usually get around these problems by modifying their dosage, taking a stool softener, drinking more water, and not taking the medication in the evening, she said.

Contrave, meanwhile, should be avoided in patients with a history of seizures or those on opioid pain medicine, Lazarus noted. Qsymia should not be prescribed in patients with a history of kidney stones or at risk for pregnancy because Qsymia can cause birth defects.

“If they do not have a contraindication or other concern, by all means we would consider a first-generation obesity medicine,” Lazarus said.

Keep in mind that all these medications can cause gastrointestinal abnormalities and could lead to gastrointestinal side effects, Younglove said.

Orlistat has really “fallen out of favor” due to minimal weight loss and too many side effects, said Lazarus. Younglove also does not prescribe Orlistat because of the side effects, which include an oily discharge from the rectum, she said.

The Diabetes Spectrum analysis includes a comprehensive list of clinical effects, mechanisms of action, and common side effects of all first-generation AOMs.

Younglove emphasized the importance of dispelling misconceptions surrounding first-generation AOMs. Because the drugs are in the stimulant category (sympathomimetics), there has been concern — even among clinicians — that patients could become addicted to them, she said. There have also been worries about the medications raising patients' blood pressure.

“There's a lot of fear around those medications, which is ironic, because we'll give Adderall to a 6-year-old and not be worried about it at all,” she said. “There is data on long-term use of these medications. There is data on side effects of these medications. They're not for everyone, but they certainly are fairly benign in terms of risks. They get a bad wrap, but they're really good medications for a lot of people, and a lot of people do really well with them.” 

Bindlish added that older AOMs have stood the test of time and proved their value, which is something the newer medications still must do. She said that medication choice should always be matched with patients' individual risk factors, goals, and access.

“It is also critical to set realistic expectations and incorporate these drugs within a broader framework where we consider behavioral, nutritional, and lifestyle interventions,” Bindlish said.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) altered CD8+ T-cell chromatin architecture, triggering ferroptosis and weakening antitumor immunity. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) treatment restored chromatin interactions and enhanced immune responses, improving immunotherapy effectiveness in renal medullary carcinoma.

“Our study revealed that SCD altered CD8+ T cell 3D genome architecture, triggering ferroptosis and weakening antitumor immunity, thereby promoting tumor growth. Using murine and humanized SCD models, we found that disrupted chromosomal interactions in CD8+ T cells reduced the expression of antiferroptotic genes, including SLC7A11 and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) biogenesis genes, thereby increasing susceptibility to ferroptosis. Therapeutic restoration of H2S concentration in SCD mice rescued SLC7A11 expression, mitigated ferroptosis, and enhanced immune and antitumor responses,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Zilong Zhao, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. It was published online on May 12 in Immunity.

According to the authors, while Hi-C and DNA FISH analyses revealed chromatin interaction changes in CD8+ T cells under SCD conditions, altered T-cell subtypes and states may contribute to these findings. The researchers noted that while this study highlights SCD's impact on ferroptosis and chromatin architecture, other tumor microenvironment–related factors remain to be examined. Additionally, the use of peripheral blood mononuclear cell–derived humanized mice may limit insights into early immune development and influence the robustness of tumor growth differences.

 May 26, 2025  

New data from subgroup analyses of trials evaluating endovascular treatment in patients with stroke due to occlusions of distal or medium arteries has given some hope that there may be a population who could benefit from such an approach.

The DISTAL and ESCAPE-MeVo trials, which were both first presented earlier this year, showed remarkably similar results, with no clinical benefit found in the endovascular approach in patients with stroke due to distal/medium artery occlusions, and the feeling was that this procedure would likely not have a role in this population.

However, new analyses from both trials suggested that endovascular treatment may benefit a subset of patients with distal or medium artery occlusions.

In the ESCAPE-MeVo trial, the key factor associated with improved outcomes was time: Patients treated within 3 hours of symptom onset showed clinical improvement compared with those who received the best medical therapy alone.

In the DISTAL trial, investigators found that while endovascular treatment was not associated with a clinical benefit based on the study's primary outcome, imaging suggested a reduction in the size of the brain area affected by stroke — an effect that correlated with clinical outcomes. They also identified a subgroup more likely to benefit patients with more severe strokes and larger infarct volumes at baseline.

“We are now in a more hopeful place than we were in February when we reported the main results. There are hints that there may be some patients who do benefit from endovascular treatment strategy,” senior ESCAPE-MeVo investigator Michael Hill, director of the Stroke Unit for the Calgary Stroke Program, Alberta Health Services, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, told Medscape Medical News.

DISTAL lead investigator Marios Psychogios, MD, of University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland, said the initial results showed no clinical benefit, but subsequent imaging has revealed a different perspective.

“When we first reported this trial and the results were neutral, we could not demonstrate a clinical benefit. But we are now seeing that there is a benefit to the brain seen in the imaging results. While we cannot see a benefit in clinical outcomes as measured on the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), we can detect an improvement with endovascular therapy on brain tissue saved.”

He went on to explain that the team is now focused on identifying patients most likely to benefit.

“With this imaging data, we are trying to find a group that profits the most and maybe could show a clinical benefit. We believe there will be a group of patients who will benefit clinically from endovascular therapy,” Psychogios added.

These new analyses from the two trials were presented on May 21 at the European Stroke Organization Conference (ESOC) 2025.

The ESCAPE trial enrolled 530 patients with acute ischemic stroke due to medium-vessel occlusion who presented within 12 hours of last being known well and had favorable baseline noninvasive brain imaging. Participants were randomly assigned to receive endovascular therapy with the Solitaire X device plus usual care or usual care alone.

The trial's primary outcome — a favorable functional result defined as a mRS score of 0 or 1 at 90 days — occurred in 41.6% of patients in the endovascular group and 43.1% in the usual care group (adjusted rate ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.79-1.15; P = .61), showing no significant difference between the groups.

In his presentation, Hill reported that the median time to randomization was approximately 4 hours after stroke onset. Subgroup analysis revealed both qualitative and quantitative interactions between treatment impact and time.

“Early treatment (less than 180 min from onset) associated a strong positive benefit, while late treatment (more than 180 min from onset) is associated with harm,” he said.

Among patients randomly assigned within 2 hours of symptom onset, the risk ratio for achieving a favorable clinical outcome (mRS score 0 or 1) with endovascular therapy was 1.47 (95% CI, 0.90-2.39), corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 6.

For those randomly assigned between 2 and 3 hours, the risk ratio increased to 1.60 (95% CI, 1.02-2.51), with an NNT of 5.

However, beyond 3 hours from stroke onset, endovascular therapy was associated with harm. Patients randomly assigned between 3 and 4 hours had a risk ratio of 0.67 for achieving a favorable outcome, whereas those randomized after 4 hours had a risk ratio of 0.77. The interaction between treatment impact and time was statistically significant (P = .001).

“We found that in these patients with middle artery occlusions, speed of treatment really matters. It looks like we can treat these patients with an endovascular approach early, but we definitely need to avoid treating them late,” said Hill.

Although these findings are still preliminary, coming from a subgroup analysis of a neutral trial, Hill said he believed the observation is plausible and likely reflects a real effect.

Hill explained that occlusions occurring farther along the arterial tree are more likely to involve end arteries — vessels without an alternative blood supply — making the affected brain tissue especially vulnerable to rapid brain tissue damage when blocked.

“This fits in with our observation that we are seeing a much more dramatic effect of time in these middle artery occlusions than in large vessel occlusion strokes, and the need for speed becomes much more important,” he said.

Hill said that, in light of these findings, he has begun using an endovascular approach in patients who present early — and are already seeing positive results.

The ESCAPE-MeVo investigators also found that collateral flow seems to play a role and that patients with good collateral circulation in the affected brain region were more likely to benefit from endovascular treatment.

“This finding was much less robust than the time results, but it follows the same line of thinking. It makes sense that patients with evidence of collateral flow in the affected area would benefit more, as the collateral flow would give us more time to get the occluded artery open. These patients are the lucky ones who have got an appropriate circulation, which allows more time for us to act,” said Hill.

The DISTAL trial enrolled 543 patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by isolated occlusions of medium or distal vessels. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either endovascular therapy or best medical treatment alone within 24 hours of symptom onset or last known well, provided that neuroimaging indicated salvageable brain tissue.

The primary outcome — disability level at 90 days, assessed by the mRS — did not differ significantly between the groups. The common odds ratio for improvement on the mRS was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.67–1.22; P = .50).

The latest imaging data from the DISTAL study were presented at the ESOC meeting by Aikaterini Anastasiou, MD, of University Hospital Basel.

This preplanned analysis focused on the proportion of patients who retained more than 80% of the brain tissue at risk at 24 hours. Among the 447 patients with advanced imaging data available, 209 met this endpoint.

Patients who received endovascular treatment were more likely to achieve this favorable imaging outcome — 52.6% compared with 40.7% in the best medical therapy group — corresponding to an adjusted odds ratio of 1.57 (P = .023). This imaging outcome was also associated with better clinical results in both treatment groups.

Psychogios told Medscape Medical News that the mRS may not be the most appropriate tool for assessing clinical outcomes in patients with distal occlusion stroke, as these strokes generally result in less severe functional deficits compared to large vessel strokes.

“It is difficult to show a treatment benefit on the mRS scale in these patients, but looking at what is happening in the brain with imaging is a proven endpoint and is highly relevant for patients,” he said.

Psychogios noted that the DISTAL investigators are currently conducting a more detailed analysis of the imaging data to better identify patients who are most likely to benefit from endovascular therapy.

They believe they have found such a subgroup — patients with higher baseline clinical deficits (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale/Score > 6) and larger stroke volumes on initial imaging (> 60 mL of at-risk brain tissue on perfusion scans).

Investigators from both trials are now collaborating to refine these findings and further define the patient population that could benefit from endovascular treatment.

“Together, the two presentations give more hope that with better patient selection we will be able to show that endovascular therapy can help this some patients with distal or middle artery occlusion strokes,” said Psychogios.

“In the initial trials I think we were probably too broad in our inclusion criteria, and we showed that this is not a technique that should be applied to this broad patient population. But still there seems to be a group that can profit from the endovascular approach,” he added.

Hill noted that two additional trials in patients with distal or medium artery occlusions — one from France and one from China — are expected to report results later this year.

“So, we are planning to put the data from all four trials together to give us more information on how to go forward with finding the right subgroup of patients with distal/middle artery occlusions who could benefit from endovascular therapy.”

Peter Kelly, MD, a neurology professor at University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, who was not involved in the studies, said the results are noteworthy. He highlighted that the ESCAPE-MeVo data emphasized the critical role of early intervention, whereas the DISTAL findings suggested that patients with more severe strokes may benefit. Together, the results pointed to the potential value of a more targeted approach to endovascular therapy in this population — an idea that warranted further investigation in future trials, he said.

The DISTAL trial was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Gottfried and Julia Bangerter-Rhyner-Stiftung, Medtronic, Stryker Neurovascular, Phenox, Rapid Medical, and Penumbra. The ESCAPE-MeVO trial was supported by grants from the University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada; the Canadian Institutes for Health Research; and Medtronic.

Psychogios reported receiving grants/speaker fees from Stryker Neurovascular, Medtronic, Phenox, Penumbra, Rapid Medical, and Acandis. Hill reported receiving grants from Medtronic for the ESCAPE-MeVO trial.

A new global review reveals how rapidly evolving H5 bird flu viruses are reaching new species, including dairy cattle, and stresses the urgent need for coordinated action to prevent the next pandemic.

Since its discovery in 1996, the Gs/Gd lineage of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses with H5 haemagglutinin, including H5N1 and other H5Nx subtypes, has caused widespread infections and mortality among numerous animal species and sporadic infections among humans, with outbreaks now reaching every continent, even Antarctica.

In a recent review published in the journal Nature Reviews Microbiology, researchers at the Department of Viroscience, Erasmus MC, the Netherlands, reviewed the current knowledge on the evolution, global spread, and growing risks posed by this persistent and adaptable virus.

Influenza A viruses have caused four human pandemics and countless outbreaks among animal populations in the past century. Among them, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) pose a major threat due to their ability to evolve rapidly. While most avian influenza viruses circulate harmlessly among wild waterbirds, some have mutated into more deadly forms, particularly the H5 and H7 subtypes. When these viruses spill over to poultry, they can evolve into highly pathogenic forms that cause severe disease and death.

The Gs/Gd lineage of H5 viruses, which includes the well-known H5N1 subtype (first identified in humans in Hong Kong in 1997) and other H5Nx variants, emerged from a complex mix of avian viruses and has since diversified into numerous lineages. This lineage has become a dominant global threat, spreading across continents and infecting a wide range of birds and mammals. Furthermore, despite ongoing surveillance and control efforts, gaps remain in understanding how this virus spreads, evolves, and adapts to new hosts, including humans.

The researchers conducted a comprehensive review of scientific literature, surveillance reports, and genetic analyses to understand the evolution and spread of highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza viruses of the Gs/Gd lineage. They traced the virus's origins back to a 1996 outbreak in domestic geese in Guangdong, China, and followed its genetic diversification through global outbreaks over the past 25 years.

The team examined how the virus has changed through a process known as reassortment, where gene segments from different influenza viruses mix in co-infected hosts, creating new virus variants. They focused on outbreaks in wild birds, poultry, and mammals, including tigers, sea lions, mink, and dairy cattle.

The study also analyzed how the virus crosses species barriers. This included reviewing molecular data on mutations in viral proteins, including hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and polymerase components, that help the virus adapt to mammalian cells. Structural features of hemagglutinin that affect binding to host receptors, as well as changes in viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase that enhance replication in mammals, were examined. Additionally, the study investigated the immune responses in different species and how the virus evades these defenses.

To assess the impact on human health, the authors also reviewed data on confirmed human infections, exposure risks, and clinical symptoms, considered the role of environmental and agricultural practices in facilitating the spread of the virus, and examined current control measures like culling, vaccination, and surveillance.

The study reported that the H5 viruses from the Gs/Gd lineage have undergone significant genetic evolution, enabling them to infect a wider range of species and persist globally. The virus, which originally circulated in poultry, has now spread to wild birds and mammals, including rare spillovers into humans.

Most alarmingly, it has recently reached dairy cattle in the United States, where it has spread primarily due to the movement of infected animals between farms. Contaminated milking equipment facilitates transmission within farms and causes widespread infections. The virus has now been detected on every continent, including Antarctica, marking an unprecedented expansion.

Its ability to reassort with other influenza viruses has also generated multiple variants, including those with new gene combinations that enhance adaptation to mammals. This genetic mixing has also improved the virus's ability to bind to human-like receptors and resist mammals' innate immune defenses.

Since 1997, there have been over 1,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of Gs/Gd lineage infections in humans, with more than 500 reported deaths; however, the true case fatality rate is uncertain due to likely underreporting of mild and subclinical infections and variability in severity between outbreaks. Most infections occurred after direct contact with infected poultry, but recent cases in the U.S. involving dairy farm workers suggested new transmission routes. Though sustained human-to-human transmission has not occurred, the increase in mild or undetected human infections raises concerns about pandemic potential.

The virus has also had devastating impacts on wildlife, with high mortality among sea lions, seals, and birds being documented across the Americas and Europe. Mammal-to-mammal transmission, especially in farmed mink and sea lion colonies, also indicates that the virus may be evolving toward more efficient spread among mammals.

The review highlights that available options for managing outbreaks in wildlife are limited and may include carcass removal and targeted vaccination of endangered species.

The ongoing spread and evolution of the Gs/Gd H5 lineage viruses, including H5N1 and other H5Nx subtypes, emphasize the serious threat these influenza viruses pose to animals, ecosystems, and human health. With increasing evidence of cross-species transmission and global distribution, this virus remains a looming concern.

The review highlights the critical need for a unified “One Health” approach that integrates animal, human, and environmental health strategies at a global level. The review indicated that strengthening surveillance, advancing vaccine strategies, expanding the use of newer vaccine technologies, coordinating international vaccine stockpiling and deployment, and integrating efforts across animal and human health sectors are crucial steps towards preventing future outbreaks and reducing the risk of a potential pandemic.

Lung Squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) represents the second most common non-small cell lung cancer. Although studies identified adenocarcinoma-like driver mutations in LSCC using next-generation sequencing (NGS), the disease is challenging to treat due to the limited number of detectable mutations for targeted drug therapy. This study aimed to evaluate the mutation profiles of LSCC detected by NGS to assess the relationships between different driver mutations and clinicopathological parameters.

NGS with a panel of 72 cancer-related genes was used to evaluate the driver mutation profiles of 41 lung resection specimens from patients with LSCC at the Molecular Pathology Laboratory of Aydın Adnan Menderes University in Türkiye. Clinical and histopathological features were recorded for analysis.

Detection of 94 mutations in 23 genes in DNA extracted from the tissue samples of 36 patients revealed that the most prevalent mutations were TP53 (30.85%), NF1 (20.20%), PTEN (11.70%), PIK3CA (5.31%), FBXW7 (4.25%), KRAS (3.20%), respectively. We identified statistically significant relationships between PIK3CA and lower mean age (p = 0.007) and between PTEN and mild inflammatory reaction (p = 0.004). PTEN was associated with central localization (p = 0.13), NF1 with visceral pleural involvement (p = 0.09), and PIK3CA with severe inflammatory reaction (p = 0.053), as well as with advanced pathological T stage (p = 0.09) and pathological N stage (p = 0.057) according to the TNM staging system.

In the era of personalized medicine, treatment for LSCC lags behind that for LADC, but new developments in this field. Careful selection of therapeutic targets is essential, as grouping multiple alterations together may lead to the oversight of true driver mutations. Similarly, drug selection and potential combinations will play a crucial role In treatment efficacy. Promising studies, including ours, will enhance understanding of the clinical relevance of suspected driver mutations. Our study identified novel mutations and their relationships, such as NF1, PTEN, and PIK3CA, which have not been previously reported in LSCC and may have significant therapeutic and prognostic implications. Given the molecular heterogeneity observed in LSCC, it is imperative to ascertain the mutational profile in all LSCC patients to identify driver mutations that are amenable to targeted therapy. Our data suggest that certain histopathological features may be associated with mutations, providing reliable information to enhance treatment and follow-up decisions.

KRAS mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in cancer and are considered particularly difficult to treat. In colon cancer, the second most common cause of cancer death, such mutations severely limit therapeutic options. The results of a study led by the Center for Cancer Research at the Medical University of Vienna, recently published in the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine, now raise a previously little-considered strategy: the targeted blockade of the EGFR signaling pathway - even in the presence of a KRAS mutation. This could make KRAS-mutated colon cancer more treatable than previously thought.

Our results show that EGFR, a receptor on the cell surface of many cells, also plays an active role in KRAS-mutated colorectal tumours - and in a different way than previously thought. This finding contradicts the long-held assumption that this receptor has no therapeutic relevance in tumors with a KRAS mutation.""

Dana Krauβ, first author, Center for Cancer Research at the Medical University of Vienna and Comprehensive Cancer Center Vienna of MedUni Vienna and University Hospital Vienna

Using so-called tumor organoids - mini-tumours made from colon cancer cells isolated from specific mouse models - the research team was able to demonstrate that the removal of EGFR has a profound effect on the metabolism of cancer cells. The cells processed sugar and amino acids in a completely different way - an indication of new vulnerabilities in KRAS-mutated tumours. In addition, EGFR blockade activated a specific gene signature associated with longer survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with KRAS mutations.

EGFR was previously considered an ineffective therapeutic target in KRAS-mutated tumours. However, metabolic analyses have now shown that EGFR blockade in colorectal organoids slows down sugar metabolism (glycolysis) and causes tumour cells to switch to glutamine instead - a fundamental change in cell metabolism. At the same time, key growth signalling pathways were significantly weakened. Also surprising was the observed reduction in cell size and the activation of stem cell signatures and the Wnt signaling pathway known to be involved in CRC development - an indication that the tumor cells respond to EGFR blockade with an alternative developmental program. The Smoc2 gene was discovered to play a key role in these processes: it is responsible for rewiring the cell metabolism and for activating new signalling networks. By analysing extensive patient data sets, the researchers were also able to show that the identified gene signature is associated with better survival in patients with KRAS-mutated CRC.

These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for why EGFR also plays a role in KRAS-mutated tumours - and call into question the current practice of excluding such patients from EGFR-targeted therapies. At the same time, they strengthen the approach of developing combination therapies that block both EGFR and KRAS in the future. Although clinical trials are still pending, the data show that KRAS-mutated CRC may be more treatable than previously thought. ""This research shows how important it is to critically question assumptions - especially in diseases for which there are currently few effective therapies,"" emphasizes study leader Maria Sibilia, Head of the Center for Cancer Research at MedUni Vienna.

Neuropathy, a disorder in which damage to nerves can impair sensation and movement, has many causes, including infection. Now, researchers from the UK have identified distinct genetic changes in a newly-discovered neuropathy and believe that their work will provide insights into the causal mechanism and why some previously healthy people develop neuropathies after infection whereas others do not.

Dr. Rob Harkness, a postdoctoral research Fellow at the University of Manchester, Manchester, UK, will tell the annual conference of the European Society of Human Genetics today (Monday) how the researchers were alerted to the case of a child in intensive care who had been fit and well until seven months old. Following a mild fever and rash she became very floppy and weak, needed help with her breathing and died before reaching her first birthday. A similar pattern had affected two of her elder brothers.

""At that point we undertook a genetic discovery study. We identified a change in a gene that we thought was likely to be the cause but it wasn't until around ten years later that we identified a second affected family with changes in the same gene with a similar clinical history – rapid neuropathy following a mild infection. Now we know of 12 affected families with changes in this gene,"" says Dr. Harkness.

The physical effects caused by changes in this gene are similar to those seen in patients with the neuropathy called Guillain-Barré syndrome, which can also be triggered by infections including Epstein-Barr virus and the bacterium campylobacter. The condition can start in people who are completely healthy and cause them to develop weakness of the legs that can spread to the whole body, including affecting their breathing.

We hope that our discovery will provide insights into the mechanisms that cause the problem. The experiments we have undertaken on cells from patients show similar features to those seen in motor neurone disease (MND), and we may be able to use knowledge gained in research on MND to help patients affected by this newly-defined condition, and vice versa. Unfortunately, there are currently no effective prevention strategies for such neuropathies, but our greater understanding of the causes of these conditions will be the first step towards developing treatments.""

Dr. Rob Harkness, postdoctoral research Fellow, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK

The new results allow a rapid, accurate diagnosis rather than numerous lengthy and expensive investigations. They will already permit preconception testing of individuals at risk of having an affected child so that this can inform their future reproductive choices. Since the researchers began to publicise their work, more families across the world have been identified, leading them to believe that the rare condition is more common than they originally believed. They are continuing their work by making nerves from skin cells donated by affected people, allowing them to understand why this disorder affects the nervous system specifically, and to test potential treatments. ""We are also mirroring these studies using fruit flies,"" says Dr. Harkness.

""Our hypothesis that there would be a change to a single gene responsible for this particular neuropathy was correct. However, we could not predict which gene it would be and what its role was. Now we know that the gene we identified is vital in controlling how proteins and nucleic acids move between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm, the gelatinous liquid filling the inside of the cell. This movement is very sensitively controlled and extremely susceptible to stress, temperature and infection in patients with this condition, and when it affects the nerves, they cannot be repaired.""

Chair of the conference Professor Alexandre Reymond said: ""This is a textbook example of gene-environment interaction. All of us carry on our respective genomes small alterations (genetic variants) that put us at risk of environmental changes, in this case specific infections.""

Drinking more alcohol, especially beer or liquor, modestly raises your risk of pancreatic cancer, according to one of the world's largest and most comprehensive studies.

Study: Alcohol intake and pancreatic cancer risk: An analysis from 30 prospective studies across Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Image Credit: crystal light / Shutterstock

The analysis of a large-scale dataset derived from four continents identified a modest positive association between alcohol intake and pancreatic cancer risk. The findings are published in PLOS Medicine.

Pancreatic cancer is the 12th most common cancer worldwide, associated with a high mortality rate when diagnosed at advanced stages. It accounted for 5% of all cancer-related deaths worldwide in 2022.

The incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer are 4-5 times higher in Europe, North America, Australia, and Eastern Asia compared to other regions. Smoking, obesity, chronic pancreatitis, and diabetes mellitus are some of the major risk factors for pancreatic cancer.

Evidence linking alcohol intake to pancreatic cancer risk remains inconclusive, despite the classification of alcohol as a group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

A previous analysis of large-scale observational data from 14 cohorts in the Pooling Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer showed that the risk of pancreatic cancer can increase by 22% in individuals who consume at least 30 grams of alcohol per day, which is equivalent to two US standard alcoholic drinks per day. However, the majority of existing studies showed inconsistent associations by type of alcoholic drinks and across geographical regions.

The current study aimed to extend the prior analysis in the Pooling Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer to more conclusively understand the association between alcohol intake and risk of pancreatic cancer.

The study analyzed population-based, individual-level data from 30 prospective studies across four continents: Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. The pooled dataset included a total of 2,494,432 participants without cancer at baseline.

In analyzed studies, self-reported information on alcohol intake (in grams of ethanol per day) was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire or a lifestyle questionnaire. The first primary incident of pancreatic cancer cases were determined by self-report with subsequent medical record review, cancer registry linkage, or both approaches.

The analysis of pooled data identified a total of 10,067 incident pancreatic cancer cases during the follow-up period of 15 years. A significant positive association was observed between alcohol intake and pancreatic cancer risk.

Overall, a 3% increased risk of pancreatic cancer was observed with a 10-gram per day increment of alcohol intake. No significant impact of participants' gender or smoking status was found on the observed association.

The reference group for risk comparison was light drinkers (0.1 to less than 5 grams per day), not absolute non-drinkers, to reduce bias from former drinkers.

The analysis adjusted for a range of confounders, including detailed smoking variables (status, duration, intensity, and cessation), diabetes, body mass index, physical activity, education, and race/ethnicity.

Among the analyzed geographical regions, the positive association between alcohol intake and pancreatic cancer risk was observed in Europe, Australia, and North America. However, in Asia, this association was not present. This could be because of the low prevalence of alcohol drinkers in Asian cohorts (38% vs. 70% overall), the underrepresentation of Asian participants (8% of the study population), and genetic factors influencing alcohol metabolism.

Among tested alcoholic drinks, beer and liquor were identified as significant risk factors for pancreatic cancer. However, no significant association was observed between drinking alcohol from wine and the risk of pancreatic cancer.

The study reveals that intake of alcohol, especially beer and liquor, moderately increases the risk of pancreatic cancer in both men and women, irrespective of previous or current smoking habits.

The study mentions explicitly that compared to light drinkers (drinking 0.1 to 5 grams per day), men who consume at least 30 grams of alcohol per day and women who consume at least 15 grams of alcohol per day are at higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer. A stronger association has been observed for alcohol intake of 60 grams per day or more. For women, risk categories were combined for those consuming 30 grams per day or more due to limited numbers at the highest intake levels.

Alcohol metabolism is controlled by two enzymes: alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. The efficiency of the alcohol metabolic process depends on the variants of the genes that encode these enzymes.

Asian populations have a higher prevalence of genes encoding for the fast alcohol dehydrogenase metabolizer and slow aldehyde dehydrogenase metabolizer than Whites. These genotypes cause the accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood. Asian people who carry these genotypes experience flushing reactions in response to alcohol ingestion and tend to either avoid or drink less alcohol. This explains the observation that alcohol intake is not associated with higher pancreatic cancer risk among Asians.

Alcohol as a carcinogen can trigger inflammation, oxidative stress, free radical production, microbiota dysbiosis, and DNA damage. These processes can cause pancreatic cell damage and pancreatic fibrosis, which in turn can increase the risk of pancreatic cancer development.

Notably, the study finds that previous or current smoking habits do not influence the negative impact of alcohol intake on pancreatic cancer risk. This observation does not refute the well-established impact of smoking on pancreatic cancer risk, but rather suggests that the effect of alcohol on pancreatic carcinogenesis is independent of smoking habit.

The study analyzed a single timepoint data on participants' alcohol intake during mid-to-late adulthood and included a limited number of Asian cohorts. The researchers highlight the need for future studies to examine the impact of lifetime alcohol intake on pancreatic cancer risk as well as the impact of specific drinking patterns, including binge drinking.

Climate change and extreme weather events are threatening the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of young adolescents in Kenya, according to a new study published earlier this month in BMJ Global Health. The study reveals that food, water, and sanitation insecurities are placing young adolescents aged 10-14, especially girls, at increased risk of school dropout, transactional sex, gender-based violence, and early pregnancy.

Climate change isn't just an environmental issue, it's an urgent public health emergency for young adolescents. In our study, we heard stories from young adolescents and community elders describing how drought, floods, and resource shortages are pushing children to drop out of school or exchange sex for food, water, or menstrual products.""

Dr. Carmen Logie, Lead Author, Professor at the University of Toronto's Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work (FIFSW) and Canada Research Chair in Global Health Equity and Social Justice with Marginalized Populations

The study involved 297 participants, including 119 elders and 178 young adolescents across six climate-affected regions in Kenya: Mathare, Kisumu, Isiolo, Naivasha, Kilifi, and Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement. Researchers from the University of Toronto collaborated with two Kenyan community-based organizations, the Centre for the Study of Adolescence and Elim Trust. Using focus groups, walk-along interviews, and participatory mapping workshops, the study examined how climate change-induced resource insecurities are shaping SRH risks among youth.

""Girls told us about the shame of not having clean clothes or menstrual supplies, and how it led them to stay home from school or enter exploitative relationships just to meet basic needs,"" says co-author Aryssa Hasham, Research Officer at FIFSW. ""These are not isolated incidents. They're part of broader, gendered systems of vulnerability and disadvantage that have been exacerbated by climate change.""

The study identified multiple direct and indirect pathways linking extreme weather events to poor SRH outcomes. Droughts and floods disrupted food systems, contributing to school dropout, street involvement and homelessness, and sexual exploitation. Water shortages were linked to educational disruptions and exposed girls to harassment and violence at collection sites. Lack of access to safe sanitation contributed to menstruation-related school absences and coercive sexual encounters in exchange for menstrual supplies.

The authors call for climate-informed SRH interventions tailored to the realities of young adolescents in low-resource, high-risk settings. Their findings offer a roadmap for policy makers, NGOs, and health systems working at the intersection of environmental justice and adolescent health.

""We must act quickly to develop climate-informed, adolescent-centred, and gender-transformative programs,"" says co-author Dr. Julia Kagunda, Director of Elim Trust. ""These programs must address the root causes of insecurity to protect young people's health and futures.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New therapy shows promise for young children exposed to trauma","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250526/New-therapy-shows-promise-for-young-children-exposed-to-trauma.aspx","Mon, 26 May 2025 13:20:00 GMT","

Young children who are exposed to trauma rarely receive the help they need, partly because there are no suitable methods targeting this age group in Sweden. However, new research from Karlstad University now points to a method that works.

""It feels good to contribute to making a difference for vulnerable children who currently fall through the cracks,"" says Anna Norlén.

""Many who work with children and adolescents, such as professionals in child and adolescent psychiatry and social services, do the best they can to achieve results. However, the methods we've been using in Sweden so far haven't been very effective. What we have here is a method that evidently works,"" says Anna Norlén.

The method tested by Anna Norlén in her research is called CPP, Child-Parent Psychotherapy, and is designed for children under the age of six. It has been used with good results in other parts of the world, such as the US. In her doctoral thesis, Anna Norlén shows that the method also works well in a Swedish clinical context.

Arriving at this conclusion has been a long journey. As a first step, staff received training in the method. Next, children and parents participated in the trauma treatment, after which Anna Norlén was able to evaluate how effective the treatment was.

In the study, assessments were made to evaluate the emotional well-being of the child and their caregiver, usually a parent, before and after the treatment. The study also included a follow-up evaluation six months after the treatment ended. And the results were positive. The method works and leads to lasting improvement for both children and adults, explains Anna Norlén.

Often, parents have shared in the child's trauma in some way, for example, in cases of an accident, war and displacement, or the loss of a loved one, and we found that both the child and caregiver experienced positive outcomes after CPP. Trauma symptoms decreased and the relationship between the child and the caregiver was strengthened.""

Anna Norlén, Karlstad University

CPP is based on the therapist working with both the child and the caregiver. A lot of focus is placed on play, always from the child's perspective.

""Play is a form of communication, and through play, adults are given opportunities to connect with their children and process what they've been through,"" says Anna Norlén.

She emphasises that the study now being published is relatively small and should be seen as a first step. But her hope is that it will help spread awareness of CPP more broadly in Sweden.

In biology, enzymes have evolved over millions of years to drive chemical reactions. Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization (MPI-DS) now derived universal rules to enable the de novo design of optimal enzymes. As an example, they considered the enzymatic reaction of breaking a dimer into two monomer molecules. Considering the geometry of such an enzyme-substrate-complex, they identified three golden rules that should be considered to build a functional enzyme.

First, the interface of both enzyme and molecule should be located at their respective smaller end. This way, a strong coupling between both of them can be achieved. For the same reason, the conformational change in the enzyme should not be smaller than in the reaction. Finally, the conformational change of the enzyme has to take place fast enough to maximize the chemical driving force of the reaction.

""We built our research on two main pillars,"" Ramin Golestanian, director of MPI-DS describes the approach. ""Conservation of momentum and coupling between the reaction coordinates,"" he continues. Thus, the researchers expanded the view of a classical 2-dimensional reaction coordinate. Typically, models for enzymatic reactions define an energy barrier that has to be overcome in order for the reaction to take place. 

As in our model we also consider the enzyme dynamics and coupling, we go beyond this existing concept, considering two reaction coordinates. Instead of overcoming an energy barrier, one can now imagine alternative ways to bypass it by taking alternative routes.""

These results provide a new basis for the design of molecular machines, avoiding the tedious and technically challenging approach to simulate the dynamics of each atom individually.

A recent study published in Engineering delves into the advancements in wound management, specifically focusing on microenvironment-sensitive bioactive dressings for diabetic wounds. Diabetic wounds (DWs) are a major complication of diabetes mellitus. With the global diabetic population on the rise, the number of people at risk of developing DWs is also increasing. The lifetime risk of developing DWs for diabetics ranges from 19% to 34%, and the recurrence rate is high, posing a significant challenge to patient health.

The healing process of DWs is complex and differs from that of acute wounds. In the hemostasis phase, patients with diabetes often experience abnormal platelet aggregation and fibrin network formation. The inflammatory phase is prolonged due to impaired immune cell function, imbalance of inflammatory mediators, enhanced oxidative stress, microvascular complications, and an increased risk of secondary infections. During the proliferation phase, the normal function of cells like keratinocytes and fibroblasts is impaired, and in the remodeling phase, the quality of collagen deposition is poor, making the wound vulnerable to recurrence.

The microenvironment of DWs is characterized by high glucose levels, persistent inflammation, persistent infection, hypoxia, disordered factors, and dynamic pH disruption. High glucose promotes the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which not only extend the inflammatory response but also affect the migration and proliferation of key healing cells. Persistent inflammation is caused by factors such as excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and imbalanced macrophage polarization. Persistent infection, often due to the formation of biofilms, is difficult to treat. Hypoxia impairs the functionality of cellular populations and angiogenesis. Disordered factors, including the over-accumulation of AGEs, ROS, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), disrupt the normal wound-healing process. The pH of DWs is often alkaline, which promotes bacterial growth.

To address these challenges, researchers have developed microenvironment-sensitive bioactive dressings with on-demand regulation. These dressings can be classified into passive and active on-demand management strategies. Passive on-demand management includes glucose-sensitive management (using materials like concanavalin A (Con A), glucose oxidase (GOx), and phenylboronic acid (PBA) derivatives), pH-sensitive management (adjusting drug release based on pH changes), antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and anti-infection management (scavenging ROS, inhibiting bacteria, and reducing inflammation), factors-sensitive management (targeting AGEs and MMPs), and temperature- and moisture-sensitive management (responding to temperature and moisture changes). Active on-demand management strategies involve ultrasound-sensitive management (triggering drug release with ultrasound), magnetic-sensitive management (using magnetic fields for therapy), and light-sensitive management (utilizing photocatalytic and photothermal technologies).

However, the clinical application of bioactive dressings still faces challenges. The biosafety of innovative materials needs to be rigorously analyzed, and they must comply with regulatory standards. Different dressings may require different Food and Drug Administration approval pathways, depending on their characteristics. Future research should focus on smart response mechanisms, delivery system construction, biocompatibility, mechanical property optimization, integration of sensors, and multifunctional design to further improve the efficacy of these dressings in treating diabetic wounds.

Males are more than four times more likely to receive an autism diagnosis than females. But a new study by researchers at UC San Diego School of Medicine has found no clinical differences in autistic traits between the sexes in toddlers when they are first diagnosed with autism. The study was published in Nature Human Behavior on May 26, 2025. The findings have potential implications for early diagnosis and intervention for autistic children.

Between 2002 and 2022, the researchers assessed more than 2,500 male and female toddlers between 12 and 48 months of age. Of these toddlers, 1,500 were autistic, 600 were typically-developing, and 475 were developmentally delayed. The assessments included 19 different measures of language development, social and motor skills, core autism traits such as repetitive behaviors, cognitive skills, and other developmental characteristics. The study also examined social attention using eye tracking technology. All assessments were conducted at a single site - the UC San Diego Autism Center of Excellence - by licensed clinical psychologists.

The researchers found:

A number of previous studies with fewer than 100 participants each have shown differences between the sexes in autistic toddlers. However, the current study is the largest and most comprehensive of its kind to date, and one of very few studies to assess children with autism at a very early age, according to senior author Karen Pierce, Ph.D., professor of neurosciences and  director of the Autism Center of Excellence at UC San Diego School of Medicine.

There is no consensus in the field about whether females are more or less impacted than males, and that is probably because there haven't been really large-scale studies at the earliest ages.  Based on previous small studies, we had anticipated there would be some sex differences. So we were a little bit surprised to find nothing at all.""

Karen Pierce, Ph.D., professor of neurosciences and director of the Autism Center of Excellence at UC San Diego School of Medicine

The researchers did, however, find sex differences between typically developing female and male toddlers, with females performing at significantly higher levels than males on more than half of the tests, especially those measuring social skills, language development, and daily living skills.

""This is consistent with the literature; female toddlers seem to develop slightly faster than males in terms of their language ability and their social ability and how well they perform daily living skills - adaptive things for a two-year-old,"" said Pierce. ""Typically developing females are accelerated in their development relative to males.""

Pierce says the findings for autistic children of no clinical differences between males and females at the time of first onset of autism lead to two possible conclusions.

""One is that previous studies that report sex differences are wrong, perhaps due to small sample size, sampling bias, limited study measures, or other methodological issues,"" she said. ""An alternative conclusion is that sex differences do not exist at the time of first onset, but instead emerge slowly at later ages, driven by psychosocial factors like socialization or differences in biology that may unfold across development.""

To examine this alternative possibility, a high-quality, large-scale study that tracks autistic children from toddlerhood through school age and beyond would be required, according to Pierce.​

Autism is highly heritable, and Pierce says the findings have implications for understanding the development of the condition, enhancing early detection, and improving early intervention. Because the study found that toddlers with autism clustered into scientifically robust subtypes within the autism spectrum rather than by sex, she thinks it may be preferable to focus on these differences instead when seeking to understand clinical heterogeneity and the most appropriate interventions for each subtype, for example.

Emma Hayes's side will take on the People's Republic of China and Jamaica in the latest international break. 

The United States Women's National Soccer Team (USWNT) return to action this week, with two friendlies on their horizon for the latest instalment of international football.

Emma Hayes's side will face the People's Republic of China, before turning their attention to Jamaica next week.

‘Triple Espresso' remain absent from the roster, with Sophia Wilson and Mallory Swanson out through pregnancy, while Trinity Rodman is continuing to work back from an injury.

Noami Girma is a highly anticipated returnee, while Kansas City Current midfielder Lo'eau LaBonta earns a first call up to the senior squad. Should the latter feature in any of the friendlies, she will become the oldest USWNT debutant in the program's 40-year history.

“Everyone always earns their call-ups but there are some much-deserved call-ups in this camp for players who have shown consistency in league play,” Hayes said.

“We have two different types of opponents ahead of us, so we'll have to be creative in breaking down those teams in different ways.

“As has been one of our focuses this year, this camp and the following camp are going to be two amazing opportunities to develop squad depth.”

Below is a selection of the notable performances and moments from the 15 matches played on the 15th matchday of the 2025 MLS regular season on Saturday, May 24 and Sunday, May 25.  

Highlights of the matchday included:

Orlando City SC continued its league-best hot streak on Saturday night, as forward Duncan McGuire scored the game's lone goal (Watch Here) in a 1-0 victory over the Portland Timbers. The win extended Orlando's unbeaten run to 12 matches, matching the club-record set from August 26 to October 18, 2020. Orlando (27 points, 7-2-6) sits in fourth place in the Eastern Conference standings through Matchday 15 and is just four points off the Vancouver Whitecaps for the Supporters' Shield lead.  

With the win, the Lions became the first team with a single-season unbeaten streak of 12-or-more matches since Real Salt Lake's 15-game run in 2024 (March 23 to June 19) and became just the fourth team to record an unbeaten run of 12-plus games over the last five seasons.  

The club will look to set the team-best undefeated streak on Wednesday night as they face off against rival Atlanta United at Mercedes-Benz Stadium (7:30 p.m. ET, MLS Season Pass on Apple TV).

After conceding two goals in the first five minutes of the match, Vancouver Whitecaps FC roared back behind a brace from Brian White to defeat Real Salt Lake, 3-2, at America First Field on Saturday (Watch Highlights of His Performance Here). With the win, the Whitecaps (31 points, 9-1-4) returned to the top of the Supporters' Shield standings and extended its unbeaten run to nine matches in league play, dating back to March 29.  

With a pair of goals, White became the second player to reach 10 goals this season, joining Philadelphia's Tai Baribo (13). White has four seasons with at least 10 goals with the Whitecaps (2021, 2023, 2024, 2025), the most in club history, and no other Vancouver player has recorded more than two such seasons. With his first score, White also became the ninth active player to reach 70 career goals and the third player to reach the mark this year, joining Nashville's Hany Mukhtar and Columbus' Diego Rossi.  

Vancouver welcomes Minnesota United FC to BC Place on Wednesday (10:30 p.m. ET, MLS Season Pass on Apple TV) in their final league match before the CONCACAF Champions Cup Final against Cruz Azul on Sunday, June 1 (9 p.m. ET).

After building a 2-0 first-half lead, the Philadelphia Union traded second-half blows with Inter Miami CF as four goals were scored in the final 35 minutes of action in a 3-3 draw at Subaru Park. Golden Boot presented by Audi leader Tai Baribo recorded a brace for the Union, while Lionel Messi added a goal and an assist in the 87' and 90'+5', respectively, for Miami.  

Fresh off of his first USMNT call-up, midfielder Quinn Sullivan opened the scoring for the Union in the seventh minute (Watch Here), before Baribo scored his first of two goals just before the half (44', Watch Here). Tadeo Allende pulled one back for the Herons in the 60th minute to draw within one (Watch Here) before Baribo completed his brace in the 73rd minute (Watch Here).  

With his pair of scores, Baribo (13 goals) became the fourth player in MLS history to score at least 13 goals in his team's first 15 games of a season, joining Carlos Vela (15 in 2019), Chicho Arango (13 in 2024), & Josef Martínez (13 in 2018). Martínez and Vela both won Landon Donovan MLS MVP in their respective seasons.

Behind the late-game heroics of Messi, including a sensational free-kick score (87', Watch Here), and Telasco Segovia (90'+5', Watch Here), Inter Miami CF overcame a two-goal deficit in the 85th minute or later to earn a point for the first time in club history and became the first MLS team to do so since 2023.  

The Union will look to keep its seven-match unbeaten streak alive against Toronto FC on Wednesday night (7:30 p.m. ET, MLS Season Pass on Apple TV / Apple TV+) before traveling to Texas to take on FC Dallas on Saturday night (8:30 p.m. ET, MLS Season Pass on Apple TV).  

Inter Miami returns to action on Wednesday against CF Montréal (7:30 p.m. ET, MLS Season Pass on Apple TV) before a weekend showdown against the Columbus Crew (7:30 p.m. ET, MLS Season Pass on Apple TV / Apple TV+).

United States Men's National Team forward Patrick Agyemang scored twice (Watch Here) and Pep Biel added a goal (Watch Here), as Charlotte FC ended the Columbus Crew's 11-match road unbeaten run with a 3-2 victory at Bank of America Stadium on Saturday. With the win, Charlotte (22 points, 7-7-1) snapped a five-game losing streak and moved to eighth in the Eastern Conference table.  

Agyemang recorded his first multi-goal game of the year and the second of his Charlotte career, as he became the second player in club history to record at least two multi-goal games, joining Karol Świderski (six games). The 24-year-old striker has 16 career goals in 57 matches for Charlotte and trails only Świderski (28 goals) on the club's all-time scoring leaderboard.  

Charlotte embarks on a five-game road swing beginning on Wednesday night against the New York Red Bulls at Sports Illustrated Stadium (7:30 p.m. ET, MLS Season Pass on Apple TV).

On the back of an 86th minute penalty-kick goal by Albert Rusnák (Watch Here), Seattle Sounders FC notched a 1-0 win over FC Dallas on Saturday afternoon, marking the club's third win in its last five matches. The Sounders (23 points, 6-4-5) climbed to fifth place in the Western Conference table and have taken 17 points across its last eight matches.  

With his goal, Rusnák became the second player in MLS history to record at least 25 goals and 25 assists with multiple clubs, joining Steve Ralston, who accomplished the feat with the Tampa Bay Mutiny (34 goals, 62 assists) and the New England Revolution (42 goals, 73 assists). Rusnák has totaled 25 goals and 25 assists across 110 games for the Sounders from 2022-25 and had 41 goals and 39 assists in five seasons with Real Salt Lake from 2017-21.  

Seattle will host expansion side San Diego FC on Wednesday night (8:30 p.m. ET, MLS Season Pass on Apple TV), before a Sunday night matchup against Minnesota United FC (6 p.m. ET, MLS Season Pass on Apple TV / Apple TV+).

The latest United States men's national team pre-Gold Cup roster features notable absences and has left much of the American soccer world baffled, as Mauricio Pochettino's team misses out on a major opportunity to build chemistry and momentum ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Mauricio Pochettino's pre-Gold Cup squad has certainly raised eyebrows.

Although the once prestigious tournament has lost its luster in recent years, the 2025 edition of the Gold Cup presents a set of larger implications, particularly for the United States men's national team. First, it's a redemption opportunity for what was a massively disappointing 2025 USMNT Nations League campaign, losing to Panama in the semis and Canada in the third-place match. The U.S. put up paltry efforts in both games in front of a pair of tepid home crowds, and it was seen as yet another embarrassment following the 2024 Copa America.

The 2025 Gold Cup is also the final competitive tournament the U.S. will play in before next summer's World Cup, which will also be on home soil.

So while the last few Gold Cups have seen many top American players omitted from the roster in favor of training with the club teams for the upcoming season, many thought there would be an “A-list” squad this time around. They were mistaken.

Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Gio Reyna, Antonee Robinson, and Yunus Musah were all left off of Pochettino's pre-Cup roster — Pulisic and Robinson due to lingering injuries and high minutes logs from the 2024-25 club season, McKennie, Weah, and Reyna due to Club World Cup commitments for Juventus and Borussia Dortmund, and “personal reasons” for Pulisic's AC Milan teammate Musah.

Even more baffling was the exclusion of bubble players who had solid seasons in European club soccer, in favor of domestic Major League Soccer talent with questionable long-term national team potential.

On the surface, it appears Pochettino may have “busted” the team up as he continues searching for players he believes can contribute more to the national team than the often underperforming European core.

On the other hand, players opting out of competitions or managing minutes has been an ongoing issue for the USMNT since the Gregg Berhalter era. Regardless of how it's explained, the latest roster that is likely to compete in the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup is devoid of expectations. Only a handful of the players selected are realistic candidates for the final World Cup roster a year from now.

Pochettino's latest roster is a grim indictment of the current state of the program as it nears the end of what has been an abysmal 2026 cycle — one that continues to alienate fans and set expectations for the team at an all-time low.

 – quinta-feira, 22 de maio de 2025

To better understand who's missing, here is the 27-man roster Pochettino has selected for upcoming friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland, and the possible 2025 Gold Cup team:

GOALKEEPERS (4): Matt Freese (New York City FC; 0/0), Patrick Schulte (Columbus Crew; 3/0), Zack Steffen (Colorado Rapids; 30/0), Matt Turner (Crystal Palace/ENG; 51/0)

DEFENDERS (8): Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew; 3/0), Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 33/2), Alex Freeman (Orlando City; 0/0), DeJuan Jones (San Jose Earthquakes; 10/0), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse/FRA; 19/0), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC; 68/1), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace/ENG; 24/1), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati; 32/3)

MIDFIELDERS (10): Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United/ENG; 47/8), Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/ENG; 44/2), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; 0/0), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis/ESP; 18/0), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC; 24/1), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake; 4/0), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo; 4/1), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia Union; 0/0), Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 17/0), Sean Zawadzki (Columbus Crew; 1/0)

FORWARDS (5): Patrick Agyemang (Charlotte FC; 4/3), Folarin Balogun (Monaco/FRA; 17/5), Damion Downs (FC Köln/GER; 0/0), Brian White (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; 4/1), Haji Wright (Coventry City/ENG; 15/4)

 – sexta-feira, 23 de maio de 2025

In his press conference, Pochettino and the federation emphasized two key points: first, that it was Pulisic's decision to withdraw from the Gold Cup due to a long European season.

According to multiple sources, Pulisic has been dealing with a hip issue that has required injections. If this is the case, why didn't U.S. Soccer communicate it clearly? Wouldn't it have been easier to simply say the Milan winger is recovering from injury? The lack of transparency makes it appear as though Pulisic is skipping the tournament just to rest ahead of the next European season where AC Milan is not playing any continental competitions.

On the other hand, Pulisic has reportedly been playing through this injury for months, logging significant minutes for Milan and performing well. Given the current state of the U.S. men's program, having the team captain on the roster could have sent a positive message that demonstrates commitment and leadership. Instead, it's yet another baffling episode in a pattern of U.S. Soccer prioritizing external interests over its own success.

The second notable moment came when Pochettino stated, “If you come here to play golf, to have dinner, to see your friends… no. This is not the culture we want to create.”

It raised the possibility that some absences were intended as messages to underperforming players and a signal that the coach is seriously evaluating new options.

Would that necessarily be a bad thing? Looking at some of the absences, perhaps not.

Musah and Reyna had dreadful club seasons and currently have no business on the national team based on form. Josh Sargent squandered his chance with Pochettino during the Nations League and seems to be on the outs.

Other omissions are harder to explain. Joe Scally had a consistent season in Germany, and Antonee Robinson had a career year in England. Their exclusions raise the question: is U.S. Soccer prioritizing resting players over winning?

While many agree the current USMNT “core” needs to be broken up, some missing bubble players make little sense.

Tanner Tessmann and Gianluca Busio both showed they merit extended looks. Aidan Morris, who had decent showings under Pochettino early on, is completely absent.

Paxten Aaronson, after a solid season with FC Utrecht, still can't crack the full national team—a surprise given his midfield play in the Eredivisie.

Pochettino also doesn't appear to rate Celtic's Cameron Carter-Vickers or Auston Trusty very highly either.

The current mess gives new players a unique chance to break into the squad. By performing well, and potentially winning the Gold Cup, some could earn a spot in the A team.

Malik Tillman and Johnny Cardoso, both coming off strong European seasons, will be looked to as breakout candidates, while Diego Luna also has a chance to cement his place on the roster.

Sergiño Dest and Folarin Balogun will now work under Pochettino, with Balogun eyeing a return as the first-choice striker while Ricardo Pepi recovers from injury.

Wildcards like Sebastian Berhalter, Brian White, Haji Wright (potentially as a winger), Quinn Sullivan, and Damion Downs could emerge as surprise contributors depending on their Gold Cup performances.

Former USMNT legend Tab Ramos told Urban Pitch after news broke that Pulisic was out and a B squad would be heading to the Gold Cup:

“It's unfortunate that, once again, we will not have our strongest team together to prepare,” Ramos said. “After this summer, competitive opportunities will be fully behind us. We will have to hope that all players are in good form with their clubs going into next summer and that somehow it all comes together as a team.”

That seems to be the operating philosophy of U.S. Soccer lately: Fingers crossed, hoping it all somehow works out in the end. Meanwhile, the federation and coaching staff continue to fumble their way through what has been a dismal 2026 cycle.

Letting players “pick and choose” competitions, “negotiating” minutes with European clubs during must-win windows, and paying a coach $6 million per year to manage mostly substitutes, it's a colossal waste for now.

Optimism is at an all-time low for the USMNT. This latest roster has done little to ease the frustration of fans tired of a generation of players who talk the talk but never walk the walk.

Igor Tudor's agent, Anthony Seric, confirms his client will remain in charge of Juventus for the upcoming Club World Cup.

Tudor will remain in charge of Juventus for the 2025 Club World Cup, which starts on June 14.

His agent Seric clarified his client's recent claims on Monday morning: “He has an excellent relationship with Giuntoli and all parts of the club,” he told Sky Sport via SportMediaset.

“He will not pressure the club about his future decision because he clearly hopes to still be the Juventus coach next season and will respect the timing of their choice.

“He spoke with Cristiano after his post-match interview, and Igor will honour his commitment to lead Juventus at the Club World Cup.”

According to Sportitalia transfer expert Alfredo Pedullà, Tudor and the Bianconeri directors met Monday morning to discuss the coach's statements after Sunday's win over Venezia and clarified that the Croat would remain in charge for the upcoming tournament.

Tudor had said on Sunday that he'd only lead the team for the Club World Cup if he were confirmed as the head coach for 2025-26.

His contract was automatically extended last night after the Old Lady's 3-2 win over Venezia, which qualified them for the Champions League. However, the Bianconeri can terminate the agreement by paying just €1m, and growing reports suggest they have already chosen Antonio Conte as their coach for next season.

“It will be known soon, not after the Club World Cup, but before.

“We were all focused on the end of the season, all the games. I didn't even want to talk about this. Now we have the Club World Cup, but all this will be solved before that. It would not be a good idea to go there without a decision, or to make a decision [to change] but still go there with the same coach. It would not be serious for the club or the coach.”

Looks like we will have at least part of an answer about who Juve's next manager will be in a short amount of time.

After helping Juventus secure Champions League football for next season on Sunday night in Venice, it appears as though interim manager Igor Tudor has drawn a line in the sand when it comes to his future at the club.

And it also sounds like we will find out shortly as to whether the Croatian will be Juve's manager going forward — and even at the Club World Cup this summer.

During his post-match media availability on Sky Italia following Juve's 3-2 win over Venezia that secured a fourth-place finish and Champions League qualification, Tudor said that he will discuss his future with the club “very soon.” On top of that, Tudor essentially said that it makes no sense for him to manage Juventus at the Club World Cup if he is not confirmed as the head coach for next season — which goes against something that we've heard from the club's management for much of the last couple of weeks and again from Chief Football Officer Cristiano Giuntoli after Sunday night's game that Juve will decide on their next manager after their participation in the tournament.

To add to the situation, Fabrizio Romano and others have reported following Juventus' win over Venezia that the qualification for the Champions League has activated a clause in Tudor's contract that extends the deal through 2026. Juventus can either keep Tudor for the 2025-26 season or payout a buyout — believed to be around €1 million — if they want to go a different direction with their next manager.

Here are Tudor's words regarding his future as Juventus' manager beyond Sunday night's season finale:

“I can say that we will know very soon, a little patience and we will decide, before the World Cup.”

[...]

“You're making me get into discussions about which I can't say anything. We'll see each other soon and a decision will be made soon, we were all focused on this finale, on the games. I don't even have to talk about it for a question of concentration, now there's the World Cup but everything can be resolved beforehand.”

(Source: ilbianconero.com)

It had also been previously reported in the days leading up to him officially signing with the club that Tudor's hiring on a short-term caretaker basis included being manager at the summer tournament that will see Juve play at least three games in the United States.

Juventus begin group play at the Club World Cup against Al Ain FC from the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday June 18, at Audi Field in Washington D.C.

Tudor has every right to both know what the future holds for him at Juventus and the stance to not be a lame duck coaching Juventus at the Club World Cup when he already would know somebody is coming in to take his job once the tournament is over. One of the biggest clubs in the sport, Real Madrid, have already set up their managerial succession line and will see it get officially underway this summer, with Xabi Alonso coming in for Carlo Ancelotti, who will now head to the Brazilian national team.

With rumors spinning that a certain former Juventus manager — and teammate of Tudor's during his playing days in Turin — might be leaving Naples after leading Napoli to the Scudetto this season, the Bianconeri might be trying to rekindle their old flame shortly. And if that's the case, then they may as well have their new manager start work and evaluating this squad at the Club World Cup no matter who is actually available to play.

Tudor was brought in to get Juventus in the Champions League and the next step was still to be determined. If they have determined that Sunday night's win in Venice was the last time he will be on the sidelines and somebody else will be hired on a full-time basis, then it seems like we're going to know in relatively short order.

Madrid are optimistic about signing the young left-back this week, according to MARCA and AS.

Real Madrid are accelerating efforts to complete the signing of Benfica left-back Álvaro Carreras this week, aiming to finalize the deal in time for the player to be registered for the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup — a competition that has become a clear priority for the Spanish giants.

According to reports from both MARCA and AS, negotiations between Real Madrid and Benfica resumed after a brief pause to allow the Portuguese club to focus on their domestic cup final. The renewed talks signal Madrid's urgency in reinforcing their squad ahead of a demanding summer schedule.

Carreras, 21, is reportedly eager to make the move to the Santiago Bernabéu, having already reached a verbal agreement with the club several weeks ago. However, Real Madrid are pushing to reduce the financial burden of the transfer, aiming to avoid paying the full €50 million release clause set by Benfica.

Still, all reports suggest that an agreement is likely to be reached within days.

Alex Moreno

Bombshell on El Chiringuito. Josep Pedrerol has revealed news that shakes the market. Trent Alexander-Arnold will play the Club World Cup with Real Madrid.

Real Madrid will pay 5 million euros to Liverpool to have the full-back right away.

""Madrid will pay 5M to Liverpool for Arnold to play the Club World Cup,"" stated Pedrerol live.

The agreement is already closed. The English defender will join Xabi Alonso's team immediately.

Alexander-Arnold will not arrive in July. He will be available from the first minute of the Club World Cup.

Real Madrid has accelerated the operation so that Xabi Alonso has all his reinforcements from the start.

""Arnold will go to the Club World Cup, they will pay about 5 million to Liverpool so he can go. Therefore, it is already closed for 5 million,"" Pedrerol insisted.

The English full-back's contract ends this summer. But Madrid did not want to wait. They prefer to pay this symbolic amount and have him right away.

With the arrival of Alexander-Arnold, Real Madrid adds three reinforcements for the Club World Cup.

Dean Huijsen was the first. The club already made his signing official a few days ago.

The second will be Álvaro Carreras, Benfica's left-back. His signing is very advanced and is expected to be announced shortly.

The third, already closed, is Trent Alexander-Arnold.

All three will be available for Xabi Alonso. Real Madrid's new coach will be presented today.

Florentino Pérez wants to offer him a competitive team from the start. He is achieving it.

Trent Alexander-Arnold arrives with the experience of having won everything at Liverpool.

His quality, vision of the game, and offensive capability make him a top-level reinforcement for the right-back position.

For only 5 million euros, Madrid secures a strategic signing. They do it before his contract ends.

In summary: Alexander-Arnold will play the Club World Cup with Real Madrid. The operation is closed. He joins Huijsen and Carreras as the first three reinforcements of the Xabi Alonso era.

LAFC look to qualify for their first-ever FIFA Club World Cup in Saturday's playoff match at BMO Stadium against Mexican powerhouse Club América.

The winner replaces Club León, who were disqualified from the tournament due to FIFA's multi-club ownership rules. They'll slot into Group D alongside Chelsea (England), Flamengo (Brazil) and ES Tunis (Tunisia).

Should the Black & Gold win, they'll join Seattle Sounders FC (2022 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) and Inter Miami CF (host nation spot) as the third Major League Soccer representative in the expanded, 32-team tournament that runs from June 14 to July 13 across the United States.

Concacaf teams earn a guaranteed $9.55 million for participating in the Club World Cup and could win up to nearly $100 million as part of the unprecedented $1 billion prize pool.

In 2023, LAFC reached their second Concacaf Champions Cup final by ousting LD Alajuelense of Costa Rica (Round of 16), Vancouver Whitecaps FC (quarterfinal) and the Philadelphia Union (semifinal).

Despite losing 3-1 on aggregate Club León in the final, the Black & Gold now have the opportunity to secure their Club World Cup place.

After a bumpy start to the year, LAFC have settled into fourth in the Western Conference table on 23 points (6W-4L-5D). Head coach Steve Cherundolo's side is riding an eight-match unbeaten streak and has lost just once at BMO Stadium this year.

Club América qualified for this playoff match as the top club in FIFA's Concacaf Club Rankings Index after the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup. The Index grades all clubs and leagues throughout the confederation, awarding or deducting points based on results across the past four years.

Following a 34-point Clausura campaign, Las Águilas finished second in the LIGA MX table. However, Toluca denied their four-peat bid with a 2-0 victory in Sunday's Leg 2 finale.

With that setback, manager André Jardine's team can still extend their 2024-25 season and join fellow Mexican sides CF Monterrey (2021 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) and CF Pachuca (2024 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) at this summer's marquee tournament.

LAFC and Club América met during a preseason friendly in February, with goals from Denis Bouanga and Nathan Ordaz delivering a 2-1 Black & Gold victory at BMO Stadium.

This time around, however, the scenario is a bit different with equal ticket distribution for fans and $9.55 million on the line.

Whichever team can embrace the moment without being overwhelmed by it will likely book their spot in the 2025 Club World Cup.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

Manchester City are ramping up their pursuit of Tijjani Reijnders before jetting off to the Club World Cup.

Reijnders, the AC Milan midfielder, is expected to command a fee of more than £55million this summer after a stellar season in Serie A.

The Netherlands international has 15 goals in all competitions this term and was voted midfielder of the year over the weekend.

Milan fans have protested against the club's disappointing campaign and the potential sale of Reijnders.

Pep Guardiola wants to bolster that area of the pitch but has been stressing that while he's offered opinions on altering the squad, the club will take the ultimate decisions.

Hugo Viana is taking over as director of football from Txiki Begiristain, while City hope Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White – called up to Thomas Tuchel's latest England squad - will also join them.

The midfielder would command a fee in the region of £55million after a stellar season

Pep Guardiola has, though, insisted that the club will make the final decision on transfers rather than him

Guardiola suggested that an influx of new faces is unlikely but City are thought to want at least one full back - Rayan Ait-Nouri at Wolves has long been admired - as well as a couple of midfielders.

The futures of the likes of Ederson and Matheus Nunes are up in the air, while Guardiola confirmed that Jack Grealish could leave, with outgoings likely to have an impact on supplementary business.

'I don't have any doubts that with Rodri there and Phil (Foden) there, we would have competed (this year),' Guardiola said after they secured Champions League qualification.

'I'm not saying we would have won because Liverpool deserved to win, but we would have been better. What happens next season the club is going to decide.

'I give my suggestions but the club will decide. That is not the most important thing, the most important thing is how we create our connection and vibes between all of us to go and compete everywhere.

'We will be better and I will try. We will be closer. This season we have done 71 points - miles away from our standards in the past.'

US

This is the first major easing of Saudi Arabia's alcohol ban in over 70 years

Saudi Arabia will reportedly permit alcohol sales at select tourist venues by 2026, in a significant policy shift aimed at boosting tourism ahead of Expo 2030 and the FIFA World Cup in 2034.

The government has reportedly said that around 600 licensed locations will be authorised to serve alcoholic beverages to non-Muslim visitors. These include five-star hotels, resorts, and designated zones within large-scale tourism projects such as NEOM, the Red Sea Project, and Sindalah Island.

This marks the first broad loosening of the kingdom's alcohol ban in over seven decades.

Permitted drinks will be limited to wine, beer and cider, with a maximum alcohol content of 20%. Spirits and other high-alcohol beverages will remain banned.

According to a report by Saudi Moments, all alcohol must be consumed on-site. Takeaway sales, retail distribution, and public advertising will remain prohibited. Alcohol will also remain unavailable in homes, shops, and public areas outside of the licensed zones.

Officials said the changes are part of Vision 2030, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's wide-reaching plan to diversify the Saudi economy and reduce reliance on oil revenues. The plan aims to position the country as a major destination for international tourism and investment.

The rules will be enforced under tight controls. Licensed venues will be operated by trained staff and regulated by clear operational standards. Violations, including serving unauthorised individuals or offering takeaway alcohol, could lead to venue closures or legal action.

The general ban on alcohol for Saudi citizens and Muslim residents will remain in place. Religious cities such as Mecca and Medina will continue to prohibit alcohol entirely.

Saudi Arabia had already opened its first alcohol shop in decades in January 2024. Located in Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter, the store is open only to non-Muslim foreign diplomats.

Access is limited to customers who register via a government app, receive foreign ministry clearance, and comply with monthly quotas. Mobile phones must be sealed upon entry, and purchases must be made in person.

That pilot initiative was introduced to regulate diplomatic alcohol access and curb black market sales, without changing the broader prohibition affecting the general public.

The alcohol licensing programme will begin rolling out in 2026, just four years before Saudi Arabia is due to host Expo 2030 in Riyadh and eight years before the World Cup.

Earlier in Febuary, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United Kingdom said that alcohol will not be allowed at the upcoming FIFA World Cup.

In an interview with LBC ( London Broadcasting Company), Prince Khalid bin Bandar Al Saud stated that alcohol would not be sold anywhere during the tournament, including hotels.

“At the moment, we don't allow alcohol,” Prince Khalid said. “Plenty of fun can be had without alcohol—it's not 100% necessary. If you want to drink after you leave, you're welcome to, but at the moment we don't have alcohol.”

Asked whether fans would be able to drink in hotels, as was the case at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, he replied: “No, there is no alcohol at all. Rather like our weather, it's a dry country.”

He added: “Everyone has their own culture. We're happy to accommodate people within the boundaries of our culture, but we don't want to change our culture for someone else.”

LAFC host Mexican powerhouse Club América on Saturday evening, with the winner punching their ticket to the FIFA 2025 Club World Cup.

This playoff game follows Club León getting disqualified from the Club World Cup due to FIFA's multi-club ownership rules.

As such, either LAFC or Club América will take their place in Group D alongside Chelsea (England), Flamengo (Brazil) and ES Tunis (Tunisia). Additionally, Concacaf teams earn a guaranteed $9.55 million for participating in the tournament as part of the unprecedented $1 billion prize pool.

The Club World Cup features 32 teams competing from June 14 to July 13 across the United States, ending with the final at MetLife Stadium.

LAFC were granted this opportunity as the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup runners-up; head coach Steve Cherundolo's side fell 3-1 on aggregate to Club León during that two-legged final.

Fast forward two years and the Black & Gold remain among the Western Conference's top contenders. They're also carrying an eight-game unbeaten run (3W-0L-5D), most recently earning a 2-2 comeback draw at CF Montréal thanks to Olivier Giroud's rebound finish.

Should LAFC win, they'd become the third MLS side at the Club World Cup alongside Seattle Sounders FC (2022 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) and Inter Miami CF (host nation spot). Their top threat is Denis Bouanga, who has 10 goals in 20 appearances (all competitions) this season.

Who's claiming the last spot? 🔮#FIFACWC pic.twitter.com/sv5XDM65y8

Club América are one of the most storied teams in the Western Hemisphere, winning a record 16 LIGA MX titles. However, their bid for a four-peat was denied Sunday evening when they fell 2-0 to Toluca in Leg 2 of the Clausura final.

That result only adds fuel for head coach André Jardine's side, which is littered with high-profile stars. That list includes former FC Dallas homegrown forward Alejandro Zendejas, who also represents the US men's national team.

Should Las Águilas prevail, they would join fellow Mexican sides CF Monterrey (2021 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) and CF Pachuca (2024 Concacaf Champions Cup winner) at this summer's marquee tournament.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

Four Inter Milan players are in the Italy squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers, with Francesco Acerbi still hoping for a spot.

This according to today's print edition of Milan-based newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, via FCInterNews.

The club season is only just coming to an end.

It has been a dramatic conclusion which saw Inter Milan miss out to the Serie A title to Napoli on the final day of the season.

Meanwhile, the Nerazzurri will face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League final next Saturday.

Then, next month, Inter will play in the expanded Club World Cup in the United States. They will be one of two teams representing Serie A in the competition along with Juventus.

However, there is also time for another international break right after the Champions League final.

There will be four players from the Inter Milan squad who shift gears to the national team immediately after the Champions League final.

The Gazzetta confirm that Italy coach Luciano Spalletti has called up Alessandro Bastoni, Federico Dimarco, Nicolo Barella, and Davide Frattesi.

Then, there is the question of whether Francesco Acerbi could get a spot.

Despite being 37 years old, the veteran former Sassuolo and Lazio defender is still in the frame for the Azzurri.

Aside from Bastoni, Spalletti will call up Federico Gatti, Alessandro Buongiorno, and Riccardo Calafiori in defense, reports the Gazzetta.

However, there will likely also be an additional defender, the newspaper reports.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Italian clay specialist Flavio Cobolli underlined that he is a force to be reckoned with at Roland Garros, when he won the biggest title of his career by upsetting third seed Andrey Rublev 6-2, 6-4 to win the Hamburg Open.

Ranked number 35 in the world, Cobolli had only one ATP 250 title to his name, having won the Romanian Open last month, but the 23-year-old now has two clay-court titles after dismantling Rublev in the final of the ATP 500 event.

Cobolli thereby became just the third player to win multiple titles on the ATP Tour this year after Carlos Alcaraz (three) and Felix Auger-Aliassime (also two), as the impressive win also saw him rise to a career-high 26th in the rankings.

A little over 1000 km to the south of Hamburg, Novak Djokovic won the 100th singles title of his career by beating Hubert Hurkacz 5-7, 7-6(2), 7-6(2) at the Geneva Open in Switzerland. He thereby became only the third man in the Open Era to win 100 titles, after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer.

Djokovic arrived in the bank capital without any wins on clay this season, but recovered his form just in time for the French Open, where he bids for a fourth crown. 

On the WTA Tour, No. 4 seed Elena Rybakina ended a year-long title drought on Saturday, posting a 6-1, 6-7(2), 6-1 victory over No. 8 seed Liudmila Samsonova to capture the WTA 500 Internationaux de Strasbourg title in France. 

The former Wimbledon champion Rybakina otherwise had not reached a final since April 2024, when she won another clay-court title at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. The win in Strasbourg was Rybakina's ninth career WTA singles title; four of her previous titles have also come on clay.

Alexander Zverev certainly didn't have the perfect warm up for the Roland Garros as he suffered another early exit before the second Grand Slam tournament of the year, being eliminated in the quarter-final of the Hamburg Open losing 6-3, 4-6, 7-6(5) to Frenchman Alexandre Muller, who is ranked 40 in the world. 

The German said sickness was behind his lacklustre showing. ""It was OK considering I threw up 37 times and had a fever of 39.4 degrees (Celsius, 102.9 Fahrenheit) all night.""

The 28-year-old said his opponent had taken advantage of his poor condition.

""When I had to walk it was difficult. He then realised at some point I wasn't feeling well and made the points last as long as possible.""

The German was also eliminated in the quarter-finals in Rome in straight sets against Lorenzo Musetti 7-6 (1), 6-4, and the German has confessed that he is battling severe mental distress due to his recent string of failures on the court. 

“I have no idea what's happening to me right now. I have been trying to understand it for several months, but I don't even know what to say anymore"", said Zverev at the beginning of April as he bowed out of the Monte Carlo Open, and he seems far from his best going into the French Open. 

American contender Danielle Collins, who was set to end her career last year given the fact that she has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and endometriosis - with the former the same disease that haunted Caroline Wozniacki - has turned into a divisive figure on the Tour. 

She has often found herself in the midst of controversy as she previously told a booing Australian Open crowd that they “pay her bills”, and has also earlier taken issue with Iga Swiatek. Collins captured the headlines again in the past week during the WTA tournament in Strasbourg as she, during her match with Emma Raducanu, told a camera operator to give them space and claimed the TV crew were being “inappropriate”.

“I need to get water. We're on a changeover. You don't need to be that close to me and you don't need to be on top of Emma. It's wildly inappropriate. It's not that difficult to give space, I'm sorry,” she said.

While Collins' on-court antics have often frustrated other players, Raducanu admitted after the match that she had no problem with the 31-year-old's behaviour. 

Cobolli and Rublev treated the crowd at the Rothenbaum Arena in the Hamburg Open final to an amazing tennis afternoon where Cobolli won a spectacular clay-court rally with a strong forehand winner.

Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime had to battle for his ticket into the semi-finals of the Hamburg Open as he closed off a marathon match on his seventh match point against Alexandre Muller with a delicious drop-shot volley. 

Over the next two weeks, all eyes of the tennis world will be on Roland Garros, which was the first Grand Slam tournament to join the ""Open"" era in 1968. Since then, many tennis greats have graced the famous clay courts, including Bjorn Borg, Ivan Lendl, Mats Wilander, Gustavo Kuerten, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. 

Carlos Alcaraz won the 2024 French Open after beating Alexander Zverev in the final. Iga Swiatek won her third consecutive French Open title in the 2024 tournament, drawing her closer to Chris Evert's record of seven titles.

Rafael Nadal has rightly been known as ""the king of clay"" as 14 of the Spaniard's 22 career Grand Slams came on the French Open's clay courts. 

For 2025, the prize money pool has been announced to be €56.352 million, an increase of 5.37% compared to the prize pool for the 2024 edition.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

Down 15-30, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro had history on her racquet. The 22-year-old Spaniard was up big—so much that she was attempting to become the first woman to defeat a Top 10 player 6-0, 6-0 at a Grand Slam since Martina Navratilova obliterated world No. 7 Manuela Maleeva in the 1989 US Opqn quarterfinals.There were two notable differences today at Roland Garros: first, this was a first-round match, not a quarterfinal where Top 10 players can collide. Second, Bouzas Maneiro is ranked 68th, not second as the legendary Navratilova was.Navratilova's distinction remains safe, as Navarro got on the board with a Bouzas Maneiro double fault. The American raised her arm to the sky in a wry celebration.

Navratilova's distinction remains safe, as Navarro got on the board with a Bouzas Maneiro double fault. The American raised her arm to the sky in a wry celebration.

Just one game later, though, and the Bouzas Maneiro demolition on dirt was complete. Navarro's stats were ghastly: she won just 44% of her first-serve points and 22% on second serve. She broken seven times, struck 23 unforced errors and hit just four winners.Bouzas Maneiro won 56 of the 86 total points played in a ladies' sweep, if you will.""That is a devastating loss,"" said Mark Petchey on truTV. ""I feel like there's an explanation coming.""The two had never played before and perhaps Navarro never hopes they do again.

Check out some key statistics from Emma Navarro's loss to unseeded Jessica Bouzas Maneiro at the French Open. (0:41)

PARIS -- US Open semifinalist Emma Navarro lasted only 57 minutes at the French Open, losing 6-0, 6-1 in the first round Monday to Jessica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain.

It's a major setback for the 24-year-old American, a New York native, who reached the fourth round in Paris last year before her first Grand Slam semifinal at Flushing Meadows. Navarro, the No. 9 seed in Paris, had a strong start to the season, including a quarterfinal appearance at the Australian Open and a WTA 500 title, but has struggled on clay this spring.

On Court Suzanne-Lenglen, the 68th-ranked Bouzas Maneiro dominated the match and reached the second round at Roland Garros for the first time.

""I didn't expect the result but I always try to play my best, and I think everything is possible,"" Bouzas Maneiro said. ""I feel good playing on clay, and winning here at Roland Garros is so special to me.""

Last year at Wimbledon, the Spaniard upset 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova in the first round of the grass court tournament.

She will next face either Diane Parry of France or American Robin Montgomery.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

British number one Katie Boulter speaking after her first-round win: ""It's my first victory here at Roland Garros. Honestly, I'm really pleased with myself. I sometimes find it really difficult on this surface and I've kind of persevered and tried my hardest to bring some good tennis.

""It's obviously my first Roland Garros win, you never forget those so this one is special for me and it'll go in my books. I'm really happy today and I'm really happy to be back out here in France.""

On winning the Trophee Clarins in Paris last week: ""It was great for me. It was my first clay court title which means I officially have now got one on every surface, so that means a lot to me. It makes it even more special that it was right here in Paris.

""I have such familiar feelings of this place because I got to play my Olympics doubles match on this court last year, so I had good vibes coming out here today.""

Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 1-6 Boulter

Katie Boulter says she's eating a lot of steak frites on her rest days.

She hasn't had a croissant while she's been out in Paris this year but will treat herself at the end of the tournament.

She looks absolutely chuffed during her on-court interview. She's finally got that win at Roland Garros.

Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 1-6 Boulter

There's a fair few British fans watching on court. Union Jacks aplenty.

Katie Boulter is speaking on court. She says she sometimes finds it difficult on this surface. You never forget your first win, she adds.

Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 1-6 Boulter

Another Carole Monnet error and that's enough. Katie Boulter wins a match at the French Open for the very first time!

The British number one comes from a set down and will play either seventh seed Madison Keys or qualifier Daria Saville in the next round.

*Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 1-5 Boulter

Monnet goes wide. Two match points.

*Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 1-5 Boulter

Monnet slams one into the net. 15-30.

*Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 1-5 Boulter

Katie Boulter's playing freely now. She wins a point with a delicious drop shot and then backs it up with a passing winner.

That's a hold to 15. Monnet will serve to stay in the French Open.

Annabel CroftFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds

Katie Boulter feels she isn't too far away from the finish line now - and she is really roaring herself on with the fist pumps. She is trying to get herself fired up here.

I don't think she wants any more time-wasting. I think she just got pulled into a situation in the first set where she almost couldn't control what was happening.

Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 1-4 Boulter*

Carole Monnet stops the rot, holding to 15. It's not 100% plain sailing for Boulter.

*Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 0-4 Boulter

Boulter's charging now. The crowd on Court Simonne Mathieu have gone silent as Boulter holds to 15.

The Briton has won 10 of the past 11 games.

Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 0-3 Boulter*

Katie Boulter goes a double-break up in the decider after another loose Carole Monet error.

Is that the light at the end of the tunnel?

Annabel CroftFormer British number one on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds

The first two games of this set have been quite tricky, especially the opening game of this final set.

But Katie Boulter has done such a good job to steady the ship once again. She just needs to keep on forging towards this finish line because I'm sure she felt that she was never doubt of winning this match, but it just became really problematic.

It's a bit of a messy match.

*Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 0-2 Boulter

Now then, a big opportunity on Monnet's serve, 30-30.

Boulter stays in the rally, before the qualifier slices a forehand wide to give the Briton another break chance.

*Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 0-2 Boulter

Top perseverance from Katie Boulter who relies on some clutch second serves to recover from 0-30 to hold.

Boulter backs up her break. It's her match to lose now.

Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 0-1 Boulter*

The home crowd want French qualifier Carole Monnet to push again. She finds another gear and races to 0-30 on Boulter's serve.

Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 0-1 Boulter*

She's got it! It sticks!

After 10 minutes Katie Boulter breaks at the start of the deciding set, curling a forehand winner right into the corner.

*Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 0-0 Boulter

Boulter gets another break point, hitting a winner at the net.

This time?

*Monnet 7-6 (7-4) 1-6 0-0 Boulter

Monnet is clinging on but keeps finding a way. She gets out of a mammoth rally as Boulter scoops a backhand long.

American tennis sensation Ben Shelton opted not to mimic Emma Raducanu's controversial move last year when the British star withdrew from her Wimbledon mixed doubles commitment with Andy Murray following a singles win, confessing: ""I wasn't raised that way"". The 2021 US Open winner faced criticism for her decision, which marked the end of Murray's stint at the All England Club.

The two-time Wimbledon champion had already bowed out of the men's singles and been defeated in the doubles alongside his brother Jamie.

Shelton, who has already sailed into the second round of the French Open after triumphing over Lorenzo Sonego, was confronted with a dilemma at Wimbledon last year. He had soared to the fourth round in the men's singles while simultaneously competing in doubles with Mackenzie McDonald.

Raducanu, who withdrew citing stiffness in her right wrist, had also advanced to the women's singles fourth round, leaving Judy Murray, Andy's mother, astounded by the withdrawal — remarks she later described as sarcastic.

Yet even as his own singles success beckoned, Shelton did not forget the commitment he made to McDonald, promising to uphold it despite progressing in the singles competitions.

""Yeah, I mean, whenever you're on the schedule seven days straight, it's not something easy to deal with,"" the 22-year-old said. ""I think five of those days I was - five or six of those days I was actually on a court playing.

""Maybe six. So it's not an easy thing to deal with, but I signed up for it. I signed up to play doubles yesterday. Played two extra sets after my singles match, and that's my decision.""

Shelton didn't bring up Raducanu directly but candidly expressed his dedication to the game and to his partner, stating: ""I think a lot of people probably would have pulled out of doubles in that situation, but I didn't want to do that to my partner.

""He's been waiting around for four, four and a half days to play doubles with me. I'm not just going to pull out on the guy. I think it's a selfish thing to do. Just kind of wasn't raised that way.""

In light of Raducanu's Monday match at Roland Garros, where she required medical assistance against Wang Xinyu, the Brit mentioned apologizing to Murray again, expressing her regret and anticipation for a future conversation: ""I hope he's forgiven me for last year, I still feel bad about it,"" she commented.

""I'm looking forward to seeing him around and having a conversation. I think he would give great advice, he's been in a similar situation and would probably understand a lot of things that I'm also going through. But as to anything more, I don't know, that's very far out of thought.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Meet Henry Patten, Britain's unheralded Wimbledon champion","https://www.thetimes.com/sport/tennis/article/henry-patten-interview-britains-unheralded-wimbledon-champion-8892xvct8","Mon, 26 May 2025 09:00:59 GMT","

He is the No2 seed heading into Roland Garros. He triumphed at Wimbledon last summer and then headed to Australia and won that grand-slam tournament as well . . . yet you may not have heard of him. Which is faintly ridiculous given that both those titles were won amid high drama and with sublime, entertaining skill.

Henry Patten is a British doubles specialist and his breakthrough success has come alongside Harri Heliovaara, a passionate Finn whose reaction to winning on Centre Court was arguably the highlight of last year's championships. Both players were in slight shock, given they were unseeded, but Heliovaara repeatedly broke down under the fraternal gaze of his partner. 

It was the stuff of dreams and the two men headed to the champions' dinner as, well, champions. Patten, 29, was shy at the thought of giving a speech but had prepared to say a few words to thank the coaching team who had helped him and his partner seal glory. By the denouement of the men's doubles, Centre Court was jam-packed and raucous in support of the battling Brit, but the achievement featured for only a few seconds on the video shown at the dinner. 

It was a sign of things to come. Patten's triumph was not even mentioned in the speeches. It was a kick in the teeth. 

“I was absolutely fuming, to be honest,” he says. “I was thinking maybe I would get a ‘Congratulations to the men's doubles champions', especially for being a British winner.

“It's something that, at the time, I thought was really celebrated. And there was nothing.”

Heliovaara, 35, blogged words to the effect that the food was nice but not the lack of recognition, and Patten mentioned his dismay to a few people at the National Tennis Centre, which led to Debbie Jevans, the chairwoman of the All England Club, writing each of them a letter of apology, stating that their omission had been a complete oversight.

“All I can hope for is that it doesn't happen again, that whoever has that moment in the future, they don't have that disappointment,” Patten says. “Which I think hopefully has now been solved.”

What has not yet been solved is the way doubles is often overlooked by tournament and TV schedulers. When Patten won in Melbourne there was almost no one there to see it, with the match finishing at 2am local time. A family from his home town of Manningtree, Essex, who had moved to Australia and whom Patten has known since the age of five, were there, as were a clutch of ecstatic Finns. 

Patten's tennis career was forged in the United States while he studied at the University of North Carolina before a postgraduate course at Durham, and he turned professional in 2020. The closest he thought he would get to being a regular at Wimbledon was when he worked collating data for IBM at the championships in 2016. His partnership with Heliovaara began only in April last year, when the Finn was ranked slightly higher. He was initially a little reluctant to commit, but they complement each other beautifully.

Doubles does have its big moments; there is the Davis Cup and, of course, the Olympics. Patten smiles as he recalls the euphoria prompted by Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz pairing up at the Paris Games.

“All of a sudden everyone was watching the doubles, and they did pretty well,” Patten says. “There were lots of exciting storylines that came out of that. And people enjoy watching doubles. They really do. 

“The most important thing is, how much does the viewer care about the player? How well do they know the player? Obviously, when I'm playing in Wimbledon, people kind of feel that connection to me. But when I'm playing in, let's say Shanghai, let's face it, they haven't seen me on the telly. They haven't seen me on any of the social media. So I don't understand why they're going to watch that match, to be fair.

“There is a real lack of visibility and connection for the fans.”

Should Patten compete at the LA Olympics in 2028, though, the connection will flourish. Becoming an Olympian is his dream.

Being the British No1 in men's doubles gives him some control over plotting how to do that, especially in terms of who to team up with. He admits that pairing up with another British player would also make life “a lot easier” for Leon Smith, the GB Davis Cup team captain.

In the meantime, though, there is little appetite to interfere with his fruitful partnership with Heliovaara, whose dream is also to compete at an Olympics but who paused his career in 2013 when suffering from an autoimmune disease.

Two grand-slam titles may not have propelled Patten to becoming a household name just yet but his day-to-day life has changed a good deal.

“I've got my picture on the wall at the National Tennis Centre [in southwest London] which is really nice. Once you get to a certain world ranking, they support you really well. I have a doctor, I have a nutritionist, I have a personal trainer, private health insurance with Bupa.

“I have access to Louis Cayer, who is the best doubles coach in the world. I have access to all of the facilities whenever I want. It is without a doubt the best doubles training programme in the world and the most successful one too. So it's really exciting to be a part of that.”

What has also changed post-Wimbledon is the attitude of his peers. “Respect from my colleagues grew massively,” he says. “Tennis is a funny sport. It's basically a bunch of extremely competitive men travelling around the world together and seeing each other every week.

“People know much more about who I am and my world ranking kind of shot up and they were, I don't know, worried or excited about it — one of the two. Because when you go up, someone else has to come down.

“Last year we were playing much, much smaller tournaments but now we qualify for Monte Carlo [where they reached the semi-finals] and Madrid [where they got to the quarter-finals]. I'd never played in Monte Carlo before, I'd never played in Madrid before. They are much bigger tournaments that are much nicer to travel to and you're kind of treated better in general with better hotels and better food on site.”

Patten has been recognised in the street but he thinks that's because he was carrying tennis gear. He still goes, now and again, to his local chess club in Manningtree, in an old church, where nobody really chats about anything not related to chess.

“They all think I'm just an idiot. I lose every match when I go there. I think of it in terms of tennis and it's like I'm a pretty bad club tennis player,” he says.

“They don't know I'm a tennis player. I'd be away for a month and come back with a tan but no one would ask me where I had been.”

Patten enjoys playing on clay even if, in doubles, the surface meddles with rankings. No matter who emerges as the men's doubles champions in Paris, he would like sports fans to have dipped into watching it.

“Doubles players really get emotional,” he says. “I think Harri is a great example of that. Almost every match, he's going crazy. There are lots of moments that kind of go missing, but that's why people watch sport — to have that emotion and connection.”

Rafael Nadal was left emotional at the French Open on Sunday, where he was honoured after retiring from tennis last year.

Iga Swiatek was emotional at Nadal's farewell ceremony, which she attended alongside many other star names within tennis.

His fellow legends Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray were also present to give the Spaniard a fitting send-off.

Nadal won 14 French Open titles during his stunning career, more than any other man, with Bjorn Borg his nearest rival on six.

The Spanish icon retired late last year with 22 Grand Slam titles to his name overall, second only to the 24 of Djokovic.

But his efforts in Paris particularly caught the eye, with former players Marion Bartoli and Pat Cash having now shared their take on the legendary figure for BBC 5 Live Sport.

Bartoli said: “He has been synonymous with Roland Garros for the past two decades, and now Carlos Alcaraz is sort of starting to fill those shoes.

“And everyone is talking every single year whether Alcaraz is going to be the next Nadal. Only time will tell.”

Cash then shared his verdict, saying: “Yeah, I don't see anybody doing what Rafa has done ever, not until I'm gone.

“Nobody's going to be like Rafa. I mean, just to see him on the center court there tearing all over the place.

“It's one of the greatest sights I've ever seen. Roger Federer at Wimbledon, yes, the flow and the beauty and the elegance and the power.

“But Rafa at Roland Garros is… if you've never seen it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for you. I sat there with my jaw open every time.”

Just like Nadal made Roland Garros his home, Federer enjoyed stunning success on the grass courts of Wimbledon.

The Swiss icon won eight times in London before calling time on his phenomenal career, more than any other player.

But his record is somewhat under threat with the presence of Djokovic on the ATP Tour, with the Serbian just one behind.

He is joined by Pete Sampras and William Renshaw on seven Wimbledon titles, with another chance at success set to arrive later this summer.

But the French Open is up first for the 38-year-old, who just won his 100th ATP Tour title at the Geneva Open.

Djokovic starts his latest Roland Garros adventure against Mackenzie McDonald, with the world number six representing the sixth seed at the Grand Slam.

Nadal and Federer will likely be watching on, with their efforts at the French Open and Wimbledon respectively simply needing to both be admired in their own individual ways as opposed to being pitted against one another.

Both were truly jaw-dropping in their own ways, with such heroic feats not likely to be repeated in the future of the sport.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Emma Raducanu remains in the dark as to whether Andy Murray has forgiven her over last year's Wimbledon fiasco.

The pair were due to play mixed doubles together at the All England Club in what was Murray's final grand slam before retirement.

However, Raducanu withdrew due to wrist soreness as she chose to focus on her singles draw.

The decision denied Murray one final appearance at Wimbledon, with a defeat in the men's doubles alongside his brother Jamie his last match in SW19.

Murray's mother, Judy, labelled Raducanu's withdrawal 'astonishing' on social media, although she later claimed her response was sarcastic.

Although Raducanu insisted she had 'smoothed things over' with Murray after they bumped into each other at the Australian Open, she still feels guilty about what happened at Wimbledon.

However, speaking at the French Open, she ruled out being coached by Murray following his recent split with Novak Djokovic.

“I hope he's forgiven me for last year, I still feel bad about it,” Raducanu said.

“I'm looking forward to seeing him around and having a conversation. 

""I think he would give great advice, he's been in a similar situation and would probably understand a lot of things that I'm also going through. 

""But as to anything more, I don't know, that's very far out of thought.”

Although Murray is no longer Djokovic's coach, he won't be left twiddling his thumbs as he revealed he'd become an associate partner at a London-based investment firm.

As for Raducanu, she intends to continue with Mark Petchey as her part-time coach for the French Open and Wimbledon.

However, Petchey, who also coached Murray as a youngster, may not be able to attend all of Raducanu's matches due to his TV commitments.

Petchey was in Raducanu's coaching box alongside Jane O'Donoghue for the 22-year-old's impressive run to the quarter-finals of the Miami Open.

O'Donoghue will remain part of Raducanu's coaching team, with Tom Walsh also jumping on board for Roland Garros.

When quizzed about how busy Petchey's schedule would be in Paris, Raducanu conceded she was unsure but knew it was going to be jam-packed regardless.

However, she felt the 54-year-old has helped her to become 'a lot more self-sufficient'.

""I think for him it's a great opportunity to keep doing what he does so well and at the same time have fun hopefully being on court with me,"" Raducanu said.

""I have Tom here who is going to help and Jane, when he isn't available. And that's how its going to go.

“I think being a lot more self-sufficient is something Mark has helped me with the last few weeks. 

""Since Miami I think one thing that is a great sign of a coach is when you don't necessarily feel like you need them every shot, every point, so he's really helped me to figure things out for myself.”

Robin Montgomery is not leaving Paris early.

The 20-year-old American, who is appearing in her first-ever French Open main draw, secured her place in the second round by sending home-hero Diane Parry home with a 6-2, 6-1 win on Monday.

Montgomery dominated during the contest, winning five of her seven break points, dropping just three games and serving down five aces in her win.

It's a victory she'll hope she can use to elevate her status at Roland Garros as as she continues to climb up the rankings.

Up next for her is Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, who recently dismantled World No.9 and fellow American Emma Navarro.

The US sensation is ranked 115 in the world and made her debut five years ago as a 15-year-old at the US Open. Since then she's amassed over a million dollars in prize money.

Montgomery is well known within the American tennis scene, catching the eye when she won the US Open junior singles title in 2021.

She followed that victory up a few hours later with the junior doubles title when she and partner Ashlyn Krueger defeated Reese Brantmeier and Elvina Kalieva in three sets.

It meant she became the first person to win both titles in New York since Michaëlla Krajicek in 2004.

Montgomery first began to make some noise on the professional tour in 2023.

She was able to qualify for the Austin Open early that year and also earned her first WTA 1000 win when she defeated Ana Bogdan.

In 2024, she faced her toughest challenge yet and one that she still remembers to this day. 

It was Aryna Sabalenka in the third round of the Miami Open.

It took Sabalenka two-and-a-half hours to beat Montgomery, edging her in a 6-1, 6-7(5), 6-4 victory and one that demonstrated to the then-teen where her level was at.

""It was a very close match, and it kind of opened my eyes a little bit of where my level is and what I can actually do,"" Montgomery told Clay Tennis.

""I was pretty p*****!! Knowing that I was that close and it was just a few shots here and there that cost me the match… didn't feel great.""

She even admitted to crying after that loss as she described how devastating it was to come so close to winning.

""I was crying! I called my childhood coach and he was like ‘relax' and I'm like ‘no, screw this'. But yeah, it was a stinger, but it does happen for a reason,"" she added.

""It's gruesome I would say. She hits the ball very big, very hard and you have to always be ready for anything. When you play against her it sometimes feels like you're already on defense even before the point starts. It's very tough, she's a top player. The best nowadays.""

Montgomery is also friends with fellow American tennis star Coco Gauff, saying she grew up with the 2023 US Open winner.

""We are friends! When we see each other at tournaments we talk, we go out to dinner, that's pretty much it, but I'd say we're friends,"" she said.

""We grew up together, both chasing similar goals since young. I've known her since I was 9, we had our first USTA camp together, so we've known each other for a long time.""

Montgomery will be focused on forging her own path in tennis, and this year's French Open gives her that chance.

The added bonus is that it's on a surface she enjoys playing on.

""I do have good results on clay. So I probably enjoy it and play better than most American players on clay."" Montgomery said.

PARIS (AP) — U.S. Open runner-up Taylor Fritz lost in the first round of the French Open as the tournament's No. 4 seed on Monday, eliminated 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 by 66th-ranked Daniel Altmaier of Germany.

Altmaier broke Fritz's big serve five times at Court Simonne-Mathieu and ended the Californian's 15-match Grand Slam winning streak against players ranked outside the top 50.

Fritz's exit followed another by a top-10 American: No. 9 Emma Navarro was bounced from the women's bracket earlier Monday.

In September, Fritz lost the U.S. Open trophy to Jannik Sinner, becoming the first U.S. man to reach a major final since Andy Roddick in 2009. In Paris, Fritz was the highest-seeded American man at the French Open since Roddick was No. 3 in 2007.

While hard courts are Fritz's preferred surface, he did have a run to the second week on the red clay of Roland-Garros a year ago, making it into the fourth round before losing to Casper Ruud.

This is not Altmaier's first big win at the French Open. He beat No. 8 seed Matteo Berrettini there in 2020, and Sinner in 2023.

PARIS (AP) — Caroline Garcia wiped away a tear in the tunnel leading to Court Suzanne-Lenglen on Monday. She brushed it off, smiled, then stepped into the light — for what turned out to be her final singles match at the French Open.

The 31-year-old Frenchwoman, who announced on Friday she will retire later this season, lost in the first round to American Bernarda Pera 6-4, 6-4.

It was Garcia's 14th consecutive appearance at her home Grand Slam tournament.

After the match, Garcia stayed on court to deliver an emotional speech to a packed Suzanne-Lenglen crowd. She received a standing ovation, with French fans chanting her name for several minutes.

“I tried to fight until the end,” Garcia said, her voice trembling. “Since the start of the season, I knew this would be my last Roland-Garros. I hesitated to say it out loud because I didn't know how I'd handle the emotions — and this week, the tears have come every single day.”

She thanked the French public, her family, her fiancé, and the sport itself for shaping her identity.

“It's time to say goodbye,” Garcia had written in a social media post. “After 15 years competing at the highest level, and over 25 years devoting almost every second of my life to this sport, I feel ready to turn the page and open a new chapter.”

Garcia has won 11 WTA titles and captured the WTA Finals crown in 2022, the same year she reached the U.S. Open semifinals. She also won the French Open doubles title in 2016 and climbed as high as No. 4 in the singles rankings in 2018.

Her path hasn't always been smooth. Injuries, pressure, and a break from the sport in 2022 tested her resolve. That same year, she revealed she had struggled with eating disorders, triggered by the physical pain of a foot injury and the emotional toll of the tour.

Though Garcia bid farewell to Roland-Garros, she said she hopes to play two more majors.

“I would like to go to Wimbledon,” she said. “Depends on my ranking, of course, because I went down. Depends if I get a wild card or not. And then the U.S. Open.”

American tennis sensation Ben Shelton opted not to mimic Emma Raducanu's controversial move last year when the British star withdrew from her Wimbledon mixed doubles commitment with Andy Murray following a singles win, confessing: ""I wasn't raised that way"". The 2021 US Open winner faced criticism for her decision, which marked the end of Murray's stint at the All England Club.

The two-time Wimbledon champion had already bowed out of the men's singles and been defeated in the doubles alongside his brother Jamie.

Shelton, who has already sailed into the second round of the French Open after triumphing over Lorenzo Sonego, was confronted with a dilemma at Wimbledon last year. He had soared to the fourth round in the men's singles while simultaneously competing in doubles with Mackenzie McDonald.

Raducanu, who withdrew citing stiffness in her right wrist, had also advanced to the women's singles fourth round, leaving Judy Murray, Andy's mother, astounded by the withdrawal — remarks she later described as sarcastic.

Yet even as his own singles success beckoned, Shelton did not forget the commitment he made to McDonald, promising to uphold it despite progressing in the singles competitions.

""Yeah, I mean, whenever you're on the schedule seven days straight, it's not something easy to deal with,"" the 22-year-old said. ""I think five of those days I was - five or six of those days I was actually on a court playing.

""Maybe six. So it's not an easy thing to deal with, but I signed up for it. I signed up to play doubles yesterday. Played two extra sets after my singles match, and that's my decision.""

Shelton didn't bring up Raducanu directly but candidly expressed his dedication to the game and to his partner, stating: ""I think a lot of people probably would have pulled out of doubles in that situation, but I didn't want to do that to my partner.

""He's been waiting around for four, four and a half days to play doubles with me. I'm not just going to pull out on the guy. I think it's a selfish thing to do. Just kind of wasn't raised that way.""

In light of Raducanu's Monday match at Roland Garros, where she required medical assistance against Wang Xinyu, the Brit mentioned apologizing to Murray again, expressing her regret and anticipation for a future conversation: ""I hope he's forgiven me for last year, I still feel bad about it,"" she commented.

""I'm looking forward to seeing him around and having a conversation. I think he would give great advice, he's been in a similar situation and would probably understand a lot of things that I'm also going through. But as to anything more, I don't know, that's very far out of thought.""

PARIS (AP) — Naomi Osaka still wore the pink accessories in her hair inspired by “sakura” — cherry blossoms — and there were streaks on her cheeks where tears had rolled, when she sat down for a French Open news conference after her first-round loss to Paula Badosa on Monday.

Osaka's red eyes welled as she answered a few questions before needing a break and briefly leaving the interview room following the 6-7 (1), 6-1, 6-4 exit against the 10th-seeded Badosa.

“As time goes on, I feel like I should be doing better. But also — I kind of talked about this before, maybe a couple years ago, or maybe recently, I'm not sure — I hate disappointing people,” said Osaka, who owns four Grand Slam trophies from the hard courts of the U.S. Open and Australian Open but never has been past the third round on the red clay of Roland-Garros.

Then, referring to her current coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, who used to work with Serena Williams, Osaka said: “He goes from working with, like, the greatest player ever to, like, ‘What the (expletive) is this?' You know what I mean? Sorry for cursing. I hope I don't get fined.”

Osaka, who was born in Japan and moved to the United States as a young child, was undone Monday by 54 unforced errors. That was twice as many as Badosa, whose best showing at a major was a semifinal run at the Australian Open in January and who reached the quarterfinals at Roland-Garros in 2021.

After taking the opening set, Osaka was treated by a trainer for hand blisters and also took time to clip her sakura-themed fingernails on the sideline.

She attributed the blisters, which also bothered her at the Italian Open this month, to “the friction of clay, because I don't have blisters on any other surface.”

Osaka's powerful serves and groundstrokes are dulled by the clay, and that showed against Badosa. Osaka was broken five times and finished with nearly as many double-faults, five, as aces, seven.

Once ranked No. 1 and currently No. 49, Osaka withdrew from the French Open in 2021 before her second-round match, explaining that she experiences “huge waves of anxiety” before speaking to the media and revealing she had dealt with depression. She then took multiple mental health breaks away from the tour.

She helped usher in a change in the way athletes, sports fans and society at large understood the importance of mental health.

A year ago at Roland-Garros, Osaka played one of her best matches since returning to action after becoming a mother, coming within a point of upsetting eventual tournament champion Iga Swiatek.

On Monday, after taking a break from questions, she returned to field one query from a Japanese journalist with an eye to the next major tournament, Wimbledon, which begins on grass on June 30.

“I don't necessarily know my grass-season schedule right now,” Osaka said. “I wasn't really expecting to lose in the first round.”

TENNIS prodigy Learner Tien has enjoyed a whirlwind year so far.

At the start of 2025 he earned his first win at a Grand Slam, beating Camilo Ugo Carabelli in the opening round of the Australian Open.

He then sparked a huge upset after beating fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in round two.

The 19-year-old made it to the fourth round - becoming the youngest man since Rafael Nadal in 2005 to do so - by easing past Corentin Moutet in straight sets before eventually losing to Lorenzo Sonego.

Tien's outstanding Australian Open campaign saw him jump from No121 to No67 in the world rankings.

And now he is one of the most exciting prospects in tennis.

Discussing his start in the sport, Tien told The Guardian in March: ""I started when I was little older than one.

""I think [it was] one of my dad's old rackets that were lying around. So they didn't really even expect for me or my sister to start playing tennis that young. So it's not like they were prepped with little kiddy rackets or anything.

""My parents would play recreationally. I got to the courts a couple times a week, just with my dad, just watching him play in random men's leagues.

""So that's kind of how I got introduced. Eventually my dad started taking me to the courts, randomly feeding me balls from a pretty young age, and then it kind of just progressed from there on.""

Tien's passion for tennis picked up when he started school at the age of 11.

He was homeschooled throughout the early years of his life by his mother, a retired teacher, who named him in homage to her profession.

The tennis ace continued: ""The tennis wasn't really in the picture yet.

""My sister is a few years older than me, so my mom retired when my sister was born, so she was already just at home with my sister starting to teach my sister. So she just thought she'd teach me, too.

""I started school young. I would work through the year. I wouldn't have summer break and stuff like that. I would just work throughout the year.

""I obviously like tennis more than I like school, so it was a good motivation for me to kind of get away from school just to go and play. But throughout juniors, my parents did a very good job, honestly, of not putting a lot of pressure on me to win.""

Tien is now set to face Alexander Zverev in the first round of the French Open on Wednesday.

It will be his first appearance in the main draw at Roland Garros.

American Taylor Fritz suffered a surprise first-round defeat against Germany's Daniel Altmaier at the French Open on Monday.

Altmaier triumphed 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 against fourth-seed Fritz, who becomes the first major casualty of the men's draw at Roland-Garros.

The loss marks Fritz's earliest exit at the French Open since 2018 and his earliest at any grand slam since the 2022 US Open.

“It was very special,” said Altmaier after recording his fifth victory against an opponent ranked inside the top 10, per the ATP Tour. “I think I was working really hard the past weeks to get confidence, preparing myself for those kinds of matches.

“I feel like I'm ready to play whoever is going to face me. I'm really happy to get this first win and I really love my performance.”

The world No. 66 will next face the Czech Republic's Vit Kopriva in the second round on Wednesday.

Having finished runner-up to Jannik Sinner at last year's US Open, Fritz has now had two disappointing defeats at majors this season – the loss against Altmaier adding to a third-round exit at the Australian Open in January.

He converted just one of his five break points in Monday's match and managed 34 winners – 14 of which were aces – compared to Altmaier's 46.

The 27-year-old Fritz wasn't the only high-ranked American to lose in the opening round at Roland-Garros. In the women's draw, ninth seed Emma Navarro was thrashed 6-0, 6-1 by Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in just 57 minutes.

According to ESPN, Navarro is the third woman seeded in the top 10 to win just one game in the first round of a grand slam, following Monica Seles at the 2001 Australian Open and Anna Chakvetadze at the 2008 Australian Open.

Elsewhere in the women' draw, Spanish 10th seed Paula Badosa triumphed 6-7(1), 6-1, 6-4 against four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka, who wore pink bows in her hair and an outfit inspired by the cherry blossoms of her native Japan.

It means that Osaka, currently ranked No. 49 in the world, has not progressed past the second round of the French Open since 2019.

Title rivals Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner start their French Open campaigns on Monday as three-time reigning champion Iga Swiatek hopes a return to Roland Garros can shake her out of a slump.

Alcaraz beat Sinner in straight sets in the Italian Open final just over a week ago as the Italian world number one returned from a three-month doping ban.

The Spaniard edged Sinner in five sets in the semi-finals at Roland Garros last year and believes the two-time reigning Australian Open champion will pose an even greater threat to his crown in Paris after brushing off the cobwebs in Rome.

""The level he has played in (Rome) is insane after three months without playing, without any tournament,"" said Alcaraz.

""I'm pretty sure he's going to be better and better.

""If he's winning in Roland Garros and he's going farther, I think much better he's going to feel. He's going to be a really dangerous player in Paris.""

First up for Alcaraz though is Italian qualifier Giulio Zeppieri, who replaced the injured Kei Nishikori in the draw.

Sinner takes centre stage in the night session against Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, who can expect to enjoy much of the support under the lights on Court Philippe Chatrier.

It is the first of two successive potential French opponents for Sinner, who could meet the retiring Richard Gasquet in the second round. Gasquet, 38, takes on another wild card, Terence Atmane, in his 22nd and final Roland Garros.

""It's definitely going to be different,"" Sinner said of the atmosphere that awaits in Paris after he received a warm welcome back in front of home fans in Italy.

""It was great after three months coming back making the final. It was my first big final on clay, which is not to underrate, because we worked a lot for that.""

But he warned against expecting too much at the French Open.

""There are no miracles. I need some time. Matches are different than practice sessions,"" said Sinner. ""There is a lot of room to improve.""

Sinner served a suspension for testing positive twice in March last year for traces of the banned anabolic steroid clostebol. Doping authorities accepted that it was the result of an accidental contamination involving his physio.

- Swiatek reign under threat -

Swiatek, like her idol Rafael Nadal, has proved almost untouchable at Roland Garros, where she holds a 35-2 win-loss record in six trips.

But her struggles since the last of her four French Open titles is well documented and the Pole has gone almost a year without a trophy.

She has dropped to fifth in the world ranking and has lost her aura of invincibility on the red dirt.

However, her early exit from the Italian Open earlier this month has provided Swiatek more time to prepare for Paris and she said she has used that time well.

""You know, right now, I felt like I had the most peaceful time to practice since the beginning of the season,"" Swiatek told AFP last week.

""It has been going great. And on a practice court, I feel really good. We were working on some details in my serve and my forehand. But overall, you know, it looks great. I just need to implement that during the matches.""

Swiatek kicks off her title defence against Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova.

Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka, who had a match point against Swiatek in the second round at Roland Garros a year ago, has a tough opening match against 10th seed Paula Badosa.

Australian Open champion Madison Keys plays Australian qualifier Daria Saville in round one. Former Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina also plays a qualifier in Argentina's Julia Riera.

Stan Wawrinka, the 2015 French Open champion, is drawn against Britain's Jacob Fearnley, while two-time runner-up Casper Ruud faces Spanish qualifier Albert Ramos-Vinolas.

Holger Rune, the only man to beat Alcaraz on clay this year, goes up against Roberto Bautista Agut. Fourth seed Taylor Fritz and 2021 finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas are also in action.

Emma Raducanu is set for her first Roland Garros appearance since her 2022 debut, taking on China's Wang Xinyu.

Flavio Cobolli clinched the biggest title of his career at the Bitpanda Hamburg Open, and with it stormed to a career-high No. 26 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

Fellow Italian Lorenzo Musetti is also up to a career high, while finalist at the Gonet Geneva Open, Hubert Hurkacz, has climbed back into the Top 30. ATPTour.com looks at the movers in the PIF ATP Rankings, as of Monday, 26 May.



No. 26 Flavio Cobolli, +9 (Career High) 

Cobolli's mid-season charge picked up pace in Hamburg, where he captured his second title of the season following his maiden triumph in Bucharest last month. The Italian, who went winless in his opening seven tour-level matches this year, has turned his form around and has risen nine spots to a career-high No. 26.

Cobolli's run to the title in Hamburg was highlighted by straight-sets victories over fifth seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the second round, and former champion Rublev in the final.







No. 7 Lorenzo Musetti, +1 (Career High)

Despite not competing on the ATP Tour last week, Musetti has risen one spot to a career-high No. 7 after Casper Ruud did not defend his title at the Swiss ATP 250. In Rome earlier this month, Musetti became the first Italian in history to reach the semi-finals at all three clay ATP Masters 1000 events in one season. Having already started his Roland Garros campaign with a straight-sets victory Sunday against Yannick Hanfmann, the 23-year-old is 23-5 on clay since last July, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.
No. 15 Andrey Rublev, +2 

With his run to a third championship match in Hamburg, Rublev has climbed two places to No. 15. Although the 27-year-old was unable to claim a second title at the ATP 500 (after his 2020 win), he appears to be rounding into form after slipping to No. 17, which was his lowest position since January 2020.
No. 28 Hubert Hurkacz, +3 

Hurkacz delivered a series of statement performances to reach the final at the ATP 250 in Geneva without dropping a set, and has moved up three places to No. 28 with his run. The Pole defeated top seed Taylor Fritz en route and led by a break in the deciding set against Novak Djokovic in the final, but the Serbian roared back to claim his 100th tour-level trophy. Hurkacz, the former World No. 6, has won seven of his past nine tour-level matches.






No. 49 Roberto Bautista Agut, +8 

Roberto Bautista Agut has jumped eight spots to No. 49 with his run to the quarter-finals in Hamburg, where he was defeated by Cobolli. The 37-year-old earned Lexus ATP Head2Head wins over Marcos Giron and second seed Frances Tiafoe en route to that stage, and has climbed inside the Top 50 for the first time in seven months. Bautista Agut boasts a career-high World No. 9.

No. 27 Felix Auger-Aliassime, +3
No. 34 Jiri Lehecka, +3
No. 36 Matteo Arnaldi, +3

Jay Clarke is back in the winner's circle on the ATP Challenger Tour. The Briton secured his fourth crown at that level and first since May 2022 by winning the Macedonian Open in Skopje, North Macedonia.

The 26-year-old earned a commanding 6-2, 6-3 win over Nerman Fatic in Saturday's final, during which Clarke converted all four of his break points, according to Infosys ATP Stats, sealing the win in 84 minutes. Clarke, who is up 64 spots to No. 186 in the PIF ATP Rankings, did not drop a set en route to the title.

""I am very very happy with this week. I actually love playing here,"" he said.

""It was a very tough for week for me. But I am very happy I've had a lot of wins this year.""

In other Challenger action, Saba Purtseladze completed a dream week on Saturday at the Mziuri Cup in Tbilisi, where he clinched his maiden title at that level on home soil.

The 23-year-old defeated #NextGenATP Italian Federico Cina 7-6(5), 6-4 in the championship match. Purtseladze won 81 per cent (25/43) of his first-serve points and saved all three break points he faced en route to a one-hour, 33-minute victory.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Gasquet's final farewell: Bidding adieu to tennis' French artiste","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/richard-gasquet-retirement-tribute-2025","Mon, 26 May 2025 06:36:08 GMT","

Tennis photographer Corinne Dubreuil vividly recalls working a junior tournament in Blois in July 1995 for France's Tennis Magazine. The reporter on site with her rushed over with news of an impressive nine-year-old.

“My colleague came to me and said ‘Corinne, Corinne, you have to come to Court 3 and see this little guy',” Dubreuil said. “He's so amazing. He has a one-handed backhand. Crazy, crazy.”

Dubreuil took some photos of the young player and like her colleague was impressed. They spoke of the player to their superiors at the publication, who contacted the boy's family and decided to produce a full report, which turned into a cover story.

The boy's name was Richard Gasquet.

Early in 1996, Dubreuil visited the Frenchman in Sérignan, located in the south of France, to photograph him at home and document him playing tennis and at the beach. She took a famous portrait of Gasquet sitting in his bedroom with posters of the ATP Tour's biggest stars surrounding him. 

Across two walls were legends including Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, as well as Frenchmen Guy Forget, Henri Leconte and Marc Rosset. Little did Gasquet know one day he would become an international star, too.

A post shared by Richard Gasquet (@richardgasquet34)

The February 1996 edition of Tennis Magazine featured a striking cover in which the phenom was winding up to unleash a one-handed backhand. The headline read: “Le champion que la France attend?” In English, that means: “The champion that France is waiting for?”

That was a massive amount of pressure for a nine-year-old. There was no guarantee Gasquet would pursue tennis for a career, let alone become a professional. But over the next three decades he became one of the best players in the history of French tennis. 

Gasquet's backhand turned into one of the most feared shots in the sport and no matter how the Frenchman performs this Roland Garros — after which he will retire — his game will be remembered for generations to come. 

In 1999, Gasquet won the prestigious Les Petits As international junior tournament in France, and three years later he became the No. 1 junior in the world as a 16-year-old. But the first major splash the Frenchman made came earlier that year, when he won his ATP Tour debut at the 2002 Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters as a 15-year-old. 

Gasquet defeated former World No. 11 Franco Squillari 7-6(5), 3-6, 7-5 to become the youngest match winner in the history of the Tour (since 1990). Nobody has broken his record since.

Watch Highlights:

Even aged 15, the Frenchman's talent was clear. As was the case for the next 23 years, Gasquet was already crafting jaw-dropping backhands according to Squillari.

“My crosscourt forehand was my best shot and I thought before [the match] I would do my best with his backhand and his backhand was unbelievable,” Squillari told ATPTour.com. “He [did not make] a mistake more than three hours from his backhand. Okay, I [then] played to his forehand and from his forehand he didn't make a mistake, too. He's a very complete player.”

The 16-time ATP Tour titlist became known for his artistic game, creating unthinkable angles with his one-handed backhand and playing aggressively with his forehand when he needed to. The Frenchman was as meticulous with his strategy as he was with his grip, which he redid at nearly every changeover, more than anyone else on the ATP Tour.

Gasquet first broke into the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Rankings on 29 September 2023, shortly after his 17th birthday. From 18 April 2005 through 14 January 2024, he spent nearly 19 consecutive years inside the Top 100.

The 38-year-old has earned 609 tour-level wins, more than any Frenchman on record according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Two years ago, after earning his 600th win to join Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray as the fourth active player to reach the milestone (Nadal and Murray have since retired), Gasquet joked, ""Of course I'm the worst by far!"" 

Most Wins By A Frenchman




A three-time major semi-finalist and a three-time ATP Masters 1000 finalist, the only thing that prevented Gasquet from claiming titles at the biggest events was competing against the likes of Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer. All six of his losses in those critical matches came against one of those three players. The Frenchman defeated Djokovic and Federer in his career, but lost all 18 of his Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings with Nadal.

“He was very close in the beginning of his career with Nadal,” Squillari said. “But unfortunately, Nadal was one of the best of four or five players on Tour in history. That was not good news for Richard.” 

When Squillari lost to a 15-year-old Gasquet, it was difficult to take as a former World No. 11. But time has shown that the teen turned into a star, who climbed to a career-high World No. 7.

“He [won] more than 600 matches. I lost against one of the [biggest] players on Tour,” Squillari said. “If you lost in the French Open against [Michael] Chang [when he was] only 16 years, 20 years after you say ‘Okay, it was not too bad'. And I say now, it was not too bad.”



Gasquet recently appeared on the ‘Nothing Major' podcast, named because the four American former professional players who host it never won a major. They joked that Gasquet fit in with them, unless he wins Roland Garros over the coming fortnight.

“Zero chance,” Gasquet said, cracking a laugh. “But if there is a non-major [list] as you do, I think I would be seeded, I would be Top 10.”

The son of a father who ran a local tennis club made history in his first tour-level event and will also do so in his last tournament. By competing in Roland Garros this year, he sets the new Open-Era record for main-draw appearances in the tournament.

“It's the end, maybe the last match of your career. Hard to say,” Gasquet said of his expecations of the moment. “It's special, but I'm happy to do this, I'm happy to play here one last time. I'm practically 39 years old. I never thought I was going to be playing such a long time.

“I'm lucky enough to be able to do it here one last time. I know what that represents, to play in a tournament like this. So I'm going to try to enjoy it from beginning to end and give my all. It's sport. You never know what's going to happen.”

France hoped a nine-year-old Gasquet would turn into a champion, and that he did.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Eyes closed for Alcaraz before his Roland Garros opener","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-roland-garros-2025-eyes-closed","Mon, 26 May 2025 01:22:41 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz had arranged to meet Albert Ramos-Viñolas on Sunday morning on Court 5 at Roland Garros for his final practice session before his Monday opener against Giulio Zeppieri. However, the Spaniard turned up half an hour early in the company of Juan Carlos Ferrero and Samuel López, his two coaches, to work on one specific part of the game: his return.

With his brother Alvaro serving, for some time the 22-year-old was trying to get the ball back in play with something of a disadvantage. Alcaraz kept his eyes closed until he heard the sound of the ball on the other side of the net.

In an effort to improve his reaction time, the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings faced his brother's serve without seeing a thing until the moment the strings made contact with the ball, generating a sound that signalled to Alcaraz it was time to open his eyes and make his move.

With the exercise, which he repeated for more than 15 minutes, the four-time Grand Slam champion sought to perfect the instinct required to be quick and accurate on the return, thus fine-tuning that part of his game the day before kicking off the defence of his title, which he won last year by defeating Alexander Zverev in the final.

The Spaniard, who is always looking for ways to improve his game, made changes to his serve in the preseason. His new action is more relaxed, with a looser wrist. By no longer stopping when the racquet reaches its peak, he has improved the flow of his technique. The stats show that these changes have translated into an improved delivery, and the Murcia native has capitalised on it so far in 2025 with three titles (Rotterdam, Monte Carlo and Rome).



Alcaraz, on Sunday was present at the tribute to Rafael Nadal inside Court Philippe-Chatrier, but now will turn his focus to his first-round match Monday against Italian qualifier Zeppieri.

The second seed is charged with defending his title at the season's second Grand Slam tournament. He will pursue his second Coupe des Mousquetaires.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Roland Garros Day 2 preview: Now comes the hard part for Madison Keys","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4273303/roland-garros-day-2-preview-now-comes-the-hard-part-for-madison-keys","Mon, 26 May 2025 02:05:33 GMT","

As Grand Slam champion Madison Keys begins her Paris campaign, a loaded Monday lineup also includes Naomi Osaka, Emma Navarro and Barbora Krejcikova.

What happens when, after years of trying, you finally achieve your wildest dream? How do you move forward and stay motivated?

Madison Keys, winner of the year's first Grand Slam, has some thoughts.

“From the time I was 14, I just always wanted to win a Grand Slam, and what would that feel like?” Keys told reporters at Roland Garros. “For 16 years, it was just always kind of still the elusive question, and then to finally achieve it and feel that success, have that achievement and then go home and then think, `OK, wait, this is the first time that I don't not know anymore.'

“It's, `I did it.' So I think that's just the biggest thing. Just kind of shifting past goals that you have now achieved and setting new ones.”

Working on a 7-0 winning streak in the majors -- the last two victories against Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka -- Keys begins her first Slam as a major champion.

Here's a look at Monday's best matches:

No. 10 Paula Badosa vs. Naomi Osaka

Head-to-head: 0-0.

It's a dreamy matchup between 27-year-olds: Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion and former World No. 1, opposite Badosa, who has been ranked as high as No. 2.

How has this not happened before?

One of the best matches Osaka played last year was a second-round loss to four-time French Open champion Iga Swiatek. The score was 7-6(1), 1-6, 7-5, and it revealed that Osaka could be a threat on her least-successful surface. This was confirmed when she won the recent WTA 125 in Saint-Malo and won three matches in Rome.

Osaka has won five of her previous seven first-round matches at Roland Garros.

Badosa, meanwhile, reached the third round in each of her previous four appearances. After going 2-5 in the first round of Grand Slams, she's working on a 13-match win streak.

The Spaniard is coming back from a back injury and advanced to the quarterfinals last week in Strasbourg before falling to Liudmila Samsonova.

No. 7 Madison Keys vs. qualifier Daria Saville

Head-to-head: 1-1, both matches coming on clay in 2016.

Keys has been mostly money in first-round matches at Roland Garros, winning 11 of 13. She's also won 11 straight first-rounders in majors, the last misstep coming at the 2021 US Open at the hands of fellow American Sloane Stephens.

Good news and bad news: Saville has won five of eight career clay-court matches against Top 10 opponents -- but the last time it happened was seven years ago.

No. 9 Emma Navarro vs. Jessica Bouzas Maneiro

Head-to-head: 0-0.

Navarro is coming off a grueling, three-hour loss to Beatriz Haddad Maia in the Strasbourg quarterfinals -- and this is her fifth event of the clay season. Her first appearance at Roland Garros, two years ago, resulted in a second-round loss. Last year, she progressed to the Round of 16.

Bouzas Maneiro has made three straight second rounds at the majors but is 1-4 against Top 10 players. Bouzas Maneiro has defeated one Top 50 opponent on clay.

No. 12 Elena Rybakina vs. qualifier Julia Riera

Head-to-head: 0-0.

The original draw called for Rybakina to play Belinda Bencic, but an arm injury forced the Swiss player to withdraw. Rybakina won four matches and the title in Strasbourg on Saturday -- her first in more than a year -- and has a quick turnaround. Riera, a 22-year-old from Argentina and ranked No. 202, won three qualifying matches and six of seven sets.





 Jimmie48/WTA
                        

No. 15 Barbora Krejcikova vs. Tatjana Maria

Head-to-head: 0-0.

Krejcikova sat out of six months, nursing a lingering back injury but came back last week in Strasbourg. She lost her opening singles and doubles matches but will be encouraged  by a return to Paris, scene of her first Grand Slam singles title in 2021.

Maria, 37 and mother of two daughters, lost her first match at Roland Garros the past five attempts. This is her 11th main draw.

No. 17 Daria Kasatkina vs. Katerina Siniakova

Head-to-head: 5-1, Kasatkina. She won the first four matches from 2017-20, but since then it's 1-all. 

Three years ago in Hamburg, Siniakova won in three sets, while Kasatkina was a straight-sets winner last fall in Ningbo.

Kasatkina, playing her first major under the Australian flag, comes in with a 2-3 record on clay -- but knows what it feels like to go deep in Paris. She was a quarterfinalist in 2018 and reached the semifinals in 2022. Her overall record here is a tidy 17-7.

Siniakova, playing her 11th French Open, was the doubles champion in 2018, 2021 (with Barbora Krejcikova) and last year with Coco Gauff.

Other notable matches:

No. 20 Ekaterina Alexandrova vs. Lucia Bronzetti

Katie Boulter vs. qualifier Carole Monnet

Veronika Kudermetova vs. Viktoriya Tomova

Wild card Leolia Jeanjean vs. Irina-Camelia Begu

Wild card Diane Parry vs. Robin Montgomery

Rafael Nadal bid an emotional farewell at Roland Garros with a grand tribute attended by champions Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek. The ceremony featured video montages, cameos from Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, and Andy Murray, and special ""Merci, Rafa"" T-shirts for fans. Swiatek, a longtime Nadal fan, was moved to tears.

Rafael Nadal said an emotional farewell to Roland Garros on Sunday -- and Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek had a front-row seat to the spectacular tribute.

Last year's champions were among the thousands of fans who gathered inside Court Philippe-Chatrier to celebrate 14-time tournament champion Nadal's legacy on the first day of this year's tournament, one which also featured several video montages, and cameo appearances by his greatest rivals Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray.

Tournament director and former World No. 1 Amélie Mauresmo promised since April that Roland Garros would give an ""exceptional"" send-off to its most prolific champion following his official retirement from tennis last November. Nadal had previously declined to be celebrated after his final Roland Garros match -- a first-round loss to Alexander Zverev last year -- and Sunday's ceremony saw several unforgettable moments. All fans in attendance -- including Alcaraz and Swiatek -- were gifted burnt-orange T-shirts that read ""Merci, Rafa"" as a part of the celebration, transforming the seats into a living tribute to the clay courts that Nadal dominated.

Hailing the Spaniard as her idol since her earliest days on tour, Swiatek predicted in her pre-tournament press conference on Friday that ""for sure"" she'd cry if she attended the ceremony -- and a balled up wad of tissues in her hand in photos she posted to social media confirmed that the spectacle brought tears to her eyes.

""Your legacy will last forever @rafaelnadal,"" she wrote on Instagram, adding the hashtag #yesicried.

Less than 24 hours later, Swiatek was back on Chatrier -- beating Rebecca Sramkova for her 22nd straight match win at Roland Garros -- and revealed in her on-court interview that it was tough to ""keep it together"" watching her idol overcome by his own feelings.

""I needed to be brave!"" she said. ""Seeing Rafa crying also made me more emotional. It's nice that he shows emotions that way, and he shows us that he's human. I really like what Roland Garros did yesterday, especially the footprint there. I'm happy that it's going to stay here forever, because I think Rafa deserves it and deserves even more.

""It's great that the whole tennis world could come together and show our appreciation, and tell Rafa that we're really thankful for everything that he did and so many emotions that he gave us when we watched. He's a huge inspiration, and even when he's not playing, even being here yesterday, inspired me a lot. So thanks Rafa.""

Down 15-30, Jessica Bouzas Maneiro had history on her racquet. The 22-year-old Spaniard was up big—so much that she was attempting to become the first woman to defeat a Top 10 player 6-0, 6-0 at a Grand Slam since Martina Navratilova obliterated world No. 7 Manuela Maleeva in the 1989 US Opqn quarterfinals.There were two notable differences today at Roland Garros: first, this was a first-round match, not a quarterfinal where Top 10 players can collide. Second, Bouzas Maneiro is ranked 68th, not second as the legendary Navratilova was.Navratilova's distinction remains safe, as Navarro got on the board with a Bouzas Maneiro double fault. The American raised her arm to the sky in a wry celebration.

Just one game later, though, and the Bouzas Maneiro demolition on dirt was complete. Navarro's stats were ghastly: she won just 44% of her first-serve points and 22% on second serve. She broken seven times, struck 23 unforced errors and hit just four winners.Bouzas Maneiro won 56 of the 86 total points played in a ladies' sweep, if you will.""That is a devastating loss,"" said Mark Petchey on truTV.

Although it helped them to secure a double points finish, Williams pair Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz were left frustrated by the “messy” midfield strategy of drivers slowing down the pack to allow their team mate to claim a free pit stop in Monaco.

Williams were keen to continue their run of both drivers finishing in the top 10, which has now been extended to four races, but to do so they had to deploy some unusual tactics to keep their rivals at bay.

MONACO LOWDOWN: All the key moments as Norris realises a dream, Racing Bulls shine and famous faces enjoy the show


Racing Bulls were the first team to deploy the move, which involved the team mate further back (Liam Lawson, in their case) purposefully driving at a reduced speed to back up those behind and open a larger gap to Isack Hadjar in front.

This allowed Hadjar to complete his two compulsory pit stops with a significantly minimised threat of losing positions, as the margin back to Lawson was big enough for him to emerge ahead of the pack. While it frustrated everyone else in the train, including Albon, it was an effective play that Williams also used to get both cars into the points.

Team orders meant that Sainz allowed Albon to pass him for P9

“I didn't like it, I don't think Carlos liked it,” Albon said after the race. “It's not really how we want to go racing. In the end it's a tactical game and we had to make it work.

“The RB started it and we knew if they started it, we had to match it. It just makes this messy race. I could have brought a pillow in the car and a coffee and just chilled out a little bit, but in a weird way it's actually quite hard to keep your focus when you're driving around that slowly.

INSIGHT: What it feels like to complete a high-speed lap around Monaco's famous streets


“It's not pretty but I'm glad we got points for the team. Realistically, we lost the race on Saturday and we just missed out on tyres. You pay the price here as you saw today. You start where you finish and that was it.

“Frustrating not to come away with more points but at the same time we're just chipping away at it. I think this weekend's been a bit disappointing. It feels like we didn't maximise what we could have achieved and instead got a few angry drivers behind me!”

Racing Bulls' tactic with Lawson dictated the Monaco midfield battle

Sainz similarly branded Lawson's driving an attempt to “manipulate the pace”, but admitted that repeating the tactic helped Williams to cross the line in P9 and P10 rather than languishing outside of the points.

In fact, the tail end of the top 10 is beginning to become a disappointment for the Grove outfit as Albon has proved they can finish as high as P5, which he has achieved on three occasions across the campaign.

Sainz explained: “It's a good sign that with ninth and 10th, we're coming out of the weekend frustrated. Before for Williams, ninth and 10th was a huge result so I'll take that as a positive.

“I had a bit of an off weekend until the race. In the race, I felt quick but we need to make sure we are back on the pace in Barcelona, even though Barcelona should be a tricker track for us.”

Showrunner Molly Smith Metzler, director Nicole Kassell, stars Fahy and Alcock stand by the Netflix series' unexpected finale: “I hope this is a debate people are having.” 


							By 

	Lexy Perez


Associate Editor


[This story contains major spoilers from the season finale of Netflix's Sirens.]


	Throughout Netflix's five-episode series Sirens, viewers hace watched Devon (Meghann Fahy) try to lure her sister Simone (Milly Alcock) away from the lavish community she now resides in while working for and being uncomfortably close with socialite Michaela “Kiki” Kell (Julianne Moore), who reigns supreme on the island along with her husband Peter Kell (Kevin Bacon). Though determined to convince Simone to come back home to Buffalo to help her with their ailing father (Bill Camp), the series then ends where it began, with the matriarch of the Cliff House standing on the edge of the cliff overlooking the ocean — only this time, it's Simone standing there instead of Michaela.

	After Moore's Michaela fired Simone as her assistant after seeing a photograph of Simone and Peter kissing (a kiss that Bacon's Peter initiated, leaving a shocked Simone to run off), Simone went back to Peter and Peter left Michaela. The ending of Simone betraying Michaela by becoming Peter's new partner could be rather surprising for viewers given Simone and Michaela had a tight-knit relationship. But there's also the fact that a much older Peter, who is believed to be easy-going and approachable despite his notable wealth, had his sights set on Simone as his new love to begin with.


	Meanwhile, Devon left the island sans Simone to return to Buffalo to continue caring for her father. She also saw Michaela departing, and is now left to pick up the pieces, no longer being Mrs. Kell. The ending was one Fahy found “surprising” and left Alcock feeling “really sad.”


	“Ultimately, we want Simone to be the person that the audience ends up seeing her as, which is this broken little girl who's so much more capable than she believes herself to be,” Alcock tells The Hollywood Reporter. “The fact that she chooses the path she's chosen reinforces that stigma and narrative where she needs a man in financial stability to provide for her. It made me incredibly sad finding out that was the ending.”


	Fahy adds to THR, “I was definitely surprised. But the more I thought about it, the more I felt like it was true that Simone would double down, do whatever it took to not have to go back to that place and that Devon would go back and not go with the guy, or anything.  think it hurts on some level to see both of them make the choices they make, because you want so much better for them. But it felt right. It felt true they would make those choices.”

	











	Showrunner Molly Smith Metzler says the ending, however surprising, was inevitable. “What I love about the ending is that it asks the audience to decide how to feel about it,” she recently said in an interview with THR. Executive producer Nicole Kassell, who directed the first two episodes, adds that though there is an “impulse” to “hate Simone” at the end, that's what the show is ultimately exploring.


	“Women are blamed for breaking up marriages. Devon's blamed for breaking up Ray's marriage, Michael is blamed for Peter's previous [marriage], but where is the accountability of the men? Historically we are all conditioned to shit on the women who break up relationships. But in Peter and Simone's case, he's targeting a woman 40 years younger and he can have more children, he can have this facade or fantasy of longevity in a way that a female can't just because of your ovaries,” Kassell explains.


	“It's a tale as old as Greek mythology time. Women are going to be cast in this role. Peters are going to do Peters. It's an old story. It's right there in front of us,” Metzler says. 


	Throughout the series, Fahy's Devon attempted to free Simone from what she deemed a cultish community, insisting she's a “traumatized little girl running from her past.” That past included losing their mom and growing up with a disregarding father. Simone may have found a new home and identity, but Alcock and Fahy agree that both things they're fighting for can be true. Simone is running from her past like Devon suggests, but Fahy says everyone is also refusing to respect her choices.

	











	“Objectively, as Millie, I think Simone is running from her past. But as Simone, I think she sees this as a complete survival tactic,” Alcock says. “What is her alternative? She dropped out of law school. She has no money. She'd be starting from ground zero. This is her golden ticket. This is her way out of her previous situation. She's willing to fight like tooth and nail to be there and to be safe.”


	She continues, “Simone, at face value, is really easy to dislike. She's someone who you're kind of instantly like, ‘oh my god, this girl is completely insufferable.' She's performing chronically to everybody she's with. She's completely an inconsistent person; that's her response to her trauma. Her rebellion is to put herself in a position where she is safe and in an environment where she has a certain type of value and is seen as valuable, because the parental figures in her life never did that. She's still this sad, lost little girl.”


	Devon's determination to bring Simone back home to help her take care of their dad is palpable given she “genuinely needs help,” Fahy says, but admits Devon is being selfish. “She is sort of refusing to acknowledge her sister's wants and needs because she wants what she wants. Her sort of refusal to accept what is true in pursuit of her own want and need is part of the negative end of what she's set out to do by going there to drag her sister back to what is inarguably, a really shitty situation.”


	But for viewers wanting a clear answer as to why Simone stays and essentially replaces Michaela as Peter's wife, Kassell reminds everyone that Simone's background is the key to understanding. With no family, home or career anymore, Simone had to make a choice.

	











	Kassell reflects, “If we didn't have that context, she would seem like just pure shit selfish. But that's where I feel like she's almost the most honest. Michaela is collateral damage, and she wouldn't have done that had she not gotten fired. She would have run the foundation. She really would have done a great job as Michaela's second in command, but when that opportunity went away, and it was either this or that, I understand. I don't endorse. But when I think about a past that is so unimaginable and this as a path out, it puts me in that uncomfortable place of both wanting to hate her for it, but feeling like I have to understand. As a woman I understand if your whole life has been to escape a horrific background.”


	“I think she needs to survive, and that's what she does to survive,” Meltzer notes. 


	And the showrunner knows there will be debates about it. “Ppeople are going to think Simone's a villain, and people are going to think Peter's a villain, and people are gonna to think they're all villains,” she adds. “I can't ask you to feel a certain way about what Simone does. All I can ask is that you try to understand it. If you were in her shoes, and that ferry is leaving to take you back to certain trauma and destitute, what would you do? That's what I hope people are talking about. I hope this is a debate people are having. It's a question that interests me so much, I wrote a damn five episode series.”

	











	As for Devon, she may leave the way she came, however she now has a newer understanding after confronting her compulsive addictions and past trauma. She decides to move out and live separately from her dad but still be there to help care for him, just now ensuring she won't lose herself to do so. She also has an epiphany about Michaela. In a final conversation, she tells Michaela that she doesn't think she's a monster, which Michaela also says about Simone. The two then have a mutual understanding and newfound agency as they bid Simone and Cliff House farewell.


	“These two women go through something over the course of this weekend where they come out more similar than they would have guessed. They have more in common and see each other in the end with clear eyes,” Metzler says.


	“Devin appears to be someone who has a great sense of self, who is unapologetically who she wants to be wherever she goes. But as the series gets deeper, you start to realize that's a bit of a front, and she's really using several devices to keep people from getting too close,” Fahy says of her character being forced to confront and find some peace with her trauma.


	With Devon and Michaela now gone, the series ends with Simone looking out into the ocean from the cliff. Her expression is inscrutable, but the one thing that is clear is she's now living her life abiding by her own needs.


	“We went through all the different takes of Simone on the cliff at the end, and the one we chose for the final cut, she has a little bit of a Mona Lisa smile,” Metzler says. “I think her face is a little opaque. We chose that one because I think there's a version where she won — she's a siren and hear her roar.”

Managing Editor, Digital


Demi Lovato is married.


	The singer-actress wed singer-songwriter Jordan “Jutes” Lutes on Sunday afternoon in California, according to Vogue.




	The couple met in January 2022 while working on music for Lovato's album Holy Fvck, with Lutes co-writing her songs “Substance,” “Happy Ending,” and “City of Angels.” 


	Lutes proposed in December 2023, but he previously shared that they weren't in any rush to get married.


	“We're not trying to skip engagement to get right to wedding,” he told People last year. “We're just basking in it and soaking it up. We'll be married forever. We just want to enjoy every step.”

	For the ceremony, Lovato wore a pearl white Vivienne Westwood dress made with heavy silk satin fabric with a corset bodice, Vogue reported. Lovato told the outlet that she's been a fan of Westwood's designs “for a long time.” She changed into another Westwood-designed dress for the reception.


	Lovato, who recently made her directorial debut with the documentary Child Star, in which she also appeared, next stars in the film Tow opposite Rose Byrne and Dominic Sessa. She also is working on her next studio album.

Celebrity presenters included Kacey Musgraves, Finn Wolfhard, J Balvin and Mayu Matsuoka, while ‘Attack on Titan' was honored with the inaugural Global Impact Award.

Asia Bureau Chief


Solo Leveling was the big winner Sunday night at the 2025 Crunchyroll Anime Awards, taking home anime of the year, best action, best new series, and multiple performance and music honors in a starry ceremony that brought together anime's most passionate global fans. Held at the Grand Prince Hotel Shin Takanawa in Tokyo, the annual celebration honored the top talent in Japanese animation across 28 categories — drawing a record-breaking 51 million fan votes worldwide to decide the winners.


	In the feature film category, Look Back, the emotional adaptation of Tatsuki Fujimoto's one-shot manga, earned Film of the Year, while fan-favorite Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba added to its legacy with best continuing series and best animation. The genre-defying Dan Da Dan picked up several creative awards, including best opening sequence, best anime song, and best character design.

	Hosted for the third year in a row by voice actress Sally Amaki and entertainer Jon Kabira, this year's show again welcomed a diverse slate of celebrity presenters, further underlining anime's global appeal. Appearances were made by Grammy winner Kacey Musgraves, Stranger Things stars Finn Wolfhard and Gaten Matarazzo, Latin music icon J Balvin, Japanese actor Kanata Hongo and Japanese Academy Award-winner Mayu Matsuoka. Also on hand were singer Rina Sawayama, Brazilian pop star Pabllo Vittar, model Saya Ichikawa, actor Dean Fujioka and Damiano David of Maneskin fame.


	The night's most poignant moment came when Attack on Titan was awarded Crunchyroll's first-ever Global Impact Award, a new honor recognizing a franchise's profound influence on anime and global pop culture. Director Yuichiro Hayashi accepted the award on behalf of studio Mappa and the series' many creators, following the release of Attack on Titan: The Last Attack in late 2024, which concluded the long-running saga.


	Fans were also treated to live performances from some of anime music's biggest acts, including Creepy Nuts with their viral hit “Bling-Bang-Bang-Born” from Mashle: Magic and Muscles, Japanese rock legends Flow with “Days” in honor of Eureka Seven, and a three-song medley by J-pop star Lisa, including her Demon Slayer anthem “Gurenge.”

	











	“Fans form deep emotional connections to anime. These are not just series, films or songs, but rather works of art that help define the identity of anime fans,” said Rahul Purini, president of Crunchyroll. “With an incredible 51 million votes this year, the 2025 Anime Awards are celebrating the creators in Japan who have captured the hearts of fans and are powering anime's prominence in global pop culture.”


	Crunchyroll partnered with Sony Music Solutions Inc. and Dempsey Productions to deliver the high-energy show, which will be available to stream via Crunchyroll's YouTube and Twitch channels, as well as Sony Pictures Core and other Sony Group platforms.


	Sony Group has identified anime as a key pillar of its growth strategy, with Crunchyroll sitting at the center of its holdings in the sector. On Sony's most recent earnings call in May, the conglomerate revealed that Crunchyroll now counts 17 million subscribers worldwide. Crunchyroll, Aniplex and Sony Pictures will collaborate later this year on the North American and international release of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle, a trilogy of films that concludes what is currently the world's most bankable anime franchise. Crunchyroll and Aniplex are also co-producing an anime series based on the blockbuster samurai adventure PlayStation game Ghost of Tsushima.

Craig Mazin and Neil Druckman answer several burning questions about that season 2 cliffhanger finale: ""This show is going to be a different show every season."" 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


[This story contains spoilers for The Last of Us season two, episode seven.]


The Last of Us season two ended with a gunshot and a cryptic title card: “Seattle Day One.”




	What does it all mean? The Hollywood Reporter first spoke to co-creator Craig Mazin, and Mazin and co-creator Neil Druckmann also took questions from reporters during a finale press conference tackling several burning questions. 


	The first question, of course, is whether Ellie (Bella Ramsey) is dead from what seemed to be Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) shooting her (with a searing, “I let you live — and you wasted it!”).

	If you don't want to know the answer to that one, skip the rest of this paragraph. Mazin firmly says we haven't seen the last of Ellie. Also, the show has been extremely faithful in its adaptation of its source material, the PlayStation games The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II. In the game, Ellie survives this encounter with Abby and has a major role to play in the rest of the story. 


	As for the ending showing Abby being roused from sleeping and a “Seattle Day One” title card, this likely signals another shift in the show's narrative focus. While the creators declined to explicitly confirm this during interviews, just as the show's perspective shifted from Joel (Pedro Pascal) to Ellie, season three will likely shift again to tell Abby's story — assuming the show follows the tracks laid down by the game. This isn't just a clever narrative device, but part of the theme of the show. 


	“I don't think television is supposed to work like this,” Mazin says. “We're clearly breaking quite a few rules, and I love that. And I love it because that is the point. This is not something we're doing as a gimmick. The point of this story — and this is looked at from so many different angles in so many different ways — is that the entire concept of protagonist is flawed. The entire concept of villain is flawed. Our way of processing the world through heroes and villains is a mistake. It ends up creating these barriers between people that shouldn't be there. It ends up giving ourselves justifications and conveniences for bad behavior, and it ends up allowing us to judge others summarily for things that we don't quite understand the motivation behind it. We know this is a challenging thing to keep track of emotionally. We understand people are going to be provoked. But part of this story is about examining why we're so comfortable with following one person's point of view about everything.” 

	











	“Abby is the hero of her story,” Mazin added later. “Wherever we go next, we'll always be centering on somebody, whether it's Ellie and Dina, or Abby and Owen … [But] everything is under the cloud or sunlight of Joel — what Joel did to Abby and what Abby did to Joel.'”


	The finale also saw the death of Jesse (Young Mazino), who was shot by Abby. “It's an interesting situation because Jesse dies in part because of Ellie, but Ellie doesn't pull the trigger — Abby does,” Mazin says. “And we understand that Dina had this great relationship with Joel and she has gone in pursuit of Abby out of a sense of justice for that. So now the question is: Who does she blame [for Jesse's death]? Jesse's death is going to change things for her.” 


	Another big moment — and a very different one from the game — was the traumatic death of Abby's pregnant friend Mel (Ariela Barer). 


	“In the game, Ellie fights Owen (Spencer Lord), and then fights Mel, and it's only after Mel dies that her coat opens and Ellie realizes she's pregnant,” Mazin says. “But for this, Ellie is not really capable of killing Owen — you look at Bella and you look at Spencer Lord, he's 6'4″ and just incredibly imposing. A physical struggle wasn't going to go well, and she's not there to kill them. She just wants to kill Abby. I remember saying to Neil that as fucked up as that moment was in the game, I think it can be more fucked up and not to be a tormentor.”


	Continued Mazin: “Not to be a tormentor, but to just reflect reality, Mel is a doctor and understands in that moment as she's dying that there is a chance to save her child. This is ingrained in our theme — parents doing whatever they can to save their child. And poor Ellie in this circumstance is confronted by the horrible consequences of her pursuit and also a terrible panic. This is like my worst nightmare —somebody telling me how to save their child, and I don't understand what they're saying because they're running out of oxygen and slipping away. Bella sits back understanding the totality of her failure here, and what's even more heartbreaking is her failure isn't over yet. She just doesn't realize it.” 

	











	We also asked Mazin if Ellie — given her crushing experience with Mel — would have still killed Abby if Ellie had gotten the drop on her rather than the other way around. “I would say unquestionably,” Mazin says. “It wouldn't even be about whether she had it in her, it would be about what she doesn't have in her — which is any ability to restrain herself in the pursuit of that. I think Ellie would've crouched down right next to Abby and given a very similar speech to the one Abby gave to Joel.”  


	As for ending on a cliffhanger, Mazin says they did consider other ways to end the season. 


	“We considered everything,” Mazin says. “Maybe we should just interlace the stories [of Ellie and Abby]? I just remember saying, ‘Isn't [switching perspectives] part of the genetics of how this story functions?' It's just part of the genetics. Now what it means is we have to take risks as a television show, and HBO is backing us taking risks. But then again, we just did kill Pedro Pascal. Like [HBO] understands that this show is going to be a different show every season, which is a tricky thing to do when you're a hit show. You keep asking people like, ‘I know you love this, we're taking it away and giving you this now.'”


	Another key question: Will Joel appear in season three? Mazin made it sound like a potential flashback side trip featuring Joel and Tommy (Gabriel Luna) isn't off the table. “Next season we probably will have a lot more flexibility [to tell side stories],” Mazin says. “Maybe a side trip to do Joel and Tommy terrorizing the countryside, we'll never know. I wouldn't have guessed we'd have a short story about Joel's dad before we wrote the season.” And then later he said: “[Tommy's] been in war, and we also know that for some time, he and Joel were doing some pretty bad things. So there is the potential of seeing this other side of Tommy, and that is now about him delivering on his understood promise to his brother.” 

	











	The duo also teased season three — to some extent, as they didn't want to give anything crucial away. 


	“We're telling you that next season, one, there's an epic nature to everything that's about to happen,” Druckmann said. “But this other story is going to be really important coming backing to Joel and Ellie and everything we've seen so far.”


	Adds Mazin: “All I can say is we haven't seen the last of Kaitlyn Dever, and we haven't seen the last of Bella Ramsey, and we haven't seen the last of Isabela Merced, and we haven't even seen the last of a lot of people who are currently dead in the story.”

Ophuls was also behind the influential docs 'Hotel Terminus,' 'A Sense of Loss,' 'The Memory of Justice' and 'Veillees d'armes.'


							By 

	Duane Byrge


Marcel Ophuls, the Oscar-winning, German-born French filmmaker whose powerfully eloquent documentaries confronted difficult political, moral and philosophical issues, has died. He was 97.

Ophuls “died peacefully” at his home in the south of France, his grandson Andreas-Benjamin Seyfert told The Hollywood Reporter. 


Ophuls earned his Academy Award — as well as prizes from the Cannes and Berlin film festivals— for Hotel Terminus (1988), a 4-hour, 27-minute documentary that examined the life of the notorious Klaus Barbie, convicted in Bolivia of his Nazi war crimes in 1987.

	










Ophuls' best known work, however, came almost two decades earlier with The Sorrow and the Pity (1969), which explored the reality of the Nazi occupation in the small industrial French city of Clermont-Ferrand.

Ophuls spent more than two years compiling the more than 60 hours of footage that was eventually boiled down to that 4-hour, 11-minute film, which delineated France's compliance with Nazi Germany. (Some in the country supported Hitler and others joined the resistance, but most just went along for the ride.)

Sorrow and the Pity struck such a nerve in France that it was not shown in the country until 12 years after it was completed.

“Many people in France still think it gives a ‘message' about how the French behaved,” Ophuls told The New York Times in 2000. “This would be pompous, stupid and prosecutorial — to make a statement about a country that has been defeated and had to live under these conditions for four years.

“I did not set this up to set up France for being collaborators. In times of great crisis, we make decisions of life and death. It's a lot to ask people to become heroes. You shouldn't expect it of yourself and others.”

Pauline Kael in The New Yorker called Sorrow and the Pity “one of the most demanding films ever made.” In Life magazine, Richard Schickel declared it “a great human document.”

The Sorrow and the Pity also has a prominent place in Woody Allen's Annie Hall: It's the film that Allen's Alvy Singer drags his reluctant girlfriend (Diane Keaton) to see in a theater (Marshall McLuhan is there, too), and at the end of the movie, she drags her new boyfriend to see it.

Ophuls also was behind other influential documentaries like A Sense of Loss (1972), centering on the Protestant-Catholic conflict in Belfast; The Memory of Justice (1976), which focused on the Nuremberg trials and the Vietnam War in its 4 1/2 hours; and Veillees d'armes (1994), about journalists under siege in Sarejevo.

	










Born on Nov. 1, 1927, in Frankfurt, Germany, Ophuls and his family fled their home in 1933, then escaped from Paris in 1940 when the Nazis invaded that city. They finally settled in Los Angeles in 1941.

While attending Hollywood High School, Ophuls had a small part as a Hitler Youth member in the U.S. Army-commissioned Prelude to War (1942), directed by Frank Capra. He then attended Occidental College and UC Berkeley sandwiched around a stint with the U.S. Army's theatrical unit.

Fluent in French as well as German, Ophuls broke into film as an assistant to leading directors like John Huston and Anatole Litvak. He assisted on Huston's Moulin Rouge (1952) and helped out his father on Lola Montes (1955) after the family returned to live in France.

While working at a German TV station in Baden-Baden, Ophuls made a short film about painter Henri Matisse. At his father's funeral in 1957, he was introduced to Francois Truffaut, and the French legend hired him to write and direct one of the five segments in Love at Twenty (1962).

Through Truffaut, Ophuls met French stars Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jeanne Moreau, and they played the leads in his first feature, the comedy Banana Peel (1963).

He followed by co-writing and directing Fire at Will (1965), an international thriller about a gang of female spies that starred American expatriate Eddie Constantine as an FBI agent.

Ophuls' first foray into documentary features was Munich or Peace in Our Time (1967), also done for German television.

	










For Hotel Terminus, Ophuls employed more than 120 hours of discussions with former Nazis, American intelligence officers, South American government officials and victims of Nazi atrocities and witnesses to make his film about the infamous “Butcher of Lyon.”

Later, Ophuls worked for CBS News and for the ABC newsmagazine 20/20 and taught at Princeton University. In 1995, he received a career achievement award from the International Documentary Association.

The creator, who is partially deaf, discusses her crime thriller series, starring Rose Ayling-Ellis, Charlotte Ritchie, Andrew Buchan and Kieron Moore, for ITV and BritBox.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	When you watch the crime drama Code of Silence, which premiered on ITV and streamer ITVX  in the U.K. on May 18 and will hit streaming service BritBox in the U.S. and Canada in July, you quickly realize that lip reading is even harder, and much less of a science, than you may have believed. One big reason for this reality check embedded throughout the detective thriller series is the experience of partially deaf creator and writer Catherine Moulton (Baptiste, Hijack) and the show's deaf star Rose Ayling-Ellis who portrays the protagonist Alison, a deaf police canteen worker who gets tasked with a role in a sting operation due to her lip-reading skills.

	“People are always looking for new ways into crime shows,” Moulton tells THR. “And it just sort of made sense to me that lip readers are detectives. So to have a crime show with a lip reader at the heart was just something that felt very personal to me.”

	The show, executive produced by Bryony Arnold and Damien Timmer for ITV Studios' Mammoth Screen, alongside Robert Schildhouse and Stephen Nye for BritBox, as well as Ayling-Ellis and Moulton, also features Kieron Moore (Vampire Academy, Masters of the Air, The Corps), Charlotte Ritchie (You, Ghosts) and Andrew Buchan (Black Doves, The Honourable Woman, Broadchurch).


	Moulton talked to THR about the inspiration for the series, the origin of its title, and her hopes for addressing misconceptions about lip-reading. 


Could you share a little bit about what inspired you to create and write Code of Silence?


	I'm partially deaf, and I have been since childhood. Kind of like Alison, I I just picked up lip-reading. I just taught myself naturally, and it came quite instinctively. I didn't really know how I was doing it. Then, a few years ago, I wanted to understand more about it and get better at it. So I had lip-reading lessons, and I learned more about the theory. The statistic is that between 30 and 40 percent of speech is visible on the lips, and that's the best case scenario, when we're sitting looking at each other, and I can see you clearly. The rest of it is just very informed guesswork. You're looking at people's body language, you're taking things from the context of what you know about them, the situation that you're in, and even the rhythm of speech. And you're putting all those clues together to work out what the sentence is. So there's a lot going on. 

	











	If I have to spend a whole day relying on lip-reading, I get very, very tired. It's really a lot of work. People are always looking for new ways into crime shows, and it just sort of made sense to me that lip readers are detectives. So to have a crime show with a lip reader at the heart just felt right, and it was something that was very personal to me. 


How did you come up with the title Code of Silence. I love that it has a couple of layers and meanings…


	It came very early on. I always find with titles, either you get them straight away, or you're forever changing it. This just felt thriller-y and tells you that you're getting a thriller. But it's also [a reference] to lip-reading. Lip-reading is a silent code, so that's what the show is about.


As a viewer, you learn a lot about lip-reading and its challenges. For example, Alison asks in one scene if the police can zoom in on someone's face in a video. Or in another scene, she asks someone to turn to her while speaking. How did you approach integrating these issues into the script?


	The trickiest thing was marrying the kind of the information we needed to get in for the thriller and mystery story with the reality of lip-reading. [Lead director] Diarmuid [Goggins] has done such a brilliant job, because there was a version that could have looked really bad where either you definitely can't see the lip shapes, or they are weirdly always looking at the camera really conveniently. But Diarmuid has done it so brilliantly that it really works.

	











You draw viewers into that idea of lip-reading as detective work that you have mentioned in scenes where Alison pieces together lip movements and we see letters appearing and moving around on screen until they end up forming a sentence or phrase. I felt so frustrated following these puzzles and gained additional respect for lip-reading because I often couldn't figure out what was being said until the words were shown on screen. I assume you wanted us to feel this stress…


	Yeah, I wanted to put the audience in the position of a lip-reader, and for them to understand how difficult it is, and how tiring. I think there's this misconception that lip-reading is just like reading a book — you just magically see all the words. And I don't think people really understand quite how much work lip-readers are doing. So, I'm glad you felt stressed.


	Catherine Moulton


How did you think about balancing this educational aspect and the entertainment focus of your show?


	It was really important to me that the show was entertaining and that you could just watch it and be entertained. It's hopefully a really good crime story. I love detective shows. I've grown up watching them, and I really love mainstream crime drama. With Code of Silence, what I wanted to do was just think about how to put someone with some of my experience and some of Rose's experience in a crime show. Obviously, there are elements that we've seen before, like surveillance shows and heist shows. But if you put a very different character, like Alison, at the heart of it, what does that do to the story? How does that change it? Hopefully, that makes it feel fresher.

	











What was the biggest challenge as a writer on the show?


	The biggest challenge was definitely making the lip-reading realistic and difficult, but also making sure that we were getting enough of the right beats of the crime story at the right point. so that people could understand what was going on and wanted to know more. And the lip-reading subtitles kind of evolved even in postproduction.


	Obviously, it was quite an unusual script in a way, because there was the scene you're seeing on camera, Rose with the police, and what she's able to see, but then we had to also write the scene that was happening in the background — the scene of the crime gang and what they're saying to each other. So there was a lot of trying to balance what they would really be saying and what we wanted to reveal. So it was different from any other crime show that I've worked on.


What feedback did Rose give on her experience that led you to adjust the script?


	Rose, I think, was brilliant when we got to finalizing the lip-reading subtitles in that she was very, very focused on the authenticity of the moment and what we can actually see on screen. What lit patterns are there? What can we work with? Whereas I was kind of juggling that with what the audience needs to know. So, she really kept me honest in that respect. Sometimes it was just really great to have someone else who is a brilliant lip-reader on the show. A lot of the time it was us just going: Oh, can I actually see that on screen? Or do I just know that I wrote that line?

	











Did you always know Alison would be someone who gets a chance to work with the police?


	It started from that thing about lip-readers being detectives, and then the idea that lip-readers have to watch all the time. You have to watch very closely, so that suggested a surveillance show. And because she's deaf, it feels unlikely that she would be a police officer, and I didn't think she should be a criminal. So she was obviously going to be a civilian [who ends up working with the police].


I caught myself rooting for Alison early on because everyone seems to doubt her but she is ambitious, and you want to see her succeed. What can you share about why you chose to make her so driven and not, as you could have done, a more passive character who gets dragged into a big role? 


	I didn't want that character to feel like a victim. That's not how Rose is. That's not how I am. We don't see ourselves as victims,. We're kind of happy with who we are and being deaf, so I never wanted to make Alison any kind of victim. She had to be an active character.


	I did want you to both be rooting for her to succeed and to worry. At the start, she's not where she wants to be in her life. And she's running between two jobs, and when she gets this opportunity with the police to use her skill that often goes unrecognized, she grabs onto it with both hands. But I wanted you to worry a little bit about how far she would push that, because you see that she's got something to prove.

	Virtual star Ironmouse, along with a host of other VTuber virtual talent, will perform at an IRL event in Los Angeles in July. 


	Fantastic Reality will feature a performance from Ironmouse, a massive virtual streaming and Twitch star, along with performances from virtual talent including Japanese virtual singer KAF and Jakarta's virtual pop artist JKT48v. Together, these acts have a combined global following of almost 10 million. 


	But while the talent is virtual, the event will be very real. Fantastic Reality happens at The Vermont Hollywood on July 3 beginning at 7 p.m. For several of the performances, VTuber composer Daryl Vanessa Barnes will direct a live band, with performer and event co-producer Mariya serving as MC for the night, which will also feature music from both virtual and non-virtual DJs.

	Fantastic Reality is part of the VTuber (or “virtual YouTuber”) phenomenon happening in online spaces and featuring virtual artists of all shapes and sounds. These performers, who are not AI, create often anonymous content using real-time motion capture technology. The field typically fuses aesthetics of anime, video games, animation and the internet.

	











	To wit, South Korean virtual boy band PLAVE, whose members' real-life identities are hidden behind digital avatars but whose commercial performance and ambitions rival K-pop's biggest human acts, recently became the first entirely virtual Korean act to surpass 1 million units sold, according to Circle Chart.

	Fantastic Reality is pushing the boundaries even further by bringing such virtual acts into an IRL space. The event is being presented by VTuber streaming app IRIAM, with co-producers Kou Mariya, Daryl Vanessa Barnes, ETC, Bulldog DM and Rust.


	“Fantastic Reality is doing something that has always been impossible,” Mariya says in a statement. “We're uniting our community in an intimate IRL space with a cutting-edge live show featuring international luminaries Ironmouse, KAF, JKT48v and more with a live band.”

Lovato shared several wedding dress photos in a feature published by Vogue on the couple's wedding day, Sunday, May 25.

Demi Lovato and Jordan ‘Jutes' Lutes are married. The couple were wed in a ceremony in California on Sunday (May 25), the newlyweds confirmed to Vogue.


	Lovato and Lutes said “I do” at around 4 p.m. PT on Sunday, according the outlet, which got an exclusive first reveal of the pop star's Vivienne Westwood wedding dress. (See Lovato's wedding gown here.)


	Calling herself a longtime fan of Vivienne Westwood, Lovato opted for a custom-designed, corset bodice dress made from heavy silk satin fabric — paired with a cathedral-style veil made from ivory tulle — for her wedding ceremony. The bride's hair was styled in soft waves.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	As Lovato told Vogue, “When I was thinking about [what dress style I wanted], I often found myself coming back to Vivienne's designs — specifically how the silhouettes really compliment the curves in your body, and her use of corsets.”


	Lovato changed into another Vivienne Westwood dress for their reception: “The Audrey,” an ivory silk satin column dress with a draped corset top and pearls cascading from the neckline, each strand “draped and attached by hand, one by one,” she said.


	Just hours before the wedding, TMZ published paparazzi pictures of the bride and groom's rehearsal from Saturday.


	The wedding festivities, which were overseen by event planner Mindy Weiss, were long-awaited for the couple, who made their relationship public in August 2022 and got engaged on Dec. 16, 2023. 


	“Jordan, I cannot WAIT to marry you!!” Lovato gushed in a message to Jutes on Valentine's Day, sharing a romantic set of photos from an Old Hollywood-style shoot with her then-fiancé on Instagram. “The past 3 years have been the best 3 years of my life and I have you to thank for that. I'm obsessed with your heart, your love and your light. I can't wait to grow old with you and start a family together. Happy Valentine's Day to the love of my life. I love you honey!!!”


	Jutes matched the bride-to-be's sentiments in a caption on his Instagram page, writing, “happy valentine's day to the love of my life. words will never do you justice, and I'll never stop feeling like the luckiest guy alive. there's no better feeling than being loved by you. I adore you baby and I can't wait to marry you.”

	











	The duo have worked together on music, with Jutes contributing as a co-writer on three tracks that appeared on Lovato's Holy Fvck album, which reached No. 7 on the Billboard 200 albums chart upon its release in 2022.

	Dubbed What Was That: A Club Night Dedicated to Lorde, the event took place on Sunday (May 25) with Australian DJ Xeimma behind the decks to spin the Kiwi musician's hits. “We're officially in the L4 era, so it's only right we throw a party for our true Lorde & saviour!” the venue wrote on social media.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	However, footage from the event shows that Mary's Underground also welcomed a special guest to the event, with Lorde herself showing up to bask in the festivities.


	Appearing with no fanfare at all, Lorde can be seen within the crowd where only a couple of attendees recognized her, shaking her hand and exchanging pleasantries. However, after being noticed by a couple of other audience members, the club exploded into chaos as the musician was thrust into the spotlight.


	As the event unfolded, Lorde soon found herself up on the stage, dancing along to her songs with other fans, and even setting up behind Xeimma's DJ booth as fans kept their focus on her. “Still in disbelief. Feeling unbelievably grateful to Lorde for making this a night we'll talk about for years,” Xeimma wrote on Instagram after the event.


	“It's official – Lorde came to my party on 25 May 2025,” she added. “After years of throwing events, this was one of the most rewarding nights of my life. Completely unmatched.”


	Lorde recently launched into her latest era with the release of “What Was That” on April 24, with Virgin scheduled to arrive on June 27. 


	Last week, on May 19, Lorde shared the artwork to her next single, “Man Of The Year,” which she noted will arrive at an unspecified date this week. “An offering from really deep inside me,” she said of the track. “The song I'm proudest of on Virgin.”

The reggaetón superstar headlined day two of the event in Chicago's Grant Park.

Senior Editor, Latin


	Drawing in a massive crowd on day two of Sueños Music Festival, Don Omar cemented his icon status delivering a jam-packed setlist to wrap the fourth edition of the event in Chicago's Grant Park. 


	On Sunday, the reggaetón powerhouse came out on stage just a few minutes before his 9 p.m. start time, eager to sing to the crowd — significantly larger than yesterday's — that had gathered to see him perform. Don Omar did not disappoint and he knew exactly which songs would get his fans going. 

	











	From “Dale Don” to “Hasta Abajo” and “Dile,” the Puerto rican hitmaker started with a bang. “Latinos make some noise,” he said at the top of his one-hour set. He was a man of a few words, letting the music speak for itself. “Are we having fun?” he asked at one point. It's safe to say the crowd was indeed having fun with groups of friends perreando and singing along with the self-proclaimed King of Kings.

	He went on to sing “Pobre Diabla,” Hector y Tito's “Morena,” “Salió El Sol,” “Se Menea,” “Taboo,” “Danza Kuduro” and “Bandoleros.” But a highlight of the night was when he sang “Ella y Yo,” his 2005 hit duet with Romeo Santos. “You guys know this song, right?” he asked, almost rhetorically. 


	One of the most memorable collaborations of the 21st century, Santos and Don Omar engage in a call-and-response of sorts to tell a story of lust, infidelity and betrayal in “Ella y Yo.” Don Omar asked the Sueños crowd to play the part of Santos and they promptly followed his orders, making for an epic duet between Don Omar and his fans. 


	Don Omar most recently wrapped his Back to Reggaetón World Tour, which marked his grand return to the stage in celebration of his decades-spanning career. 


	Day two of Sueños Music Festival also included riveting performances by Kapo, Bellakath, Omar Courtz, Jhayco, Tito Double P, Grupo Frontera and Wisin.

	In an unfortunate example of life imitating art, Argentine moviegoers were treated to an unwitting immersive experience as they screened Final Destination Bloodlines, with their theater's ceiling collapsing mid-movie.


	The incident took place last week at Cinema Ocho in La Plata, the capital city of Argentina's Buenos Aires, according to Argentine digital publication Infobae. During a May 19 9 p.m. showing of the sixth and latest installment in the horror franchise — which sees its protagonists stalked and eventually captured by death via bizarre accidents — around 40 attendees had their viewing experience cut short as the roof of theater No. 4 let down debris.

	“A really loud noise was heard,” 29-year-old Fiamma Villaverde, who went to the screening on a whim with her 11-year-old daughter and a friend, told the outlet in Spanish. “At first, we thought it was a part of the movie because we were so engrossed; but immediately after a piece of rubble fell on me.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	She said the pieces struck her shoulder, back, knee and ankle, adding, “It didn't hit my head because I was slightly leaning over the armrests.” 


	Video captured at the scene depicts a significant hole in the ceiling and debris on the floor in between the aisles. Commotion can be heard as attendees chattered amongst themselves in audible shock. Per local reports, the theater did not provide a statement regarding the incident and moviegoers theorized the city's heavy rainfall could have contributed to the damage. For her part, Villaverde said she is planning to file a complaint and has contacted her lawyer, after missing days off of work due to her severe bruises and an X-ray that diagnosed her with “trauma from the blow.” 


	Released May 16 to positive reviews, the Zach Lipovsky- and Adam B. Stein-directed entry is already the best debut in the long-running franchise, which first began spooking viewers 25 years ago. The New Line/Warner Bros. feature accomplished a rare feat at the box office, heading into a $102 million global start with an even split from domestic and international revenue.

TV Reporter


SPOILER ALERT! This post contains details from the Season 2 finale of HBO‘s The Last of Us.


	The Season 2 finale of The Last of Us makes it hard to continue rooting for Ellie.


	What started as a quest to seek vengeance for Joel has, at this point, spiraled out of control. Even as Jesse and, eventually, Tommy try to convince her it's time to go home, she's fueled by (and blinded by) this hatred for Abby.


	As a result, by the end of the episode, Ellie is inadvertently responsible for the deaths of at least three more people. She kills Mel, who is pregnant, and Owen while trying to interrogate them about Abby's whereabouts. Eventually, she gets what she's asked for when Abby arrives at the theater to confront her — and kills Jesse in the process.

	“All of these people are dying around her, and now her loved ones, because of her monomaniacal need to kill Abby. I think she's starting to just realize how her actions are affecting her entire life,” Bella Ramsey told Deadline of Ellie's headspace as this final episode progresses to a pretty jarring cliffhanger.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In the interview below, Ramsey tracks Ellie's descent over the last few episodes that leads her to such a dark place that it'll be difficult to come back from. 


DEADLINE: Before we get to the finale, I want to ask you about the scene at the end of 205 where Ellie is torturing Nora. How do you think that moment gets her to where she is in the finale — and what she does?


BELLA RAMSEY: I mean, it happened a bit in Season 1 when she attacked David with the axe after he attacked her, and that sort of unlocks new levels of violence, I think, that they didn't know that she had. And similarly…torturing Nora, I think there's an element of it in the moment where she is getting some sort of gratification from it, but then afterwards just hates herself, like, truly hates herself. I think that leads into dissent. She can't really feel remorse. I think after, it's more of just like a deep loathing for oneself, which then I think contributes to this downward spiral of like, ‘Well, I'm this person now, and so therefore the next actions that I'm going to take, that's just who I am.' The damage is definitely severe, and I think that that moment is like a tipping point into the depths, for sure.

	











DEADLINE: In the beginning of the finale, Ellie tells Dina what Joel did at the hospital and why Abby came after him. Dina seems to accept it pretty easily, but how do you think this impacts their relationship? 


RAMSEY: I think that Ellie is terrified to tell Dina that, and Ellie expects that once she tells Dina this, that that's it. Dina will leave. Everything that she's built with Dina will go away. Because I think that Ellie feels so ashamed of all of that, and, I think, just expects that Dina will too. And Dina obviously has a reaction, but it's very gracious, and I think that that is something that they will they work through. I think that Dina ultimately — to me anyway, how it felt playing it with Isabela — is that there is a level of understanding, and there's a level of like, ‘I love you so much that I'm gonna try and understand why you haven't told me this before, and thank you for telling me now.' I think that was sort of more of the consensus.


DEADLINE: There are so many big moments in the finale, including when Ellie kills Mel and Owen. How is that moment different for Ellie than when she tortures Nora? Her reaction to their deaths is much more visceral and less accepting. She's clearly very shaken up by it.


RAMSEY: I mean, this definitely feels very different to the end of Episode 5, nearly killing Nora. There was something deliberate about that. There was nothing deliberate about this. Something that we played around with on the day is that when I'm counting down, like, ‘321,' every number that I go down, I'm like begging them to just do as I say so that I don't have to shoot them. I think Ellie really, truly doesn't want any of that to happen. Obviously, seeing that Mel is pregnant, I think all that Ellie's seeing in that moment is Dina, and that is pretty bad. So she reverts to being like the tiniest of children in that moment. I think she just feels so lost and afraid and the way of her whole journey up until then, I think, crumbles onto her in that moment. 


DEADLINE: How is that feeling compounded by Abby killing Jesse?


RAMSEY: That grief is so immediate and there's almost no time for her to process it, but obviously they've just had that conversation before where they've reached sort of a mutual understanding, because Ellie has always been aware of Jesse not agreeing with her for a lot of the things that she's done. I think there's that instant shock, but I think once she starts to process that issue — she's not very much from a processor, to be fair — but I think she really feels like she's the reason for all of this. All of these people are dying around her, and now her loved ones, because of her monomaniacal need to kill Abby. I think she's starting to just realize how her actions are affecting her entire life.


DEADLINE: Is it enough, though? Can she be snapped out of it, or is her overwhelming need to seek revenge against Abby still driving her at this point? 


RAMSEY: I think that both things are still true. I mean, when she comes running and sees Abby, and Abby's holding the gun to her, that scene was so complicated to film, emotionally, for me, because I go from like immediate grief to being terrified for Tommy to being terrified for my own life, but at the same time, this is the person that I've been waiting for, and here she is. It's such a weird, crazy moment, and I think that Ellie's need for revenge and vengeance doesn't just go away. I don't think it ever does.

	











DEADLINE: What scene stands out to you this season as the most emotionally impactful?


RAMSEY: Oh, I honestly think it is that Mel and Owen scene. I think that was definitely the most impactful for me. That's probably one of the scenes I'm proudest of in the season. She goes from being sort of a villain to just a lost human being who you kind of hate and kind of feel sorry for.


DEADLINE: What are you most looking forward to about continuing the story in Season 3?


RAMSEY: I'm really excited. The second game is so brilliant, so what a joy to have the space and the time of more seasons to explore all of that and get into it. The same way, after Season 1, I was so excited to get back into Ellie's skin for Season 2, I'm excited again for that again in Season 3.

Phil Robertson — the star of the popular A&E reality television series Duck Dynasty, a professional hunter and businessman — has died at the age of 79, his son and daughter-in-law announced on social media today. The Duck Commander patriarch was diagnosed with Alzheimer's last December.


	“We celebrate today that our father, husband, and grandfather, Phil Robertson, is now with the Lord,” the family said in a statement on Instagram and Facebook. “He reminded us often of the words of Paul, ‘you do not grieve like those who have no hope. For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.'

	The post continued, “Thank you for the love and prayers of so many whose lives have been impacted by his life saved by grace, his bold faith, and by his desire to tell everyone who would listen the Good News of Jesus. We are grateful for his life on earth and will continue the legacy of love for God and love for others until we see him again.

	“We know so many of you love him and have been impacted by his life. We're having a private service for now, but we'll share details soon about a public celebration of his life,” the statement concluded, with a reference to 1 Corinthians 2.

A post shared by Korie Robertson (@korie.robertson)


	Last year, Robertson's son Jase gave details about his father's condition, noting that he was “just not doing well” and “really struggling,” he said on the family's Unashamed podcast. He added that the family's focus at the time was to “make him more comfortable” amid a further diagnosis of “some sort of blood disease that's causing all kinds of problems. It's accelerated and it's causing problems with his entire body.” Despite being in immense pain and facing memory issues, Jase Robertson said his dad was keen to return to the Christianity podcast, which was first launched in 2019.


	In 2023, Robertson's life was the basis for Fathom Events' biopic The Blind, which became the company's highest-grossing feature upon release. The faith-based film, helmed by Andrew Hyatt and written by Stephanie Katz, traced Robertson's origin story to 1960s Louisiana; as his demons and addiction threaten to tear his family apart, he seeks redemption in an unlikely place. Starring Aron Von Andrian, Amelia Eve, Brielle Robillard and Matthew Erick White, the pic grossed upward of $17 million at the box office.

	











	The Duck Dynasty patriarch first rose to prominence during the 11-season-run of the reality series, which ran from 2012 and 2017, documenting the close-knit Robertson clan and its multimillion-dollar hunting and outdoor recreation enterprise. An entertainment phenomenon, the A&E show broke viewership records throughout its tenure, setting multiple records for most-watched episodes, most-watched series and most-watched telecast in A&E's history. In 2013, Robertson was suspended by the cable network after he made anti-gay remarks in an interview with GQ; however, the suspension lasted no more than 10 days following fan outcry. 


	Known for their lengthy beards and Evangelical Christian views, multiple episodes drew more than 9 million viewers with one of the seasons averaging 9.4 million viewers throughout. The original show now streams on Fox Nation, which launched followup Duck Family Treasure in 2022, centering on sons Jase Robertson and Jep Robertson.


	Earlier this year, A&E announced a reboot of the mothership series, called Duck Dynasty: The Revival, which will premiere June 1, focusing on heir to the Duck Commander legacy Willie Robertson and wife Korie Robertson, as they navigate an expansive family life. The original announcement noted that Phil Robertson would not appear in the show given his diagnosis.


	Robertson published a memoir called Happy, Happy, Happy: My Life and Legacy as the Duck Commander alongside co-author Mark Schlabach in 2013. He attended Louisiana Tech University on a football scholarship and was thought to have the goods to go pro, but was more interested in hunting, eventually receiving his bachelor's and then master's degree in education from there.


	An outspoken conservative and Christian, he married wife Marsha Kay in 1966, and is survived by his five children (including a daughter from an extramarital affair), brother, daughter-in-law and six grandchildren.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kevin Jonas Bravely Opens up About Mental Health Struggles After Touring","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/kevin-jonas-mental-health-after-touring/","Mon, 26 May 2025 15:44:26 GMT","

Kevin Jonas revealed that coming home after a long time on the road can be mentally draining. “All the depression, blues, it's real, especially after a tour,” he told People in an interview published on May 26.

Referring to his 2023-2024 tour with his brothers Joe Jonas and Nick Jonas, Kevin shared, “After our last tour, we did over 100 and something shows — it was too many — and we ended in Europe. I got on my plane to come home after I believe 130 shows, and I got on my flight — which was delayed terribly, which is never fun.”

Kevin recalled the harrowing experience of trying to get home, which ended up taking over 18 hours with delays and unexpected stops. “I was already fatigued and burnt out by the time I got home,” he said.

“My wife was like ‘Something's wrong with you, are you okay?' I actually had to go start talking to a therapist about it, how to process the highs and the lows. It's so jarring,” the “Love Me To Heaven” singer shared.

A post shared by Jonas Brothers (@jonasbrothers)

Prioritizing their overall health was important for the Jonas Brothers while on “The World Tour.” Joe stated in May 2023, per AP. “We've been burnt out before and then you're like, ‘I still got 20 more shows on this tour.'”

He continued, “So we all have our own perspective ways of going about that, and we just make sure that that's prioritized and also that we think the three of us are communicating as best as we can.”

A post shared by Jonas Brothers (@jonasbrothers)

The Jonas Brothers are celebrating their 20th anniversary in music with their “JONAS20: Living The Dream” tour set to kick off on August 10 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The trio is also releasing their new album, “Greetings From Your Hometown,” on August 8. 

“[The album] really encapsulates where we were and where we came from and the sounds that embodied how we grew up and really inspired us to become musicians,” Kevin told Eli Manning in an interview shared by Billboard in April. 

“Taking a lot of that and bringing it now, into our musical journey. I'm excited for people to hear it,” he added.

Joe stated on “Good Morning America” in March, “We feel incredibly grateful for 20 years. We started in an abandoned trailer … with our dad driving our full band in the van and the three of us just chasing this dream.” 

He continued, “You wish you could be there in 20 years doing the same thing. It just feels just so incredible. We're having time of our lives obviously — we get to continue this ride.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jax Welcomes First Baby & Names Her After Rock Band","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/jax-has-baby-name-good-charlotte/","Mon, 26 May 2025 14:31:03 GMT","

Exactly 10 years after she took third place on “American Idol,” pop star Jax has entered her mom era. 

The 29-year-old “Victoria's Secret” singer announced on May 24, 2025, that she welcomed her first child with her husband, music video director Braverijah “Brave” Gregg. The couple named their baby girl, born on May 20, Charlotte Good — inspired by the rock band Good Charlotte — and have been showered with love by fans and celebrities alike. 

A post shared by JAX (@jax)

Sharing a series of baby photos with her two million Instagram followers, Jax wrote, “Welcome to the world, Charlotte Good.” 

In the comment section, Jelly Roll's wife BunnieXO, wrote, “Omg the name 😭 Congrsts you guys!” and Jax replied, “iykyk 🤘🏼”

Jax first met the band in 2011, according to Alternative Press, when she was a teenager and got to open for them on a couple of their tour dates. 

In September 2024, when Jax appeared on the “Artist Friendly” podcast hosted by Good Charlotte leader singer Joel Madden, who happens to be “American Idol” judge Lionel Richie's son-in-law and performed on May 18 season finale, she was nervous to share that she and her husband had decided to name their first child after the band. 

“We have always said, since we started dating and knew we were gonna end up together, we'd name our daughter after Good Charlotte and name her Charlotte Good,” she told Madden. 

“Really?” he replied, and she beamed, “Charlotte Good Gregg, yeah.” 

After she noted that their daughter would likely be called Charlie Good and that they'd already filmed video messages for her, Madden said, “That is so sweet!” 

Lots of Jax's celebrity friends flooded her post with notes of congratulations, including former Nickelodeon star and Hallmark actress Daniela Monet, who wrote, “Peanut!!!! Congrats mama, you did it 🤍”

Fellow “American Idol” alum Lauren Alaina, who's also expecting her first child, chimed in, “Congrats to you guys. She is beautiful. ❤️”

The band Shinedown commented, “YAY!!!!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️” and singer Christina Perri wrote, “ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!”

Jax also added some additional information about her delivery in the comment section, sharing, “The delivery nurses and doctors at @ascensionsaintthomas are real life angels on earth. They held our hands for HOURS through some very scary moments and made sure our baby made it out healthy and kicking. We will never forget how amazing they were.”

The new mom first rose to fame on season 14 of “American Idol,” where she landed in third place behind runner-up Clark Beckham and winner Nick Fradiani. Jax signed with Atlantic Records in 2021, per Billboard, and her song “Victoria's Secret” became a smash hit the following year.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Nikki DeLoach Reveals New Movie With Beloved Christmas Co-Star","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/nikki-deloach-new-movies-home-turn/","Mon, 26 May 2025 16:02:36 GMT","

Hallmarkies who've missed seeing Nikki DeLoach in Hallmark's 2025 movie lineup will be relieved to know the actress will be back soon, and with a favorite co-star by her side. 

In an interview with Us Weekly published on May 25, 2025, DeLoach confirmed she'll star in “Home Turf” this fall and, interestingly, she'll reunite onscreen with Warren Christie, her co-star in November's “Our Holiday Story.”

“Home Turf” is one of several Hallmark movies being filmed in Utah during the first half of 2025, per the Salt Lake Tribune, which reported that Maclain Nelson was the director. Nelson has directed many Hallmark movies, including the “Haul Out the Holly” movies and 2024's “The Magic of Lemon Drops” and “Branching Out.” 

Filmed in the Salt Lake City area in April, according to local casting notices, DeLoach told Us Weekly she had a blast on set. 

“It's football, it's romance, it's college campuses, it's multi-generational, it's funny,” she said. “Warren Christie is my co-star again. We've been reunited from Christmas. And I gotta tell you, I have not had this much fun on a set in a really long time. I am so excited about this movie!”

With over two dozen Hallmark movies under her belt, DeLoach typically stars in multiple movies for the network each year, but she has been absent from the schedule during the first six months of 2025. 

The good news for fans is that she not only filmed “Home Turf” this spring, but also two new “True Justice” mysteries filmed earlier in the year with Benjamin Ayes, Kat McNamara, and the rest of the cast from the original 2024 mystery. However, those two new movies have yet to be given premiere dates.

Meanwhile, fans of her “Curious Caterer” franchise with Andrew Walker have been eager to see them reunite onscreen since their fifth movie, “Forbidden Fruit,” premiered in October. 

In December, Walker told Soaps.com, “We were supposed to shoot a couple of them in the new year, January and February, but they've been pushed back to mid-year.”

On April 24, DeLoach let fans know that nothing had been scheduled yet. When a fan created a funny meme featuring her and fellow “Curious Caterer” actress Jaycie Dotin, DeLoach shared it in her Instagram Stories and wrote, “Aww thank you for the love! We love you, too. We actually have not filmed any new Curious Caterers, unfortunately. Hoping we can get to do some soon. ❤️”

[Editor's note: This article contains spoilers for Episode 7 of “The Last of Season” Season 2] 

It may only be small comfort, with likely a two year wait to return to that theater in Seattle, but let it be some comfort to all viewers that “The Last of Us” was renewed well before Season 2 ends with Ellie (Bella Ramsey) held at gunpoint by Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) and with a shot ringing out over one of the HBO series' most brutal cuts to black.

A cliffhanger of this magnitude is as close as series creators and showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann can get to replicating how “The Last of Us Part 2” game abruptly transitions the player from controlling Ellie as she hunts for vengeance in Seattle to controlling Abby over the same three-day period. While Season 2 ends on maybe the game's most infamous act break, stopping the action of the series there wasn't necessarily a given for the creative team.

“Part of the job of adaptation is figuring out how to impart the same feeling — of a kind of uneasy empathy with somebody we do not like, and how to introduce people in ways that make sense for the audience when they're not playing as the person. A lot of story math went into that,” Mazin told IndieWire on an episode of the Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. 

Where to begin in Jackson, where to end in Seattle, what to show or not show, who to introduce or add or change, all of it was on the table. But Mazin thinks that the configuration that “The Last of Us” Season 2 ended up with is the right one, because it stays true to the way in which the show has always tried to re-examine its characters through the lens of different relationships.  

“I like the fact that we keep presenting a new world with different ways of tracking the story,” Mazin said. “Season 1 was the Joel [Pedro Pascal] and Ellie tale. Season 2 is very much the Ellie and Dina [Isabella Merced] story. And Season 3 is going to really get into the world of Abby.” 

The young Washington Liberation Front operative only shows up at the edges, or else the seven-episode season would probably be a lot shorter. So much of what we know about her is based around her desire to hunt down and kill Joel for murdering her own father back in Salt Lake City, in his quest to save Ellie from the Fireflies. It is easy for the audience, just as much as Ellie, to have a very simplified sense of Abby and her crew, even if similarities or telling little details hint that the two survivors might not be so different. 

 










Mazin points in particular to the ways that both Ellie and Abby swing an object down on a person when they are at their most brutal. “ It's quite remarkable to me how similar they are in their brutality and in their loss of self in that moment,” Mazin said. “Now with Abby, that's mostly what we've seen [but] with Ellie, we've seen so many other sides of her.” 

The juxtaposition that ends Episode 5 after Ellie has beaten information out of Abby's friend Nora (Tati Gabrielle) — of Ellie, dead-eyed in demonic red light, seemingly lost to herself, with a flashback to Ellie and Joel at their most loving and safe — isn't just about the angst of that comparison. It is the point that “The Last of Us” wants to make about everyone who is still a human in this world. People are both kind and cruel; they can be led to both those places by the love they have for others. 

“We are so wrapped up in Ellie and Joel when Joel dies and [when] we see Ellie's heart break, our hearts break, because we know them. We were there when Joel first encountered Ellie, pointed a gun at her face, and kicked the knife away. She called him an asshole and then he was stuck with her and called her cargo. And we went from that to [Joel saying] ‘It wasn't time that did it,'” Mazin said. “We are part of them.” 

 










The shift that awaits us in Season 3, whether we like it or not, is to spend more time with Abby and become more a part of her story. “Let me quote Jeffrey Wright's story about pans. I've got a Kaitlyn Dever. If you've got a Kaitlyn Dever, you use Kaitlyn Dever. I'm so excited to unleash her and to show the audience the full 360-degree view of that character,” Mazin said.  

For as intense a transition as it is on a character level, Mazin anticipates some narrative and technical smoothness for Season 3 in comparison to Season 2, which had to thread dynamics in Jackson with yet another road trip across the Northwest with establishing all the geographic hotspots in Seattle and conflict dynamics there, too. Plus smarter zombies. It's a lot for any television show to manage, especially when the episode count of individual seasons get shaved down to the bone. 

Hopefully no shorter than the seven episodes that preceded it, Season 3 will get to build on that already established narrative work and deepen its visual worldbuilding in a way that “The Last of Us” really has not gotten to do yet over the course of its run. “We do have this weird tendency to build things and then blow them up, set them on fire, walk away from them,” Mazin said. “But it is a different vibe to be camped out in a place [and] I think Season 3, production-wise, will probably be smoother.”  

 










Mazin is perhaps more excited for the ways that Season 3 will be aiming for the same emotional target. At its core, “The Last of Us” is about impossible choices that characters make to survive, based on how they are connected to each other. Abby Anderson will have no shortage of those choices to make; and Season 3 may also be smoother because the final choice is the one we've already just seen — or at least, Ellie's side of it. 

“If we do our job right, when this is all over – or at least, when Season 3 is over — we should be confused morally and conflicted morally, and hoping that somehow these two unstoppable forces that are aimed at each other figure out a way to not kill each other. Because we'll end up loving them both and we'll end up also fearing them both.” 

“The Last of Us” is streaming on HBO Max. To hear Craig Mazin‘s episode of Filmmaker Toolkit and other great filmmaker conversations, make sure you subscribe to the podcast on Apple, Spotify, or your favorite podcast platform.

“The Rehearsal” has maybe never been truer to its name than in its Season 2 finale, “My Controls,” which not only wraps up creator Nathan Fielder's impassioned thesis on the need for better communication in airplane cockpits, but casually charts his (intentional or not) two-year rehearsal process to fly a real passenger jet full of real people, where the stakes of airplane safety are real, too. 

Fielder tends to prefer not to discuss the process behind his projects outside of what he and his team choose to include as part of “The Rehearsal” itself. HBO respects that wish and also keeps fairly mum about how “The Rehearsal” was made. But the flight that Fielder captained from San Bernardino and back again got the IndieWire team thinking about how aerial sequences in film and television get approved at all. Did Fielder need to lock the network lawyers assigned to Season 2 inside of Nate's Lizard Lounge for the duration of the two-hour and 10-minute flight? How was “The Rehearsal” cleared for takeoff?

The name of the game for any kind of stunt is risk management, something that becomes infinitely more complex the more specialized the action is. Few would know that better than Wade Eastwood, the stunt coordinator for the last four “Mission: Impossible” films — including the recently released “Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning,” which, among other things, features Tom Cruise flying and fighting on top of a vintage biplane. IndieWire reached out to Eastwood to ask about how a film team goes about preparing to actually shoot a sequence in the sky.  




			Popular on IndieWire		






“There is no form for how you put someone on the wing where they can move around freely and do the crazy stunts that Tom's going to do,” Eastwood told IndieWire. “If you get into a forklift truck and you're going to drive it [on camera], then you have to have this certification and you wear steel-toed shoes and all that. That's normal. But this, people don't do.” 

The first step in proving you can do something people don't normally do would, actually, fit into an episode of “The Rehearsal.” Once an aerial stunt's been conceived of, in addition to planning how to execute it successfully, the team also needs to generate a worst-case scenario outcome. One of the concerns is one that Episode 3, “Pilot's Code,” deals with directly: bird strikes. “ There's obviously always an element of danger. Something could happen. An engine could fail. A bird strike. You know, there's all sorts of things that we try and eliminate as much as possible,” Eastwood said. 

 










If you're Tom Cruise and you're strapped into the wing of a biplane just enough that you can still be scrambling around the fuselage, then air particles and prop blasts are a concern, too. But even with Fielder safely inside the cockpit of a 737, partnered with a co-pilot with over 5,000 flight hours, the goal is the same: “ We do as much as we can to make the red box turn green, if you like, on the safety,” Eastwood said. 

It is a back and forth between the safety team doing that risk assessment and the decision makers who insure the production and its assets, including talent, that determines the color of the proverbial box. 

For the “M:I” films, this involves a fair amount of testing and both video and written documentation to prove a stunt is doable to the satisfaction of the production team before Cruise even starts rehearsing it on the ground. But even “The Rehearsal,” which aspired to run a commercial airline flight under as ordinary and unremarkable a set of conditions as possible, has to answer a similar set of questions: Do they have the right equipment, and are there enough redundancies and trained personnel to narrow the risk down to an acceptable, insurable level? 

For “The Rehearsal,” we see some of that prep work in the show's most stunning flashback to date — the two years that Fielder spent training to become a licensed commercial pilot type-rated to fly a 737, and the show's search for a rentable 737 safe enough to fly. Fielder was still probably well short of the flight hours needed to achieve his airline transport pilot's license at the time of shooting “The Rehearsal” finale, which is the certification that the vast majority of pilots flying passenger planes have. 

 










But even so, Fielder dedicated himself to learning enough material to fill a college degree in a condensed amount of time, in addition to his work as a comedian. Although it comes out a little bit heartbreaking as the final voiceover of the series, from an insurance perspective if Fielder's allowed to be in the cockpit, then he must be fine. 

The main answer, therefore, in how “The Rehearsal” got away with packing a real airplane full of real people (even if they are actors) and flying it in the actual sky is that Fielder did the work to be qualified to fly it, that the production found a plane airworthy enough (thankfully, without bird nests), and that the team around Fielder, from his co-pilot to the show's aviation consultants (two are credited in the episode, Steve Giordano and Robert Allen) to the crew in the chase plane, were experienced enough for HBO's army of lawyers to agree they had indeed mitigated as much risk as possible. 

“ I just have to make sure that the team around [Cruise] is as strong and as safe and as together as possible so that he can create and do what he wants to do,” Eastwood said. Only time and a potential Season 3 of “The Rehearsal” will tell what other stunts, aerial or otherwise, Fielder will create next.

[Editor's Note: The following review contains spoilers for “The Last of Us” Season 2, Episode 7 — the Season 2 finale. For additional coverage, including previous episode reviews, check out IndieWire's “Last of Us” landing page.]

“Maybe she got what she deserved.”

“Maybe she didn't.”

To open “The Last of Us” Season 2 finale, Dina (Isabela Merced) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) share the above exchange about Nora (Tati Gabrielle), the member of Abby's (Kaitlyn Dever) posse who Ellie chased down, tortured, and left to die at the end of Episode 5. But by the end of Episode 7, viewers may very well be repeating the debate about Ellie, whose ultimate fate makes for an agonizing cliffhanger that won't be resolved until Season 3 premieres (at least).

Did Abby shoot Ellie like she shot Jesse (Young Mazino), R.I.P.? Did she wound her? Did she miss? Of course, I'm desperate for Ellie to survive, but “The Last of Us” already killed off one of its leads this season and, more importantly, it's clear co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann (who cowrote the Season 2 finale with Halley Gross) want viewers to consider not just what they want to happen, but what these characters have chosen for themselves.

Sans sentiment, Ellie's moral report card is grim. She tortured and killed Nora. She shot and killed Owen (Spencer Lord), as well as Mel (Ariela Barer), the latter of whom was pregnant when she died. Sure, Mel's death was an accident, but that's hardly an excuse when Ellie's entire plan is built around murdering people.

On the other hand, Ellie's ethical judgement showed signs of improvement in Episode 7; that her experience in Seattle (and lingering memories of Joel) may be steering her away from vengeance and toward mercy. Saying “maybe she didn't” about Nora deserving to die (and be tortured), as well as telling Dina why Abby was so fixated on finding Joel to begin with, is a good sign for Ellie's level of bloodlust. If she's open to considering other opinions, instead of just finding Abby at all costs, that's progress. (Her revelation also drives a wedge between her and Dina, which speaks to how hard — and how important — it must've been for Ellie to divulge.)

Granted, Ellie suffers a setback when she realizes where Abby is hiding. (The only words Nora said to Ellie were “whale” and “wheel,” so when she spots them both by Seattle's Aquarium, the dead-end suddenly becomes an open door, and she can't stop herself from walking through.) Long before her interrogation of Abby's crew goes so quickly sideways, it's clear Ellie should've gone with Jesse to help Tommy (Gabriel Luna). Tommy came to Seattle to help her. He cares about her, and she cares about him. He's part of her community, and he's still alive.

 










Joel isn't. And if Ellie's decisions really were dictated by what Joel would want, there's no way he would rather Ellie kill his killer than save his brother. (Back in Episode 3, Tommy even said as much: “He'd be halfway to Seattle to save my life,” Tommy said, when Ellie tried to argue Joel would go to Seattle to avenge Tommy's death. “But when we lost people, no. It would just break him, like it was his fault. I saw that time and time again.”) But Ellie isn't hearing it. There's too many variables. “Fuck the community!” Ellie screams. “You let a kid die today, Jesse. Because why? He wasn't in your community? Let me tell you about my community. My community was beaten to death in front of me while I had to fucking watch.”

To be fair, Jesse didn't “let” anyone die. There was no way they could've saved the Scar who was trapped by W.L.F. soldiers. Ellie and Jesse vs. a literal army? Sorry, but they're taking an “L” on that one. But the selective responsibility Ellie points out does bring up one of the show's thornier subjects: Where do you draw the line when it comes to helping others when doing so comes at great personal risk to yourself?

With the Scar boy from earlier that day, it's a relatively easy choice. But Jesse and Tommy already made a harder choice — to come to Seattle to save Ellie and Dina — and Jesse, as he explains to Ellie, already sacrificed his own romantic happiness to stick in Jackson and help the townsfolk, which includes Ellie. “I go with that girl to New Mexico,” he says, “who saves your ass in Seattle?”

 










Despite Ellie and Jesse accusing (and then, later on, supporting) each other, the difference between them is clear. In Jesse's scenario, neither road available to him is actively harmful: If he goes with the woman to New Mexico, maybe he makes her happy, himself happy, and the people of New Mexico happy. Sure, everyone in Jackson would miss him, but they could've found another leader-in-waiting. Still, he chose to stay. Maybe he's less of a romantic, or maybe — as it's implied here — he's less selfish than Ellie. That doesn't mean “better”; sometimes you need to be selfish. Ellie just took it too far.

With Ellie, if she had stayed in Jackson, Dina would have been safe. Ellie would have been safe. The people of Jackson would still have two of their best patrol members, Tommy would still have a de facto niece, and Jesse would have been able to see his baby be born. Going had a single best case scenario: Abby would be dead. One more person on this planet would be gone. And for what? Abby isn't a known threat to anyone now that Joel is gone. Ellie's revenge is for her. It's selfish. It's meant to be healing, but it's only sewing more destruction.

Now that destruction is all around her. Nora, Owen, Mel, and Mel's baby are dead. Jesse is dead. Tommy and Dina are wounded, and it's hard to imagine Abby letting them live. Ellie may be gone, too, although — without knowing what happens in the games — I have to imagine her story will continue. Her nature, her soul, is still forming. She hasn't hardened into a monster or softened enough to find mercy. But fate doesn't wait around for you to be ready. Whether she lives or dies, she chose the path that led her here.

 










“The Last of Us” Season 2 is available on HBO and Max (which is soon to be HBO Max… again). The series has been renewed for Season 3.

• Speaking of monsters, a brief word on the book Ellie picks out for Dina's unborn baby: “The Monster at the End of This Book,” written by Jon Stone with illustrations by Michael Smollin. The children's book, first published in 1971, tells an innovative meta narrative in which Grover (the “Sesame Street” character) reads the title of the book and gets scared about what sort of monster is waiting for him at the end. From there, most of the book's “story” is just Grover begging the reader not to continue, so he doesn't have to encounter the monster, but (spoiler alert) the monster at the end of the book is… Grover.

For kids, the lesson is clear: The scariest monster is the one you build up in your mind. Expectations and reality don't always match up, and sometimes a monster is just… misunderstood. Take that reading a step further (not unlike comedian Gary Gulman's does in his 2024 stand-up special, “Grandiliquent”), and the monster at the end of the book is the reader themselves, or more accurately, whatever anxiety, trauma, or scarring event from the reader's past they can't seem to escape — and shapes how they see the world. Gee, I wonder how that would apply to Ellie?

 










• And speaking of presumed leaders who abandon their posts, what the heck is going on with Abby, Isaac (Jeffrey Wright), and the W.L.F.? During “Seattle Day 3,” she's M.I.A. Isaac sits down with Sgt. Park (Hettienne Park) and complains that Abby and her whole team are missing on “tonight of all nights.” Later, we get an idea of that night's significance when the W.L.F. sets off a massive explosion at the Seraphites' village. It's unclear who lived and died, what was destroyed, or if anything was accomplished, but it's implied — both by Isaac and by Owen, who doesn't seem to know where Abby is before Ellie walks in on him — that Abby was supposed to be on those attack boats, and she just… wasn't.

Isaac tells Sgt. Park he was planning for Abby to take over someday as the W.L.F. leader, so what happened to make her abandon that trajectory? We'll surely find out in Season 3, considering the final scene flashes back to “Seattle Day 1” to share what's going on from Abby's perspective. But given the emphasis placed in Season 2 on Jesse's planned ascension in Jackson, as well as Ellie stepping into Joel's shoes, there's a growing emphasis on generational transitions in “The Last of Us.” 

Jesse's succession would've been relatively smooth, given how much he aligned with the current leadership, Tommy and Maria (Rutina Wesley). But Ellie's attempts to follow in Joel's footsteps are bumpy at best. The longer she tries to play the badass avenger, the more she doubts whether that's who she is (and if that's who Joel wanted to be) . Could the same thing be happening to Abby? Could completing her quest for revenge have rattled her enough to drift from the person she was before? Might “The Last of Us” actually see hope for a better future in a generation of kids so ill at ease with the actions of their elders that they run in the opposite direction?

 










• For a show that took more than two years between Seasons 1 and 2, it's hard to sit with Mazin & Co.'s chosen endpoint. For one, Season 2 is only seven episodes long, as opposed to Season 1's nine-episode arc. But on top of that, this arc feels incomplete. Ellie's left halfway through a transformative moment. Everything happening between the W.L.F. and the Seraphites feels half-formed, and Abby has barely been fleshed out enough to build anticipation around seeing more of her in Season 3. I enjoyed the time I spent with “The Last of Us” Season 2 — and I hope you did, too, dear readers — I just wish there was more closure before another long break.

Adult Swim‘s “Rick and Morty” is back for Season 8, and the nearly year-and-a-half break has resulted in a burst of creative energy for a show that, at its best, can only be loosely described as a sci-fi sitcom. Creators Scott Marder and Dan Harmon have returned to the core Smith family dynamics (partly inspired by “Succession”), now severely impacted by Rick (Ian Cardoni) and Morty's (Harry Belden) rippled universe mayhem. Season 8 offers up some provocative existential problems, along with eye-popping world-building, and even more imaginative body horror. At the same time, there are a few callbacks to feed the fanbase.

 










Here are some early highlights: In Episode 1 (“Summer of All Fears”), Morty and older sister Summer (Spencer Grammer) return from being prisoners inside a simulated “Matrix” as punishment for not returning Rick's phone charger. Summer became a ruthless tech firm leader while Morty suffered PTSD from going to war. Now they must resume their normal lives as scarred adults trapped inside their former bodies. In Episode 3 (“The Rick, the Mort & the Ugly”), we return to the Citadel arc, where a population of Ricks manipulate and control the subordinate Mortys. And, in Episode 4 (“The Last Temptation of Jerry”), the Easter Bunny has been turned upside down into a sex horror nightmare of alien proportions, especially for Jerry (Chris Parnell) and Beth (Sarah Chalke).

“What guides us is what usually guides us,” Marder told IndieWire. “ We've just found we never wanna leave [the family] out.  Obviously, our favorite stories are [about] Rick and Morty, but everyone's so strong that it's just so natural in the cooking up of ideas that a Jerry one, or a Summer one, or a Beth one will pop up. We get together in a room, and the most exciting idea comes in on any given day, and that'll win the day.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






Then, as the season begins to fill up with new ideas, Marder tries to take the long view in figuring out a season arc that has started to take shape. “And this season it's certainly got a fun return to form with just kind of crazy [episodes] and heady ones. But it's also got a nice light arc that touches on Rick dealing with being home, figuring out what's next, and what it means in terms of his relationships with [the family].”

 










The seed of “The Summer of All Fears” came from the notion of putting Summer in an Easy Bake oven and then seeing what happens after she pops out as a 17-year-old again. “  This allowed her to live to adulthood, then gain some autonomy, and become not just a grown woman but a woman with supreme agency,” Harmon told IndieWire.

What's different is that the viewer is dropped unceremoniously into the episode and forced to play catch up throughout the adult Summer and Morty set up, which pays off with a little conspiracy theory for cynical measure.

“We don't normally like to play games with the audience by misleading them,” added Marder. “But there's a little bit of intrigue with what's going on here? Why are these two adults now? It was heavily influenced by ‘Succession.'  I think that series really made us excited about getting to do something grounded with adult versions of Summer and Morty.  We could be doing so much with these kids as adults. I know the writer, Jess Lacher,  connected to that fantasy of what if you could go back to high school or back to college, knowing everything you know now. That's like such an age-old dream. But it wouldn't go the way you hoped it would go.”

With “The Rick, the Mort & the Ugly,” the creators were intrigued by the idea of crash-landing on the Citadel and turning the focus away from the main Rick and Morty characters. “ There's infinite Ricks and Morty's, and, every once in a while, we can touch on a different set,” said Marder. “ We knew we didn't wanna just reset it and have it magically come back and there not be any repercussions from [Season 5 Episode 10]. So it was cool to check in with it later and see a good amount of survivors and Ricks being Ricks, kinda rebuild this thing, and we found some cool back guys in there.”

 










As for turning Jerry into a monstrous Easter bunny as part of an intergalactic war in “The Last Temptation of Jerry,” the original concept began as Santa Claus meets “The Fly,” where he gets punished for turning into a magical holiday character.

Harmon explained that it was an episode that needed a lot of mining. “We found a really fun story that was challenging, but one where we ultimately hit gold,” he said. When Jerry irks the family by insisting they celebrate Easter, he bizarrely transforms into an Easter Bunny sex machine as part of an alien plot to destroy the planet. “Easter, which in spite of it being a pagan solstice, a fertility ritual draped even more ironically in Christian resurrection myths, had us questioning what this means to Beth?

“ We had fun with piling on mythology on top of mythology to a point where no one intentionally could make sense of it,” Harmon continued. “Who's on what side? Who's fighting who? It became very funny and really layered.”

For Marder, the world-building became another imaginative component to explore. “Every episode is a completely new landscape with brand new characters,” he said. “The production crew was really open to getting to take swings at these new things with a brutal war in the first episode, and the Citadel and the whole Christian mythology, stuff that looked like cathedrals in the sky. All of them have different color palettes, too. The war one is really blue, the Citadel one is really red, and the Easter one is really pastel. When you take a step back to look at this season, it's all really intentional, which is neat.”

 










“Rick and Morty” is streaming on Adult Swim.

	When Redding, California resident Keith Papini called first responders on Nov. 2, 2016, he feared the absolute worst. 


	He had returned home from his job to find his two children alone in the house, and his wife Sherri Papini nowhere to be seen. After using the Find My app to track her location, Keith found Sherri's phone lying in the dirt on the side of the road, headphones coiled around several strands of her hair. Local law enforcement brought in the FBI, and the search turned into a national media frenzy. Sherri was found 22 days later, starving, bruised, branded, and claiming to police she was abducted and held captive by two masked Hispanic women. But after a six-year investigation, officials had an alternative hypothesis, eventually accusing Sherri of manufacturing the kidnapping to run away with her former boyfriend, James Reyes. 


	The claims skyrocketed the attention, painting Sherri as a real-life Gone Girl. She was convicted for mail fraud and making false statements to the FBI and sentenced to 18 months in federal prison. After leaving prison, Sherri remained out of the public eye, refusing to comment even as her story was turned into a Lifetime original movie (Hoax: The Kidnapping of Sherri Papini) and the Hulu documentary Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini. But now, Sherri is speaking publicly for the first time since her disappearance about what she says really happened  nine years ago. In the new docuseries  Sherri Papini: Caught in the Lie, out May 26 and May 27 on ID and Max, Sherri tells her firsthand account of her experience — including the revelation that she did lie about her whereabouts, but was actually held against her will. 

	











	“The story that the world thinks they know is that I am a master manipulator who has fooled everyone,” Sherri says in the opening moments of the docuseries. “The Sherri Papini that's out there, it's not me. She's not real. I've gone from teenage sex worker to criminal mastermind to master manipulator. I poisoned my children. [I'm a] liar, cheater, whore. . . . I'm so f—ing tired of keeping the secret and living the lie. Now I get to tell the truth.”

	Here's five things we learned from Sherri Papini: Caught in the Lie. 












	According to Papini, she and her now ex-husband Keith had an incredibly toxic marriage. She claims he was often emotionally abusive, and controlled her finances, friendships, and even when she was allowed to speak in the home (Keith denied all of these allegations through an attorney statement in the docuseries.) 


	Because of this tension, Sherri claims she started an emotional affair with a former boyfriend James Reyes. The two spoke often on burner phones, but never met up, she says. According to Sherri, when she went for a run that Nov. afternoon, Reyes pulled up and abducted her. 


	“I remember waking up briefly in the back of the vehicle and not being able to even keep my eyes open,” Sherri says. “And then the next time I woke up was when he was getting me out of the vehicle to go inside, and it was dark. He had one hand underneath my arm trying to help me walk. And I just remember thinking, ‘This is not where I'm supposed to be. I'm supposed to be picking my kids up from day care. I am not supposed to be here.'”


	Police interviewed Reyes during their investigation, who claimed that he picked up Sherri with consent and allowed her to stay at his house — where she planned her injuries and often refused to eat. (Reyes did not participate in the documentary, declined to comment to filmmakers, and has not been charged with any crimes.) But Sherri claims she was held against her will.

	Sherri's ex-husband Keith and several members of her family participated in Hulu's 2024 docuseries Perfect Wife: The Mysterious Disappearance of Sherri Papini. The series also included testimony from the case's lead investigators and FBI officials. But according to Denise Farmer, the FBI's lead investigator on Sherri's case, ID's docuseries is the first time investigators have been able to freely speak about the case. 


	During previous interviews, they had public relations officers in the room to make sure they didn't spill any sensitive techniques or confidential case files. This one is different because no FBI minders were present during any law enforcement interviews — allowing Farmer to speak in more detail to the ID team about the investigation and when they first began to suspect Sherri of lying. 


	“Our work speaks for itself, but we don't speak about our work. We're silent professionals. We don't wanna just tell the whole world how we investigate these cases,” Farmer says in the docuseries. “That's just not something we're gonna publish. This time is different, because I'm retired now.” 

	











	Sherri was found on Thanksgiving day by a motorist near Interstate 5, 22 days after she disappeared. When police questioned her at the hospital, she claimed that she was abducted by two Hispanic women who kept their faces hidden behind masks. She kept this claim up throughout the investigation, even self-publishing a book about her time in captivity called 22 Days. In the book, she nicknamed the two women Smegma and Taint, and described several instances of being injured, beaten, and starved. 


	Officials said she lied to keep the kidnapping hoax going, something that eventually led to her and Keith's divorce. “To go back and watch the footage to see all the people that were affected, and knowing that she's lying — not just lying; she's watching videos of everyone search for her. All the signs, and knowing that her children are at home, and being OK with that? It's painful, and it definitely separates into, this isn't just a lie,” he told Rolling Stone in 2024. This was planned. So it's very painful, and it really shows the level of manipulation and deceit that she put upon us.”


	But in the docuseries, Sherri claims she lied when she was found because she was afraid of Reyes and that her husband would find out about her emotional affair with him. Sherri had signed a postnuptial agreement, which gave Keith a large portion of their funds if she ever cheated on him. 


	“The truth is,” she says in the series, “I was concealing an affair from my husband, threatening to take everything from me if he found out that I was having any involvement [with another man].” 


	Much of the trouble with Sherri's case is her shifting story about what happened to her. During the investigation, Police could not find any record of the two women she claimed had kidnapped her. After speaking to Reyes, they found several people who corroborated the fact that Sherri was in his home. The investigation also confirmed that she and Reyes were in communication prior to her disappearance. 


	Sherri confirms in the docuseries that she was speaking with Reyes, and even might have mentioned in passing a plan to meet up, but never consented to leaving. Her psychologist, Dr. Stephen Diggs, claims in the series that Sherri has self-defeating personality disorder, which makes her susceptible to pleasing behavior. Diggs says this could explain why Sherri kept communicating with Reyes and might have even agreed to meet up with him over the phone. In the docuseries, Sherri even tries to recreate her abduction, but says the exercise doesn't jog any memories. 

	











	“I was abducted,” she says.  “I don't remember if I got into the car.”

	Sherri maintains that while she lied about many things, she is not lying about her interactions with Reyes. For the docuseries, Sherri passed a polygraph saying that she did not ask him to brand her. 


	“The injuries that occurred, the bites on my thigh, the footprint on my back, the brand, the melting of my skin,” she says. “I am telling you there was no consent.”

Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's deeply reported book, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, takes a sledgehammer to Joe Biden's legacy, already in grave disrepair. Claiming to have interviewed more than 200 sources around the 46th president, the CNN anchor and the Axios correspondent have written a necessary and deeply disturbing account of the Biden White House. For anyone interested in politics and Shakespearean tragedy, there's something on every page. 


	For supporters of Biden's presidency and its considerable legislative achievements, this is an extremely grim read. Biden is both the most effective Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson and the man who helped usher Donald Trump back into the Oval Office by not stepping aside for a stronger candidate. The Biden presented in the book is both familiar and tragic, a King Lear on the Potomac with a Lady McBeth at his side in Jill Biden. The small cohort of longtime aides — dubbed the Politburo by insiders — protecting the president from the press, the American people and, it seems, reality, could be cast in a community theater version of The Death of Stalin. 

	











	“I blame his inner circle and I blame him,” one senior administration official told Tapper and Thompson after the election. “What utter and total hubris not to step aside and be a one-term president, as he said he would, and have an open primary when there was time to let the process play out.”


	Hubris is a theme that runs throughout the book. Tapper and Thompson present compelling evidence for a plot to cover up for an octogenarian politician in steep physical and mental decline. It was an ineffective and inane effort, but the president's team, it seems, really did try to prop up a visibly aged man, who had carried decades of personal grief and was facing new family drama that would have broken most. There is an unforgettable eyewitness description of Biden as Mr. Burns from The Simpsons, all skin and bones, and short of breath. One can't help but wonder how Team Biden thought running for reelection was the best thing for the man, not to mention the country. It was malpractice and a scandal of the highest order. Given what's depicted in these pages, it's more than fair to ask: Who was leading America after 4:30 p.m., when, sources told Tapper and Thompson, the president's workday often ended after the early bird special?

	“Five people were running the country, and Joe Biden was at best a senior member of the board,” one person in the know told Tapper and Thompson. Most presidents delegate some authority, but this sounds almost like Woodrow Wilson-in-a-stupor-level stuff.


	One of the many questions that haunts the pages: How far back was Biden sliding into infirmity and no longer up to the task? Aging is a complicated process that differs for everyone. But family tragedy seems, understandably, to have played a role here. There is some evidence in the book that points to the death of Beau Biden, back in 2014, as an inflection point. “Before Beau died, he was 100 percent sharper,” one senior Biden White House official told Tapper and Thompson. “Beau's death wrecked him. Part of him died that never came back.”


	At the 2020 Democratic National Convention, signs were there as well, according to the book. One top Democrat described seeing videos of Biden and thinking, “This was like watching Grandpa who shouldn't be driving.” But the real cliff seems to have been reached in 2022 or 2023, when Biden's shuffling and other physical effects of his age became pronounced and inescapable. Descriptions of a confused and forgetful Biden fill these pages. Most of the sources here seem to be folks sympathetic toward the president, but he comes off more addled and confused as his presidency continues. Time comes for us all, but not all of us have the responsibilities of the presidency.

	Understandably, the stress of his son Hunter Biden's scandal-ridden life seems also to have taken a toll on the president. One cabinet secretary described Hunter's trial for gun possession to Tapper and Thompson as a “five-hundred-pound weight dropped on the president's head.” Joe Biden's story of personal loss — his first wife and infant daughter killed in a car crash, the death of Beau — has been one of the things that made him an empathic figure. No one could doubt he understood and felt pain; it was there on his face. For much of the last decade or more, Joe Biden has had to worry about losing a third child, first to drugs and then to the criminal justice system. The pressures Biden faced, on the job and in his home, would age any human being. 


	The debacle of the 2024 presidential debate is traced in great detail. For this was the moment when the jig was up. America saw what had been kept hidden: a man long past his prime, but still inexplicably auditioning to retain the most important job in the world. It was undeniable and damning and not just a bad night. This was one of the most stunning moments in recent presidential history, when the scales fell from a nation's eyes. A high-powered Democratic operative described it to me as “like watching someone die.” Tapper was a moderator and writes that the performance was even worse in person. At one point, after another horrific Biden gaffe (“Look, if… we finally beat Medicare”), Tapper's colleague Dana Bash passed him a note that read: “He just lost the election.”

	











	Some who dared to speak the uncomfortable truths about Biden's condition are owed an apology for the backlash they faced. Congressman Dean Phillips, who rang the alarm and tried to run against Biden in a primary last year, only to be shut out and shunned by the party. Special Counsel Robert Hur, who declined to prosecute Biden for his mishandling of classified documents, and described the president as “a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” Hur's integrity was attacked by partisans on both sides of the aisle — simply for being honest and doing his duty.


	The figure looming off-camera for much of the book is Donald Trump, and part of the story here is how destructive the negative partisanship of the MAGA moment has become — the political equivalent of a toxic speedball of rage, fear, and resentment. The ends justify the means, the thinking goes. Trump was such a danger to democracy that any tactic necessary was needed to keep him out of office. When reporters or public officials like Phillips and Hur brought up Biden's age, they were set upon in, well, Trumpian style. Team Biden's playbook: Deny, deflect, and attack. But deceiving the American people about a candidate's health and mental acuity was sure to backfire. They were asking the American voter to believe the White House, not their own lying eyes, about a man deteriorating before them. (Biden's stage IV cancer diagnosis, announced the day before Original Sin was released, only raises more questions and eyebrows.)

	If a candidate other than Trump had been running, would they have really tried such an outrageous ploy? At least in part, Biden seems to have convinced himself that only he could beat Trump and thus was not ready to honor his campaign pledge to be a “bridge” to the next generation and pass the torch. Gov. Jerry Brown may have said it best, when reflecting on Biden's decision to stick around: “Politics is addictive. It's exciting. It's a kind of psychic cocaine.”


	History will judge Biden's long-term impact, and Original Sin is but the first draft. His role in the Senate, as vice president, and as president will be chewed over for decades to come. There's a lot there, much of it very good, some bad, and more than a little bit ugly. He's been one of the most consequential politicians of his era. His achievements are real and profound. But this last chapter was brutal, unfortunate, and entirely preventable.

The Better Sister tells two stories about two different sets of siblings, one fictional, one real. Officially, the Prime Video series (premiering May 29) is an adaptation of the 2019 novel by Alafair Burke, about a pair of estranged siblings, played by Jessica Biel and Elizabeth Banks, reuniting when one's husband is murdered. But it's also a way for the show's creator, Olivia Milch, to work through the family dynamics with her own sister, Elizabeth Milch (who's also a Better Sister producer), and their dad David Milch, the brilliant but troubled mind behind all-time classic dramas Deadwood and NYPD Blue. 


	In the story, the father of Biel's Chloe and Banks' Nikki was a drunk who sobered up before his younger daughter Chloe was old enough to be aware of the worst of his behavior. Perhaps not coincidentally, Chloe has grown up to be a celebrated journalist and activist, while Nikki is a recovering addict whose son has been raised by Chloe. Similarly, David Milch suffered through multiple addictions, including heroin and gambling, but got sober by the time Olivia was 10, while Elizabeth was 15. (“Ding, ding, ding — I don't know why I connected with that!” Olivia jokes of the material.) The siblings' personalities — along with their brother Ben, who like Elizabeth has vivid memories of when his father was using — were shaped accordingly. 

	











	Olivia, 36, is a firecracker. She makes her presence felt entering any part of The Better Sister set in Queens, asking each member of the crew what's happening with them and enthusing about their work. Elizabeth is friendly and warm, but not as boisterous as Olivia. During the most tumultuous part of her childhood, she says, “it probably felt useful for me to be quiet and watchful, to know what a given day would be like and how best to fit into it.”  


	Both women were drawn to their father's work as kids. At six, Elizabeth visited the set of her David's short-lived Capitol News and declared, “I'm going to come to work with you every day I have off from school.” Olivia's earliest childhood memories are of being on the set of NYPD Blue. She jokes that the smell of a soundstage is like Proust's madeleines to her.

	As a self-described “very proud nepo baby,” Olivia has brought various pieces of her father's past into Better Sister. She hired Regina Corrado, who wrote for David on Deadwood and his inscrutable follow-up series, John From Cincinnati, as her co-showrunner. The supporting cast includes three Deadwood alums: Kim Dickens as the cop assigned to the murder, Michael Harney as Chloe's loyal doorman, and Keone Young as a private investigator. There are other, subtler links, like a scene where Nikki imagines meeting with her late father in a bar, modeled on (and quoting from) an NYPD Blue scene where Detective Sipowicz dreamed of a similar encounter with his dead son. 

	











	The entire production is laden with Milch family Easter eggs both intentional and accidental. The walls of Chloe's luxurious apartment are lined with paintings by Olivia and Elizabeth's mother Rita. (“Their mother, as an artist, is staggeringly good,” says Biel.) Production designer Ford Wheeler unwittingly designed Nikki's pool house in the Hamptons to resemble a guest house David and Rita used to have. Also a coincidence: In the set where Nikki attends AA meetings, Wheeler hung a sign that reads, “Keep your side of the street clean” — which, Olivia explains, “was one of the most oft-said phrases in our home growing up.” 


	But some Milchian hallmarks Olivia was not keen to tap. David Milch sets were chaotic by nature. Scripts for individual scenes often weren't completed until hours before they were filmed — with actors still expected to be precise with David's distinct language, and even punctuation, despite the lack of prep time. This slowed the process so much that Dickens remembers “looking at call sheets that would say ‘Day 17 of 11,' and ‘TBD' for the script pages.” The Better Sister production was both more organized and more relaxed: no monologues being penned at the last possible second, and while Olivia, like her father, cares deeply about dialogue being delivered with the proper meter, she's less rigid about the words themselves.

	“People who were on the set of Deadwood said they would have paid the cost of admission to be there,” she says, “but that's tough to put people through. Growing up with that environment, sometimes you think, ‘Maybe I don't want to replicate that.'” As Deadwood alum W. Earl Brown puts it, “You see elements of David in Olivia. But she doesn't seem to have let it destroy her, like David did.”


	Olivia also knows that at least part of the reason her father, who has been battling Alzheimer's for the last decade, got away with his unpredictable behavior was, “to put it quite bluntly, he was a man.” By contrast, she created a set with “a super-feminine energy,” as Biel describes it. “You just felt like you were in your mom's kitchen. ‘Do you need a chai tea? Do you need to go to the bathroom?' It was a very warm environment.” 


	Life with David Milch was, if memorable, much less reassuring. Trips to the track could be an emotional roller coaster for anyone who came along to watch him play the ponies. Corrado remembers a day when Milch won $90,000, and drove away with it “in a paper bag in the back of the car. He gave it to me at home. It just seemed very surreal.” The track could feel like a playground for the kids when he won, but Olivia describes his losing days as “terrifying.” On the drive home, she says, “you just felt how upset [he was], the intensity.” Still, David's love of games of chance also led to a tradition that the Milch sisters have been happy to continue: buying lottery tickets for the cast and crew. 

	











	That family spirit of generosity also extends to how they treat even seemingly minor characters. The Better Sister has a mystery as its narrative spine, but it treats every supporting player as a person rather than a plot functionary. “None of the characters are utilitarian,” says Dickens. “They're all so well drawn, and lots of texture, and that sort of has that same feel [as Deadwood].” 


	The show saves its biggest gifts for its two fictional siblings. Amid the darkness of both the murder mystery and Nikki and Chloe's shared past, Banks and Biel have great chemistry and a vivid, complex relationship. They're also really funny together, which is much more expected from Banks than Biel, who usually plays the straight woman when she does comedies. 


	Though the Milches felt the most direct autobiographical connection to the material, the stars didn't have to look very hard to find their own parallels. Biel says of Chloe, “Her experience is different than my experience,” but there are certain lines that are easy to draw between these two polished, glamorous celebrities, with high-profile marriages, whose every move is under intense public scrutiny. “I watch my friends in this business who go through it,” Biel says. “I felt like I had a lot of things I could pull from my personal life regarding that.” 


	Banks is the oldest of four, and describes some of her past films, like Pitch Perfect and Charlie's Angels, as “me working out in my art one of the most important relationships to me, which is sisterhood.” Like the Milches, she knows what it's like to have a very different childhood from her siblings: “My parents split up after I went to college. My baby brother has divorced parents, which is not my experience at all.” She also was drawn to the project because she has several loved ones in AA. 


	So does Corrado, who's the youngest of nine, but who has become close enough with her mentor's clan that she once asked herself, “Why do I feel like an orphan? I have such a big family. But I want to be in the Milch family.” However welcome she feels around them, she also has no illusions about her pecking order relative to Olivia and Elizabeth. “I knew that the sisters, I could never get between them,” she says.

	The Milch sisters remain so tight that on the last day of filming, Olivia stood up to thank the cast and crew and, says Dickens, “could barely get out the words thanking her older sister. All she wanted to do was make her proud.” That older sister sees another parallel between Olivia and one of the siblings she wrote for this show. Olivia and Chloe, Elizabeth explains, “have the fixer mentality. Anything that comes up, they both are like, ‘There's clearly a right way to do this, and I can make sure it happens, and why don't you just let me handle it.' They're both 100 percent right, but also you want to say, as a protective older sister, ‘Or you could let other people try to do things, and who knows how it would go?'”

	











	“But why,” Olivia asks, grinning, “would we ever want to find out?”

	The first chapter of the new book Tearing Down the Orange Curtain: How Punk Rock Brought Orange County to the World, like its unfurling title, leaves you a bit breathless. It starts with the history of the Cuckoo's Nest, a ramshackle Costa Mesa club that became a haven for O.C. punk bands like T.S.O.L, the Vandals, the Adolescents, Agent Orange, and Social Distortion to moor and display their loud, raucous music among the sea of pleasantries of Orange County, California, in the Seventies and Eighties. Quickly, however, through lucid details and retellings from T.S.O.L. singer Jack Grisham and the Nest's owner Jerry Roach, things get sweaty, wild, and loud — setting the frenetic tone for the rest of the book.


	While the heart of Tearing Down the Orange Curtain, by authors Nate Jackson and Daniel Kohn, aims to be a chronological examination of the emergence of O.C. punk and ska before it reverberated around the world and deliciously warped music's soundscape, the book is also a tale of rebellion, addiction, and raw grit. It pummels forward and backward, through chapters focusing on bands like Social Distortion, Sublime, and No Doubt, capturing how those artists, and more, had to fight, often literally, to get their now-indelible songs into existence. Blood was physically spilled for songs like “Story of My Life,” “Doin' Time,” and “Spiderwebs.”

	











	In the firsthand recollections of Social D's Mike Ness, we see the Fullerton, California, tough guy discover his artistry in a babysitter's bedroom fitted with a radio and religious art, what he calls “a shrine to eroticism and rock and roll.” From there, Ness carves a path into punk-rock history with his bandmates Casey Royer, Dennis Danell, and Rikk Agnew — themselves following the groundwork laid by Fullerton punk pioneers, the Mechanics.

	Mosh pits, the uncertainty of the future, and the lull of drugs all collide in the pages that follow, teeing up the unlikely success of bands like the Offspring, who sweated it out on the punk circuit well before their 1994 album Smash — and its ubiquitous “Come Out and Play” — hurtled the band into the mainstream. The book chronicles the early years of the group, while also probing the DIY beginnings of future concert-promoter behemoths Goldenvoice and the Warped Tour festival, where backstage exploits and bus antics became the stuff of punk-rock lore.

	The DNA of Orange County punk is also recognized in the ska, surf-rock, and reggae sounds of Sublime, whose humble house-party origins belied the enduring success the group would experience, despite the heroin-overdose death of singer Bradley Nowell in 1996 — “Santeria” and “Wrong Way” remain in heavy rotation today on rock radio. The same is true of the songs of No Doubt, an Anaheim band that leaned into poppy angst while coming of age in the shadow of the Happiest Place on Earth, Disneyland. Following the suicide of original singer John Spence, a devastating romantic breakup, and the departure of co-founder and songwriter Eric Stefani, No Doubt went on to release a monumental album, 1995's Tragic Kingdom, and catapult its new singer, Gwen Stefani, into superstardom.


	As Tearing Down the Orange Curtain races through the chaotic, violent, roaring corridors of Orange County punk rock, Jackson and Kohn also take pains to dig into the region's past. This is their invitation to the world to discover the music that also shaped them, as both journalists and music fans. The book, like the music it celebrates, goes by fast. The same can be said of the era too.

This post contains spoilers for this week's episode of The Last of Us, now streaming on Max. 


	In a way, referring to this as the Season Two finale of The Last of Us feels like a misnomer. Yes, it is the final installment that we will be getting this year — or possibly, according to co-creator Neil Druckmann, for more than another year. But it in no way feels like a conclusion to anything, other than this period where Ellie was the series' primary point-of-view character. There's a silly cliffhanger where it seems as if Abby has shot and killed Ellie — a classic case of what TV writers refer to as “schmuckbait,” where only someone who knows nothing about storytelling or television would believe what just seemed to happen — and then the story rewinds to the day Ellie and Dina arrived in Seattle, only now we're following Abby as a member of WLF(*). The season doesn't so much end as it just stops, abruptly and somewhat confusingly. 

	











(*) When we first catch up with Abby inside the stadium, she's holding a copy of Thieves of the City, a fake book mocked up to resemble City of Thieves, the novel by Game of Thrones co-creator David Benioff, about two young Russian men who, during World War II, are sent behind enemy lines on a pointless quest. Seems apt, even if they were searching for eggs (on behalf of a military officer who wants a cake at his daughter's wedding) rather than vengeance.  


	This is the inherent risk of splitting your source material across multiple films or TV seasons. When it works, you get the two recent Dune movies, where it felt like Denis Villeneuve needed that much time to properly cover the important material from the book. When it doesn't, like with the end of the original Hunger Games movie series, it can feel like a naked cash grab, padded out to the point of pleasing only the most hardcore fans. (And not even them sometimes.) 


	At only seven episodes compared to Season One's nine, this round of The Last of Us doesn't so much feel padded as incomplete. Yes, serialized dramas are built for stories to bleed from one season into the next. But usually there's some sense of a clear character and/or story arc for an individual season — whether it's fully resolved within that season, or comes to an important turning point at the end. This is not that. This is four episodes (minus the opening chapters and the Joel flashback) of Ellie seeking revenge against Abby, and various people suggesting why it might be a bad idea, all leading to a literal bang and then the perspective shift. It feels like we're getting only half the story, because we are, with no way of knowing how long it will take for the other half to arrive. It's a deeply unsatisfying way to begin an extended hiatus, regardless of whatever issues may have existed previously.

	Even if you accept that the show had to tell this revenge story, no matter how much Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal's chemistry together elevated this series above being Smarter Walking Dead, the execution has been iffy — carried more by the intensity and magnetism of Ramsey's performance than by anything they were given to do with Isabela Merced. 


	For starters, there was the way the season framed Ellie and Dina's decision to stay in Seattle once they not only discovered that the Wolves were far larger, more organized, and dangerous than they had assumed, but learned that Dina was pregnant. If the show had portrayed one or both of them as ambivalent about the idea of being a parent — whether in general or in this broken, scary world in particular — then the idea of them staying would have made more emotional sense. It would be a way to put off thinking about it, or even to let fate make a decision for them. But from the moment Dina told Ellie, it was clear that both of them were overjoyed at the possibility. Yet still, they refused to leave. It's not until early in the finale, after Dina has been injured — and after Ellie has finally told her the full story about what Joel did and why Abby came for him, and that Ellie knew most of it already — that Dina finally acts like someone who regrets ever having come here, and endangering herself and her pregnancy.

	After that — and also after a long and implausible explanation for how Jesse was able to track down Ellie and Dina within a sprawling urban environment he's never been to before — our heroes begin planning to get the hell out of here, and grab Tommy on the way home. Jesse scolds Ellie a bunch for being selfish. We are perhaps meant to be on her side — she's the main character, and he's a guy we barely know(*) — but nothing he says seems unfair or unreasonable. In a reality like this, when Maria and friends have managed to build a relative paradise like Jackson, Ellie's decision to take off on this crazy quest has implications that go far beyond the risk to herself and Dina. 


(*) In addition to the flashback episode shining a light on how much the show lost by killing off Joel, it also underlines what a disappointing job the season has done in establishing many of the new people like Jesse, and even Dina. She's been around for the entire season, and he's been in more than half of it. And neither character feels as fully developed in that time as Joel's dad and Gene did within the space of a few minutes apiece in the last episode. Some of that is a credit to older and more experienced actors like Tony Dalton and Joe Pantoliano being able to do a lot with a little. But Young Mazino and Isabela Merced are doing well with what they're given; they're just not being handed as much to dig into as their veteran counterparts. 












	As the trio sets out to find Tommy, we run into the other big structural problem of the season: We know both too much and not enough about the other Seattle characters. If Druckmann, Mazin, and company had decided to show things only as Ellie learned about them — only seeing the Seraphites whenever the women came across their handiwork, or their corpses, and not meeting Isaac or any Wolves who didn't directly cross paths with Ellie and Dina — then it would have felt disorienting in an interesting way. And it would have made sense with the plan to now switch over to Abby's POV for a while. Instead, we were given context that this season's protagonists didn't have, yet not enough knowledge to really understand the conflicts at play between the Wolves and the Seraphites, or even within different WLF factions. Ellie being captured by the Serpahites, and only saved from disembowelment because they all need to run off and deal with an attack by Isaac's forces, would feel even more harrowing if we knew as little as she did about who these people are and why they're doing this to her. 


	While hanging out at the bookstore again, Ellie thumbs through a copy of The Monster at the End of This Book, a self-aware Sesame Street tie-in where Grover is terrified about meeting the title character when he gets to the last page, then relieved when the monster turns out to be him. The Last of Us has already done its version of that, when Joel turned out to be the monster at the end of the season. Here, it seems like we are headed for a sequel. On the way to rescue Tommy, Ellie figures out where Abby has been hiding out, and again chooses revenge over family. Abby's gone by the time Ellie gets there, but she manages to kill two of her sidekicks, and is horrified to realize that one of them was very pregnant. She tries to deliver the baby herself, with instructions from the dying mom, but this is not The Pitt (nor is it Station Eleven, another Max postapocalyptic drama which had a memorable episode built around childbirth). Ellie has no clue what she's doing, and she fails at the impromptu task. She has become the exact thing she came to Seattle to punish, and she has started to recognize this.

	Perhaps if not for the transparently phony cliffhanger, that would feel like enough of a character arc for the year. But the shooting is obnoxious, and the shift in POV not as gracefully executed as it should be, ending an uneven season on a real bum note. 

	











	Kaitlyn Dever is a world-class actor in her own right, and maybe moving Abby to the forefront of the narrative will finally give this revenge plot the emotional clarity it's struggled with to this point. But whether it works or not, that's a long way off. And we're left with this finale to consider until then.

	When it premiered in 2023, HBO's The Last of Us was hailed by many as the best video game adaptation ever. A huge part of that acclaim was attributed to how closely series' creators Craig Mazin and Neill Druckmann (who co-created the game) stuck to the script when translating the 2013 title to television.


	For anyone who'd played the game, it seemed obvious; The Last of Us was designed to closely resemble the language of cinematic storytelling. The first season lifted the entire structure of the game — with 1:1 recreation of many scenes and lines of dialogue to the point where fans could practically speak alongside the characters precognitively.


	But fans also knew that by the show's second season, a near-perfect adaptation would be much more difficult. 2020's The Last of Us Part II was a different beast than its predecessor, with a more sprawling story told from different perspectives — and its own tectonic narrative shifts from the first entry that stirred controversy among audiences.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	While its creators have been open about how the story of The Last of Us (the show) will need to evolve to fit the medium of TV, it hasn't stopped those in-the-know from counting off and decrying some of the biggest alterations to the game's plot. And while it remains to be seen just how far the trajectory of the narrative will depart from the source material as the series progresses, stretching the game out over multiple seasons, it's clear from Season Two that even minor updates could have an enormous impact on how television audiences will experience the story of Joel, Ellie, and Abby.


	Without getting caught up on minutiae, some of the differing choices are apparent while others are more subtle. Here are all the biggest changes we've caught in The Last of Us Season Two from the games.


	[Spoilers ahead for The Last of Us Season Two, episodes one to seven, as well as the games.]


	The season premiere opens with a look back on the final moments of the show's Season One finale, wherein Ellie confronts Joel about the events that took place in Salt Lake City. Joel lies about Ellie's procedure that might've saved humanity from the cordyceps infection and omits the whole bit about slaughtering almost every Firefly in the hospital. It's ambiguous as to whether Ellie believes him — but the shadow of doubt looms.

	In the game, the introduction is framed as a conversation between Joel (Pedro Pascal in the show, Troy Baker in game) and his brother Tommy (Gabriel Luna in the show, Jeffrey Pierce in game). With somber flashbacks to the violent night, the scene plays out more grimly than in the show, reminding players that even if they agreed with Joel's actions, he has innocent blood on his hands. When questioned by Tommy about what he really did, Joel replies, “I saved her.” This line does end up in the series but is relayed later by Tommy when speaking to someone else. It's a small detail, but cutting the interaction gives Joel a lot less screen time early in the show, which focuses more on the people affected by his decisions than his internal struggle about them.


	With the pivot away from Joel in the episode's opener comes a much earlier introduction to Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) and her surviving Firefly cohorts in the immediate aftermath of the bloodbath in Salt Lake City. In a makeshift graveyard outside the hospital, surrounded by the giraffes that Ellie met in one of the first season's most emotional scenes, the group discuss their next moves after burying their dead. Their mission is clear: kill Joel, after finding another outfit to regroup and rebuild with.

	In the game, Abby arrives in the story further down the line as a seemingly innocuous figure during a raid by the infected horde. Her motivations and allegiances remain a mystery until much later, making her serve as a more bogeyman-like threat. Here, she bears more humanity up front, and is intended to be empathized with as a victim of Joel rather than shrouded in the otherness of being the antagonist.


	One of the biggest changes established in season one was in how the fungal cordyceps spread and wreak havoc throughout the world. Rather than infecting people through airborne spores (necessitating gas masks during encounters), the fungus grows underground, stretching out a nervous system-like web of roots that help it find human colonies for prey.


	In Jackson, the town where Joel and Ellie have found refuge with Tommy, an initiative to expand the community unearths a serious issue with water pipelines that are filled with the fungal tendrils (although the threat they pose is played down as a curiosity for those who may not recall their impact in the previous season). All of this is new to the story, and sets up a ticking clock toward a major incursion in Jackson that's never in any real danger during the events of the game.

	











	Early in the premiere, Ellie's friend and potential love interest Dina (Isabella Merced in the show, Shannon Woodard in the game) stops by to pay Joel a visit, discussing the town's various renovations and the off-kilter behavior of Ellie. It's quickly established that Joel has taken a liking to Dina and sees in her a healthier father-daughter relationship than he currently has with Ellie, who's become more distant.


	Their relationship is less defined in the game, with Dina seen more through Ellie's perspective. The deeper ties established here play into additionally added character interactions and sequences that veer away from the game in later episodes, but it also reinforces the strain between Joel and Ellie, even as we see them interact less in the series than they did in the game.


	One of the strongest aspects of the first season of The Last of Us was the expansion of characters like Bill (Nick Offerman) and Frank (Murray Bartlett), who go from footnotes in the journey to fully fleshed out people in one of the best episodes of television ever. Season Two does much of this, too, but also adds new characters like Catherine O'Hara's Gail, who was originally meant to appear in the game but was ultimately cut.


	Gail is the town therapist, and although she's clearly damaged and finding solace in heavy drinking, her role is to help assuage much of the trauma the survivors face daily. Specifically, she is working through Joel's issues with Ellie — and the secrets Joel himself is withholding, even though Gail hates Joel for killing her infected husband just a year earlier. Gail's session with Joel has shades of other conversations he has with Tommy in-game, and again reinforces the unstable nature of Joel, who is coming apart at the seams as his relationship with Ellie flounders in the face of his actions.


	One of the biggest alterations to an important scene from the game comes at the end of the premiere, where Ellie comes across Joel sitting on his porch after making a mess at the town's party by punching Seth for his homophobic comments. Having already told Joel off in front of everyone, Ellie pauses for a moment to look at her would-be father before silently passing by.


	This is one of the most shocking pivots from the game, which at this point in the narrative had spent more time letting players breath in the short-lived family dynamic of the pair. In-game, this sequence is actually the penultimate scene toward the very end, a flashback diving into the last conversation Joel and Ellie ever had that recontextualizes much of their relationship. In the space where the porch scene exists in the series, there's instead a different flashback where Joel fulfills his promise to teach Ellie how to play guitar, performing an acoustic rendition of Pearl Jam's “Future Days.” The omission of the song makes sense given that “Future Days” released in 2013, the year the apocalypse happens, which is changed to 2003 in the series, meaning that the song was never written in this reality.

	











	From the initial casting announcement of Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, many fans were quick to point out that the actress lacked the bodybuilder-like physique of the in-game character (voiced by Laura Bailey, modeled after Jocelyn Mettler). Although the show's creators have argued that the bulky musculature isn't essential to the character, it serves a different purpose in-game, where at the portion the story that makes up episode two, players take on control of the character to see that she plays very much like Joel did in the first game — a powerhouse in contrast to Ellie's more stealthy gameplay.


	While Abby's lack of raw strength makes her more vulnerable to danger in the show, there's also cutbacks to her emotional vulnerability with characters like Owen (Spencer Lord in the show, Patrick Fugit in game). In the game, an early conversation overlooking Jackson reveals that Abby and Owen were once romantically involved, but that he's now with another party member named Mel. He tries to convince Abby that the threat is too great, and that they should turn back. In the series, the details of their love triangle are pulled, and Owen instead rallies the group to abandon the mission behind Abby's back.


	Outside of reshuffling individual scenes, this is a point at which deliberate choices to which characters are present for specific sequences may truly impact the plot of The Last of Us moving forward. In the game, it's established that brothers Joel and Tommy always take their lookout patrols together, but with a massive snowstorm looming over Jackson, the show opts to keep Tommy planted in-town, while Dina instead accompanies Joel for their ill-fated meeting with Abby. In a parallel subplot, Dina's ex-boyfriend Jesse (Young Mazino in the show; Stephen Chang in game) replaces Dina as Ellie's patrol partner.


	The effects of this are twofold: It means that Ellie and Dina's will-they-or-won't-they dynamic is pushed further down the line as a major interaction between the potential paramours doesn't occur here; secondly, it places Tommy in Jackson for a life-threatening action sequence that teases his death (but spares him), rather than being in the room when Abby ultimate executes his brother.

	











	By far the biggest addition thus far to the series is a large-scale action sequence in Jackson that pays off on the tease of the cordyceps network previously introduced beneath the town. Invaded by a sprawling horde of infected, including a giant bloater that almost kills Tommy, Jackson is left almost entirely in ruins. The events of the raid occur simultaneously with Joel and Dina's arrival at the resort where Abby's group waits in hiding.


	In the game, Joel and Tommy find Abby surrounded by infected (as she is in the show), but the stakes are somewhat lower, and Joel's intentions are more altruistic — wanting to save Abby and bring her in from the storm rather than racing to find armed allies to help quell the assault on his home. For Joel, the endpoint is ultimately the same, but now his death is coupled with countless more in Jackson.


	For gamers, Joel's death has been a well-guarded secret in the lead-up to the series' second season. Players knew it was coming, but it doesn't make the sucker punch any less painful. But there is some softening of the edges — whether to make Abby feels slightly less savage or simply avoid comparisons to another shocking death in a similar show (The Walking Dead) — Abby's execution of Joel isn't quite as gratuitously violent.


	In the show, Abby does use a golf club to beat Joel to the brink of death, and the squelching of her fists against his face is skin crawling. But after Owen begs her to put an end to it, Abby chooses to stab Joel in the neck with the sharpened edge of the broken driver. While still unsettling, the scene plays more as Abby providing a small mercy to Joel with silent blow, whereas in the game she continues to cave in his skull with the club as a restrained Ellie holds eye contact. It might sound like a nitpick to those who'd prefer a less bloodthirsty approach, but it does change the framing of the scene thematically.


	Episode three opens with the aftermath of Joel's death, seeing Tommy tend to his body and Ellie suffering from PTSD as she recovers from both the severe physical and psychological trauma she endured on the night of. The show jumps ahead three months to show both the town of Jackson and Ellie herself at an uneasy stabilization point. In her sessions with Gail, Ellie is pretending to be fine despite the therapist's inclinations otherwise.

	











	All of this is newly provided context added for the show that informs how the people of Jackson chose to respond to both Joel's death and the horde attack (which also isn't in the original story). In the game, a decision to pursue Abby is made just days after Joel's burial, providing immediate action and consequences to players who want to get revenge themselves. It also changes who from Jackson wants to take said action given the different circumstances the characters find themselves in from the show.


	Midway through episode three, the plot shifts briefly away from Jackson to a group of facially scarred travelers (who we'll later know as the Seraphites). Less equipped with technology and weaponry than the other factions like the Washington Liberation Front and FEDRA, the Scars (as they're nicknamed) resemble a more hunter-gatherer culture, and wax poetic about the benevolent prophet of their cult. They're subsequently ambushed and slaughtered by unknown attackers, with even the women and children ruthlessly killed.


	This differs extensively from the game, where the Scars debut later in Ellie's trek through Seattle as a terrifying force depicted more facelessly and savage. Here, Ellie and Dina discover their corpses and assume the violence was the work of Abby's group (the WLF), reinforcing their perception of the organization as killers to be stopped. In the game, the Scars play a crucial role in Abby's personal story, but at this juncture of the series, they're just another sea of victims.


	Stemming from the major changes made with episode two's destruction of Jackson, episode three sees a town hall meeting held for the community to debate whether they should send a hunting party out to get revenge on Abby. While Tommy himself wants blood, he's more concerned about protecting both the town and Ellie, the latter he knows will absolutely try to go it alone to get payback. Despite an impassioned plea from Seth and a relatively well-reasoned one by Ellie, the council votes against sacrificing resources for a suicide mission. In response, Ellie and Dina decide to sneak out themselves, minimizing the impact on the community with a smaller mission.


	This is a stark contrast to the game, where Tommy himself decides to take on the burden of vengeance, sneaking out to murder Joel's killers (as he believes Joel would've for him). Unlike the show, it's Tommy's wife Maria (Rutina Wesley in the show, Ashley Scott in game) who sends Ellie and Dina out, not to kill anyone, but to bring her husband home safely. The show's divergence here is enormous, first by grounding Tommy in Jackson rather than as the leader of the violent excursion and secondly removing any guise about Ellie's intentions. Rather than using the salvation of Tommy as an excuse to inadvertently kill those who wronged her, Ellie's bloodlust is on full display to Dina.

	











	A smaller repercussion of the changing dynamics and character pairings provides the town bartender, Seth, with a moment of redemption for his past behavior. In episode one, Seth spews homophobic rhetoric and slurs at Ellie and Dina during their dance, leading the Joel's intervention and subsequent shunning from his adoptive daughter. In the show, Seth provides the same weak apology he's coaxed into from the game, but he also stands up to support Ellie during the council meeting (although he makes it more about projecting strength than making amends).


	His final act of penance is being the one to equip Ellie and Dina with weapons and supplies for their venture and helping them sneak out in the night — the role played by Maria in the game, sending the duo off to rescue her husband.


	The show's framing of Dina is overall very different, giving her much deeper tactical knowledge and street smarts than the more impulsive Ellie. In many ways, she's the one leading the charge as the brain behind the operation. She also leads their blossoming relationship, luring Ellie into opening about their kiss in the premiere, although stopping short of acting on their chemistry. She also reveals that within the three-month gap added to the series, she's gotten back together with Jesse (once again).


	At this point in the original plot, Ellie and Dina have already slept together and are depicted as essentially being a couple. Ellie remains strongheaded as always, but in the game there's a more tragic love story at play as she is pulling along a less willing and capable participant under the false pretense of saving one of their own. Here, Ellie is more reserved, while Dina has more agency and control.


	Episode four picks up with a flashback to 2018 (15 years into the apocalypse), where a platoon of FEDRA soldiers is riding in an APC. Their leader is shown to be Isaac (Jeffrey Wright in both the game and show), a world-weary veteran who ultimately turns on the group, killing all but one solder before aligning with the WLF (who get nicknamed as Wolves in the episode).


	In the present, Isaac is the leader of the Wolves and is waging a personal war on the Scars to eradicate the rival faction. In a later scene, he can be seen interrogating and executing a Scar at WLF's home base. This is all in line with the game but comes into play much sooner than before — where Isaac's role is mostly confined to Abby's subplot that we'll likely see in future seasons of the show.

	











	While the first game was neatly broken into four parts based on the seasons of the year, The Last of Us Part II has a much more complex structure. Episodes one to three of the show mostly make up the prologue before things would've kicked into gear in the game. By episode four, Ellie and Dina are in Seattle for the first of three days that round out this section of the story. But playing the game, each day is an arduous journey in their own right; conversely the show speeds through day one in a single episode.


	Ellie and Dina make their way through Seattle, pausing for just one pitstop at a record store, before targeting a defunct TV station occupied by the Wolves. By removing Tommy from the equation, the duo isn't finding corpses left behind by Joel's brother to chart their next path — skipping over sequences where Abby's friends begin dying off. As of now, they've been pulled completely from the plot and could potentially all be alive and well.


	After fleeing the TV station and killing two Wolves in a remixed turn of events, Ellie and Dina find themselves in a subway tunnel besieged by both WLF and infected. It's a harrowing sequence lifted directly from the game, but the scene's ending changes to match the internal logic of the show's reality. Near their escape, Ellie throws herself in front of Dina, taking a bite from an infected person to save her friend. In this world, that's a death sentence for anyone but Ellie.


	The scene plays out slightly differently in the game, wherein airborne spores force everyone to wear gasmasks — including Ellie, to hide her immunity. In this version, they're also attacked but her mask is smashed, revealing the truth to Dina as Ellie manages to survive the fatal inhalant. In the show, the bite leads to an all-night standoff where Dina must hold a gun to Ellie's head until she sees that there's no transformation.


	Unlike the game, where Ellie and Dina hook up early on, the show takes some time teasing out their potential pairing. Following Ellie's bite, an awestruck Dina finally makes a move after the emotional whiplash of realizing that she hadn't lost her newfound love. It's here that Dina also reveals that she's pregnant with Jesse's baby, with Ellie proudly proclaiming that she'll be the dad in their triple parenting situation.


	Obviously, this sex scene occurs much sooner in the game, but it's also the impact of the pregnancy reveal that's changed. In the source material, Dina's pregnancy is used as an excuse to leave her behind in the theatre, pitting players as Ellie alone, who can set aside any pretenses of the journey being anything more than a revenge mission without her partner's safety to worry about.

	











	Similarly to the game, the episode ends with a massive explosion rattling downtown Seattle. Using a stolen walkie lifted from the TV station, Ellie and Dina can suss out that it's the Wolves who are making a move on some other entity, and the pair quickly plan to make their move in the middle of the chaos to find their marks.


	Although it's unclear exactly who the Wolves are raining fire upon in both versions of the story, it's presumed to be the Scars in the adaptation; whereas in the game, Ellie and Dina believe that Tommy is responsible for the carnage. If it turns out to be Wolves attacking Seraphites, it will shift up the timeline of the game where the Wolves have escalated their attempts to eradicate the group that plays heavily into later portions of the story. For now, the identity of who's involved remains a mystery.


	Episode Five opens with a conversation between two Wolves named Hanrahan (Alanna Ubach) and Elise (Hettienne Park), with the former investigating the latter for killing a troop of her own men — including her son, Leon. At Hanrahan's behest, Elise had sent a squad of Wolves to the basement of the Lakehill Hospital that the faction is occupying. After receiving a call from Leon cryptically stating, “It's in the air,” Elise is forced to seal the soldiers in the basement to die.


	Both Hanrahan and Elise are new characters created for the show, as is Leon — although there is another character in the video game that suffers a similar fate. In The Last of Us Part II, players can find a note while exploring Seattle that tells the story of a would-be bank robber with the same name, who is also sealed into a vault to meet his demise. Here, Leon's fate helps flesh out the human toll the Wolves are suffering but also teases a much greater reveal later in the episode.


	During their trek through Seattle, Dina and Ellie stumble across a mural painted to worship the prophet of the Scars, now defaced by graffiti and blood after WLF soldiers executed a group of the cultists, leaving their bodies in a pile. Dina throws up again and Ellie urges her to go back to protect herself and the baby. It's here that Dina explains that she shot a raider who murdered her mother and sister. He was the first non-infected person she'd ever killed, and the event left her orphaned.

	











	This is similar to Dina's backstory in the game although, originally, Dina's sister Talia survives the ordeal and raises her in the following years. Talia teaches Dina about their family's Jewish faith, which becomes a big part of Dina's worldview as she imparts stories and parables to Ellie during in-game dialogue. In the show, Dina doesn't mention religion, instead teaching Ellie about Amish communities in the pre-apocalypse. The loss of her family remains a driving factor in wanting to bring Joel's killers to justice.


	After a grueling encounter with multiple infected stalkers, Ellie and Dina are saved by the surprise appearance of Jesse, who tells the pair that both he and Tommy left Jackson shortly after their departure to bring them back safely. Having split up, Tommy is now on his own searching for the girls, leaving the newfound trio to track him down. The group quickly stumbles upon a pack of Scars slaughtering Wolves, causing Dina to take an arrow to the thigh and retreat with Jesse to the theatre while Ellie continues her pursuit.


	This is the reverse of the scenario laid out in the game, where Ellie and Dina leave Jackson to find Tommy, although Ellie does run into Jesse in a similar situation. In the original story, Ellie encounters the Scars alone and takes the arrow herself, although it's mostly shrugged off as a minor injury given that players need to trudge on with the mission. In the show, Tommy's whereabouts are unknown, whereas the game's plot sees Ellie tracking him throughout the city as he carves his way through the Wolves and sews chaos.


	Picking up on the tease from the episode's opening, a major retcon to the lore of the show comes into play as it's revealed that the cordyceps can now spread via spores in the air, having evolved to become even more lethal. As Ellie chases one of Joel's killers, Nora (Tati Gabrielle in the show, Chelsea Tavares in the game) through the Lakehill Hospital, she eventually forces her prey down into the basement where Leon and his crew had previously been trapped. Here, Nora begins choking on airborne spores, sealing her fate — but not before realizing that Ellie herself is unaffected and is the mysteriously immune girl that got her friends killed by Joel back in Salt Lake City.


	The reveal is a huge development for the series that brings the nature of the infection more in line with the game, where airborne spores play a major factor from the very beginning. Nora's realization of Ellie's immunity plays out similarly in both versions, but has a different level of impact here as the spores now signal a much graver threat to humanity than ever before.

	











	After the big reveal of both the spores and her immunity, Ellie proceeds to try beating information out of Nora with a massive pipe. Nora refuses to tell Ellie the whereabouts of Abby and her friends, knowing that she's already doomed after inhaling the cordyceps. It's a point of no return for Ellie in both versions of the story, as all pretenses of salvation or rescuing her friends are tossed aside, laying bare her bloodlust and vengeful nature as she relentlessly pummels Nora to death.


	In the show, the sequence plays out like a heel turn for Ellie as she commits the first flat-out murder of a Wolf, although the scene abruptly cuts to black before Nora's death can be shown. At this point in the game, Ellie has already killed many people (Wolves included), and although the scene is still impactful, the show's relative lack of violence from Ellie makes the sequence more shocking, if not quite as sadistic. Bathed in the basement's red light, Ellie resembles a horror movie monster; however, in the game, the execution is seen from Nora's perspective, forcing players to press the button prompts for each blow Ellie lands as they experience the murder through the eyes of the victim.


	Episode Six begins with a cold open set in 1983, 20 years before the show's version of the outbreak, where younger versions of Joel (Andrew Diaz) and Tommy (David Miranda) are having a panicked discussion. Tommy's done something wrong and is afraid that their father (Tony Dalton) is going to react violently. The senior Miller is a police officer and despite his anger over Tommy buying drugs — and Joel trying to take the blame — he responds with a more measured tongue than expected. Joel's dad instead explains how his own father beat him, and although he has been hard on the boys, he believes that he's “doing a little better than [his] father did.” He hopes Joel will do the same.


	All of this is newly created for the show. In the game, the only depiction of the before times is from the night of the outbreak when Joel loses his daughter, which served as the opener for the series premiere. Players know that Joel is protective of Tommy from conversations they have through the games, none of which are overtly present in the show's narrative. Instead, this scene shows more plainly why Joel has felt the need to be so violently defensive of his loved ones.

	











	The whole episode is told through a series of flashbacks, chronicling different birthdays for Ellie from the five-year period between their arrival in Jackson and the night before Joel's death. We see how happy their early years were as a family, with Joel going out of his way to plan elaborate gifts for Ellie, including cakes, a personalized guitar, and a trip to a nearby museum where she can live out the fantasy of riding in the Apollo 15 space shuttle. By her nineteenth birthday, six months prior to the show's present, their relationship had mostly fallen apart.


	Some of the sequences, like the museum visit and Ellie's first patrol, are pulled directly from the game, although they're spread across the first 10 or so hours of the story, usually coming to Ellie as memories. Others, like how she covers up her bite with a chemical burn and tattoo, are pieces only alluded to in passing. Constructing a full episode of these moments, and reframing them all as birthdays, serves to chart the downward trajectory of their bond and succinctly close the book on Joel and Ellie's relationship. 


	One recurring visual motif from The Last of Us Part II is the ubiquitous presence of moths. In the game's opening title screen, they're seen fluttering in the light of a windowpane; there's one on Ellie's guitar neck, which is implied to be the inspiration for Ellie's tattoo. That's all here, too, but mixed around a bit. Rather than Ellie being inspired by the moth on her guitar (which Joel refurbished instead of fully customizing), it's actually Ellie who's enamored with moths, referring to them as something she saw in a dream. From her drawings, Joel pulls the image for her guitar and admires the moth tattoo on her arm after simmering down from their argument.


	In the game, the importance of the moths is left more ambiguous, whereas the show states it clearly during a conversation between Joel and Gail. The exasperated therapist tells Joel that moths are historically considered symbols of death. Previously, players might've only gleaned that knowledge from interviews with the game's co-director, Neil Druckmann.


	On Ellie's nineteenth birthday, Joel takes her out on her first patrol as a gift, which affords them the opportunity to ride horses and bond like they did in the old days. Here, Ellie is planning to confront Joel about the events of Salt Lake City, but they're interrupted by Eugene (Joe Pantoliano), who has been infected and begs to see his wife Gail one last time before being put down. Ellie thinks she's convinced Joel to show him mercy, and runs back to get the horses; Joel brings Eugene to the lakefront where he betrays his word and kills him.

	











	In the game, Eugene is mentioned in passing but never appears in the flesh. His hideout is the grow house where Ellie and Dina smoke a little weed and sleep together for the first time, but his role is minimal. Here, his death at Joel's hands becomes an inflection point for Ellie in the story.


	Following Eugene's death, Ellie and Joel return his body to Jackson, where Joel attempts to lie to Gail about his demise, saying that he opted to end his own life to spare her the pain. Disgusted by the ruse, Ellie breaks down telling Gail the truth, creating the rift between Joel and Gail seen earlier in the season, and setting up a major confrontation between the already fractured father and daughter duo at the end of the episode. In the aftermath of Eugene's death, Ellie sees clearly how easily Joel can lie.


	None of this happens in the game, but instead there's a different flashback that the show omits entirely. In that sequence, Ellie disappears from Jackson, leaving Joel to track her back to the hospital in Salt Lake City. There, she confronts him in the way she intended to on patrol (in the show) and learns the truth about his role in killing the Fireflies and Marlene, denying her a choice in the fate of humanity.


	Much to the relief of many fans, the penultimate episode of the season does a slight bit of retconning to show that Ellie's final interaction with Joel wasn't just ignoring him on the porch the night of the New Year's Eve party, but rather that the original depiction from the season premiere was a feint by the series' writers. After passing by Joel, Ellie doubled back to speak with him, demanding the truth about the hospital massacre for the cathartic moment she would've gotten in the omitted Salt Lake City scene from the game. He finally tells her real story as he breaks down crying, and although it deeply affects Ellie, she offers the hope that she'll someday forgive him.


	The Porch Scene, as it's known by fans, is a pivotal moment in the game and was previously a point of contention around the show's earlier truncated version. As it's portrayed in the adaptation, it serves multiple purposes — both airing out the truth and showing that Joel and Ellie had, in some small way, opened the door to reconciling on the night before his death. It's a lot to digest; in the game, there's months between the revelation and Ellie's willingness to forgive, and their shared secret is the reason for Ellie's growing disconnect from Joel. In the show, her suspicions and teenage angst play a larger role than her factual knowledge, and she's much quicker to make amends within the very same scene. Here, Joel also imparts the same sentiment his father did about doing better for his own kid than prior generations did for theirs.

	











	The biggest difference, however, is the placement of this flashback, which will likely serve as the last time viewers ever see Joel and Ellie together. In the game, it's part of the final cutscene, and the reveal that Ellie wanted to forgive Joel is meant to imbue a sense of tepid hopefulness at the end of a mostly bleak story.


	Episode Seven picks up back at the theatre where Jesse is desperately trying to tend to a panicking Dina's arrow wound. Shortly after, Ellie arrives and, after a brief interrogation about her whereabouts from Jesse, she rushes back to see Dina. Just like in the game, Dina cleans up a bloodied Ellie in an intimate moment as Ellie quietly breaks down while coming to terms with killing Nora. Ellie claims that she left her to die from infection rather than implying an execution. Whether that's true is open to interpretation. Ellie then opens up about how easy it was to beat information out of Nora, before coming clean about Joel's actions that set everything in motion — from killing Abby's father to denying everyone a cure.


	This is a huge divergence from the original plot, where Ellie keeps her growing bloodlust to herself, as well as the truth about Joel. She's also much more empathetic toward Abby's crew than she is in the game, acknowledging that perhaps Nora didn't deserve to die. In the show, Dina declares that it's time to go home; her perception of Joel now shattered after becoming much closer to him than they were in the game.


	While traveling to the bookstore where Tommy should be held up, Ellie and Jesse notice another Seraphite mural painted on a building, but this one has a different face than before. Ellie wonders if this means that the group has different prophets; Jesse shrugs it off. In the game, there's only one figurehead for the Scars, whose story is mostly told via notes strewn throughout the world. By this point in the game, very little about Scars is known — they're more mysterious than they've appeared in the show and their origins and ongoing war with the Wolves doesn't come into focus until later chapters of the story. Here, there's an implication that their cult might have differing sects, or that there's some deeper meaning to different murals adorning new faces.


	Shortly after arriving at the bookstore, Ellie and Jesse break for a moment while Ellie combs through some children's books. Here, Jesse concedes that he can never love Dina the same way Ellie does, and that he previously fell for another woman who'd passed through Jackson for just two weeks. He considered leaving with her, but chose to stay and do right by the community that took him in. In that same vein, he also confesses later in the episode that he voted against Ellie's request to hunt down Abby's crew, again arguing that she didn't have the town's best interest in mind.

	











	All of this is new information added to the show, although a similar conversation does occur in the game where Jesse acknowledges that Dina and Ellie are the stronger couple. In the show, Jesse's sense of duty to the community over his own desires is a bigger talking point from Ellie, meant first as an insult, then later as a compliment.


	Prior to arriving at the bookstore, Ellie and Jesse run across a group of Wolves torturing and preparing to execute a young male Scar. Ellie wants to intervene, but Jesse prevents her, saying “This is not our war.” Ellie initially holds her tongue, but their differences come to a head later when the pair are arguing about whether to pursue Tommy, who's pinning down the Wolves with sniper fire near the marina. After Jesse accuses Ellie of only acting for herself, she screams, “Fuck the community,” and chastises him for letting the Wolves kill Scar children. Her words directly conflict with her own actions, as she continues the pursuit of revenge against her rivals, leaving Jesse to find Tommy on his own.


	Later, the pair is reunited, and Ellie — distraught from the violence she inflicted on Abby's friends at the aquarium — changes her tune. She tells Jesse that he's a good person (in a less mocking way) and the two make amends just before Jesse suffers a fatal bullet wound to the face from Abby. In the game, Ellie never questions Jesse's commitment to his friends or family, knowing full well that her choices have endangered everyone else. Instead, she dryly mocks him, calling him a sap in a more playfully somber way. She also never comes to care about the Scars or see them in a more sympathetic light.


	After parting ways with Jesse, Ellie commandeers a skiff boat and rides into the storm toward the aquarium to find Abby. Along the way, she's capsized by a wave and washes up on the shore of the island where the Wolves are about to commence their attack on the Scars' village. She's discovered by a young Scar child and captured by the cultists, who attempt to disembowel Ellie before they're interrupted by gunfire in the distance. Given grace, Ellie escapes and hops back in the boat toward her destination.


	This sequence is an oddly timed detour in the episode, but it's not entirely new. In the game, it's Abby who's captured by the Scars early in her section of the story. The scene plays out much differently and incorporates numerous characters that have yet to be introduced in the series. Ellie has no involvement during this portion of the game.

	











	After arriving at the aquarium, Ellie finds Abby's friends Mel and Owen. At gunpoint, she demands that they both individually show her where Abby is on a map (“They better match up,” echoing Joel's method of information gathering from Season One). After Owen agrees to help, he suddenly reaches for a gun, causing Ellie to fire a single round that penetrates Owen's throat, killing him instantly, and ruptures an artery in Mel's neck, causing her to bleed out. Frantic, Mel opens her jacket to reveal that she's pregnant and begs Ellie to find a knife to give her an emergency c-section to save her baby. Hysterical and terrified, Ellie can only watch as Mel dies, choosing to do nothing and condemning the child to death too.


	In the game, the horrific sequence plays out slightly differently and, despite being more graphic, manages to feel moderately less traumatizing for Ellie. While trying to negotiate with Ellie, Owen attempts to grab the gun, only to be shot in the chest. Mel then springs into action, attempting to kill Ellie with a knife, before having the blade turned back on her as she's stabbed in the neck. With a faint whisper, Mel dies as Ellie unzips her coat to reveal her pregnancy. In both cases, Jesse and Tommy find Ellie in shambles.

	After Jesse's death, the season finale culminates in a scene lifted directly from the game: As Abby trains her gun on Tommy, she demands he pay for killing her friends. Ellie pleads with her to spare him and explains that she was the one responsible for their deaths, and was the reason Joel killed Abby's father to save Ellie in Salt Lake City. Enraged, Abby raises her gun to Ellie and pulls the trigger as the screen cuts to black. Afterward, the scene shifts to Abby waking up on a couch to news that Isaac wants to talk. Emerging from a massive corridor, the camera pans out to reveal that the Wolves headquarters are inside a football stadium. Text appears that reads “Seattle,” then “Day One,” revealing that the story will rewind back 72 hours to follow Abby's perspective parallel to the events of Season Two.


	While this is fully in line with the game, which ends the corresponding chapter of Ellie's story with the gun-shot cliffhanger, the Seattle reveal is positioned less as a major surprise than it is here. In The Last of Us Part II, players control Ellie for the game's first act, consisting of three days in Seattle before a flashback brings Abby's perspective into focus. From there, the same three days are played as Abby — a structure that the show looks to be taking on for Season Three. One key similarity for eagle eyed viewers, however, is that in the scene prior to the first cliffhanger, Abby's neck is bruised, meaning that the sequence of Ellie being hung by the Scars could still play out close to the game with Abby suffering a similar fate.

A strange metallic sphere discovered in Colombia has sparked speculation about unidentified flying objects (UFOs), with scientists offering conflicting views on its origin.

The object was reportedly spotted flying over the town of Buga on March 2 before landing, according to social media page @Truthpolex.

Researchers studying the sphere say it appears to have no visible welds or joints-features that typically indicate human manufacturing. This has led some to believe the object could be of extraterrestrial origin, Fox News reported. 

Jose Luis Velazquez, one of the researchers involved, said the sphere has a unique three-layered structure and its design is unlike anything he has encountered before.

However, not everyone is convinced. Julia Mossbridge, a physicist and founder of The Institute for Love and Time (TILT), told Fox News Digital that she doubts the object is alien in origin. ""It looks to me like a really cool art project,"" she said, cautioning against jumping to conclusions.

She added that the discovery-regardless of its origin-should serve as a reminder of how little we truly understand about the world around us. ""We're learning that we don't fully understand what's in our skies or our waters,"" Mossbridge said.

She also pointed to the increasing global interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), noting that various scientific groups such as the Galileo Project and the UAP Disclosure Fund are investigating such sightings independently of government agencies.

Mossbridge stressed the need for rigorous scientific testing before labeling any unidentified object a UFO. ""Bring the object to a group like the Galileo Project. Let experts determine if the material is clearly not man-made,"" she said. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}","other"

A man who recorded the 'best ever UFO footage' has explained why he doesn't think what he saw was fake.

There are plenty of people who are convinced they've seen a UFO hurtling through the sky, and some even manage to get video evidence of their sightings.

Some of the claims people make aren't hard to debunk, others take a lot more explaining.

Advert

One of the clearest pieces of footage of a sighting was taken by someone who was up in that very sky themselves and became convinced they'd had a close encounter of the third kind.

The footage was dubbed 'one of the greatest UAP (UFO) evidences of all time' by ufologist Jaime Maussan, who has been caught with fake aliens in the past.

However, truth is in the eye of the beholder so you might as well give it a look and learn why the person who filmed it thinks it's genuine.

The video was taken by pilot Jorge A. Arteaga, who was flying in the skies above Antioquia, Colombia, when he spotted something peculiar moving through the sky.

Advert

Within just a few seconds, a strange square-like object can be seen flying past Arteaga's plane and goes whizzing off in another direction.

The bloke claimed that he and his co-pilot had seen the object hovering in the air between the cities of Medellín and Santa Fe before it suddenly gained speed and moved towards them.

Arteaga claimed that the pair had wanted to keep following this strange sight before it suddenly started heading right for them.

However, Arteaga was able to get some footage on his phone which he's claimed as proof that he had a bona fide daylight encounter with a UFO.

Check it out:

This is the big question that anyone is going to ask when someone says they've caught a UFO on camera.

There are all sorts of objects in the sky which might just be a balloon or a scrap of something else floating about in the wind.

Advert

However, the pilot said that since his plane was at 12,500 feet there's no chance it could just have been a balloon.

Arteaga claimed it would be too cold and turbulent at that height for something like a balloon to survive in the skies, so he reckons it must have been a UFO.

On top of that, the pilot claimed the thing he saw was 'something totally unknown without means of propulsion' and he thought it moved in an 'intelligent' manner.

You may believe what you like, but the man who saw and filmed it is pretty convinced he laid eyes on a UFO that day.

A UFO researcher has an ominous message for humanity as governments around the world begin releasing more information about alleged contact with extraterrestrials.

Dr Julia Mossbridge is a cognitive neuroscientist and a researcher of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) - the new term for UFOs and alien sightings.

After scientists in Colombia recovered a mysterious, sphere-shaped object that many now believe is a piece of UFO technology, Mossbridge said the world is moving into an era which may soon have to deal with the knowledge that aliens exist.

'We are entering a time when we are starting to recognize as humans we don't have the control that we thought we had over everything,' Dr Mossbridge told Fox News.

However, Mossbridge, who studies how humans think and also attended the May 1 congressional hearing on UAPs, said the impending disclosure of alien life could throw the worldview of many people into chaos.

'One of the mistakes we make is [saying], because I think I understand this, everything I think today is true,' the neuroscientist explained.

'It ends up making us very confused when something shows up that doesn't fit our model of the world,' she added. 

While the sphere in Colombia is convincing many that the public is finally looking at alien technology, Mossbridge actually remains skeptical that this discovery is a genuine UFO.

A sphere discovered in Colombia displays symbols that researchers compared to ancient scripts, including runes, Ogham, and Mesopotamian writing systems. They also used AI to help decipher a possible message

The so-called ' UFO ' was spotted in March over the town of Buga, zig-zagging through the sky in a way that defies the movement of conventional aircraft

Dr Julia Mossbridge said that humans are quickly realizing they no longer have control over the universe around them as more information about UFOs emerges

'The sphere itself seems kind of like an art project,' the UFO researcher said, adding that she believes it was created by humans, not aliens.

Mossbridge noted that no direct connection has been made between a video of what's being called the Buga sphere and the actual metal object found in Colombia.

'If an artist is doing this, why is that? Well, I think it's partly the same reason. It's because we're learning that we don't understand what's in our skies or our waters. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us,' Mossbridge explained.

The so-called 'UFO' was spotted in March over the town of Buga, zig-zagging through the sky in a way that defies the movement of conventional aircraft.

That same object was allegedly recovered shortly after it landed and has since been analyzed by scientists, who discovered it features three layers of metal-like material and 18 microspheres surrounding a central nucleus they are calling 'a chip.'

Dr Jose Luis Velazquez, a radiologist who examined the sphere, reported finding 'no welds or joints,' which would typically provide a clue that humans made it.

'It is of artificial origin, in that it shows no evidence of welding, and its internal structure is composed of high-density elements. More testing is needed to establish its origin,' Velazquez and his team contended.

The sphere also displays symbols that the team compared to ancient scripts, including runes, Ogham and Mesopotamian writing systems.

Using AI to assist in deciphering the design, the team interpreted the message to read: 'The origin of birth through union and energy in the cycle of transformation, meeting point of unity, expansion, and consciousness — individual consciousness.'

'We interpret it as a message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth—especially considering the current issues with pollution and environmental decline,' the researchers said.

The object was recovered shortly after it landed and has since been analyzed by scientists, who discovered it features three layers of metal-like material and 18 microspheres surrounding a central nucleus they are calling 'a chip'

David Velez el Potro, one of the individuals who recovered the object, recently spoke on Maussan Television hosted by journalist and ufologist Jaime Maussan, whose research has stirred controversy for nearly a decade.

Maussan gained attention in 2017 when he claimed to have discovered alien mummies in Peru—findings that remain unconfirmed.

Velez el Potro has claimed that the sphere is authentic, found in the woods of Buga.

He told Maussan that the man who found it, Jose, felt sick for days after touching the object.

'When I poured water on it, it started to smoke and the water vaporized instantly,' Velez el Potro added, suggesting the interior was hot and exterior cold.

There have been no official reports or scientific analysis to confirm claims of a sphere falling over Buga. Only eyewitness reports.

Velez el Potro said the government contacted him to hand it over the sphere, but he refused, saying, 'It would never be seen again.'

Mossbridge noted that Velez el Potro's alleged discovery is the latest incident where people outside of the government are trying to find out what's going on with UAPs before someone comes in and shuts down the investigation.

Non-governmental, non-partisan research groups like the Galileo Project and the Scientific Coalition for UAP studies have all been working to prove the existence of alien life in recent years. 

'They are all trying to get rigorous information themselves, not necessarily waiting on the federal government, about what's going on in our skies, what's going on in our waters,' she said.

The object was recovered by a couple on March 2, who said it weighed about four and a half pounds and had 'the temperature of a refrigerator' when touched

A team of scientists have recently analyzed the sphere using X-rays and conducted other tests to identify its origins

Velez el Potro gave it to Maussan and his team of experts with hopes of them uncovering the sphere's origin.

Researchers found that the sphere had irregular edges, 'indicating that it is a solid object.'

The findings suggest that the outer layer could be made of titanium or steel, but researchers noted that a full composition analysis is needed to confirm this.

X-rays did not reveal any visible signs of how the mysterious object was assembled.

Paris Hilton just admitted her son, Phoenix, has left her “spooked.”

The American socialite, who is a mother to two children, two-year-old Phoenix and one-year-old daughter, London, with husband, Carter Reum, shared a video where her son was pointing out a “ghost.”

Addressing other moms who follow her on social media, Paris captioned the clip, ""Well, I'm spooked... To all my #SlivingMoms, has this happened with your little ones? Would love to know … for research purposes.""

The video, where the little one can be heard telling his mother, ""There's a ghost in there... There's a ghost in there and there,” is captioned, ""Phoenix saw a ghost in our house.”

Behind the camera, Paris asked her son, ""Where's the ghost?"" and Phoenix replied, ""Ghost this..."" as her pointed to the door and exclaimed, ""Ghost!""

""So cute, yet so scary I can't,” the hotel heiress said.

Paris then asked Phoenix, ""What's in Mama's room?"" to which he responded, ""Ghost indoor... Ghost in… store. Ghost in this door!""

The video ended with the words: ""Okay, need to move now.""

Paris has previously also revealed her own experience with paranormal activity in an interview with British Vogue, alongside her friend, Nicole Richie. 

Nicole asked her, ""Never have I ever had a paranormal experience"" and Paris recalled a spooky encounter at her grandmother's place.

""My grandma's old house. We're just like in the playroom, and a crown, like, started floating across the room… Because, supposedly, a girl who had lived there before, something happened in like the driveway, like a hundred years ago. And people would see her in the mirror, brushing her hair…” the This Is Paris star revealed. 

Nicole replied, ""Sick! Oh my God!"" to which Paris concluded by saying, ""So scary.""

Horror and Paranormal enthusiasts are well aware about the demonically possessed doll, Annabelle, a raggedy doll which was linked to some of the most bizarre and inhumane cases from the 1970s. The doll was captured and locked by the paranormal investigators, Edward Warren Miney and Lorraine Rita Warren, with a warning that the doll should never be unlocked.

While some believe that the stories surrounding the doll are just horror stories meant for Halloween nights and slumber parties, the history of the doll and everyone linked to it, has often made people cautious about it. However, after being locked in for over five decades, the news recently went rife that Annabelle is no longer in her box, which has left the internet in a buzz.

The origin of the Ann Doll

According to the New England Society For Psychic Research, the Ann Doll was purchased by a mother in 1970 from a hobby store. The doll was a birthday present for her daughter, Donna, who was preparing to graduate from college with a nursing degree. While the raggedy doll was an odd choice as a gift for a 28-year-old, what followed was further disturbing for Donna, her roommate, Angie, and their common friend, Lou. Angie was also a nurse and lived with Donna in a tiny apartment. When Donna brought the Ann doll home, she didn't give it much thought and placed her on her bed, but soon after, something extremely strange started happening.

At first, it was small movements, like a change in how the doll was placed. However, over time these changes became more noticeable. The doll would be in a completely different room. Angie and Donna would, at times, find the doll with its legs crossed and arms folded, and other times, it would be found upright, standing on its feet. Things changed when, several times, Donna left Ann Doll on her couch, only to find her back in bed with the bedroom door closed. These increased instances alerted the two young women, and what followed was beyond anything explainable.

As if the movements made by the Ann Doll didn't frighten the girls enough, Donna and Angie started finding messages on parchment paper that read, ""Help Us"" and ""Help Lou"".

However, it was not the messages that creeped them out; it was the way they were written. What further worried the girls was the fact that Donna and Angie never kept parchment paper at their place which raised concerns as to where the notes were coming from.

Meet Annabelle Higgins, the girl who allegedly possessed the doll

Donna and Angie were terrified of what the Ann Doll had been up to. The change in positions, rooms and notes could mess with anyone's psyche. So, one night, when they found the doll moved back to the bed, despite it being a regular occurrence, they felt as if something had changed. Upon inspecting the doll, they found a blood-like red substance on Ann's hands and chest. Scared and desperate for help, the girls decided to seek expert advice.      

ADVT.

Their search led them to a medium that organised a seance to contact the spirit. This led Donna and Angie to be introduced to Annabelle Higgins, the spirit of a young girl who had resided on the property before the apartments were built. Annabelle recalled her life as a happy young girl whose lifeless body was found in the field upon which the complex was now built. Hearing the young child's plea for attention and considering her past, Donna and Angie gave her permission to inhibit the doll and stay with them. However, they soon found out that Annabelle, despite how sweet she seemed, had the most malicious intentions.       

The incident with Angie and Donna's friend Lou

Lou was Donna and Angie's close friend. However, he had never been fond of the Ann Doll and warned the young ladies to get rid of the evil doll. Against his pleas, the girls kept the Ann Doll, which later turned out to be one of the most horrid decisions they ever made. One night, Lou woke up in a state of panic, only to find out he was stuck in his own body and the Ann Doll at his foot. The haunted doll soon moved and strangled him, leaving him paralysed and gasping for air. Nonetheless, he woke up the next morning unharmed.

The night's instance has made Lou determined to get rid of the doll. However, as he planned a way to get rid of the doll, he heard someone in Donna's room. However, as he got up to check, he found the room empty, with only Annabelle on the floor in a corner. As he reached for the doll, he found himself unable to breathe, cut and bleeding. Seven distinct claw marks were found on his chest, all hot-like burns, yet again, they healed almost immediately.       

The Warrens' investigation

Donna had finally realised that the spirit of that young girl was inhuman and demonic. She contacted the Episcopal priest, Father Hegan, who contacted Father Cooke, who reached out to Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo soon contacted Donna, Lou and Angie and reached the conclusion that the doll was not possessed but was being used as a medium to possess one of the three occupants. The Warrens had Father Cooke perform an exorcism before taking the doll with them.      


However, their journey back home was one filled with vicious hatred and danger, with the car swerving at every turn. The brakes and steering of their vehicle failed, but before they could meet a deadly end, Ed took out some holy water and doused the doll. The doll's activities continued for weeks before a special case was built for the doll, which has since remained locked.

The accident and Warrens' warning 

To this day, Annabelle resides inside the case at the Occult Museum. However, the doll is alleged to be responsible for the death of a young man who came to the Museum with his girlfriend on a motorcycle to see the doll. The man mocked the Ann Doll and laughed, stating that if the doll could scratch, then he wanted to be scratched. While Ed Warren asked him to leave, it was already too late, the man died in an accident while returning from the museum. His girlfriend, who was hospitalised for over a year, later revealed that they were laughing about the Ann Doll when the motorcycle suddenly lost control. Since then, Ed, till the time he was alive, explicitly warned the visitors not to challenge evil.      

Is Annabelle missing from the Occult Museum?

advertisement




It was reported in 2025 that the Ann Doll had gone missing earlier in May 2025 during the Devils on the Run tour. Soon after, a fire at the adjacent Nottoway Plantation, which is now the Nottoway Resort in White Castle, heightened rumours that Annabelle's purported abduction was somehow related to the fire. However, on May 24, 2025, a TikTok by NESPR lead called the news fake and revealed the doll was safely locked away in the museum.       


One can only hope that the doll remains locked in the Occult Museum. What are your thoughts on Annabelle's back story? Let us know.

However, they soon found out that Annabelle, despite how sweet she seemed, had the most malicious intentions.       

The incident with Angie and Donna's friend Lou

Lou was Donna and Angie's close friend. However, he had never been fond of the Ann Doll and warned the young ladies to get rid of the evil doll. Against his pleas, the girls kept the Ann Doll, which later turned out to be one of the most horrid decisions they ever made. One night, Lou woke up in a state of panic, only to find out he was stuck in his own body and the Ann Doll at his foot. The haunted doll soon moved and strangled him, leaving him paralysed and gasping for air. Nonetheless, he woke up the next morning unharmed.

The night's instance has made Lou determined to get rid of the doll. However, as he planned a way to get rid of the doll, he heard someone in Donna's room. However, as he got up to check, he found the room empty, with only Annabelle on the floor in a corner. As he reached for the doll, he found himself unable to breathe, cut and bleeding. Seven distinct claw marks were found on his chest, all hot-like burns, yet again, they healed almost immediately.       

The Warrens' investigation

Donna had finally realised that the spirit of that young girl was inhuman and demonic. She contacted the Episcopal priest, Father Hegan, who contacted Father Cooke, who reached out to Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo soon contacted Donna, Lou and Angie and reached the conclusion that the doll was not possessed but was being used as a medium to possess one of the three occupants. The Warrens had Father Cooke perform an exorcism before taking the doll with them.      


However, their journey back home was one filled with vicious hatred and danger, with the car swerving at every turn. The brakes and steering of their vehicle failed, but before they could meet a deadly end, Ed took out some holy water and doused the doll. The doll's activities continued for weeks before a special case was built for the doll, which has since remained locked.

The accident and Warrens' warning 

To this day, Annabelle resides inside the case at the Occult Museum. However, the doll is alleged to be responsible for the death of a young man who came to the Museum with his girlfriend on a motorcycle to see the doll. The man mocked the Ann Doll and laughed, stating that if the doll could scratch, then he wanted to be scratched. While Ed Warren asked him to leave, it was already too late, the man died in an accident while returning from the museum. His girlfriend, who was hospitalised for over a year, later revealed that they were laughing about the Ann Doll when the motorcycle suddenly lost control. Since then, Ed, till the time he was alive, explicitly warned the visitors not to challenge evil.      

Is Annabelle missing from the Occult Museum?

It was reported in 2025 that the Ann Doll had gone missing earlier in May 2025 during the Devils on the Run tour. Soon after, a fire at the adjacent Nottoway Plantation, which is now the Nottoway Resort in White Castle, heightened rumours that Annabelle's purported abduction was somehow related to the fire. However, on May 24, 2025, a TikTok by NESPR lead called the news fake and revealed the doll was safely locked away in the museum.       


One can only hope that the doll remains locked in the Occult Museum. What are your thoughts on Annabelle's back story? Let us know.

According to the New England Society For Psychic Research, the Ann Doll was purchased by a mother in 1970 from a hobby store. The doll was a birthday present for her daughter, Donna, who was preparing to graduate from college with a nursing degree. While the raggedy doll was an odd choice as a gift for a 28-year-old, what followed was further disturbing for Donna, her roommate, Angie, and their common friend, Lou. Angie was also a nurse and lived with Donna in a tiny apartment. When Donna brought the Ann doll home, she didn't give it much thought and placed her on her bed, but soon after, something extremely strange started happening.      


advertisement




At first, it was small movements, like a change in how the doll was placed. However, over time these changes became more noticeable. The doll would be in a completely different room. Angie and Donna would, at times, find the doll with its legs crossed and arms folded, and other times, it would be found upright, standing on its feet. Things changed when, several times, Donna left Ann Doll on her couch, only to find her back in bed with the bedroom door closed. These increased instances alerted the two young women, and what followed was beyond anything explainable.      

The Ann Doll and the cryptic messages
ADVT.











As if the movements made by the Ann Doll didn't frighten the girls enough, Donna and Angie started finding messages on parchment paper that read, ""Help Us"" and ""Help Lou"". A month after the experience began, the notes left the two nurses unsettled. The notes feature the handwriting of a small child. However, it was not the messages that creeped them out; it was the way they were written. What further worried the girls was the fact that Donna and Angie never kept parchment paper at their place which raised concerns as to where the notes were coming from.

Meet Annabelle Higgins, the girl who allegedly possessed the doll

Donna and Angie were terrified of what the Ann Doll had been up to. The change in positions, rooms and notes could mess with anyone's psyche. So, one night, when they found the doll moved back to the bed, despite it being a regular occurrence, they felt as if something had changed. Upon inspecting the doll, they found a blood-like red substance on Ann's hands and chest. Scared and desperate for help, the girls decided to seek expert advice.

However, on May 24, 2025, a TikTok by NESPR lead called the news fake and revealed the doll was safely locked away in the museum.

As if the movements made by the Ann Doll didn't frighten the girls enough, Donna and Angie started finding messages on parchment paper that read, ""Help Us"" and ""Help Lou"". A month after the experience began, the notes left the two nurses unsettled. The notes feature the handwriting of a small child. However, it was not the messages that creeped them out; it was the way they were written. What further worried the girls was the fact that Donna and Angie never kept parchment paper at their place which raised concerns as to where the notes were coming from.

Meet Annabelle Higgins, the girl who allegedly possessed the doll

Donna and Angie were terrified of what the Ann Doll had been up to. The change in positions, rooms and notes could mess with anyone's psyche. So, one night, when they found the doll moved back to the bed, despite it being a regular occurrence, they felt as if something had changed. Upon inspecting the doll, they found a blood-like red substance on Ann's hands and chest. Scared and desperate for help, the girls decided to seek expert advice.

Their search led them to a medium that organised a seance to contact the spirit. This led Donna and Angie to be introduced to Annabelle Higgins, the spirit of a young girl who had resided on the property before the apartments were built. Annabelle recalled her life as a happy young girl whose lifeless body was found in the field upon which the complex was now built. Hearing the young child's plea for attention and considering her past, Donna and Angie gave her permission to inhibit the doll and stay with them. However, they soon found out that Annabelle, despite how sweet she seemed, had the most malicious intentions.       

The incident with Angie and Donna's friend Lou

Lou was Donna and Angie's close friend. However, he had never been fond of the Ann Doll and warned the young ladies to get rid of the evil doll. Against his pleas, the girls kept the Ann Doll, which later turned out to be one of the most horrid decisions they ever made. One night, Lou woke up in a state of panic, only to find out he was stuck in his own body and the Ann Doll at his foot. The haunted doll soon moved and strangled him, leaving him paralysed and gasping for air. Nonetheless, he woke up the next morning unharmed.

The night's instance has made Lou determined to get rid of the doll. However, as he planned a way to get rid of the doll, he heard someone in Donna's room. However, as he got up to check, he found the room empty, with only Annabelle on the floor in a corner. As he reached for the doll, he found himself unable to breathe, cut and bleeding. Seven distinct claw marks were found on his chest, all hot-like burns, yet again, they healed almost immediately.       

The Warrens' investigation

Donna had finally realised that the spirit of that young girl was inhuman and demonic. She contacted the Episcopal priest, Father Hegan, who contacted Father Cooke, who reached out to Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo soon contacted Donna, Lou and Angie and reached the conclusion that the doll was not possessed but was being used as a medium to possess one of the three occupants. The Warrens had Father Cooke perform an exorcism before taking the doll with them.      


However, their journey back home was one filled with vicious hatred and danger, with the car swerving at every turn. The brakes and steering of their vehicle failed, but before they could meet a deadly end, Ed took out some holy water and doused the doll. The doll's activities continued for weeks before a special case was built for the doll, which has since remained locked.

The accident and Warrens' warning 

To this day, Annabelle resides inside the case at the Occult Museum. However, the doll is alleged to be responsible for the death of a young man who came to the Museum with his girlfriend on a motorcycle to see the doll. The man mocked the Ann Doll and laughed, stating that if the doll could scratch, then he wanted to be scratched. While Ed Warren asked him to leave, it was already too late, the man died in an accident while returning from the museum. His girlfriend, who was hospitalised for over a year, later revealed that they were laughing about the Ann Doll when the motorcycle suddenly lost control. Since then, Ed, till the time he was alive, explicitly warned the visitors not to challenge evil.

However, the doll is alleged to be responsible for the death of a young man who came to the Museum with his girlfriend on a motorcycle to see the doll. The man mocked the Ann Doll and laughed, stating that if the doll could scratch, then he wanted to be scratched. While Ed Warren asked him to leave, it was already too late, the man died in an accident while returning from the museum. His girlfriend, who was hospitalised for over a year, later revealed that they were laughing about the Ann Doll when the motorcycle suddenly lost control. Since then, Ed, till the time he was alive, explicitly warned the visitors not to challenge evil.

It was reported in 2025 that the Ann Doll had gone missing earlier in May 2025 during the Devils on the Run tour. Soon after, a fire at the adjacent Nottoway Plantation, which is now the Nottoway Resort in White Castle, heightened rumours that Annabelle's purported abduction was somehow related to the fire. However, on May 24, 2025, a TikTok by NESPR lead called the news fake and revealed the doll was safely locked away in the museum.

Lou was Donna and Angie's close friend. However, he had never been fond of the Ann Doll and warned the young ladies to get rid of the evil doll. Against his pleas, the girls kept the Ann Doll, which later turned out to be one of the most horrid decisions they ever made. One night, Lou woke up in a state of panic, only to find out he was stuck in his own body and the Ann Doll at his foot. The haunted doll soon moved and strangled him, leaving him paralysed and gasping for air. Nonetheless, he woke up the next morning unharmed.

The night's instance has made Lou determined to get rid of the doll. However, as he planned a way to get rid of the doll, he heard someone in Donna's room. However, as he got up to check, he found the room empty, with only Annabelle on the floor in a corner. As he reached for the doll, he found himself unable to breathe, cut and bleeding. Seven distinct claw marks were found on his chest, all hot-like burns, yet again, they healed almost immediately.

Donna had finally realised that the spirit of that young girl was inhuman and demonic. She contacted the Episcopal priest, Father Hegan, who contacted Father Cooke, who reached out to Ed and Lorraine Warren. The duo soon contacted Donna, Lou and Angie and reached the conclusion that the doll was not possessed but was being used as a medium to possess one of the three occupants. The Warrens had Father Cooke perform an exorcism before taking the doll with them.      


However, their journey back home was one filled with vicious hatred and danger, with the car swerving at every turn. The brakes and steering of their vehicle failed, but before they could meet a deadly end, Ed took out some holy water and doused the doll. The doll's activities continued for weeks before a special case was built for the doll, which has since remained locked.

BraveWords Records is pleased to announce that Aska have released a video for the track “From Out Of The Sky”, taken from their latest album, Knight Strike. Watch the clip below:

“From Out Of The Sky” is a followup song Aska wrote on one of their favorite topics, Extraterrestrial Alien Invasion.

George Call, from Aska, “We love Science Fiction as much as we love writing about medieval fantasy and such. On our previous album, Fire Eater, we had a brief soundscape called ‘The Last Message'. It was a final message left on a beacon in space from a now extinct civilization where our world had once been. This message had been playing in space for practically an eternity before our listeners stumble upon it and hear the tale of humanity's demise. ‘FOotS' kind of picks up, extrapolates and delves deeper. I think we see it as a kind of sequel of sorts. Questions are asked; Are they friend or foe? Will you run or will you stand and fight?

“As ‘TLM' was put together by Aska bassist, Keith Knight, and he was the principal songwriter on ‘FOotS', we felt it appropriate that he should take the lead vocals on this one. I thought it would be a great surprise for our fans as it's the first time Keith has sang lead vocal on an Aska song since our third album, Nine Tongues.”



Catch Aska live with BraveWords Records labelmates, Lillian Axe, on August 17 at Reno's in (Deep Ellum) Dallas.

Reviews of Knight Strike:

The new album is just straight ahead classic heavy, heavy metal and features George Call who also sang in Cloven Hoof, Omen, and a few other bands. – The Metal Command Show

Knight Strike… exceeds expectations, offering a tour de force of U.S. heavy/power metal replete with vigor, melody, and fervor. – Metal Zone

In essence, with Knight Strike, Aska not only meets but exceeds expectations, offering a tour de force of US heavy/power metal replete with vigour, melody, and fervour. George Call's vocals, a sublime fusion of Coverdale's grit, Defeis's range, and Lizzy Borden's theatricality, further elevate the sonic tapestry, infusing it with depth and resonance. This album is a masterful amalgamation of diverse sounds and emotions, inviting listeners on a captivating sonic journey. – Metal Zone

94 out of 100, so what does this mean, well if you are an Aska fan you will get it, if you love metal an essential purchase, if you have never heard of Aska this is a good one to get you will not be disappointed! – Lance Souther Metalholics, Rock, Punk & Comedy for Eternity

About Aska:

Aska, Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas-based, long-running heavy metal band has, as the title they gave their 3rd international tour can attest, “been there, done that”. And how! In 1992, just a short year after the release of the group's self-titled debut album, they began touring the world performing at military bases, embassies and satellite installations around the globe for the U.S. Dept. of Defense/USO entertainment services. For nine years the group maintained a steady course, playing for U.S & foreign military troops in well over 56 countries and territories globally before turning their focus to the civilian world. There, they promptly played festivals around America and Europe and furthered their exposure in no small way. From inception to present, Aska released seven full length albums on both national and international labels.

During the process, Aska's triple-threat frontman/vocalist/guitarist, George Call, came to the attention of cult, US underground metal pioneers, Omen, where he was promptly recruited to take over the lead vocalist slot for three years while still maintaining his role in Aska. When that association dissolved, George was immediately snatched up by former Atlantic Records/Metal Blade, Midwestern, MTV veterans, Banshee, where he's been front and center on the band's two newest top notch releases. While helming both bands after a fateful meeting at a festival performance with Aska in Germany, Call, was further enlisted to join UK legendary, cult NWOBHM band, Cloven Hoof, where he proceeded to record and release three critically acclaimed, fan-favorite albums. Aska drummer Danny White joined George on two of these endeavours while the band's long-serving bassist/vocalist, Keith Knight, engineered and recorded a high percentage of George's extra-curricular activity at his Knight Recording Studios, keeping the three working together even when it was outside of the band.

To find the truth of one's art in one's own life is to become a purer idyll of an artist. Taking the lessons you've learned in life, the experiences you've endured and the many highs and lows you've witnessed and applying them to your work is what great art is all about. Before The Fabelmans became Steven Spielberg's most personal movie, strangely, it was the cosmic tale E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial that was most inspired by the childhood of the esteemed filmmaker. 

Telling the story of a lonely young boy who strikes up an unlikely friendship with a curious brown bulbous alien, Spielberg's 1982 movie is often considered to be his very best. It showcases his storytelling proficiency and remarkable scope for cinematic spectacle. 

Arriving on earth in a vast spacecraft, the titular alien is abandoned by his impatient family, who flee back into space after being pursued by federal agents, leaving ‘E.T' to fend for himself. Eventually, he comes into contact with a young boy, Elliot (Henry Thomas), and his family, with the two forming a close bond as they evade the authorities and engage in an unlikely coming-of-age tale. 

The alien is not a mere rubber suit, however. E.T. has special abilities, levitating objects around the family home and creating psychic links between himself, Elliot, Gertie, and Michael. Spielberg kept part of this special connection on set, ensuring that the kids never saw E.T. when he wasn't animated, never losing the magic of the alien from outer space. 

Keeping the alien as a supernatural figure was incredibly important for the balance of the movie. Still, despite his supernatural abilities, Elliot's supernatural friend turned out to have a cheeky sweet tooth like the rest of us, famously becoming fond of the delicate peanut butter candies, Reese's Pieces.  

So, how exactly did one of the world's tastiest chocolate snacks become a key part of Spielberg's classic movie? Turns out, the whole thing was a massive missed opportunity for Mars Incorporated. 

Appearing in one key scene, when Elliott lures the alien with a trail of the mini candies, Spielberg originally intended for this iconic moment to involve M&Ms. The only reason they never ended up in the movie was that Mars Incorporated, who own M&Ms, refused to give the filmmaker permission to use the multi-coloured chocolates. As a result, Spielberg chose Reese's Pieces as a replacement. 

Hershey Foods, who own Reese's Pieces, struck a deal to promote the movie, dedicating $1million to advertising, all whilst Universal allowed them to feature the titular alien in their visual media. Earning close to $800million at the box office from a budget of just $10.5m, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial became a significant hit and, as a result, sales for Reese's Pieces jumped 85% in the weeks following its release in June 1982. 

Remarkably, the film and candy are still inextricably linked, with the deal between the movie and the food company being one of the most successful examples of product placement in movie history. Its success can only really be matched by 2000s CastAway, which promoted FedEx and Wilson, as well as the James Bond franchise, which has long-held ties with the likes of Aston Martin, Omega and Heineken.

More than an extraterrestrial being and a great friend to Elliot, it turns out that E.T. was also a savvy businessman, helping Hershey's see a tidy profit while he got a generous helping of the sweet, peanut-based snack. 

Without wishing to spoil a four-decade-old movie, the entire picture is dedicated to trying to get the little guy back on his spaceship and on to his home planet. Just like his love for sweet treats, E.T. is just like us in his desire to be with his family. Famously, he wanted to “phone home” but a quick call was never enough. After they communicate with his home planet, a ship is sent back to Earth to pick up their forgotten comrade.

As the finale of the picture kicks into gear, Eliot and his gang are tasked with breaking E.T. out of the house, transporting him under the nose of the authorities and getting him on the spaceship back home. They achieve their goal but not before more than a few tears are shed, with Eliot losing a new friend. As the credits ready themselves to roll, E.T. comforts Eliot and the audience by sharing his famous line, “I'll be right here”, while pointing to the boy's chest. It's a classic Spielberg end to a classic Spielberg movie.

On the CW's Supernatural, the Winchester brothers battled the forces of evil across 15 seasons. Fans experienced the emotional roller coaster that is the hunting life from the backseat of a '67 Chevy Impala. There was no shortage of villains for Sam and Dean to fight, especially during its early years when the series felt more episodic. By the time the series had hit its stride, it leaned towards its serialized overarching stories more, and lost some of the charm it had when delivering great Monster-of-the-Week episodes.

Though there is much to be discovered by diving into the underlying themes of Supernatural, sometimes the Winchester brothers are at their best when doing their job - slaying monsters. From classic creatures such as werewolves and vampires to more obscure legends of regional folklore, Sam and Dean have hunted them all. Here are a few episodes to consider when returning to the road.

 In one of their earliest hunts of the inaugural season of Supernatural, Sam and Dean see their skills tested against a beast born from Native American myth. Shortly after the disappearance of John Winchester and fresh off the death of Sam's girlfriend Jessica, the Winchesters head to Colorado in hopes of finding their father using a mysterious set of coordinates left to them in his hunting journal. Upon Sam and Dean's arrival in Black Water Ridge, they're informed of the cases of several missing hikers in the area. They learn from the local rangers that the brother of Haley Collins, portrayed by Gina Holden, has gone missing.

This spinoff brought fan-favorite characters together in a community-centered story that was unique but also very Supernatural.

Concluding that these disappearances surely coincide with the coordinates left to them by their father, the brothers decide to visit Haley to learn more about her brother. Reluctantly, they agree to let Haley accompany them into the deep woods of Black Water Ridge in hopes of finding Ben and their father. After consulting John Winchester's journal, Sam and Dean decide they are facing a Wendigo, a once-human creature that has now transformed into a monster after consuming human flesh. The earlier episodes of Supernatural are viewed as having a creepy vibe, and the hulking and speedy Wendigo fits in perfectly with that line of thinking.

The legend of Bloody Mary is widely known in the real world among groups of teenagers trying to scare each other at sleepovers, and the world of Supernatural is no different. In this episode, a group of teens convinces a friend to repeat the dreaded phrase ""Bloody Mary"" three times in a mirror, which ends with murderous results. After studying the body of the slain boy at his funeral, the brothers encounter two friends who were present during the ritual of Bloody Mary. Sam and Dean then investigate the scene of the occult crime, and after gathering intel from those present, explore the known deaths of women named Mary.

By the laws of hunting in Supernatural, burning the remains of a ghost or spirit is a common way to defeat a ghoul. After discovering Mary's identity and concluding that her remains have already been torched, Sam and Dean determine the best way to defeat Mary is to summon her spirit in a mirror. As previously mentioned, viewers often attribute the earlier episodes and seasons of Supernatural to possessing a much more horror-centric feeling. The true-to-life urban legend of Bloody Mary adds a significant scare factor to viewers who may have taken part in such slumber party antics in their youth.

Similar to the tale of Bloody Mary, Supernatural continues tapping the powers of urban legends by reviving the story of the Hook Man. Sam and Dean are once again called to action to investigate a string of murders plaguing a college town. The Hook Man's first murder is a direct ode to the legend itself: a girl is left alone while her date exits the car to investigate a noise, to be found murdered and dangling above the car when the girl investigates further.

Supernatural has had many hits and misses in its run. But its most controversial episode had a distinct and unique reason for existing.

Sam and Dean arrive on the scene after picking up a clue in a diner about something weird afoot. After discovering the reports of a killer with a hook for a hand, the Winchester brothers dig through the local archives and find reports of a local preacher who murdered 13 women in 1862, wearing a hook on the stump of his missing hand. While no bones remain of the preacher, they search for the hook itself hoping to rid the town of its nightmare. This is another instance of tapping into the psyche of the masses with a familiar, spine-tingling story.

In Supernatural, one should be careful of what one wishes for. In Islamic lore, Djinn, haunt the depths of derelict ruins, which is exactly where Dean succumbs to the power of a ghastly genie at the start of the episode. Joking with Sam about the Djinn's ability to grant wishes, Dean searches a distant spot he assumes would be an appropriate dwelling for a genie. He is then attacked and placed in a world not quite his own.

Dean is taken through a dream of his restructured past. Waking at his childhood home in Lawrence, Kansas, Dean is confused as he can barely recall the fight with the Djinn. As he makes his way through his house, he is greeted by his mother, Mary Winchester. What ensues is a false imagining of what could have been if Mary had never died and the brothers had never been forced into hunting. Supernatural Season 2, Episode 20 is especially emotional and unnerving as Dean is forced to face this alternate reality and have it ripped from him, losing his family again.

Perhaps a nod by Supernatural to the myth of the Cajun rougarou, or the French loup-garou, the episode details a man's transformation into a creature that craves human flesh. In mythology, the loup-garou is more akin to a werewolf, while the rougarou in Supernatural is related more to the Wendigo. Sam and Dean are called to action to investigate the strange behavior of husband and father, Jack Montgomery.

The most disturbing trait of the rougarou is that the creature is not even aware that they are one until later in life. When Jack submits to the urge to kill and eat his fellow man, the metamorphosis into a monster truly begins. Even though the Winchester brothers express sorrow for Jack and his family, and lament having to kill him in the end, even though they are seasoned hunters.

In the world of Supernatural, Christmas is not necessarily a season for joy and spending time with loved ones. Alerted to rumors of murders where the victim was pulled up through a chimney, Sam and Dean set out to solve the Christmas mystery. Their attention is drawn to an older couple whom the brothers identify as a pair of pagan gods that can only be killed by stakes crafted from evergreen.

Throughout the episode, there are flashbacks to Sam and Dean's childhood Christmases. It is revealed to the viewers that it is Christmas when the younger Sam discovers their father's journal, and the realization hits him that monsters are real. While the brothers battle with the pagan gods in present times, it is the removal of Sam's innocence and child-like happiness associated with Christmas that hits home and makes this episode important in understanding the life of a hunter.

During Oktoberfest, when Sam and Dean find a victim displaying bite marks on the neck, Supernatural law points to a vampire being the culprit. This clue is muddled when the next victim shows signs of a werewolf attack. After some sleuthing and confirming that two witnesses indeed saw a vampire and a werewolf attack the individual victims, respectively, the brothers settle on the monster being a shape-shifter.

The story is shot like a classic Universal monster film, in full black-and-white glory. To continue with the theme of classic creatures, a mummy rises from its tomb within the local museum and attacks a security guard. The Winchester brothers are proven correct in their assertion that this is the work of a shape-shifter with an affinity for horror movies. In Supernatural, shape-shifters are monsters that can disguise themselves as the image of any person or beast. This is a truly standout episode and epitomizes the Monster-of-the-Week format by dipping into several examples of old-school film frights.

 With Sam and Dean investigating recent disappearances in Elwood, Indiana, Supernatural explores the existence of aliens with a clever tie-in to the lore of fairies and leprechauns. While Dean experiences the classic signs of an alien abduction, Sam's research points the hunting pair toward the little people of Irish lore. Initially confused by this revelation, the story unfolds to reveal the true weirdness that lies under the surface in Elwood.

Sam discovers that a local man named Mr. Brennan has summoned a leprechaun, hoping to save his failing business. The brothers learn from a woman named Marion that the fairies are behind the mischief. She tells them the fairies love cream and must count every grain of salt, should any be spilled. One of the most impressive feats in Supernatural is the accuracy of the lore they're representing. While the previous entries may have more of a creepy factor, this episode is extremely fun and wacky.

In Sam and Dean's world, the Shojo is a spirit of revenge in Japanese culture. This Supernatural episode also reintroduces a fan-favorite character, Garth. He calls the Winchester brothers in as backup on a hunting case. Garth informs him he suspects he is dealing with a ghost or vengeful spirit, though the attacks are more similar to those of a monster.

The episode starts with a group of teenagers in the woods. One of the group is startled by a sound, and then he views a ghost-like creature that only he can see. After fleeing into the woods, he is heard screaming and found dead by his friends. After investigating, the trio uncovers the Shojo can only be seen under the influence of alcohol. The Shojo is summoned via a cursed bottle of saké, gifted to the deceased owner of a local brewery. Much like the previous entry, this episode is quite entertaining as Sam, Dean and Garth must maintain a certain level of intoxication to see the Shojo.

Supernatural is perhaps at its best when tackling cases of classic monsters. The attention of Sam and Dean is called to a college town to investigate several suspicious deaths that, on the surface, seem like wild animal attacks. A collection of college roommates are shooting a student film, and while attempting to gather more footage in the woods, they discover a couple having a lovers' quarrel. When spotted, the filmmakers flee, and one of them is attacked off-screen. Viewers witness this through the lens of the camcorder being used.

The attacked student got a check-up from the doctor, and he was cleared to return to the dorm. In the following days, he developed powers like otherworldly strength, and his friends wondered if he was some sort of superhero. This gave them all the idea of filming the process and making a documentary out of their friend's transformation. Unbeknownst to the roommates, their friend was attacked by a werewolf and is slowly changing into one himself. Eventually, they are all infected with the curse. What makes this a standout episode is the unique use of cinematography, having the viewer experience the episode as if it were a found footage documentary.

Supernatural is a beloved and long-running series that, unfortunately, still has more than a few problematic episodes that aren't easy to rewatch.

From pointless character deaths to uninspired writing, some scenes in Supernatural pushed the audience too far.

The Last of Us Season 2 finale gives Ellie and the fans what they want by bringing back a controversial character, but at a fatal cost.

Jesse's unexpected death in The Last of Us Season 2 finale has left everyone shaken, but that's the entire point.

ByConor Murray,

 Forbes Staff. 

French President Emmanuel Macron dismissed a video of his wife appearing to push his face away while departing a plane as “joking around,” after the clip went viral on social media Monday morning and became a hotbed for conspiracy theories.

Macron, who arrived in Vietnam with his wife, Brigette Macron, on Monday, told reporters he was “squabbling and joking around with my wife,” stating he is “surprised” the video became a “disaster of planetary proposition with everyone having their own theory about it.”

In the video, captured by the Associated Press, Macron can be seen standing inside the plane alongside a second person who is initially not visible, whose arms reach out and appear to push Macron by his face, as the president then takes several steps back.

Immediately after the apparent push, Macron turns to face the outside of the plane and breaks into a smile and waves, possibly noticing the reporters and cameras.

Macron acknowledged the video was real while speaking with reporters, though multiple outlets reported his office initially denied the incident had happened.

The video was circulated online by social media accounts, many of whom appear to be European and American right-wing profiles that are typically critical of Macron, who used the incident to question his relationship with his wife or to attack his masculinity.

Emmanuel Macron, 47, has been married to Brigette Macron, 72, since 2007. The two met in 1993 while Emmanuel Macron was a student at Lycée la Providence, the high school where Brigette Macron was his teacher. Their relationship has been the subject of gossip in the French press, and Macron's parents attempted to separate him from Brigette while he was in high school by sending him to another school for his final year. Brigette Macron resigned from her teaching position once her husband became France's economy minister, and she played an active role in her husband's presidential campaign.

While addressing reporters Monday, Macron said the clip was one of several recent videos of him used to fuel misinformation. Last week, a video of Macron with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer depicted Macron picking up a white object, which was a tissue, though false theories spread on social media that the object was a bag of cocaine. Macron's office denounced the theories in a post on X, alleging they were being “spread by France's enemies” and that social media users must “remain vigilant against manipulation.”

In Hanoi, Vietnam, on Monday, Macron met with Vietnamese President Luong Cuong and signed deals worth about $10 billion on defense, transportation, nuclear energy and other contracts as Macron advocated for greater cooperation between France and its former colony at “a time of both great imbalance and a return to power-driven rhetoric.” The visit was the first to Vietnam by a French leader in nearly a decade. While in southeast Asia, Macron will next visit Singapore and Indonesia.

HYAMPOM, Calif. - New DNA technology has revealed a major breakthrough in a decades-old cold case regarding the disappearance of a Trinity County teacher. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office confirmed that a partial skull found near Trinidad Head in 1993 belongs to Kay Medin, who went missing in 1987.

Kay Medin, a teacher at Hyampom School, was reported missing on August 3, 1987, by her husband, Nikolas Medin. He returned from a business trip to find her missing, with her purse and personal belongings still at their home.

Three months later, a package containing skeletal remains and an anonymous letter was received by the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office. The letter led investigators to additional remains near Ammon Ridge Road, later confirmed to be Kay's through dental records.

In 1993, a partial human skull was discovered on a beach near Trinidad Head. Despite entering the DNA into national databases, no match was made at the time.

In 2024, federal funding cleared a backlog of unidentified human remains cases. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office partnered with private lab Othram Inc., which used advanced DNA technology to confirm the skull's identity.

Investigators located Kay's possible daughter, and DNA testing confirmed the match. Nikolas Medin passed away in 2018 and is not considered a suspect. The case remains open as a cold homicide.

If you have information about Kay Medin's disappearance, contact the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office at (707) 441-3024.

Ever wonder why some over-the-counter medications are not as easy to access? Or why are they packaged the way they are? In the early 80s, the Tylenol Murders made significant changes in how these medications are distributed, packaged and sold. Here's why.

In 1982, the Chicago area was gripped by fear as a series of sudden, unexplained deaths unfolded. Seven people died after ingesting Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules that had been laced with potassium cyanide, a lethal poison. 

But who is the culprit?

Join us at Crime+Investigation as we cover the 1982 Tylenol Murders, where an unknown murderer killed at least seven people. Explore how people came to realise something was wrong and how the killer has never been found to this day.

The first known victim was 12-year-old Mary Kellerman of Elk Grove Village, who died on 29th September after taking Tylenol for a cold. 

The young girl, who complained of a sore throat and runny nose, was given one Extra-Strength Tylenol capsule. Little did her parents know, the pill was laced with highly poisonous potassium cyanide. 

Mary died soon after, a death that shocked the nation and would change things forever. 

Later that day, 27-year-old Adam Janus of Arlington Heights also died suddenly and unexpectedly. It was thought that the postal worker had suffered a massive heart attack.

In a heartbreaking twist, his brother Stanley and sister-in-law Theresa also died after consuming Tylenol from the same bottle while mourning Adam's death. 

Additional victims included Mary Reiner, Mary McFarland, and Paula Prince, all of whom had taken Tylenol capsules purchased from various stores in the Chicago area.

At first, medical professionals were baffled by the deaths in the same Chicago area. They were unexplained. How and why did these people die so suddenly? In early October 1982, investigators began piecing together the tragic puzzle with the help of a local nurse.

Helen Jensen from Arlington Heights played a crucial role in identifying the link between the deaths and Tylenol capsules. Her observations led to the discovery that the capsules had been tampered with and laced with cyanide.

The gelatine-based capsules were popular amongst the public as they were small and easy to swallow. It was the bestselling non-prescription pain medicine in the United States at that time. Sadly, the pain within the country could not be relieved.

Despite extensive investigations, the person responsible for the poisonings was never caught. 

However, a man named James William Lewis became a person of interest after he sent a letter to Johnson & Johnson, claiming responsibility for the deaths and demanding $1 million to stop the killings. 

Lewis was convicted of extortion and served 13 years in prison but was never charged with the murders. 

The public reaction was one of shock and fear. People were advised to avoid taking Tylenol, and stores quickly removed the product from their shelves. 

The incident led to widespread panic and a significant loss of trust in over-the-counter medications. It also led to the passage of the 'Tylenol Bill' in 1983, making it a federal offence to tamper with consumer products. 

The Food and Drug Administration also implemented stricter regulations for over-the-counter medications, including requirements for tamper-evident packaging.

For the families of the victims, the pain remains. Kasia Janus, whose father, uncle, and aunt were among the victims, expressed ongoing grief and a desire for justice, even decades later.

'It is something that altered the life of every person in the world,” Janus told news outlets. “And I want people to know that, yeah, this was my family, and it has changed all of us.'

Literally went ""huh, neat a shooting star"" before my brain processed that it was entirely black? Like it was a quick streak of black that was darker than the sky and kinda had a dim redness to it? Has anyone seen anything like this before? Is there such thing as a dark shooting star? Or am I just on one lol

The European Union said it agreed to accelerate negotiations with the US to avoid a transatlantic trade war, signaling a more amicable approach just days after President Donald Trump criticized the bloc for taking advantage of the US and slow-walking talks. 

“There's now a new impetus for the negotiations,” Paula Pinho, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, told reporters on Monday, a day after Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke with Trump by phone. “They agreed both to fast track the trade negotiations and to stay in close contact.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The German military must significantly increase its weapons stockpile by 2029, the year the current government anticipates a potential threat from Russia, according to a directive issued by the country's defense chief, obtained by Reuters.

The order, titled ‘Directive Priorities for the Bolstering of Readiness', was signed on May 19 by Carsten Breuer, the inspector general of the Bundeswehr, the news agency reported on Sunday.

Moscow has denied that it has any aggressive intentions toward NATO countries, dismissing Western speculation of a possible attack as fearmongering aimed at justifying extensive militarization by the bloc's European members.

Breuer's order emphasizes the procurement of advanced air defense systems and long-range precision strike capabilities effective at ranges exceeding 500km. He has also reportedly directed the military to increase the stockpiling of various types of ammunition and to develop new capacities in electronic warfare, as well as space-based systems for both defensive and offensive missions.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced on Monday that his government has lifted restrictions on the range of weapons it can supply to Ukraine to fight Russia. The news is perceived as a hint at the possible delivery of long-range Taurus missiles, which the previous government refused to donate.

In March, the German parliament amended the nation's law to exempt military spending from the ‘debt brake', a measure that limits government borrowing. Merz has proposed allocating up to 5% of the nation's GDP to security-related projects by 2032, a significant increase from the current level of around 2%. He claimed that this expenditure would transform the Bundeswehr into Europe's most formidable military force.

The rearmament plans necessitate a corresponding increase in personnel. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius indicated in a recent interview that the ruling coalition aims to introduce a recruitment model similar to Sweden's, potentially ending the current volunteer-only system as early as next year.

The military initiatives come amid economic challenges, including de-industrialization and stagnation. On Sunday, the newspaper Bild said that ThyssenKrupp, a company with over two centuries of history, is undergoing a significant restructuring amounting to dissolution. According to the report, the company plans to reduce its headquarters staff from 500 to 100, transfer its steel mills to Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, sell its naval shipyard Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) in the public market, and divest most other divisions.

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said on May 26 that the bureau is looking at launching investigations into cases of potential public corruption.

Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and radio host, noted that they “made the decision to either re-open, or push additional resources and investigative attention, to these cases.”

One case that they are looking to target is the FBI investigation into the alleged pipe bombs left near the Democratic and Republican national committee buildings in Washington a day before the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol breach, he said.

“Maybe allegiances have changed or relationships have changed, and it's time to report [on the suspect],” Sundberg told the outlet.

“Tips from the public really have been very helpful but, as I mentioned, we're still trying to identify the suspect. So we're trying to release a little more information such that maybe it will jog somebody's memory.”

Other cases that warrant more resources include one involving the discovery of cocaine in the White House in July 2023 and the leak of the Supreme Court's decision that overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, Bongino said.

“I receive requested briefings on these cases weekly and we are making progress,” he said in his post. “If you have any investigative tips on these matters that may assist us then please contact the FBI.”

Also in his X post, Bongino said he and Patel have conducted one media interview together, which was with Fox News in May.

“We decided early on to limit our media footprint overall in order to keep the attention on the work being done,” he said.

“We have chosen to communicate, in writing, on this platform to fill some of the inevitable information vacuums.

“I try to read as much of your feedback as possible but the workday is busy, and my office is a [sensitive compartmented information facility] with limited phone access. In response to feedback, both positive and negative, from our interview last week we will be releasing more information which will further clarify answers to some of the questions asked in the interview.”

“They have their right to their opinion but as someone who has worked as a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan Detention Center, who's been in segregated housing, you know a suicide when you see one, and that's what that was,” Patel told Fox News.

Bongino said he agreed with Patel's assessment that Epstein's death was by suicide.

“He killed himself. ... I have seen the whole file,” Bongino said during the interview.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

The reported decision by Ukraine's Western backers to lift restrictions on Kiev's use of long-range weapons runs counter to Russia's efforts toward a peaceful settlement of the conflict, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.

Peskov made the remarks in response to comments by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who said Ukraine is no longer subject to range limitations on Western-supplied weaponry. 

“If such decisions have indeed been made, they are entirely at odds with our aspirations for a political resolution and with the efforts currently being made toward a settlement,” Peskov stated. 

“Quite dangerous decisions, again – if they were indeed made,” he stressed.

At the EuropaForum on Monday, Merz said “there are no longer any range restrictions” on Western-supplied weapons used by Ukraine against Russian military targets. “There are no restrictions from the UK, France, Germany, or the US,” he added, as quoted by Euronews.

Moscow has repeatedly warned Western countries against enabling Ukraine to carry out long-range strikes, arguing that this could make the military bloc a direct participant in the conflict given that such attacks would require targeting data from NATO satellites – capabilities that Kiev does not possess.

Moscow updated its nuclear doctrine last November following deliberations by Ukraine's backers on whether to allow Kiev to use Western-supplied long-range missiles to strike targets deep inside Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin expanded the list of conditions that could trigger a nuclear response to include scenarios where aggression by a non-nuclear state or group of states supported by a nuclear state could be viewed as a “joint attack.” 

Since then, Ukrainian forces have launched numerous long-range strikes inside Russia using Western-supplied weapons. Despite the changes, the doctrine still characterizes nuclear weapons as “an extreme and forced measure” and emphasizes Russia's aim to avoid escalation.

Russia has consistently condemned Western arms shipments to Ukraine, arguing that they fuel more bloodshed and hinder efforts toward the peace process. Earlier this month, Russia and Ukraine held their first direct talks since 2022. The sides agreed to present detailed ceasefire proposals, carry out a record 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner swap, and continue negotiations.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Friday that Moscow is at an “advanced stage” of preparing a memorandum outlining the principles and timeline for a peace settlement with Ukraine.

Germany will no longer restrict Ukraine's ability to launch long-range strikes deep inside Russia, including using German-made weapons, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated. Moscow has repeatedly warned Berlin that such a move would make Germany a direct participant in the conflict.

Kiev should be able to “effectively” defend itself against Russia, the chancellor told the EuropaForum event on Monday. The ability to only strike targets on its own territory is insufficient, Merz argued.

“We will do everything in our power to continue supporting Ukraine militarily,” the chancellor said. “There are no longer any range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine, neither from the British nor the French, nor from us, nor from the Americans.”

He did not elaborate on whether long-range Taurus missiles would be provided, which was a contentious topic under the previous government of Olaf Scholz. The former chancellor consistently opposed the idea, arguing that it would lead to a dangerous escalation of the conflict.

Taurus missiles have an operational range of 500km, meaning they could be used to attack targets deep inside Russian territory, potentially even reaching the nation's capital. Russia has repeatedly warned Germany that deliveries to Ukraine would make Berlin a direct participant in the conflict.

On Monday, Merz stated that Berlin is “actively discussing” potential deliveries with London and Paris.

The Kremlin has called the German chancellor's latest statements “dangerous.” Berlin's actions go against the attempts to settle the Ukraine conflict peacefully, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned. “If such decisions have been made, they are contrary to our desire to find a political settlement, to all the efforts to resolve [the conflict],” he said.

The chancellor's statements come as Russia and Ukraine have engaged in direct peace talks for the first time in over three years after Kiev unilaterally withdrew from the negotiations in 2022.

Merz remains skeptical about a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin “obviously sees offers of talks as a sign of weakness,” he claimed on Monday, adding that “we must prepare ourselves for this war to last longer than any of us could wish or imagine.”

Moscow has repeatedly stated it is open for peace talks but would prefer a lasting solution to the conflict to a temporary truce. The Istanbul talks took place after Putin suggested resuming peace process without preconditions.

Tánaiste to announce draft legislation on Tuesday, covering trade in goods such as olives, oranges and dates

The Irish government is to unveil a bill to ban imports from the occupied Palestinian territories in the first move by an EU member to curtail trade in goods produced in Israeli settlements illegal under international law.

Simon Harris, the tánaiste (deputy prime minister), confirmed he would unveil draft legislation on Tuesday.

“Given the scale and gravity of what we're now seeing with the deprivation of aid and the bombardment of Gaza  … this is an appropriate course of action to take,” he told the Financial Times on Monday.

The settlements include residential, agricultural and business interests in the West Bank and East Jerusalem that lie outside Israel's internationally recognised borders.

The law would make it a criminal offence to import goods originating from the occupied territories but would not result in a boycott on Israeli goods. A ban on exports from the occupied territories is seen as symbolic, as trade is limited to physical products such as dates, oranges, olives and some timber and was worth just €685,000 (£575,000) in the four years from 2020 to 2024.

The move comes just days after the EU said it would review its 1995 trade agreement with Israel after a Dutch proposal, similar to a rejected demand put forward by Ireland and Spain in February 2024, was made to the European Commission.

“This is a massive welcome step, it is the first time a trade measure of this kind has been applied to Israel by any EU country. After decades of saying and repeating that illegal settlements are totally illegal and that the EU is opposed to them, this is the first time that words are being matched with action,” said Conor O'Neill, the head of advocacy and policy at Christian Aid Ireland, who helped shape the original draft of the legislation in 2018 with the independent senator Frances Black.

Trade is an EU competency but there are exceptional circumstances in which member states can restrict it. Ireland is basing the legality of its move on a judgment by the international court of justice last year which said countries should “take steps to prevent trade or investment relations that assist in the maintenance of the illegal situation created by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territories”.

The European Commission said it was unable to comment on a proposal it had not yet received, but would offer “factual positions” once such a bill had been enacted by the Irish parliament and transmitted to Brussels.

The bill is expected to go through the committee stage this summer and could become law within the year. “We want to do something impactful … but the European Union acting collectively would have a much more profound impact,” Harris said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Japan makes form change

Japan yesterday began allowing people to write “Taiwan” in the nationality field on household registration forms. The change lets Taiwanese who live in Japan change their registration from “China” to “Taiwan.” To register a household in Japan, one must be a Japanese citizen. Foreign spouses of Japanese citizens and foreign-born people who obtain Japanese citizenship have their nationality recorded in the household registry. The Ministry of the Interior said that about 800 to 1,000 Taiwanese marry Japanese annually. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that through correct descriptions in family registers, the rights and interests of Taiwanese in Japan would be further protected.



WEATHER

Cool weather to continue

Central Weather Administration (CWA) data showed that at 8:30am yesterday, the temperature in Taipei dropped to 17.3°C, the second-lowest on record for late May since 2000. The cooler temperatures were brought by seasonal winds, the CWA said, adding that the wet and cool weather would last until late today. Some coastal areas might experience winds of 39kph, with gusts of 62kph until tonight, it said. By today, the rain is expected to ease in most areas except in Keelung, where occasional showers are likely to persist, the CWA said. National Central University Department of Atmospheric Sciences adjunct associate professor Daniel Wu (吳德榮) said that another weather front is expected to approach Taiwan late tomorrow and would bring more rain. Most parts of the nation would see significant rainfall on Thursday, with some areas experiencing torrential rain, lightning and high winds, Wu said.

CULTURE

Museum to raise prices

The National Museum of Natural Science yesterday said it would raise some of its ticket prices for the first time since it opened in 1986. Starting on July 1, an adult ticket would cost NT$120, up from NT$100, while the price for the museum's Dinosaur Card membership would rise from NT$300 to NT$360, the museum said. Tickets would cost NT$60 for children aged six to 12 and student groups of 20 or more, and for seniors aged 65 and older during holidays, it said. Tickets for students older than 12 and groups of more than 20 would cost NT$90, it added. Museum Director Huang Wen-san (黃文山) said that recent facility upgrades, made a price increase necessary. Discounted ticket prices are to remain unchanged, as would admission fees for the Botanical Garden, the Science Center, the Space Theater, the 3D Theater, the 921 Earthquake Museum, the Chelungpu Fault Preservation Park and the Fonghuanggu Bird and Ecology Park.

Worker dies in construction accident

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) yesterday confirmed that a worker died after an accident at its under-construction packaging plant in Chiayi County. TSMC said it had halted all construction at the plant. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it received a report that a transformer box had fallen and struck a worker after the forklift operator transporting the box failed to notice a drop in the ground. TSMC said onsite personnel administered first aid immediately and an ambulance took the worker to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. The company said it would cooperate with authorities in their investigation into the accident and assist the worker's contractor with the aftermath of his death.

""Palau has never stopped voicing support for Taiwan"" in the UN General Assembly, the WHO and other UN-affiliated agencies, Lai said during a bilateral meeting with visiting Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr.

""We have been profoundly touched by these endorsements,"" Lai said, praising the Pacific island nation's firm support as ""courageous.""

Lai's remarks came as Taiwan was excluded for the ninth consecutive year from the WHA, which is being held in

The first agenda item after the opening was a “two-on-two debate” on a proposal to invite Taiwan to participate at the WHA as an observer.
Similar to previous years, two countries made statements in favor of the proposal, while two others expressed their opposition.
Philippine Secretary of Health Teodoro Herbosa, president of the 78th WHA, accepted the WHA General Committee's

Six people died in Switzerland over the weekend in accidents in the Alps, officials said on Sunday.

Near the luxury resort of Zermatt, rescuers found the bodies of five people, police said in a statement.

A helicopter was sent to survey the area around the Rimpfischhorn mountain after climbers alerted authorities after spotting abandoned skis near the summit on Saturday.

“The bodies of five people were quickly found,” Swiss police said in a statement.

Authorities have opened an investigation into the incident and were working to identify the victims, it said.

The Rimpfischhorn is a 4,199m mountain that lies east of Zermatt, near the Italian border, and is popular with backcountry skiers.

AVALANCHE

Further north, a 29-year-old was killed in an avalanche on the Morgenhorn in the Bern canton, police said.

Two other climbers caught in the avalanche were rescued and hospitalized with light injuries, police said.

Outdoor sports are a popular pastime in mountainous Switzerland and accidents are a regular feature of winter.

During the current winter season, between Oct. 1 last year and May 17, 15 people have been killed in avalanches, according to the Institute for the Study of Snow and Avalanches.

In March last year, six backcountry skiers died — five of them members of the same family — after being caught in a violent storm in the peaks near Zermatt.


BACKLASH:

“Its time to have a break,” Nationals leader David Littleproud told reporters yesterday.
The split shows the pressure on Australia's conservative parties after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's center-left Labor party won a historic second term in the May 3 election, powered by a voter backlash against US President Donald Trump's policies.

Western partners are not imposing any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine for use against Russian military targets, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on May 26.

""There are no longer any restrictions on the range of weapons delivered to Ukraine – neither by the U.K., France, nor us. There are no restrictions by the U.S. either,"" Merz said during a discussion forum organized by the WDR channel.

""This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia,"" the chancellor added. ""Until recently, it couldn't do that, and apart from very few exceptions, it hadn't done so either.""

Ukraine has previously received long-range missiles from the U.S., the U.K., and France — including ATACMS, Storm Shadow, and SCALP — but was initially permitted to deploy them only against Russian military forces in occupied Ukrainian territories.

Only in late 2024, the U.S. Biden administration and other allies eased the restrictions, allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against Russian military targets in border regions. U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized ex-President Joe Biden's decision to ease the restrictions as he seeks to negotiate a peace agreement between Kyiv and Moscow.

The German chancellor also stressed that while Ukraine is using its arms to target Russian military infrastructure, Russia continues to attack Ukrainian ""cities, kindergartens, hospitals, and care homes.""

Before becoming chancellor, Merz signaled he would overturn the ban of his predecessor, Olaf Scholz, on the delivery of Germany's Taurus cruise missiles, capable of striking targets at a distance of 500 kilometers (300 miles). He has not confirmed whether he intends to deliver the missiles since taking office.

Four former Volkswagen executives have been found guilty of fraud in a criminal trial relating to the ""Dieselgate"" scandal.

The Braunschweig Regional Court in northern Germany on Monday convicted four former Volkswagen executives of fraud over the ""Dieselgate"" scandal.  

The verdict brings a massive trial to an end after almost four years. The scandal surrounding the manipulation of diesel car emissions tests came to light in September 2015. The Wolfsburg-based automaker had shortly before admitted to false test results in the US. 

Two of the executives were sentenced to several years in prison, with two other former employees receiving suspended sentences.

A former head of diesel engine development was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. The former head of drive electronics received two years and seven months in prison.

The highest-ranking defendant, a former member of the Volkswagen brand's development board, received one year and three months' probation. A former department head was sentenced to one year and ten months' probation.

The global scandal, widely known as Dieselgate, plunged the Wolfsburg-based carmaker into a deep crisis.

Volkswagen has faced countless lawsuits and estimated the total cost of the scandal at more than €30 billion ($34 billion).

The public prosecutor's office had demanded between two and four years in prison and considered probation appropriate in only one case. The defense, however, pleaded for three acquittals and one warning.

Former chief executive Martin Winterkorn was originally due to stand trial alongside the four, but proceedings against him were suspended for health reasons before they began in September 2021.

Winterkorn has since appeared in court as both a witness and a defendant, repeatedly denying any responsibility for the scandal.

A recent accident and hospitalization further interrupted his case, and it remains unclear if or when the proceedings against the now 78-year-old will resume.

Winterkorn, once Germany's highest-paid executive, resigned shortly after the scandal broke but has denied any personal responsibility. Prosecutors alleged in court that he knew about the illegal software as early as May 2014—well before the timeline he has acknowledged.

Democrats are ditching woke jargon to win back voters who defected to the right and elected Donald Trump.

Prominent party figures warned that said phrases beloved by its activist base like “Latinx” had isolated ordinary voters and fuelled shattering losses in the last year's elections.

They also fear the party's emphasis on issues such as pronouns exhausted the electorate.

Kamala Harris, who lost the 2024 presidential election to Mr Trump, was criticised during her brief campaign for nonsensical “word salad” responses she gave during interviews.

“Some words are just too Ivy League-tested terms,” Ruben Gallego, the Arizona senator, told The Washington Post.

“I'm going to p--- some people off by saying this, but ‘social equity' – why do we say that? Why don't we say, ‘We want you to have an even chance'?”

Mr Gallego, who defeated Kari Lake, a candidate endorsed by Mr Trump, in his senate race, said he had once been instructed to describe his background as “economically disadvantaged” rather than “poor”.

“Not every person we meet is going to have the latest update on what the proper terms are,” he continued.

“It doesn't make them sexist or homophobic or racist. Maybe they are a little outdated, but they have a good heart.”

He said the term “Latinx”, which avoids gendering Latinos or Latinas, is “stupid” and claimed that few Hispanics actually use it.

Joe Biden, the former US president, has previously claimed it was “hard to get Latinx vaccinated” because they were scared of being deported.

Policy papers produced by Mr Biden's administration also refer to “justice-involved populations” rather than prisoners, and “previously-incarcerated individuals” instead of ex-convicts.

Andy Beshear, the Kentucky governor who won two terms in the red-leaning state, said Democrats had fallen into using phrases like “substance abuse disorder” instead of addiction.

“I believe that over time, and probably for well-meaning reasons, Democrats have begun to speak like professors and started using advocacy-speak that was meant to reduce stigma, but also removed the meaning and emotion behind words,” he said.

“It makes Democrats or candidates using this speech sound like they're not normal… It sounds simple, but what the Democratic Party needs to do is be normal and sound normal.”

“Democrats trip over themselves in an attempt to say exactly the right thing,” said Allison Prasch, an associate professor of rhetoric, politics and culture at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

“Republicans maybe aren't so concerned about saying exactly the right thing, so it may appear more authentic to some voters.”

Elissa Slotkin, the Michigan senator, said she had once won over a group of sceptical Teamster union members by calling them “motherf---ers”.

“They love it…. That is a different way to enter the room,” she said.

She has previously criticised progressive politicians, like Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, for railing against the “oligarchy”, claiming the term means little to ordinary voters.

In March, Pennsylvania senator John Fetterman urged his party to talk “like regular people”, adding: “Most people are not sure what an oligarch is.”

During last year's election campaign, the Trump campaign and Republicans sought to paint Democrats as out-of-touch and beholden to a radical activist wing.

Ms Harris was frequently mocked for her “word salad” responses to interview questions. One New York Times commentator complained she relied heavily on “jargon” and “rehearsed turns of phrase” while she “winds her way slowly toward an answer”.

In a town hall event a fortnight before election day, Ms Harris appeared to address the issue, conceding she struggled to answer questions, was “kind of a nerd”, and was not always “quick on her feet”.

Several commentators said her lack of clarity meant she ended up on the wrong side of the culture war. One of Mr Trump's most effective attack adverts ended with the tagline: “Kamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you.”

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Monday, Rahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor who is considered a potential contender for the Democratic nomination, urged his party to focus on issues like education over gender identity.

“I'm empathetic and sympathetic to a child trying to figure out their pronoun, but it doesn't trump the fact that the rest of the class doesn't know what a pronoun is,” he said.

            Ten people were shot and at least one other person was injured when a holiday weekend gathering at a charter boat in a South Carolina coastal community turned violent, according to police.
    


            Some of those injured in the shooting in Little River on Sunday were in critical condition as of Monday morning, Horry County police said, without specifying how many. Detectives were trying to determine who was responsible for the shooting, police said; no names were released and no arrests were immediately announced.
    


            The shooting stemmed from an altercation during a private Memorial Day weekend gathering on a charter boat in Little River, a community of about 11,000 people situated along the Intracoastal Waterway near the North Carolina state line, police said.
    


            Police didn't say whether the shooting happened on the boat. The vessel was docked at the time of the incident, Horry County spokesperson Mikayla Moskov said. Details about what led to the altercation weren't immediately available.
    


            Eleven people were taken to hospitals, police said. Besides the 10 who were shot, one person “reported an unknown non-gunfire-related injury,” police said.
    


            According to The Associated Press, a flyer online advertised a party Sunday night with a DJ on a three-hour cruise ending at 9 p.m. A woman who answered a phone number on the flyer early Monday said she was distraught seeing her friends get shot, but then said she didn't want to talk further and hung up, according to the AP.
    


            Someone who answered the phone at the company that owns the boat said he didn't want to talk to a reporter, according to the AP.
    


            Little River is roughly 20 miles northeast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","A physician who advocates for the power of human touch over technology will deliver Harvard's commencement speech","https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/26/us/harvard-commencement-speaker-abraham-verghese","Mon, 26 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","


            Doctors interact with patients, in many cases, when they are feeling their worst – so, how they talk to those patients during such a vulnerable time matters.
    


            That's the philosophy of Abraham Verghese, the bestselling author, Stanford professor, and infectious disease doctor who will address students at Harvard University's 374th Commencement this week.
    


            Harvard's invitation to Verghese, comes at a time of significant uncertainty at the Ivy League school amid its ongoing clashes with the Trump administration over academic freedom, federal funding, campus oversight and most recently, a ban on the enrollment of international students.
    


            Verghese will be the first physician to give Harvard's commencement speech since 1996, according to the school's student-run newspaper, The Harvard Crimson. That year, Harold E. Varmus, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and former director of the National Institutes of Health, told graduates that supporting science was a shared human responsibility.
    


            “He has pursued excellence across disciplines with an intensity surpassed only by his humanity, which shines brilliantly through his works of both fiction and nonfiction, as well as his work as a clinician and teacher,” said Harvard President Alan M. Garber about Verghese in the university's commencement announcement. 



            In previous years, graduates have heard from many accomplished speakers: Nobel Prize-winning journalist Maria Ressa, Academy Award-winning actor Tom Hanks, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Academy Award-winning director Steven Spielberg and media mogul Oprah Winfrey.
    


            While the 69-year-old may not be a household name, Verghese is a prominent physician. His journey has taken him across the United States, healing patients through medicine and reaching people through literature, including his 2023 novel “The Covenant of Water.”



            Verghese declined to be interviewed for this story, but wrote on social media he was “deeply honored” to have been invited to Harvard by Garber, who was previously one of his colleagues at the Stanford School of Medicine.
    


            For many years, Verghese has advocated for strengthening the physician-patient connection and bedside skills.
    


            He joined the Stanford School of Medicine in 2007 as a professor and is currently, vice chair for the Theory & Practice of Medicine program. He also founded an interdisciplinary center at Stanford focused on the human experience in medicine and Stanford Medicine 25, an initiative designed to foster bedside exam skills for professionals.
    


            For Verghese, the most important innovation in medicine is “the power of the human hand to touch, to comfort, to diagnose, and to bring about treatment,” according to his 2011 TED Talk in Edinburgh, Scotland.
    


            Technology is impacting the interactions b﻿etween patients and doctors because hospital rounds often center around data and images on a computer, far away from the actual patient, Verghese said during the TED Talk.
    


            “The ritual of one individual coming to another and telling them things that they would not tell their preacher or rabbi, and then, incredibly, on top of that, disrobing and allowing touch, I would submit to you that that is a ritual of exceeding importance,” Verghese said.
    


            “And if you short change that ritual by not undressing the patient, by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown, by not doing a complete exam, you have bypassed on the opportunity to seal the patient-physician relationship.”
    


            Through Presence, an interdisciplinary center at Stanford, and Stanford Medicine 25, Verghese hopes to educate future medical professionals on bedside medicine, harnessing technology for the human experience as well as studying and advocating for the patient-physician relationship.
    


            Verghese has drawn from his personal experiences in three continents to fuel the type of educator and writer he has become today.
    


            He was born in Ethiopia's capital city of Addis Ababa to expatriate Indian parents, who were both educators, and grew up there as the country was ruled by Emperor Haile Selassie.  He started medical school in Ethiopia but fled the country when Selassie was toppled by a violent military dictatorship in the 1970s, Verghese wrote in The Guardian.



            Verghese reunited with his parents in New Jersey, where they had previously moved. There, he began working as a hospital orderly, which ultimately inspired him to return to his family's homeland and become a physician.
    


            “Looking back, that was the best medical education I could have had, because I saw what happened to the patient in the 23 hours and 58 minutes the doctors were not in the room,” Verghese shared in an interview with a medical journal about his time as an orderly.
    


            Once he graduated from medical school in India, Verghese returned to the US and completed his residency at a hospital in Johnson City, Tennessee, followed by a fellowship in infectious diseases at the former Boston City Hospital in Massachusetts in the mid-1980s.
    


            During his time in rural east Tennessee, Verghese had a front row seat to the frontlines of the AIDS epidemic. That experience﻿ “humbled” him and changed the way he saw his practice, he said in an interview with the American Society of Hematology's magazine, ASH Clinical News.
    


            “We learned what it meant to heal when we could not cure,” he told the magazine. “We realized how much our presence and caring mattered. A cure wasn't within our reach, but we were making a profound difference by indicating to the patient that we would be there, that we were not running away.”
    


            And despite being able to do so little for his patients, who battled a disease with no treatment, he focused on providing them comfort and doing so filled him with purpose.
    


            After witnessing so much loss and health care workers' burnout during the AIDS epidemic, Verghese has said becoming a writer became “a matter of self-preservation.”



            In 1990, the physician pressed pause on medicine to focus on his writing and attended the prestigious Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa, according to his website.
    


            After earning his master's degree in Iowa, Verghese moved to El Paso, Texas, where he was a professor of medicine and chief of the division of infectious diseases at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center for 11 years. During that time, he would spend his evenings writing, he told Palo Alto Online.
    


            “Writing became my escape from the pressures of being an infectious disease clinician, ” he told ASH Clinical News.
    


            “Other people might have played golf or something, but for me it was writing,” he added.
    


            In his first novel “My Own Country: A Doctor's Story,” Verghese pulled back the curtain on his own experiences and the meaningful, personal relationships he formed during the AIDS epidemic. The 1994 book was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and listed as one of Time magazine's best books of the year.
    


            Verghese has written several other award-winning titles, including “The Tennis Partner,” “Cutting for Stone,” and most recently, “The Covenant of Water,” which is a New York Times bestseller, a Oprah's Book Club pick and was named one of former president Barack Obama's favorite books of 2023.



            “In my work as a writer, I have always tried to convey the notion that medicine is a uniquely human, person-to-person endeavor,” Verghese has said about his writing. “In my view, it is a ministry with a calling.”
    


            His family, notably his grandmothers, influenced “The Covenant of Water,” he said during a 2023 talk at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The novel is set in Kerala, south India, and follows three generations of a family looking for answers about a secret.
    


            “Both my grandmothers were, in their own way, quietly heroic women,” he said during the talk. “They had real life tragedies that they somehow weathered and they went on because of their faith.”
    


            Verghese has received many accolades for his work, including the 2014 Heinz Award – which highlights individuals making contributions to the arts, the economy and the environment – the 2015 National Humanities Medal, and the Guggenheim Fellowship in 2023.
    


            “Dr. Verghese's widely acclaimed writings touch the heart and inform the soul, giving people of all walks of life a true understanding of what it is to heal the whole person - not just physically, but emotionally,” Teresa Heinz, chair of the Heinz Family Foundation, said in a news release at the time.
    


            While Harvard students will have to wait to hear his speech, Verghese previously addressed graduating students at the Stanford School of Medicine, where he implored them to let their innate intelligence guide them through the future.

Turning Point Actions Driena Sixto and Republican Latina Ana Kuecker join Fox & Friends First to discuss the president's sit-down interview with Fox Noticias, the importance of Hispanic media and immigration reform. 

Ex-Obama senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer warned on Friday that there is ""no path"" for Democrats to win elections unless they address their rapidly declining Latino vote.

Pfeiffer brought this up with former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau on the ""Pod Save America"" podcast as they looked over 2024 election exit data which showed former Vice President Kamala Harris losing ground with both young voters and minority voters.

Pfeiffer added that the Democratic Party had been losing Latino voters since 2016.

""The main story of this is that Democrats are in a huge bit of trouble,"" Pfeiffer said. ""There's no way to look at this without recognizing the massive scale of our problems. And you can kind of tell yourself that things might be kind of okay by looking at just the shift from 2020 to 2024. But if you really want to assess where we are as a party, you have to look at the shift from 2016 to 2024. And it is particularly true with Latino voters.""

He pointed out that Latinos have shifted 17 points towards Republicans since 2016. While Democrats still took a majority of Hispanic voters, Pfeiffer showed concern over this trend.

""Latinos are the fastest-growing population in the country. They are particularly politically powerful because of how the population is distributed in electoral-rich sunbelt states like Texas, Florida, Arizona, Nevada, et cetera. And so, they are becoming more of the electorate, and we are losing more of them at a very fast rate. If that trend continues, there is no path to Democrats winning elections,"" Pfeiffer said.

Regarding young voters, Pfeiffer pointed out that Harris only got about half of new voters compared to President Donald Trump.

""If that trend continues, we're in huge trouble,"" Pfeiffer said. ""The message I take from this is anyone who thinks that we can get away with just tinkering around the edges just hoping that Donald Trump becomes unpopular or they nominate some yahoo in 2028 or we're going to ride the wave of tariffs and inflation to a narrow House victory is just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. We have to be willing to ask very hard questions.""

WHO WAS ‘SHOCKED' BY JOE BIDEN'S INFIRMITY? Here is a basic question about Original Sin, the new book detailing the White House's attempt to hide former President Joe Biden‘s in-plain-sight mental and physical decline: Why is it having such an impact? Sure, the subject, an intermittently disabled president, is hugely important. But on the other hand, everybody knew, or should have known, that Biden was an intermittently disabled president.

So, why did the book devour the news cycle last week? You have to go back to the pivotal debate between Biden and then-former President Donald Trump on June 27, 2024. Biden's out-of-it performance shocked Democrats and their allies in the media. In an instant, they realized he was not up to the job of serving a second term as president. (Truth be told, he was not up to the job of finishing his first term, either.)

How could they be shocked? It had been obvious for a while that Biden was struggling cognitively and physically. There were three public events in the weeks before the debate in which Biden's problems were overwhelmingly clear. Yet even today, many insist they were shocked on debate night.

What Original Sin does is give those Democrats and their allies in the media an explanation — an excuse, if you prefer — for that feeling of shock, for missing a huge story that was happening right in front of their eyes. There was a White House conspiracy! The tight circle around Biden — the politburo! — carefully controlled his schedule to conceal the truth! We weren't in the tank. We weren't negligent. White House insiders were hiding it.

Last week, the book's two authors, Axios's Alex Thompson and CNN's Jake Tapper, appeared on the MSNBC program Morning Joe. Everyone around the table, with the exception of Thompson, professed shock at Biden's debate performance.

“We all saw the debate, June 27,” Tapper said. “We were all shocked. We were all stunned at his inability to communicate his thoughts.” Later, co-host Joe Scarborough said to both Tapper and Thompson, “Can I ask you guys, were you shocked by the debate?” “Yes, of course — especially in person. I was there,” said Tapper, who had co-moderated the debate for CNN. Thompson, who, unlike the others, had actually looked into Biden's condition well before the debate, said no, he was not. “I wouldn't say I was shocked,” Thompson said. “I was a little surprised it had gotten that bad.”

Original Sin carries a big impact for people who say they were shocked by the debate. Consider it this way. If you look at the story of Biden's infirmity and White House efforts to conceal it, and you say, “I had no idea!” — then the book is shocking. On the other hand, if you say, “Of course he had cognitive issues; everybody could see that” — then the book is not shocking.

The big problem for the we-were-shocked group is that Biden's problems were not only obvious but also that there were reputable journalists, not Trump or Republican activists, who reported on those problems in real time. Thompson did some. A number of commentators pointed out troubling videos of Biden losing his train of thought, wandering around, and appearing generally confused in public. And then, on June 4, 2024, three weeks before the debate, the Wall Street Journal published a story headlined “Behind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping.”

Reporters Annie Linskey and Siobhan Hughes began with a description of a Biden meeting with congressional leaders in which the president “spoke so softly at times that some participants struggled to hear him … read from notes to make obvious points, paused for extended periods and sometimes closed his eyes for so long that some in the room wondered whether he had tuned out.”

The article added that “the White House and top aides said [Biden] remains a sharp and vigorous leader. Some who have worked with him, however, including Democrats and some who have known him back to his time as vice president, described a president who appears slower now, someone who has both good moments and bad ones.”

If one looked at the Wall Street Journal story, plus some other reporting, plus the many examples of Biden spacing out in public — if one looked at all that, there was cause for alarm, especially when it came to the president asking voters for four more years in office. Yet the reaction of some in the press was to try to knock the story down. 

CNN's media reporter attacked the Wall Street Journal article, arguing it suffered from a “glaring problem,” which was that it purportedly relied on too many Republican sources. Tapper's program reported the story the day after it appeared, when the news was the White House's pushback against the Wall Street Journal. Two people appeared on the show to discuss the issue: Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), perhaps Biden's closest friend and supporter in the Senate, and Rep. Andy Kim (D-NJ). Both said Biden was just fine and up to the job.

This is not to single out the CNN coverage; it was representative of much of the press. The overall message was exactly what the White House wanted: Everything is fine. Those stories that the president is suffering from cognitive decline are all falsehoods pushed by his political opponents.

Did the journalists really believe that? That's for them to say. It's hard to believe that one could look at Biden's public performances and accept the White House spin, but that is exactly what some did. It is easier to believe this: Many in the media were biased in favor of Biden over Trump. When there was something terribly wrong with Biden, they either did not want to know about it or reacted reflexively in a way that was comfortable to them — that is, when Trump or Republicans said something, their instinct was to knock it down. And so it was with Biden's infirmity.

Then came the debate and the professions of shock. Now, a year later, with all the other things that are happening, the political world is still grappling with it, and it is still dominating the news.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","FEMA's fork in the road: Abolition or seat at the Cabinet","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/in_focus/3421371/fema-future-abolition-overhaul-cabinet/","Mon, 26 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has landed on President Donald Trump's radar as he considers the agency's abolishment or a significant reform to its operations. 

But a bipartisan push from both chambers of Congress would instead seek to install FEMA as a Cabinet-level agency, effectively promoting the agency's importance while moving it directly under Trump's purview. 

The efforts come after Trump has previously floated “reforming” or “getting rid of FEMA.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees the agency, also said during a Cabinet meeting that the agency was “going to eliminate FEMA.”

Congressional lawmakers on both sides of the aisle see a different path forward. 

Reps. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) and Byron Donalds (R-FL) are among the lawmakers pushing to carve FEMA out of the Department of Homeland Security, arguing that the public security agency's size has become a hindrance.“Homeland has become too big,” Moskowitz told the Washington Examiner. “It's a giant bureaucracy, and it's slowing FEMA down, which is some of the reform and criticism, some of the criticism it gets, and some of the reform that's needed.”

Donalds, who joined Moskowitz in introducing the FEMA Independence Act earlier this year, said it's “critical” that FEMA is not caught up in the “bureaucratic mess that Homeland Security can be” and that there be a direct line between the president and governors in organizing disaster responses. 

“It's just critical at the end of the day when disaster strikes, people need answers quickly, not bureaucratic answers,” Donalds said.

As part of his plans to overhaul the agency, Trump has formed the FEMA Review Council to conduct a “full-scale review” and suggest “improvements or structural changes.” The council, which met for the first time on May 20, is expected to submit a report of its findings in November. 

“The Council will help transform and reform how America responds to and recovers from disasters by recommending changes related to FEMA that best serve the national interest,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “Their work will help Make America Safe Again.”

Donalds told the Washington Examiner that he has spoken with the White House about getting FEMA moved out from under DHS, saying that leaving it within the agency will lead to “more bureaucratic mishaps.”

There is precedent for FEMA to be an independent agency, as it was before the formation of DHS by then-President George W. Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 

Subsequent organizational changes to FEMA following its absorption into DHS alongside over 20 other agencies led its then-director, Michael D. Brown, to warn that the organization would be “fundamentally” severed from its core functions, and that “long-standing, effective and tested relationships with states and first responder stakeholders” would be shattered. 

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), the lead Republican author on legislation in the upper chamber to elevate FEMA to Cabinet-level status, sees the agency as the heart of disaster management that brings together all levels of government before, during, and after devastating weather events. Portions of his state hit worst by Hurricane Helene last September are still recovering from the deadly storm, in which wind and rain-induced flooding killed 107 people in the Tar Heel State.

“This just doesn't happen organically,” Tillis said. “They are deploying assets. They are working with state agencies before a storm ever hits. They were on the ground when Helene hit. You can't, all of a sudden, start treating this like a pickup game.”

Eliminating FEMA or having it use federal money to delegate most of its hands-on responsibilities to local governments is a philosophy Tillis emphatically rejected as someone who lacks knowledge of natural disasters.

“I don't mind FEMA getting thinner. I don't mind an argument about certain core functions of FEMA being put in emergency management state operations,” he said. “But to eliminate it, to me, demonstrates a lack of understanding of how storm responses work.”

At the core of the discussion over reforming the disaster agency is whether or not states or the federal government should be in control of emergency management. 

Those in disaster-prone states, such as Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), hold a pessimistic view of FEMA and are wary of affording it greater power. A former two-term governor of the Sunshine State and no stranger to working with the agency while battling major hurricanes, he characterized FEMA as rife with fraud that does little more than write checks for post-disaster clean-up.

“I think that they actually have way too much involvement. I think some sort of block grants would be helpful,” Scott said. “I'm not a process person, whether it should be a Cabinet or whatever. I think that they are way too involved in disasters. How can somebody in DC know what to do locally? It doesn't make any sense.”

Rep. Addison McDowell (R-NC) argued that state and local governments should lead on disaster responses, saying that “Bureaucrats in Washington don't rebuild communities and are too often an impediment.”

“While the federal government should be there to ensure impacted communities have what they need in times of immediate aftermath and also rebuilding, I believe that state and local governments, in partnership with nonprofit and the private sector, should take the lead on implementation and execution,” McDowell wrote in a statement to the Washington Examiner. 

Trump himself has stated similar beliefs, saying earlier this year that he would “rather see the states take care of their own problems” during an interview on Fox News.

Rep. Deborah Ross (D-NC) disagrees with eliminating FEMA outright, however, telling the Washington Examiner that doing away with the disaster agency and leaving it to the states would be a “race to the bottom for our people.”

Discussions about altering FEMA in various capacities have also created conservative contrarians willing to cut against the GOP's traditional narrative that less government is inherently better.

US AND CANADA LINKED UP IN FIGHT TO STOP DRUG SMUGGLING AT BORDER

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), among the chamber's most conservative members, has begged FEMA to approve Missouri's pending federal disaster declaration requests from tornadoes that have ravaged the state, some of which have gone unfilled for more than a month. He described FEMA as an agency currently incapable of cutting through bureaucratic red tape to adequately respond to natural disasters but still views it as providing a vital federal service for constituents. “I'm open to anything that makes sure that in crises like the ones we're in the midst of in Missouri now, we get the relief we need, our residents get the responsiveness they need,” Hawley said. “What I am not for is something that says, ‘Well, you know, you're on your own. Good luck to you.' We paid these tax dollars for a reason.”

Strategy (MSTR) has acquired an additional 4,020 bitcoin BTC$109,104.03 for roughly $427 million, pushing its total holdings to 580,250 BTC, the company said.

The latest acquisition was funded through three ongoing at-the-market (ATM) equity programs, according to a press release.

Between May 19 and May 25, Strategy sold 847,000 shares of its common stock (MSTR) for $348.7 million, 678,970 shares of STRK preferred stock for $67.9 million, and 104,423 shares of STRF preferred stock for $10.4 million.

These offerings, with combined capacities of nearly $45 billion, are part of the company's long-running bitcoin accumulation strategy.

At an average purchase price of $106,237 per coin for the latest tranche, the firm's total bitcoin investment now stands at $40.61 billion with an average purchase price of $69,979.

Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind US President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform, is planning to raise $3 billion in a mix of equity and convertible bonds to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the Financial Times reported. The move would position the company to follow the footsteps of crypto treasury companies like Strategy.

Trump Media will issue $2 billion in equity and $1 billion in convertible bonds, a type of asset that can be converted into equity at a later date. The size of the raise may change, the FT cited sources familiar with the matter as saying.

The equity is expected to be sold at market price as of the close on May 23. On that day, the share price closed at $25.72, marking a 4.6% increase on the day. Trump Media's market capitalization was $5.7 billion as of May 23.

The company is following a similar approach to that pioneered by companies such as Strategy, Metaplanet, Semler Scientific and others, allocating part of their funds to Bitcoin (BTC). Betting on crypto provides a hedge against inflation and keeps them from becoming “zombie companies,” some of the companies have said.

Trump Media's move may increase scrutiny

The move may also result in more scrutiny toward the Trump family's growing crypto businesses. Democratic lawmakers have pushed back against bipartisan bills over the Trump family's crypto dealings, with some staging protests against the memecoin dinner Trump hosted on May 22.

Trump's crypto ties include non-fungible token collections, the Official Trump (TRUMP) and Melania (MELANIA) memecoins, decentralized finance platform World Liberty Financial and a dollar-pegged stablecoin. Critics say that Trump's crypto ventures pose a conflict of interest, especially as he could hold influence over an industry he stands to profit from.

According to the report, Trump transferred his 53% share in Trump Media and Technology to a revocable trust managed by Donald Trump Jr.

The crypto market has been pumping over the past weeks, putting the bear market of the first quarter firmly in the rearview mirror. Now, the question for investors isn't what direction the market is headed next—it's which tokens to buy to earn the biggest gains in the coming frenzy.

We've talked to analysts and crypto experts to find the most promising tokens for 2025. Here are four coins that are showing serious potential.

MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is an exciting AI agent token with the potential to change the fabric of the meme coin market. The project is introducing a fully self-sovereign AI agent with its own X account and crypto wallet. It can interact with other meme coin traders, weigh in on the latest moves in the market, and even hype coins the AI has chosen to back.

All the while, MIND of Pepe will be collecting data about trader sentiment and what meme coin investors want. It will share its insights with $MIND token holders, giving them a heads up on which tokens could pump next and actionable trading signals to help them navigate the market.

The AI agent will also have the power to design and launch new meme coins based on what it perceives the meme coin market wants. $MIND investors will have an exclusive opportunity to buy the new tokens before they launch and lock in explosive gains when they go viral.

The $MIND token is currently available on presale, but not for much longer. After raising more than $10 million, the project is closing its presale in just 7 days. So, this is the final chance for investors to lock in $MIND at a discount price before it becomes the next AI agent crypto to explode.

TON ($TON) is an up-and-coming Layer-1 blockchain and already the 20th-most valuable crypto in the entire market. But while it's market cap of $7.5 billion, it's only a fraction of what this token could be worth in the near future.

The TON Network Layer-1 offers the same smart contract computing features as Ethereum, but it's significantly faster and cheaper. Even more important, TON Network boasts a deep integration with Telegram, which originally created the blockchain. That gives TON an inside path to capturing Telegram's 1 billion global active users—a headstart in building a massive community that no other project can claim.

Telegram has already created its own $TON wallet and helped TON Network become a hub for play-to-earn games like Notcoin and Hamster Kombat. As prices start rising, we think TON could be the entry point into crypto for millions of new investors and traders worldwide, sending the $TON token price soaring higher.

Best Wallet ($BEST) is a leading Web3 crypto wallet and up-and-coming ecosystem. It offers top-notch crypto security, complete privacy, and a full complement of features to help crypto investors and traders navigate the ever-growing world of Web3. Features include the ability to buy crypto anonymously, connect to crypto gaming platforms, explore emerging cryptos, and more.

Now, Best Wallet is getting even better with a new ecosystem token, $BEST. The new token offers Best Wallet users and investors significant perks like discounts on token swaps at Best Wallet's DEX and exclusive early access to new projects in the Upcoming Tokens launchpad. $BEST holders also receive enhanced staking APYs on popular cryptos.

The project also has an exciting roadmap ahead for both the wallet and the $BEST token. For example, Best Wallet plans to launch a crypto debit card, and $BEST holders will receive discounts and boosted cashback on every transaction.

The $BEST token presale has been a massive success, raising more than $12 million from existing wallet users and new investors. Analysts are calling it the next $BNB or $BGB, so this is a platform token that investors won't want to miss for the coming crypto bull run.

Nexo ($NEXO) is an established DeFi platform that offers a wide range of ways for crypto investors to get the most return from their tokens. The project offers flexible and fixed-term savings accounts, credit lines for individuals, and its own decentralized crypto exchange to facilitate trading. Businesses can find a prime brokerage and a venture arm to get funding for growth.

What's exciting about Nexo now is that the company is returning to the US after several years of staying away. That opens up the platform to potentially tens of millions of new users, including some of the most affluent individual crypto holders in the world. Partnerships with US businesses, including crypto exchanges like Coinbase and US banks looking to get into crypto as regulations relax could be just around the corner.

The $NEXO token is likely to benefit from this growth since it offers significant benefits for Nexo users. For example, token holders receive reduced loan interest rates, crypto cashback after trades on the Nexo exchange, and boosted staking yields. The supply of $NEXO is fixed, so new demand from a massive US market could send the price of the token sharply higher.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Bilal Bin Saqib appointed as SAPM on blockchain, crypto","https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1315446-bilal-bin-saqib-appointed-as-sapm-to-lead-pakistans-blockchain-crypto-future","Mon, 26 May 2025 07:54:00 GMT","

Bilal Bin Saqib has been appointed as the Special Assistant to the PM (SAPM) on Blockchain and Crypto, with the status of state minister by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

Pakistan was positioned among an elite group of 7-9 nations, including the United States, El Salvador, and the UAE, with dedicated leadership for cryptocurrency and blockchain, signalling a bold commitment to leading the global digital economy, by this groundbreaking decision.

Saqib also serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) and Chief Advisor to the Finance Minister.

As CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, Bilal has spearheaded strategic collaborations and built critical bridges between Pakistan and global technology stakeholders.

Under his leadership, the Council signed a landmark partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLF) — a decentralised finance platform backed by US President Donald Trump — to help drive blockchain innovation and stablecoin adoption in Pakistan.

He also invited Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder of Binance, and appointed him as Strategic Advisor to the PCC to help shape regulatory development, infrastructure expansion, and education programmes for crypto in Pakistan.

A graduate of the London School of Economics (LSE) with a Master's in Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship, he has been featured in Forbes Asia 30 Under 30 for his work in social impact.

Saqib has also been honoured with the prestigious MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) from King Charles III.

● Developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets

● Launching Bitcoin mining initiatives

● Overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records

● Facilitating licensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)

● Championing investor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth in Pakistan

This appointment reflects Pakistan's commitment to aligning with global trends. Just as the United States has brought leaders like David Sacks — appointed by Trump as the White House AI and Crypto Czar — into its digital policy framework, Pakistan is taking a forward-thinking approach by empowering a youth leader to help steer national strategy in emerging technologies.

Pakistan stands at a critical digital crossroads. The country consistently ranks in the top 10 globally for crypto adoption, according to the 2023 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index, with approximately 40 million crypto users and an annual crypto trading volume exceeding $300 billion. The nation produces around 40,000 IT graduates annually and boasts the 4th largest freelancer market worldwide.

This rapid uptake of emerging technologies, combined with a youthful population where over 60% of citizens are under the age of 30, positions Pakistan to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of blockchain and crypto advancements in the coming decade.

Strategic policymaking in these fields is not just an opportunity but a national imperative.

According to Saqib: “Pakistan's unique demographic and digital landscape offers an unprecedented opportunity to leapfrog into the future of technology—where blockchain and crypto will drive economic growth, innovation, and global competitiveness.”

To the dismay of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, the law currently prevents Big Tech companies from opening banks. But if Congress passes the GENIUS Act, tech firms may start issuing private currencies and forcing us to use them.

Our spring issue, “Progress,” was called by one commentator “quite readable.” Click here to see what all the fuss is about.

Amid a flood of industry lobbying in Washington, DC, and Democrats' capitulation, the Senate is set to pass the GENIUS Act, a sweeping cryptocurrency law that could spread fraud-ridden, destabilizing digital currencies across the banking system. But lawmakers and consumer protection experts warn that the bill has an even more serious problem: it would allow Elon Musk and other Big Tech tycoons to issue their own private currencies.

That means we could soon live in a world where all online transactions will require us to pay for goods in billionaires' own made-up monopoly money, for which tech giants will be able to charge exorbitant transaction fees.

This scenario isn't just a pipe dream. It's a long-running project by tech platforms to control payment networks. In the past few weeks, Meta began laying the groundwork once again to launch its own cryptocurrency.

What's more, thanks to a bipartisan “compromise” that convinced Democratic holdouts to support the legislation, the latest version of the bill could stop the government's top financial and tech regulator from overseeing any of these potential tech currencies.

The GENIUS Act, which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, was designed to create light-touch regulations for stablecoins, a more commonly used form of crypto token that is often pegged to the US dollar in an equivalent value (one stablecoin is redeemable to one dollar).

If it becomes law, any banking or even nonbanking enterprise could get a license to deal stablecoins with minimal oversight. This could riddle the entire financial system with volatility and make illicit activity like fraud and terrorism undetectable while providing major new markets to the companies issuing the cryptocurrencies. The El Salvador–based firm Tether is currently the largest trading platform for these currencies and has faced numerous US lawsuits for fraud.

After some crypto-friendly Democrats temporarily backed away from their support for the bill earlier this month, Republicans came to the bargaining table and made what appeared to be some modest concessions to temper Democrats' concerns about Trump's corrupt use of crypto for personal gain. But a legal analysis from the Democratic staff on the Banking Committee just blasted this new version of the bill for allowing Big Tech to create its own currencies, among a litany of other problems.

The bill also includes a giant carve-out to ensure Musk's social media platform X, formerly Twitter, would not be covered by even modest restrictions, thereby “gifting the President's closest Big Tech ally a competitive advantage in creating his own private currency,” according to the Banking Committee analysis.

Musk might not be the only one scoring these benefits. The Trump administration could also waive the bill's more stringent requirements for any favored tech company, according to the Senate Banking Committee staff.

On top of these carve-outs, a new legal citation slipped into the bill tacitly strips away the authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a key financial and tech regulator, to oversee the issuance of stablecoins. The CFPB has been probing Meta and other tech companies' payment networks and has taken action to regulate those platforms like banks.

Despite these concerns, sixteen Democratic senators just voted in favor of moving the updated bill to a floor vote, which all but guarantees its passage through the Senate. Just two Republicans, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) and Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS), voted against the measure, disfavoring federal intervention to assist crypto and Big Tech.

According to Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, their colleagues have now given license to the kind of outright pay to play that Democrats had claimed to oppose in the original version of the GENIUS Act.

The tech giants that stand to benefit from the bill funneled millions of dollars to key swing-seat candidates this past election. Those include vocal crypto allies Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) and Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), who each received $10 million from political action committees funded by cryptocurrency interests. The Protect Progress PAC, the Democratic arm of the crypto lobby's campaign spending operation, spent $33 million on both primary and general election races in 2024.

The GENIUS Act is ostensibly geared toward assisting cryptocurrency companies whose lobbying groups have pushed hard for the bill. But Brian Shearer, a former senior adviser at the CFPB and a legal expert at Vanderbilt University, argues that the legislation's implications will be far more wide-ranging across nonbanking industries.

The bill's language erodes a two-hundred-year-old legal standard that mandates a separation between banks that deal in financial products and commercial enterprises that sell goods. The division was put in place to prevent industrial firms from accumulating too much power in finance, enabling them to restrict competitors or consumers from accessing banking.

In the past, blurring the lines between finance and commerce has caused major problems.

For example, within the financial sector, the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act under former president Bill Clinton removed a long-standing barrier between the riskier business of investment banking and the more stolid side of commercial banking, which just deals with managing depositors' accounts. Financial experts cite the law's repeal as helping to pave the way for the 2008 financial crash.

While that outcome may sound extreme, the point, Shearer says, is that “even minor disruptions to the fundamentals of financial regulation can have these profound consequences to the whole financial system.” Regulators have warned of a potential financial collapse if crypto is allowed to infiltrate traditional banking markets.

The GENIUS Act also comes at a time when financial regulators, led by the CFPB, have been cracking down on Big Tech for using its market power to force user adoption of its own payment processing services, which come with high transaction fees.

Apple, Google, and Meta each run their own payment networks, and Musk has previously indicated his desire to integrate payment services into X's social media platform.

Apple Pay has developed the most advanced online payment system, with nearly eight hundred million global users. As part of a Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit, Apple stands accused of forcing users and developers to adopt its payment network.

Former CFPB lawyer Brian Shearer explains that under the GENIUS Act, Apple could launch its own stablecoin “payment card,” which would hold customers' deposits and give the tech giant even greater access to financial and transaction data on its users.

Meta has laid out perhaps the most elaborate plans for issuing its own currency. In 2019, company CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the launch of Meta's own crypto token known as Libra but pulled back because of blowback from global and US regulators. Federal regulators, including Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, warned that lax oversight on financial products like Libra could pose a risk to financial markets. For example, there's no deposit insurance coverage for payments held on tech platforms.

Meta's announcement of Libra drew scrutiny from the CFPB, which opened an inquiry into Big Tech payment networks. Following the probe, the agency issued rules in 2024 holding tech-based payment services to the same regulatory standards as other financial institutions and applying fraud, privacy, and other consumer-protection laws to stablecoins.

Shortly after the rules were announced, Zuckerberg complained about the CFPB's actions on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and Musk called for the agency to be shut down.

Now the latest version of the GENIUS Act could strip the CFPB's authority to enforce those rules. Without the CFPB's involvement, a patchwork of other, less robust financial regulators would be left to monitor these potentially harmful practices.

As the legislation makes its way through the Senate, reports have emerged that Mark Zuckerberg is once again considering a company stablecoin. One reason cited for the move would be to make it easier for Meta to pay content creators overseas without dealing with cumbersome international banking procedures.

If lawmakers pass the GENIUS Act and allow Meta's plans to move forward, the corporation could essentially become its own financial institution for an existing customer base of nearly four billion global users across its social media platforms.

“Big tech wants to open their own banks, which they can't do under existing bank regulations,” wrote Shearer on the financial policy site Open Banker. “We know this is a real threat because Meta has already tried it and failed once before.”

 A victim lost $2.6 million in stablecoins by falling for two zero-value transfer phishing scams within three hours, raising concerns over address poisoning tactics. 

A single victim was scammed two times within three hours, losing a total of $2.6 million in stablecoins.

According to data shared on May 26 by crypto compliance firm Cyvers, the victim sent 843,000 worth of USDt (USDT), followed by another 1.75 million USDt around three hours later. Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.

Zero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim's wallet to a spoofed address.

Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim's private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. Consequently, the victims will see the outgoing transaction in their history.

The victim may trust this address since it is included in their transaction history, mistaking it as a known or safe recipient. They may then send real funds to the attacker's address in a future transaction. 

In one high-profile case, a scammer using a zero-transfer phishing attack managed to steal $20 million worth of USDT before getting blacklisted by the stablecoin's issuer in the summer of 2023.

A zero-value transfer is considered an evolution of address poisoning, a tactic where attackers send small amounts of cryptocurrency from a wallet address that resembles a victim's real address, often with the same starting and ending characters. The goal is to trick the user into accidentally copying and reusing the attacker's address in future transactions, resulting in lost funds.

The technique exploits how users often rely on partial address matching or clipboard history when sending crypto. Custom addresses with similar starting and ending characters can also be combined with zero-value transfers.

A January 2025 study found that over 270 million poisoning attempts occurred on BNB Chain and Ethereum between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2024. Of those, 6,000 attempts were successful, leading to losses over $83 million.

The report followed crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy announcing an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning. The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases.

Between climate change, economic anxiety and political turmoil, the world can feel like a scary place, especially for kids. Today's young people have already been through a deadly global pandemic, they regularly drill to prepare for school shootings, and they must learn to navigate an age of misinformation and danger online. These stressors seem to be taking a toll; measurements show anxiety and sleep deprivation among adolescents are rising, and even teen suicide attempts are increasing.

To parents, the situation can feel overwhelming. The good news is, there's a lot parents can do to help their kids meet the challenges of the world we live in, writes parenting journalist (and frequent Scientific American contributor) Melinda Wenner Moyer. In her new book Hello, Cruel World! Science-Based Strategies for Raising Terrific Kids in Terrifying Times (Penguin Random House, May 2025) Moyer surveys scientific research on kids' mental health and ways to improve it.

Moyer divides her book into three sections focused on evidence-backed tips for helping young people cope with challenges, connect to others, and cultivate strong characters. Scientific American spoke to her about how to shield kids from online misinformation, nurture self-compassion and get your children to open up with you.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

The concept of the book, this “cruel world,” resonates so much with me as a parent, and I'm sure with so many people. Tell me a bit more about how you started feeling like the world is becoming a really tough place for kids.

I have had this growing anxiety and angst as a parent, just thinking about the world that my kids were coming into and that they were going to inherit from us. There are so many things looming, you know, climate change and disinformation. I was also getting so many comments from parents saying, “I'm just so scared on behalf of my kids, and I don't know what I can do to prepare them and help them get them ready for this world that we're going to hand them.” And I'm always trying to think of solutions and trying to figure out ways to reassure both myself and my readers. We do have some control here. And so I started researching, what are the key skills that we know can help kids get through all this? I was really trying to come up with concrete strategies that I could communicate to parents to help them feel a little less worried, a little more in control, and feel like they really could do something as parents, because I think parenting is a form of activism. We are raising the next generation of kids, and through our parenting, we can change the world.

In what specific ways do you think there are challenges that kids are facing today that previous generations haven't really had to face before?

We know from the research that there are a lot of tweens and teens who are struggling with mental health issues. Whether or not you think that the statistics are as bad as they seem, there seems to be a signal there that we should pay attention to. And so a big part of the book is about: How can we help kids cope? What are the things we can do to help them manage their emotions in healthy ways, rather than unhealthy ways?

Another big one is technology. Every generation panics about technology, and so the question is, well, how much different is our situation today than it was when the TV came out, or the printing press—these were all big changes at the time. But I think this is certainly the first generation where kids have a handheld connection to technology, potentially at all times. That does feel momentous.

One message in the book that really spoke to me was that helping our kids is also about helping ourselves—that we can't teach kids things like self-compassion, or balancing work and leisure, or all these other lessons, until we can embody them ourselves.

I do think a really overlooked aspect of child health and development is: How are the parents doing? What's their mental health like? What are the skills that they have or don't have? Because we are teaching our kids so much through the choices we make. You know, are we beating ourselves up when we burn dinner? Are we constantly putting ourselves down? Our kids are learning from that and thinking, okay, I should be doing this too. I think we do overlook the role of our own well-being. This is really important because our kids are watching us.

I want to be careful too: I'm not saying this to put more pressure on parents. We already have so many expectations of ourselves to ensure that our kids are succeeding at everything they do, that they're comfortable all the time, that they're protected all the time, that they're happy all the time. We have these expectations about what we should be doing as parents that are both unrealistic and unhelpful. When we overprotect, when we over-coddle, that actually undermines the development of key skills for them. Problem solving and resilience and emotional regulation, these are all skills that kids learn through practice. They need to be sad, they need to be disappointed and frustrated. They need to fail and experience what that is and understand that that's part of the process of learning. So a lot of what I'm trying to do is give parents permission to step back a little bit and to relax.

You write in the book a lot about connection—how a strong connection between parents and kids is important for their mental health and is protective against some of the things we worry about, such as bad influences from social media. How do you make sure your connection is strong?

If you're worried you're not connecting enough with your kids, then there are things you can do. I was really surprised at the power of listening to our kids—like really listening. I think we hear a lot about talking to your kids. And I think sometimes that can be misinterpreted as, lecture to your kids, you know, tell them not to do this and not to do that, and set rules and communicate the rules. But it's also really listening to them in a respectful way, and being willing to consider their perspective, which you may not always agree with.

And when they open up to you, drop everything. It's impossible sometimes, but when they are opening up to you, even if it's in a very inconvenient time, try to allow it and stop what you're doing. Kids often like to connect right before bedtime, which is the most frustrating time ever, right? But we should really allow the connection to happen on their terms, because that's a form of giving our kids some autonomy. If you're getting from your kids some willingness to be vulnerable with you, I think that that is a really good sign.

There's a relationship between feeling listened to and being willing to be self-reflective and also intellectually humble, which I think is really interesting. So when we feel heard, when we feel safe and not threatened, we're much more willing to consider what we don't know, and to acknowledge uncertainty within ourselves.

What can parents do if we're worried about the information, the bad actors, the scary, negative stuff that our kids are coming across online? What can we do to help them tell the difference between misinformation, lies and reality online?

There's very little media literacy education happening in schools. It really helps if the parent has some of those skills already, because then they can model media literacy and information literacy a little better for kids. So I encourage parents to try to learn about media literacy.

One thing that every media literacy expert said to me was to ask your kids open-ended questions about what they're seeing and hearing in the media. It's such a beautifully simple approach, but apparently it's very, very powerful. So this could be anything, like with little kids, asking: What do you like about this show? Or why do you think that character just did what they did? It could also involve talking about how movies and cartoons are made. And when kids get older, you can ask even bigger questions, like: Who made this? Why was it made? Why is it being presented this way? What or who is missing from this? Who might benefit from this? Who might be harmed by it? Getting kids to think about these big-picture questions about the media can be super helpful in fostering this sort of curiosity and this questioning perspective in kids.

These are some really wonderful tips, and I'm going to try to put them into practice. As a parent, I'm always reading and trying to learn how to be the best parent I can be. But sometimes I wonder how much it really matters what we do and how we parent. How much of who our kids are and who they're going to turn out to be, is completely out of our control anyway?

People still debate this. We know genetics, of course, really matter. We know that temperament and personality, these are not things that we're probably going to be able to shift in our kids. But we also do know that a lot of what we're passing on to our kids is through the relationships we build with them, through the conversations we're having with them to help them understand how the world works, to help them understand what they can do to build stronger relationships, how they can interact with people. They really do learn a lot from our modeling, in terms of how to behave, how to manage conflict, how to think about different situations. We know that there are a lot of skills that kids learn through observing others, through the conversations they have with others, through the opportunities they're given to develop skills.

A big example is resilience. We know that kids who are overprotected, prevented from failing, from experiencing challenges, that those are kids who are going to grow up not knowing how to problem solve and not knowing how to deal with feelings of frustration. They haven't been given opportunities to develop emotional regulation skills and they will really suffer for that when they get older. So I feel like we do have a lot of power in terms of the perspective that we help kids develop about the world, about why it looks the way it does. We can give them the opportunities at a young age to develop skills that will serve them the rest of their lives.

At least three universities in Hong Kong are inviting international students at Harvard University to join their institutions, following the United States administration's shock decision last week to ban the prestigious American institution from enrolling foreign students.

The University of Hong Kong (HKU) is offering international students at Harvard dedicated scholarships, accommodation assistance and guidance on transferring academic credit, according to a letter addressed to them, which was posted on X yesterday by Zhigang Suo, a materials engineer at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

“We recognise that recent developments in the US may have created significant uncertainties for many international students. HKU stands ready to welcome affected students at Harvard who wish to explore options and pathways for continuing their studies with us,” a spokesperson for the university told Nature.

Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has also invited current and prospective international undergraduates and postgraduates at Harvard and other US universities to transfer to HKUST, and at least one other Hong Kong-based university has offered similar support.

The US Department of Homeland Security, which terminated Harvard's ability to enroll and host international students on 22 May, said in a press release that the university had “created an unsafe campus environment by permitting anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators to harass and physically assault individuals, including many Jewish students.”

On Friday, Harvard sued the government, and a judge in the district of Massachusetts temporarily halted the government's policy.

Harvard hosts more than 7,000 international undergraduate and postgraduate students with visas. “Thousands of international students and scholars have done nothing wrong. It is extreme cruelty for the government to make innocent people collateral damage,” says Suo.

Harvard has become a target of the Trump administration in recent weeks. In April, the university declined to agree to the government's demands for greater oversight of its admissions and hiring practices in order to continue receiving federal money. The government has since cut billions of dollars' worth of federal funding in the form of close to 1,000 grants given to researchers at the university, according to an analysis by Nature.

Four former Volkswagen executives received prison sentences Monday for their role in the emissions-cheating scandal that fundamentally transformed Europe's car market. The verdict, delivered after a three-year trial in Braunschweig, Germany, marked the latest chapter in a 10-year-long saga that reshaped the continent's relationship with diesel technology.

Jens Hadler, who oversaw diesel engine development, received the harshest sentence of four and a half years for orchestrating what judges called “particularly serious” fraud. His team had installed software allowing vehicles to recognize emissions testing, temporarily increasing pollution controls during inspections while running dirty the rest of the time.

The scandal's impact extended far beyond corporate boardrooms. Before 2015, diesel vehicles commanded over half of Europe's car market, marketed as environmentally friendly alternatives to gasoline. Today, that figure has collapsed to just 10% of new car sales.

The whole affair also accelerated Europe's transition toward electrification. Electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids now account for 25% of new car sales, while Volkswagen itself has become Europe's leading EV manufacturer, selling three times as many battery-powered cars as Tesla in April, reports The New York Times.

The best documentation for Duolingo's decline is this article from a few years ago [0]. It's a piece by Duolingo's CPO (who was a former Zynga employee) where he discusses at length how Duolingo started using streaks and other gamification techniques to optimize their numbers. He has a lot to say about manipulating users into spending more time with them, but in the entire piece he barely even gives a token nod to the supposed mission of the company to help people learn. The date he cites for the beginning of their efforts to optimize numbers pretty closely correlates to my sense for when my wife began to complain about Duolingo feeling more and more manipulative and less and less useful.This past month they finally jumped the shark and she decided to quit after 6+ years. The subsequent announcement that they'd be using AI to churn out even more lackluster content gave us a good laugh but was hardly surprising: they'd given up on prioritizing learning a long while ago.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34977435

But it's just so horrible now, constant gamification, attempts to pull me in with streaks and freezes and notifications and ""did you know you can have us nag you even more""-breaks between the lessons I'm actually there for. It's gotten to the point where I'm just done because I've already paid for the service and i just want to be left alone to do the exercises, but they never let me get from one exercise to the next without having to go through at least two or three of those annoying ""gamification and engagement"" attempts.


reply



14! The damned popups lasted longer than the lesson had!I switched over to Busuu, which has blatantly copied some of Duolingo's mechanics but at least uses them with a modicum of restraint.

There's a valid argument to be made that gamification helps to provide that motivation, but the argument doesn't hold up if the users aren't actually becoming proficient by using the app.In other words, gamification isn't inherently bad, but their motivations don't appear to be good.

> if the users aren't actually becoming proficient by using the appLearning a language to fluency requires real commitment, and I'd say an app could never possibly do it on its own. One of the most key things Duolingo gave me was consistency and a lack of an excuse to constantly practice and learn. But you also have to (and I did) use the language daily, watch content in the target language, travel and speak with locals in the language, etc. I'm not sure where Duolingo ever claimed that it alone was enough to actually reach proficiency or fluency.Duolingo's gamification and streaks and leaderboards gave me a reason to put a lot of effort into learning the language, and I don't know where I'd be without it. There's a lot of things about Duolingo I don't love but I'm incredibly grateful that it exists.

That's changed gradually over the last few years as they switched from using gamification in pursuit of learning to using a veneer of learning as a pitch to get people to try their game.


reply



On top of this, some people say motivation is cheap, discipline is what matters.


reply



Discipline is well and good, and if you're willing to put in the effort to become better disciplined to push through difficult things, I agree that you're probably better off. I do not agree that someone who already has that level of discipline would be hurt by a gamified system, though. The rewards of gamification on their own are fairly minimal, as they merely provide a (possibly false) sense of progress independent of their own assessment of how they are doing.

Instead of sticking with language learning because you have some intrinsic reason to want to learn it (or even a external one such as wanting a new job) you're substituting that with whatever Duolingo puts for their gamification. To the degree you engage with and are motivated by the gamification you are substituting your own metrics of success and progress for points and streaks.And soon enough we end up here, where Duolingo has gamified their internal numbers and in doing so gamified your ""learning"".

But consent is key. Maybe we need regulation that compels companies to disclose these manipulative techniques in digital services. Give people the chance to opt in or out.

Kids having fun playing hide and seek? Wrestling and throwing stones? They are learning hunting/survival skills.Today with more abstract knowledge needed it is harder, but the concept of making abstract learning a game again, is a very smart one in general. It of course fails, if engagement becomes the metric and not gaining knowledge.

By now my friends who use Duolingo all know it's a game, not a real learning experience. I think they got lucky and filled a void in the market for things people think they want (learning a new language) while avoiding the parts they dislike (the effort of learning).It got recommended by default for years when people asked for an easy way to learn a language, but they leaned hard into the path of gamification instead of trying to improve the learning experience for those who wanted to learn.

To be a bit cynical about it: the typical DuoLingo player has probably been misled to some extent about its effectiveness, yes, but also many of them don't particularly want to learn a new language. I suspect that they're happy to be able to play a popular mobile game that everyone else is also playing without the stigma of being a ""Candy Crush addict"" and ""timewaster"". ""I'm learning a language!"" is the welcome figleaf. https://youtu.be/F3SzNuEGmwQ?t=243

Unfortunately as they got popular automated translation services got good enough that nobody was going to pay for a slightly better and slower translation enmass.Once that happened, that's when it seemed like they dumped their goals of teaching language and instead focused on dark pattern money extraction.

Still, 3 minutes per day is just about my tempo. I don't care about literally anything in there except the learning part and consistently doing only one lesson per day makes them very nice and polite most of the time - I feel like I'm in the 'beg-these-for-money' instead of 'milk-them-dry' cohort. (Or maybe I'm in the permanent 'lets-be-nice-for-them' long running experiment?)

I switched a while ago to Seedlang (https://www.seedlang.com/), and while it only supports French, German, and Spanish, I can at least say that the German course is everything I actually wanted from Duolingo.Every exercise involves a real video of a real German speaker speaking in German. You get to hear them at the same time as you see their face, which is not something you'd think is a big deal, but absolutely does make a big difference.When it's your turn to say a phrase, it records your voice and plays it back to you, rather than use some shitty model to try and guess if you spoke correctly. By listening to your own voice you can clearly hear when you're getting things right versus when you're getting things wrong. Early on, German speakers would often comment on how my accent was quite good for my level, and I think this is big part of that.IMO Duolingo's attempt to try and scale to every language as fast as possible just makes it a worse product than something 'artisanal' like Seedlang (though of course, if there's no artisanal resources, then Duolingo might have some value to offer)

I don't see how one can learn German fluently using Duolingo (or even Memrise, which I think is much better). It's great for vocabulary, but I think understanding the grammar requires understanding the theory which I didn't see when I used these applications.

For beginners to German these days, I heartily recommend the free “Nicos Weg” course from DW that goes up to B1 at least. Also has, unusually for language classes, a cast of likeable characters played by reasonably good actors carrying a consistent, building storyline throughout the lessons.

... only for me to get to Germany and realise very early on that I would need to do a basic A1 language course.The app was gibberish; the pronunciations were wrong, the genders were misleading, and the daily interactions they tried to drill were far from useful.

odd take, do you have the same negative sentiment for the entire field of language instruction?  introductory German class at a local college?  7th grade French ?  things like that?


reply



The same thing that has worked for me as a method for learning languages has always been the same. Get books, particularly short stories or children's stories aimed at A2/B1 level, and read them. Practice grammar. Get a pen and paper and learn vocab by repeatedly writing it down. Boring but effective. And of course practice listening and talking, which means either having native friends, doing a course, using audio materials from somewhere, etc. Courses with actual humans make learning go faster (in the case of Romansh, it would have been impossible without the course).I don't find duolingo to be effective at all, as others mention beyond the A1/A2 level. I'd be a bit more skeptical and say even A2 you need to expand your horizons.

If you read the article you'll see how the CEO wrote a memo about how productivity expectations will rise and started cutting contractors in favor of AI.To suggest that this CEO was afraid of reducing morale by asking employees to put fewer pop-ups in the app is completely backward.I don't understand why you're so intent on defending this particular CEO as trying to maintain morale when we're quite literally in a comment section for an article where the CEO made a drastic anti-employee move that everyone could have seen was a morale destroyer.It's also hard to imagine a situation where the people making the app really, really want to pollute it with pop-ups and other junk, and they have to band together to resist the CEO's efforts to make a good app, and then on top of all that the CEO rolls over and lets them do it despite wishing they wouldn't.The simplest explanation is that the employees are building the app and setting direction as mandated by executives. The app we see is the result of what executives are rewarding and asking for.

The ideal AI-powered tutor would work more closely to a private language tutor. It would speak with you and gradually integrating language concepts into the conversation. When you make mistakes, it could correct you on the spot and keep track of where your strengths and weaknesses are.

When I was working as language teacher, I was tasked specifically with teaching speaking. I would often use information gap activities. These are activities where two or more parties have pieces of information but need to obtain pieces from others in order to complete the task. Sometimes, these would us language forms (re: sentence structures), but most of the time they were free flow activities. It didn't matter how ""correct"" the language was so long as the idea was communicated.To think about it another, how often do we make mistakes when speaking? Writing? And yet, we still managed to communicate just fine.That's not to say there shouldn't be any focus on form, but simply that it's not nearly as important as many tend to think when it comes to language learning.

Then again, the only languages I actually learned - besides my mother tongue - to the point of being able to do things were English and Latin and both were very much acquired offline. I have plenty of experience with language learning apps and I'm not convinced tech is the solution or even part of the solution.

After 4 weeks I also learned Spanish enough to maintain casual conversations just from trying to talk to someone online who did not speak English. I am rusty now, however, because I do not speak it with anyone, nor do I see or hear Spanish anywhere. Spanish is way easier, IMO, in comparison to Polish.Thoughts?

I've used Duolingo in the past (and other apps) and quickly lost interest, it's a fun app, but I feel like you don't learn from it. If I had to learn a new language today, I'm confident I could make good progress with GPT or Gemini, but tailoring it to how I learn.


reply



  > If an LLM can teach me a language, why wouldn't I go straight to the source and use GPT or Claude and customize it to my exact needs.

Because the ""customize it"" part is not trivial. That is the value add for most people who can not do that customisation themselves.That said, I've found LLMs to be terrific if the goal is to learn the rules of language's grammar. But to actually learn to speak the language, find HelloTalk to be best, beaten by nothing other than actually sitting down with a native speaker.

Software freedom has never been about money, and always been about preserving public access to a software commons. You might believe your local bookstore is a better source of knowledge than your local library, but that's only because you don't really know what you're missing.

If you hate ads, deception, and dark patterns as much as I do, then most software has a negative value. But I'll only pay for it if the value exceeds the price. That means there's a rather large (and probably growing) share of the software market that I'll just never pay even a penny for, because in my opinion, it has negative value. But it's not because I don't want to spend the money. It's because I want those companies that are peddling ad-laden bloatware to be a financial failure so that the market will intervene and offer better alternatives.

Part of my PhD thesis[1] was to study how robots (voice agents) can influence human language. The key component is a social connection. Back in 2017 I did that in the lab. But the research is pretty clear about it.Also my own experience (trying to learn Arabic) is, that I only remember words/phrases which I picked up during social gathering (camping in the dessert).The ""perfect"" learning app would work like how children learn: by interacting with their social surroundings. No need to learn the vocabulary or the alphabet at the beginning. 
The hard part is, to create a social interaction between the learner and the AI that evolves over time.[1] https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/items/7da0e989-aa9f-4b92-86bd-92...

So the AI furore is a bit ironic: people profess to hate ""bullshit jobs"", but if anything is a bullshit job it's probably providing the manpower for a language-learning app which doesn't actually teach languages effectively. Replacing mechanical-Turk slop with AI slop probably is a genuine productivity gain unleashed by AI here, yes? OTOH a drop in subscriber numbers and total user-hours is probably a good thing too, so don't let any of this put you off from giving up on DuoLingo.

Duolingo is, in my mind, the categorical example of a tech company. Think about what it means to say ""we're an AI first company"". Who is the audience of a statement like that? Who reads that and thinks ""heck yeah""? Its not customers; customers, at best, don't care, but at worst have had so many negative experiences with AI that it reflects very poorly. Its not employees; Luis von Ahn is digging a grave while saying ""no we're not going to kill you, we're just killing the contractors"". The answer is: Its a statement for Duolingo's real customers, not their users, but the US Financial Markets.

The app is absolutely gamified, but I've never paid them a dollar, waste about 1.5 minutes a day ignoring ads, and in exchange for nothing I get moderately useful foreign language learning. The gamification keeps me at it, where past study approaches eventually petered out.The use of AI in this and other tools is inevitable. The CEO certainly oversold it in his initial announcement, but the weird reaction of people stopping using the app because Due Lingo is going ""AI first"" seems inconsistent. Are people going to stop using Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia because they're all-in on AI too?

And the long wait for season three begins. Sunday, HBO aired the season two finale of The Last of Us, and it was a lot. Lots to digest for people who are watching this show on their own, and probably even more for people who are watching as fans of the game. Before our larger recap on Monday, we wanted to give you a chance to talk about your feelings, and we even got showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann involved. Spoilers follow.



Season two of The Last of Us ended very much like the midway (ish) point of The Last of Us Part II. After finding and killing two more of Abby's friends—Mel and Owen—Ellie's Seattle journey feels like it might be coming to an end. Especially because Mel was pregnant. That was not Ellie's intention. And so she, Tommy, Dina, and Jesse regroup and decide it's time to head back to Jackson, even though Abby is still out there.

Just then, Abby arrives. She kills Jesse and threatens to kill the rest. It's a tense moment that we don't see the end of. That's because the show cuts to black and flashes back two days. Abby wakes up at a major WLF base and we know that, next season, we're going to see what she has been doing all this time.

So, how did that make you feel? Did you like the decision? Did you even get it? At a press conference last week, showrunner Craig Mazin chimed in about how he hopes the audience feels as season two comes to a close.

“What I want the audience to feel thematically at the end of the season is that [the characters] aren't where they were, but they're not yet where they are going to go,” Mazin said. “That there has always been a story that we've been telling about the good and bad of love, but we switch which side is good and bad sometimes. Because sometimes we do need somebody to punish someone for us. Sometimes we do need somebody to protect us. Sometimes violence must be done to save the innocent. These are difficult moments. But of course, then there are times where sacrifice is called for. Where putting other people first is called for. Where creation does more than destruction.”

“And we are, especially with the porch scene prior to the last episode, and the way we now understand that there is this idea that maybe you could do a little bit better than me, we understand that both Ellie and Abby are moving forward in trouble,” Mazin continues. “They are in moral trouble because their certainty is beginning to fail them. And we can see it here with Ellie, for sure, because faced with the consequences of the thing she's done and people that didn't deserve to die dying, she's starting to feel maybe a swing of the pendulum. And we don't know where these two are going to end. But what I would hope the audience feels is that they are not done. They're not done growing or they are not done falling. We'll have to wait and see which it is.”

“The question that we're asking and the thing we're interrogating in this story is: when you've committed such horrible things, depending on your circumstance, can you ever come back from that?” Neil Druckmann added. “And we see in that porch scene, Joel is trying to come back from what he's done even though he doesn't regret it. And now we have these two characters that are on this downward spiral, trying to do justice for the people that they love and we'll see how far that goes.”

Do you agree with Mazin and Druckmann here? Talk about that, or whatever else you want to talk about, below. Then check back Monday for not just our final breakdown/recap, but more from the showrunners on the ending of the season.

Whether you're heading out on a weekend hike, setting up camp by the lake, or just need a reliable speaker to bring tunes to your backyard, having a compact yet capable Bluetooth speaker on hand can really elevate the moment. But with so many options out there, finding something that's both affordable and actually sounds good is easier said than done.

You can get the Sony SRS-XB100 Wireless Bluetooth Portable Speaker for just $38 at Amazon right now, down from its usual price of $60. That's $22 off and a discount of 37%. And for a speaker like this, snagging it for less than $50 is a good reason to go ahead and pull that trigger. You never know when you might want some extra-loud sound somewhere.

See at Amazon

With an IP67 rating, it's fully waterproof and dustproof, so it can handle everything from a dusty trail to an accidental dunk in the pool. And while it might be small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, it doesn't skimp on sound. The SRS-XB100 uses a full-range driver paired with a passive radiator to deliver balanced audio that's surprisingly loud and punchy for its size.

Sony also added its Sound Diffusion Processor, which helps spread sound more evenly across an area—perfect for outdoor spaces where sound tends to get lost. If you happen to have two of these speakers, you can hook them up together for bigger sound that can fill a larger area.

Battery life is solid too. You get about 16 hours of playback without having to charge it up again. Worried about having somewhere to charge it? It uses USB-C and includes a detachable strap so you can clip it to your bag or hang it up wherever you are.

You really can't beat this speaker for less than $50. It's just $38, and it's the perfect pick for travel, casual listening, or just tossing into your bag so you've always got music on hand when the moment calls for it. It's low-profile, comes in multiple colors, and it's easy to use. There's really no excuse not to jump on this deal while you still can.

The world doesn't move in smooth, perfectly lit shots. It's messy, fast, and full of moments worth capturing. The GoPro Hero 13 Black in Limited Edition understands this better than any camera before it, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in action photography while making professional-quality content creation more accessible than ever.

In fact, now's a better time than ever to grab your own. Right now, Amazon has made this professional-grade camera more accessible by dropping the price from $430 to $307 – a significant 29% discount that saves you $123. That's right, $123 off the camera you can take anywhere and do anything with, whether that's hiking, swimming, or even hitting the ski slopes. It's a fantastic deal that you won't want to miss out on, even if you're just going to record yourself walking.

See at Amazon

This camera is powered by is GoPro's most advanced imaging system yet, capable of shooting stunning 5.3K video at 60 frames per second. But what makes the Hero 13 truly revolutionary is its compatibility with the new HB-Series lenses. Whether you're chasing the perfect POV shot, capturing cinematic motion blur, or shooting up close with enhanced focus capabilities, they really help to expand the possibilities of what you can create.

Plus, this model's more powerful Enduro battery extends recording time in any weather condition, while HyperSmooth 6.0 stabilization turns shaky footage into butter-smooth professional shots. The updated mounting system offers more flexibility than any previous GoPro too, so you always get the perfect angle.

Automatic highlight videos take the work out of editing, while cloud auto-upload ensures your footage is safely backed up. It's professional-grade technology that doesn't require a professional degree to operate. So it's really a good gift idea for just about anyone, especially if you're already thinking ahead to next year. We can't believe it either, but 2025 is right around the corner!

At its lowest price, this isn't just another action camera. It's an investment in capturing your most exciting moments. Whether you're an aspiring content creator, adventure enthusiast, or someone who simply refuses to let memorable moments slip by uncaptured, this 29% discount makes the Hero 13 Black a great deal. Because when the perfect moment arrives, you want the perfect tool to capture it. Just don't miss out on this price, because there's no telling how long it will stick around.

Following Nvidia's keynote at Computex 2025, Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, sat down with journalists to talk about all of Team Green's latest announcements, including talk of GB200, and international market opportunities.

In response to one question, Huang talked about export controls which were first imposed by the Biden administration saying that the limitations had caused Nvidia's China Market share to be cut from 95 to 50 percent within in the presidency and hadn't accomplished what they set out to do. He also posited that the restrictions did not prevent China from developing its own, competing technologies.

Huang also talked about the massive write-downs his company had to take because of bans on the H20, saying ""export controls resulted in us writing off multiple billions of dollars. Then, write off the inventory. The write-off of H20 is as big as many semiconductor companies.""

He later praised the Trump administration for ending Biden's AI diffusion rule, saying ""I think it's really a great reversal of a wrong policy.""

This was a roundtable talk with several other journalists from other publications, but this is not a complete transcription of the entire Q&A. However, we've transcribed all of the questions we did manage to hear, some elements lightly edited for flow and clarity. Some speakers did not have clear audio while speaking, and we have noted as such on the transcript.

Ahead of reading this Q&A, you should familiarize yourself with what Huang announced at Nvidia during his Computex 2025 keynote, we've popped it down below, just so you can get a refresher.

Jensen Huang: Good Morning, very nice to see all of you. Did you guys see all of this? Isn't this just incredible?

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

So, this is the motherboard of a new server [Presumably the GB200 NVL72, or RTX Pro machine], and this server has many GPUs that are connected. The GPU's are connected on the bottom, or on top. And on the bottom are switches that connect all the GPUs together, and these switches also connect this computer to all the other computers, using CX8 networking (Nvidia ConnectX-8), 800 gigabits per-second, and then the transceivers plug in right there... Plug this into that, now you have an enterprise AI supercomputer. Because this system is air cooled, it's very easy for enterprise [users] to buy. It's available from all over the world's enterprise IT OEMs. Every single company will be offering this, and you can use this for everything.

It runs x86, so all of your software that you run with your enterprise IT works today. You can run Redmap, VMWare, Nutanix, so all of the orchestration and operating system works just fine.

And, you can run computer graphics, you can run AI, you can run agents. This is incredible. This one idea that the GPU... they didn't give us a GPU [To showcase], but you know what one looks like, it's the gold one, and that makes it a new server.

So, this is the RTX Pro Enterprise AI server, and this is a huge, huge announcement, and it opens up the enterprise market. As you know today, all of the AI isn't involved, but OEMs would like to serve the enterprises, companies would like to build it for themselves.

And so anyway, that's a very big announcement. So Cloud AI over here and GB200, that's our enterprise AI system.

Right, whose got the first question? Good morning.

Elaine Huang, Commonwealth Magazine: Just like what you mentioned, that enterprise is a very important market, and everybody talks about not just AI servers, but AI PCs. So what are the potential opportunities that Taiwan has to co-work with Nvidia for upcoming features?

Jensen Huang: Last night, Microsoft announced Windows ML, Windows Machine Learning. Machine Learning is AI, so Windows AI. And, they announced it on Nvidia. So now Windows ML, which is a new API [that] runs AI inside Windows, runs on Nvidia.

And, the reason for that is Nvidia's RTX has CUDA and Tensor cores, everyone one of them, exactly the same. We have several hundred million RTX PCs in the world. RTX equals AI, and now Windows ML runs on RTX. Everyone with RTX? They know. Hundreds of millions of gamers and PC users, workstation users, everybody. Laptop, desktop... Bingo! Home run, job done [laughs], Windows ML.

If you're a developer, and you would like your own AI supercomputer so that you don't have to keep going to the cloud, open the cloud, and when you're done, you know, shut down your session, because if you don't shut it down, the bill keeps running. And so maybe you're doing development, there's a lot of idle time. And so, you would not like to do that on the cloud, you would like to do it on your desk.

So, if you have a Mac? No problem. If you have a Chromebook? No problem. If you have Linux? No problem. If you have Windows? No problem. We have a perfect little device for you.

[We want] To give you this little AI supercomputer [Presumably DGX Spark], that sits next to you. You can connect it with networking, or you can connect them with Wi-Fi. You talk to this like you like you talk to the cloud, and the software is exactly the same.

So, if you are a developer, software programmer, AI creator, this product is perfect for you. The perfect developer companion.

And if you'd like a bigger one, this is essentially a computer for the AI natives [DGX Station], anybody who's getting completely AI applications, and you would like a bigger one than this one [DGX Spark], this is an AI workstation [Referring to DGX Station].

And this goes into a desktop, a normal desktop, and you can access it, you can remote, you can use it like the cloud, but it's yours, and you can walk away and go enjoy a coffee and don't feel bad.



Question 2 (Unclear speaker and outlet): I'm curious to know, over the last five to ten years, you've had a lot of great new products. The array of products and services you have now is quite extensive. I'm really curious to know what you had in the pipeline. Did you kill anything before it entered production? Like, you had a project, it had momentum and at some point you had to get down to business... [unintelligible speech], I'm really curious about the products that never saw the light of day. Can you share anything with us about that?

Jensen Huang: I would say it's very rare that we would completely kill a project. It's very likely that we shape it, shape it and reshape it. And, the reason for that is because the direction needs to be right. Like, for example, the initial early days of Omniverse, we had to rebuild it a couple of times, and the reason for that is because in the beginning, of Omniverse, our vision was right. That we needed to create a virtual world of digital systems, and robotic systems, and AI systems.

The vision was right. But, the way we architected the software was odd. It was kind of based on the old days of enterprise and workstation applications. And so, it wasn't scalable.

[Jensen pauses to ask for a bottle of water and proceeds to choke] I do that too, you know, I say something surprising, I'm talking, and then I'm drinking and swallowing all at the same time. I say something surprising to myself, and then I choke on water.

So, in the beginning, we built Omniverse as single instance software with multiple GPUs, and that was the wrong answer. Omniverse should have been created as a disaggregated system. It should run across multiple systems, multiple operating systems and multiple computers with multiple GPUs each. Which is the reason why we built this machine. In fact, this computer RTX Pro, it's called RTX Pro for a good reason.

It's essentially an Omniverse generative AI system, and notice this is one computer, eight GPUs, and you can connect them with more computers. Omniverse will run across this whole thing. This is the perfect Omniverse computer, the perfect robotics computer, the perfect digital twin computer.

We started working on Omniverse, how many years ago now? Let's see... Six years, seven years ago, finally it's come to connecting everything together. So notice that all the pivots that were made along the way, all of the mistakes that were made, and so on and so forth, we just keep investing.



Eric, Publication Unclear: Just a quick question about DGX Spark, and what you said with simple production, delivery is going to happen in a couple of weeks. I wonder if you can give any additional color about what you feel about the opportunity and compliance. You know, no pun intended, but is the window closing for an additional player to get into ARM-based computing?

Jensen Huang: So first of all, it's just delightful to look at. You know, it's nice to have a computer that's beautiful. The reason why we need this computer is because we need a coherent, productive AI development environment, and AI has models that are fairly large. Its environment really wants to be fully accelerated with excellent Python software and AI stacks.

If I look around this room right now, I don't actually see a computer that would be perfect for AI development. Most of the computers don't have that memory, or they don't have Tensor cores, because maybe it's a Mac, or maybe it's a Chromebook, or maybe it's an older version of a PC, or an older version of a desktop.

And so we took a state-of-the-art AI system, and we put it in a remote Wi-Fi environment that connects to everybody's computer. Now there's some 30 million software developers in the world, there will probably be just as many who are now going to be AI developers.

And so everybody has the benefit of having, essentially an AI supercomputer, an AI cloud, but not being burdened with the anxiety of your cloud computing that's ticking away. And so this is something you can buy, the ROI is probably, call it six months.

And for most of all, of course, this, we have really great volume, and it's available from everybody. So they'll be available from Asus, they can sell it alongside their laptops. It's available from MSI, and not to mention all the enterprise OEMs.

Every single developer can go out and just get one, and just put it next to their desk. You can develop on here, and you want to now scale it out, or test it out on large data sets, it's just like one pull down menu, point it at a cloud. Exactly the same thing runs there. And so, this is really an ideal AI developer environment.



Victoria Jen, CNA: Given the trade tensions and also the talk of de-globalization. How is Nvidia thinking about its global supply chain strategy, and where does Taiwan fit in that picture?

Jensen Huang: First of all, Taiwan is going to continue to grow, and the reason for that is we're at the beginning of a breed of a new industry. This new industry builds AI factories. The world is going to have AI infrastructure all over. AI infrastructure will cover the planet, just as internet infrastructure has covered the planet. Eventually, AI infrastructure will be everywhere.

We are several hundred billion dollars into a tens of trillions of dollars AI infrastructure buildout that will take five decades.

I've been looking around Taiwan. There are cranes everywhere. There's buildings everywhere. Factories are being built everywhere. And the reason for that is because we're all racing to build infrastructure for AI, manufacturing for AI.

Well, simultaneously, the world needs to be needs to have more manufacturing resilience and diversification, and some of that will be distributed around the world.

In the United States, we're going to do some manufacturing. It is impossible to do all manufacturing, all on-shore, and it's also unnecessary. But, we should do as much as we can that is important for national security, while having resilience, with redundancy, all around the world.

And so this rebalancing is happening at actually, a very good time. It's happening at a very good time because the world is building AI infrastructure. We're adding new infrastructure for the very first time. So we need a lot of new plants anyway.

The most important thing is we have to provide energy for these new plants. Communities realize that we want to grow. We want to have economic prosperity. We want to have economic security. In order for that to happen, industrialization; AI factories, need energy. And so the support of governments to provide for energy of all kinds while we pursue new technologies, whether it's hydrogen or nuclear, solar or wind, whatever new technology that that is most available at the time, we're going to need it all.

And so, government officials around the world really need to support all of the companies, so that we can re-industrialize and reset our industry, so that we can grow into AI infrastructure.



Question 5 (Unclear speaker and outlet): My question is about NVLink Fusion, what's your strategy?

Jensen Huang: NVLink Fusion allows every data center to take advantage of this incredible invention we call NVLink, now in it's fifth generation. We've been working on NVLink now for... How many years? 12 years?

Also, NVLink and Spectrum X NVLink, and quantum- our networking, is highly integrated and highly optimized together. And, that's one of the reasons why the performance of the AI data center, the AI factory, is so good.

When the factory cost $10 billion and our efficiency is 90%, and someone else's efficiency is 60%...30% of $10 billion is $3 billion. So, network efficiency is very important. Performance is very important. Efficiency is very important. Energy is very important...All because the network efficiency is so good.

And so we have many customers, many people who are developing their semi-custom AI infrastructure. They came to us and asked: ""Can we can we use NVLink?""

Because, of course, there's a there's a industry discussion about UALink. UALink is not doing that well, I don't think. And so, the customers have come to us and asked whether NVLink could be authenticated. And I said, of course, we're happy to.

The benefit to us, is that the Nvidia network, the Nvidia the fabric, is really the operating system of the data center. It's the nervous system of the data center. And so, we can extend Nvidia's nervous system into every data center, whether it's Nvidia's technology, or if you're selling custom technology.

So we can expand our our market opportunity. It is also so good for us, it's good for the ASIC companies, Mediatek, Alchip, Marvell, right?

It's good for them, because now they have a complete solution. They can have HBM [High Bandwidth Memory], they have [speech unclear], and now they also have NVLink and networking. So now they have a complete solution partner. For the customer, of course, the most important part is that the architecture of NVLink is integrated with the [server and data center] rack system.

The rack system is so complicated. The spine is so complicated. And since they are already using GB200, they're already using Nvidia's racks. Now, they can scale, continue to use Nvidia racks, or even semi-custom. So one architecture, one hardware architecture, one NVLink architecture, one networking architecture, sometimes it's three CPUs, sometimes it's Fujitsu CPUs, sometimes Qualcomm CPUs, it's very nice for the customer.

Are we open to working with Broadcom? Of course, we are, of course we are. Currently, they have their own plan. But if they need, if they would like, to use NVLink [we're] very open.

We love working with Broadcom. We work with Broadcom in many places, export control. So, as you know, export control has caused us to write off our H20s. Our H20 is now banned in China. Banned to ship in China, and export controls resulted in us writing off multiple billions of dollars. Then, write off the inventory. The write-off of H20 is as big as many semiconductor companies.

If you look at look at most chip companies, their quarterly revenue is only a few billion dollars. We wrote off, you know, multiple billion dollars of inventory. And so the cost to us is very high, and also the sales to us was quite high.

The fact of the matter is, the China market is very important. It's very important for several reasons. The first reason is that China is where 50% of the world's AI researchers are. And we want the AI researchers to build on Nvidia. DeepSeek was built on Nvidia. That's a gift to us. It's a gift to the world.

Now, DeepSeek runs incredibly well everywhere. [Audio unclear, Huang mentions R1 or similar.] is an excellent, excellent AI model. It's a gift to the world. It's open source. And so, the China market is important, because the AI researchers there are so good, and they're going to build amazing AI no matter what. We would like them to build on Nvidia's technology.

Second, the China market is quite large. As you know, it's the second largest computer market. There's no others like it. And so the China market, my guess is that next year, the whole dang market is probably [worth] $50 billion. $50 billion dollars! You know how large many chip companies are? Much less than $50 billion.

So, the $50 billion market opportunity to Nvidia is quite significant, and it would be a shame not to be able to enjoy that opportunity, to bring home tax revenues to the United States, create jobs...sustain the industry.

Okay, so, all of that... [Jensen gets distracted and looks at the person who asked the question] You asked me a question, you're not even paying attention.

[The duo converses in Mandarin, and Huang responds] Am I upset at the policy? [Regarding export controls to China] I'm not upset at the policy. I think the policy is wrong, and the reason for that is because, let's look at the evidence.

Four years ago, at the beginning of the Biden administration, Nvidia's market share in China was nearly 95%. Today, it is only 50%. The rest of it is China's technology, and not to mention we have to sell lower chip specifications. So, our ASP [Average selling price] is also lower. So we left a lot of revenue, and nothing changed.

AI researchers are still doing AI research in China. They have a lot of mobile technology they would use if they don't have Nvidia, if they don't have enough Nvidia, they will use their own! They'll use the second best. Then lastly, of course, the local companies are very, very talented and very determined, and the export controls gave them the spirit, the energy, and the government support, to accelerate their development. And so I think, all in all, the export control was a failure, the facts would suggest it.



Question 6 (Unclear speaker and outlet): So I have a quick question about AI factories. I mean, AI factories and depracaction. So the equipment inside is a data center or AI server, right? So if we talk about the factories, we have to talk about depreciation, and equipment upgrades. So, what do you expect to see? And then you have this one-year-rhythm theory, which means the systems will be upgraded every year.

So, what's your expectation on the lifetime of equipment in data center AI factories. How frequently will their systems need to be upgraded?

Jensen Huang: There are two pieces of information that are very important. The first is the reason why we upgrade every year. It's because in a factory, performance equals cost, and performance equals revenues.

If your factory is limited by power, and our performance per watt is four times better, then the revenues of this data center increase by four times. So, if we introduce new generation, the customer's revenues can grow, and their costs can come down.

We upgrade every year. So we tell our customers, don't buy everything every year. Buy something every year. This way, they don't over-build and over-invest with old technology. But the benefit that we have, is that Nvidia architecture is compatible in all of the factories. And so, we can upgrade the software for a very long time.

The second fact, Hopper in the [beginning] of it's life, Llama-70B, in the beginning, was 1/4 the performance on the same Hopper [system] four years later. So, we keep improving the performance using CUDA software, which is the benefit of CUDA. And if we optimize the software, and improve the performance of the model, it helps the whole factory. Every single every single factory. Every single computer.

Nvidia's CUDA is very valuable here, Nvidia's once-a-year rhythm is very valuable, and so you have to use both of them together. With that, your overall data center fleet revenues will go up, your overall data center costs will come down.

And then one last idea. As you know, Nvidia CUDA runs everything. Every model, every new innovation, because the Nvidia CUDA install base is so high. If you are a software developer, of course you would do Nvidia CUDA first.

You have the best performance, the best technology, you also have the largest install base, and software developers want the largest install base, so that they can touch and reach everyone. Isn't that right? And so these three ideas, once a year, performance up, costs down. Once a year, all the time, a software upgrade with CUDA. And then lastly, our install base is so high everything runs, so the life of your data center will be quite long.



Max Cherney, Reuters: Since you were just talking about China, it brings me to something that I think is been an interesting question. Over the past 10 days, you've gone on a world tour. Made pit stops in the Middle East and elsewhere. And what I'm wondering is you've also made a flurry of announcements. Very technical stuff here at Computex, you know.

What I'm wondering is if you could put some of the technical announcements you've made, such as NVLink Fusion, the laptop platform, and some of the other more detailed, nerdy things in the context of how you're planning to continue to sustain Nvidia's growth over the next few years. I think that's especially relevant, with some of the fears investors have at the moment about a pullback in AI spending, especially after DeepSeek.

Jensen Huang: That last little part is really important. Remember what DeepSeek did. DeepSeek was incredible for AI infrastructure.

The old AI is called one shot [A stateless model like GPT-2 and GPT-3] . You hit enter, and the AI gives you an answer. One shot. The only way to give you a one shot answer is not to think. No thinking. You, [the AI model] already know it. You've kind of memorized it from pre-training. But DeepSeek is a reasoning model. It has to think.

It has to think, and you want to think fast, because if you don't think fast, the answer will take too long to come. And so DeepSeek opened the reasoning model, the world's first open source, excellent reasoning model.

Developers all over the world are using it, because it's so good. Now, the reasoning model is not one shot [stateless model], but it's hundreds of shots. It even goes to the internet to read websites, and read PDFs. So, it has to read, think, reason, plan, read some more.

So, that's the reason why deep research... You see that the latest versions of queries are taking much longer. The reason why it takes much longer is using a lot more compute [power]. And so, in fact, DeepSeek increased the amount of computing needed by maybe 100 to 1000 times.

That's the reason why all over the world, the AI companies are saying the GPUs are melting down, right? Sam [Altman], says our GPUs are melting because they're working too hard. They need more GPUs, more GPUs.

And last night, Microsoft announced that they were the first to online GB200, that OpenAI is already using GB200, and that they're planning to build out this year, hundreds of thousands of GB200 [systems]. More build out this year than all of Microsoft's data centers combined, only three years ago.

That's how much [OpenAI plans to build out], in just one year. And so the build out, the ramp of AI infrastructure, to me, is actually just beginning. This is now the beginning of the reasoning AI era, and reasoning AI is so useful, and it's so useful in so many different applications.

Second, AI infrastructure is being built out. That's one of the reasons why I'm traveling around the world. Every region realizes they need to build their own AI infrastructure. AI infrastructure is going to be part of society, part of the industry. Just like electricity, just like the internet, AI is going to be an essential part of infrastructure, social infrastructure, as well as industrial infrastructure.

When I was in the Middle East, President Trump announced that this is the reversal of what was the previous AI diffusion rule, the new diffusion rule, for this administration, they realized the goal. The goal of the AI diffusion rule has specified in the past, was to limit AI diffusion.

President Trump realizes it's exactly the wrong goal. The United States, and America, is not the only provider of AI technology. If the United States wants to stay in the lead, and if the United States would like the rest of the world to build on American technology, we need to maximize AI diffusion, maximize the speed. And that's where we are today.

I think it's really a great reversal of a wrong policy, frankly. And this [the new AI diffusion rules] is a great reversal of that, and it's just in time.



Question 8 (Unclear speaker and outlet): We started with CPUs, and then to right now with GPUs. So still, both are important for our industry. So, what is the future?

[This question is quite unclear, but the general gist of it is that the speaker asks Jensen about the future of the hardware and software industries in the wake of AI factories and data centers.]

Jensen Huang: Good question. Fluid Dynamics is not going to go away. Particle Physics is not going to go away. Finite elements not going to go away. Computer graphics is not going to go away. These algorithms are so good, and they've been refined over so many years.

Not to mention trillions of dollars of software already written, no reason to rewrite it. And so flexible software, flexible hardware is always valuable. That's the reason why CPU has been so successful for 60 years.

Now, Nvidia has created something and you have been following CUDA for two decades now, and you understand very deeply, that CUDA is so successful because there's so many domains of applications.

Everything from deep learning, to machine learning, classical machine learning, to unstructured data quantities, structured data processing, to particles, and fluids, and quantum, and chemistry, and so on so forth. The list goes on.

And so the benefit is flexibility. If it's slow, then it's too expensive. But Nvidia's technology is very fast, it's also flexible. Then the data center can be used for many things. If the data center can be used for many things, the utilization will be high. If the utilization is high, the cost is down.

So, general purpose equals low cost. In fact, you might remember, on the day that Steve Jobs announced the iPhone, he showed iPhone, and then he showed the music player and camera, and also a PC. So all of these different devices can now be in a general purpose device, camera, music, player, all in one general purpose device. This general purpose device is, of course, more expensive, but the cost is actually lower than having all of those things.

So, general purpose equals low cost, but it hasn't got very high performance. And that's the benefit of CUDA. You have just exactly pointed to the reason why CUDA is so successful.



Question 9 (Unclear speaker and outlet): Two or three years ago, you said that Nvidia is a software company, and beyond hardware. So, what elements will take Nvidia to the future? Is it still CUDA [unclear audio], or a bunch of AI [unclear audio].

Jensen Huang: Thank you. Appreciate that. Actually, what I said is that Nvidia starts with software. We always start with the algorithm. For example, it could be a quantum classical algorithm, quantum classical computing.

Maybe it's an algorithm for computational lithography, making chips. Maybe it's an algorithm for 5G and 6G radio. We always start with the algorithm, and then, we try to design up, down, bottom. It's called ""co-design"", across the entire stack.

But, we have to start with the algorithm. Otherwise, if you don't understand the algorithm, you cannot accelerate it. CPUs don't have to understand algorithms. CPUs, because the algorithm sits on top of a compiler, and you only see a compiler. But, accelerated computing is not like that. [It's a] Very, very different type of computing format.

So, Nvidia starts with that [with software and algorithms]. In the future, though, you will see that Nvidia started with software, acceleration of algorithms, to full-stack, then we became a systems company, then we became a data company. Now, we're becoming an AI infrastructure company.

And the infrastructure is important, because the software that runs across the infrastructure is very different than the software that runs on a PC. And, the system organization, architecture and optimization is very different than inside a PC.

So, as we think about the future of computing and these factories, you have to think about the infrastructure completely. Everything from power, to cooling, to networking, to scale up networking, into the fabric, security, storage...everything. Everything has to be considered in one time.

Otherwise, the software is not optimized, the throughput is not optimized. And if the throughput is not optimized, the revenue is affected. This is the first time, the very first time, that a computer directly affects the revenues of a company.

Today, when you see a chip fab, that ASML equipment directly affects TSMC's revenues. Makes sense, right? It directly affects the revenues. But a computer in a big IT data center... How do you know?

If I bought you a faster laptop, does it directly translate to your revenues? Does it directly translate to your income? It does not. Same thing. [For example] IT, if I bought them more computers, does it directly translate to Nvidia's revenues? It does not.

But in the AI factory, it does.

So, this is a very new way of thinking about computers. It's a factory, and we have to optimize it to the extreme, because these factories are very, very expensive.



Dr. Ian Cutress, More than Moore: Love the NVLink Fusion announcement you did yesterday. I'm trying to understand the width, depth and breadth, to the availability to the outside world. I kind of want to envision a system where you have the NVLink spine, you have a partner with that custom CPU, with NVLink, their custom GPU, TPU, whatever you want to call it, with their NVLink, being a custom partner with a switch on top. All that's involved with Nvidia, is the ingredient with the switch. Is that a vision you can expect for that technology in the future, you said you wanted to at least buy something right?

Jensen Huang: That is one vision. But the more likely vision, is that they will buy an NVLink chiplet, and they'll buy the NVLink switch, and the NVLink spine, and the Spectrum-X switch, and all of the necessary software to go along with it. That's more likely.

Let's use one particular example. Remember, Fujitsu has been a computer company for literally, exactly as long as I can remember. They have a large install base of Fujitsu systems all over the world, and it's based on Fujitsu's CPU. They would like to add AI to that.

How do you do that? Because today, Fujitsu has a CPU, and they would like and all of their software stack runs on the Fujitsu CPU, and the Nvidia AI, runs on Nvidia AI.

And so how do you combine the two? How do you use these two together? Well, the way you fuse these two ecosystems together is with NVLink beauty. It's a fusion of ecosystems. Does it make sense? That's why I call it NVLink Fusion, the fusion of two ecosystems.

All of a sudden, by building a Fujitsu CPU with NVLink, and you connect it to...the port is actually going to look exactly like this, except this will be a producer CPU, or [unclear audio], or [unclear audio], or Rubin. We would then sell this to Fujitsu. Make sense? They plug it into the NVLink system, and look what happened. Fujitsu's entire ecosystem just become AI supercharged.

Dr. Ian Cutress, More than Moore: But could they use their own accelerator?

Jensen Huang: They could, but they really want our ecosystem. That's the reason why they did this. If they don't want our ecosystem, there's nothing to fuse. People want our ecosystem, and all the software that we bring along.

So we would do the same with Qualcomm, and if other CPU vendors would want, we're more than happy to. Because we put the chip to chip, and they NVLink into Synopsys and Cadence, so every CPU company could do it. And all of a sudden, Nvidia's entire ecosystem becomes integrated with theirs, fused with theirs. Pretty clever, huh?



Lisa, Wall Street Journal: I just want to follow up with something you said earlier. You talked about AI diffusion rule , and basically it's been a reversal for the past week. I'm interested in your views on going forward? Do you think this reversal will continue, just at least the Middle East is just one example of a country's negotiation over GPUs. I'm just wondering, did you expect Trump and his administration to continue that line and his attitude?

Jensen Huang: I don't know the details of the diffusion rules. The policy hasn't come out. No one knows what future policies are going to happen. Nobody knows in any country and in any government. Policies are always evolving.

But here's what I do know, the fundamental assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule in the beginning, has been proven to be fundamentally flawed.

That's the big thing. Believe that smart people are doing smart things in governments, and they want to do what's good for the country. I believe people genuinely do that.

If the facts are flawed, if the assumptions are flawed, then the outcome would have to be flawed, the policy would have to change, and so the fundamentals have been completely proven wrong.

And so that's the reason why President Trump made it possible for us to expand our reach outside the United States. And he said very publicly, that he would like Nvidia to sell as many GPUs as possible, all around the world.

The reason for that is because he sees it very clearly, that the race is on, and the United States wants to stay ahead. We need to maximize, accelerate our diffusion, not limit it, because somebody else is more than happy to provide it.

And this AI diffusion is important, because AI is not just AI for all of the things that we said, remember, AI is also going to be the foundation of 6G. So, future communications infrastructure will also be affected. So, we need to get the American AI technology out to as many places as possible. Work with developers and AI researchers all around the world, and help them build an ecosystem, [to] participate in this incredible AI revolution, and do that as fast as possible.

The fundamental assumption was that United States the only provider of AI. And, obviously that's not true.



Dianne, New York Times: So you talked about how important the China market is for Nvidia, and I was wondering, what does it look like for Nvidia to compete in China on an ongoing basis? Is it accurate that the company is investing in a research center in Shanghai, and does the future of Nvidia in China look like, potentially working more closer with the US government, to avoid a future situation like H20?

Jensen Huang: We are trying to lease a new building for our employees in Shanghai. We've been in China for 30 years. Our employees are in a really cramped environment.

Because now more and more people- We still have a flexible work from home policy. So, you know, I decided that the way that people work should reflect the capabilities of the technology, the nature of our work and the sensibility of culture.

And the one additional idea is, because of video conferencing, because we can remote work, I wanted to use the opportunity to enable young people, young parents, to be able to build a life, build a family, and build a career at the same time. Because many young many young women can't build a career, because they have to be at home taking care of their children.

I would want to make it possible for young women to do both: Have a great career and be a great homemaker. And so the ability to have remote work enables that to happen. It's been a fantastic response from all of our employees and all of the others.

They think it's fantastic. Of course, it is incredible maintaining both jobs or doing both things at one time. It's not easy, but at least it's possible. And so that's the reason why we have remote work.

But more and more people are starting to move to the offices, and so the offices are just too cramped. We finally found a place that we could lease the building, and that's basically it. I'm surprised that that's such an enormous story. I feel like I just bought a new chair and that that became front page news. [Laughs]

Our competition in China is really intense. Let's face it, China has a vibrant technology ecosystem, and it's very important, the fact that China has 50% of the world's AI researchers, and China is incredibly good at software. I would put China's software capabilities up against any country, any region in the world. That's how good they are.

Not to mention, they're fast. So our competition is intense. If we're not there, quite frankly, the local companies are more than joyful. They would love for us to never to go back to China.

And so it is precisely those policies benefit, whatever the reasons are. I hope that that what is actually happening, is going to help shape the policy-makers, so that it's possible for us to go back and compete, and that's my goal.

H20, as it currently stands, Hopper. We don't know how to degrade Hopper to make it useful to the marketplace, but we're committed to the market.

You know, the number one in export controls. Export control puts limits on products. If the government would like to completely have sanctions, and whatever they want to ban completely, they're allowed to do that, of course, and we'll comply with the law.

But in the meantime, our job is to comply with the export controls, and the government is very clear about that, provide the export controls, but do your best. Provide the export controls, but continue to do your best, serve the market.

What we're trying to do right now is to think through, how can we best serve the market? And we have very limited choices. We degraded the product so severely, It's going to be quite complicated. But anyhow, we're going to do our best. I don't have any good ideas at the moment, but I'm going to keep thinking.

Penny, Publication Unknown: I'm just going to ask you a question about China. So there are lots of startups in China, GPU companies, and they're developing their ownerships. I'm just wondering how you see this, and how is Nvidia going to respond to it?

Jensen Huang: There are startup companies, and [Audio unclear] one of the the largest and most affordable technologies, period, in the world. And, they are innovating fast. The advantage that AI provides is that the data center is very large. It's not like a cell phone. It doesn't have to fit in one line. If it doesn't work, you know, use two chips. And if that doesn't work, use four chips. It uses more energy. But power is quite cost effective in China, and there's plenty of land. So the the the ban on H20 is not effective for that reason. They'll just buy more more chips from the startups, from Huawei, and others. And so, I really do hope that that the US government recognizes that the ban is not effective and gives us a chance to go back to market as soon as possible.



Question 14 (Speaker and publication unclear): Nvidia is building AI systems for large scale, solutions like GB300 NVL72, do you envision any [audio unclear] specific platforms. Will Nvidia extend any particular specialized AI hardware, and how will you prioritize areas like robotics and industrial AI?

Jensen Huang: These are the two computers. These called DGX. DGX-1 was the first computer in the world, created for one service, for AI. It only does one thing. AI. Oh, and CUDA.

So DGX-1, was the world's first AI native computer, and when I first announced it, there were no customers except for one, and they didn't have any money, so I gave it to them. A company called OpenAI, this was 2016.

So, I decided that now that there are developers all over the world, and they would all love to have their own DGX-1, but DGX-1 is very big. and so I decided to make small ones. These are personal DGX-1's. This one is called DGX Spark, and this one's called DGX station, the world's first AI personal computer.

[Audio unclear] With respect to robotics, robotics is going to be the next industrial revolution. Let me prove it to you. In order for a technology to succeed, it needs to have excellent capability. It needs to have usefulness, so customers buy it, and there needs to be enough customers buying it [at] high volume, such that the R&D fly-wheel can be high.

It has to be useful, it has to be good technology. The technology needs to converge at just the right time, [it needs] lots of customers and use cases. [Audio unclear]

If this technology fly-wheel is high, then the refinement rate will be exponential. The performance will go like this. Cost will go like this, just like smartphones. The moment that the smartphone, all the pieces of technology, from touch, to 3G, which became 4G, mobile processors, internet, the whole web. The moment all of those things came together, boom, it took off. A huge industry.

The same thing is going to happen with robotics, and the reason for that, is the humanoid robot is the only robot that we can imagine using in many places, because we are in many places. We fit the world to ourselves.

There are only two of them [robotics products] with that property, those characteristics. Self driving cars, because we create the world's [Audio unclear], for cars and human robots. Because, we created the world for ourselves.

If we can make these two technologies useful, functional and useful, it's going to take off. And that's what Nvidia's Isaac GR00T is.

Our entire platform, just like we have RTX for games, just like we have Nvidia AI that you're seeing here, Isaac GR00T is our human and robotics platform, and we are very successful with them. That's going to be the next multi-trillion dollar industry. I expect it to be very, very large.

This was not the end of the Q&A session that journalists had with Nvidia's Jensen Huang at Computex 2025. However, we hope you enjoyed reading.

10-year-old GPU nearly doubles its benchmark score after VRAM upgrade

The Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 was a promising graphics card at launch offering performance similar to AMD's Radeon R9 290X at a more affordable price range. Ten years later, the GPU has been given a new life thanks to Brazilian modder Paulo Gomes and his team who managed to add more VRAM, doubling the original from 4GB to 8GB.

To increase the memory, the mod involved replacing the original 512MB, 7 Gbps GDDR5 memory modules with 1GB, 8 Gbps chips along with a resistor so that the GPU can recognize the higher density VRAM. By having access to 8GB of upgraded VRAM, the modder noted an improvement in Unigine Superposition benchmark showing nearly double the score.

This one-of-a-kind Asus Strix-branded RX 970 was then handed to Youtuber Peperaio Hardware to evaluate whether increasing VRAM on an older GPU translates to any improvement in gaming. Testing was done using a mix of old and new games where titles like Red Dead Redemption 2, GTA V Enhanced, and Plague Tale Requiem didn't show any signs of improvement. The results were compared to a Gigabyte Windforce GTX 970 with 4GB of memory.

In Cyberpunk 2077, the results varied depending on the graphics settings with an uplift of 5-15% in performance on the 8GB modded GPU. The two games that gained noticeable benefit from the increased VRAM were The Last of Us Part II Remastered with a 24% increase in frame rate and Horizon Forbidden West offering as much as 40% improvement.

Back in February last year, the same team of modders managed to repair and upgrade a defective RTX 3070 by replacing its original 8GB of GDDR6 memory with 12GB. The team soldered in new 2GB memory chips and modified the GPU's BIOS to correctly detect and utilize the additional VRAM. After the upgrade, the graphics card operated stably and passed all stress tests, showing that the mod was technically viable and functionally solid.

The upgrade had led to a performance gain in games including Resident Evil 4 Remake, where the modified RTX 3070 delivered up to a 66% performance increase compared to the standard 8GB version. In The Last of Us Part I, performance saw a boost of around 25%, while Hogwarts Legacy ran 20% better with the extra VRAM.

Both Nvidia and AMD have continued to claim that 8GB of VRAM is sufficient for most gamers. However, real-world mods like the ones mentioned above, suggest otherwise. Even as modern titles become increasingly demanding, Nvidia went on to launch the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti in 8GB variants, while AMD has announced that its new Radeon RX 9060 XT will also be coming with 8GB of VRAM.

An emergency department (ED)–based alert led to a higher rate of A1c testing among patients with diabetes overdue for routine monitoring but did not significantly improve long-term glycemic control.

""A targeted ED intervention was associated with increased testing for A1c; however, the effects decreased over time without educational communication,"" the authors wrote. ""While the program demonstrates operational feasibility, it does not appear to result in significant improvements in A1c levels relative to the overall ED population,"" they added.

The study was led by Daniel L. Shaw, MD, MCSO, Department of Emergency Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston. It was published online on May 15, 2025, in The Journal of Emergency Medicine. 

The study's retrospective design and reliance on a single institution's database limited generalizability. The classification of ""noncompliance"" might have misrepresented patients early in the calendar year. The COVID-19 pandemic during the study period could have affected ED use, follow-up, and testing compliance.

This study did not receive any outside funding or sponsorship. The authors did not disclose any conflicts of interest.

Gender-based differences were identified in the clinical characteristics and time to initiation of the first biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (b/ts DMARD) among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with women experiencing a longer disease duration before treatment initiation than men.

""The delay in treatment initiation in women despite a higher activity rate merits reflection,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Paloma Vela-Casasempere, Alicante Institute for Health and Biomedical Research (ISABIAL), Alicante, Spain. It was published online on May 14, 2025, in Arthritis Research & Therapy.

Only the covariates available in the registry were included in this study, potentially missing other confounding factors. Sex was recorded as a dichotomous variable (male/female), without accounting for self-identified gender.

The registry was supported by the Spanish Agency of Drugs and Medical Devices, Biogen, Bristol-Myers and Squibb, and others. Several authors reported receiving grants or contracts, consulting fees, honoraria, or travel support from various pharmaceutical companies, including Novartis and Pfizer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New guideline aims to help primary care clinicians diagnose and treat hypertension","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250526/New-guideline-aims-to-help-primary-care-clinicians-diagnose-and-treat-hypertension.aspx","Mon, 26 May 2025 11:44:00 GMT","

A new guideline to diagnose and treat hypertension is aimed at helping primary care clinicians, including family physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists, manage the disease. The new guideline, the first of 2 from Hypertension Canada, is published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.241770, and will be republished with permission in Canadian Family Physician and Canadian Pharmacists Journal, with a summary in Canadian Nurse.

Hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor for heart disease and death, affecting about 1 in 4 adults in Canada. Canada has been a leader in hypertension treatment and control, but this success has been on the downward trend in recent years. Discrepancies in optimal blood pressure targets, complex guideline recommendations, less engagement with front-line health care providers and other factors may be fuelling this decline.

As primary care is where most hypertension is managed, supporting primary care practitioners to better diagnose and manage this disease will improve hypertension care at the population level and benefit people in Canada. We hope these practical recommendations will help with implementing hypertension care in everyday clinical practice.""

Dr. Ross Tsuyuki, past president, Hypertension Canada

Developed by Hypertension Canada, the guideline uses the World Health Organization's (WHO) HEARTS framework to improve cardiovascular health around the globe with an adaptable approach that can be tailored to countries' unique needs. In the part of the United States where it was developed, it improved local hypertension control rates from 44% to 90% in just over a decade. 

The guideline, based on the latest evidence, provides recommendations most relevant to primary care on assessing blood pressure (BP) and definitions of hypertension for diagnosis, healthy lifestyle changes, and pharmacotherapy for treatment, including hard-to-treat hypertension. In selecting medications to treat hypertension, the guideline committee considered efficacy, tolerability, cost, coverage, availability, protection from future drug shortages, and ability to split pills.

One important change is a lower threshold for BP targets.

""The lower BP thresholds adopted for both defining hypertension and treatment targets relative to previous Hypertension Canada guidelines means that more people will be labelled as having hypertension, which may have meaningful personal implications, like stigma, insurance coverage, and more,"" says guideline co-chair Dr. Greg Hundemer. ""However, the committee thought that the current evidence strongly supports the lower thresholds to promote early detection of, and intervention for, hypertension, which will help mitigate long-term cardiovascular complications at the population level.""

A committee of family physicians, pharmacists, a nurse practitioner, hypertension specialists, and a methodologist developed the guideline. In addition, 4 patient partners with lived experience of hypertension provided feedback during guideline development and helped create a patient support tool.

The guideline is the first of 2, with the second intended to be a comprehensive guideline to address more complex aspects of hypertension management.

""This guideline is not intended to be applied in all clinical scenarios, such as managing hypertension in children or in people who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. Separate guidelines are available for these patient populations. Rather, it is a complement to an upcoming comprehensive guideline aimed to help with more complex and nuanced aspects of hypertension management, such as resistant hypertension, but should cover about 95% of most uncomplicated hypertension cases in the community,"" says Dr. Rémi Goupil, guideline co-chair.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the African Union (AU) Commission renewed their longstanding strategic partnership today with the signing of an updated Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the sidelines of the 78th World Health Assembly in Geneva. This renewed agreement reaffirms the joint commitment to advancing health security, universal health coverage, and sustainable development across the African continent at a time of unprecedented financial challenges in the global health landscape.

It further underscores the African Union's leadership in fostering collective action, inclusive partnerships, and regional resilience, and positions the Department of Health, Humanitarian Affairs, and Social Development of the AU Commission at the heart of the continent's health policy implementation efforts.

The agreement was signed by Her Excellency Ambassador Amma Adomaa Twum-Amoah, Commissioner for Health, Humanitarian Affairs and Social Development, on behalf of His Excellency Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, Chairperson of the African Union Commission, and Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. It marks a defining moment for primary health care and universal health coverage.

Commissioner Twum-Amoah emphasized the strategic importance of the agreement and the AU's leadership in shaping Africa's health landscape:

""This Agreement marks a new chapter in AU–WHO cooperation. By working together more closely, we can better respond to the health needs of our populations and ensure that no one is left behind. The African Union values WHO's central and leading role in global health and looks forward to deepening this strategic partnership in support of our shared goals. We need to move from budgeting for survival to planning for health sovereignty,"" she added.

Building on the foundation of the 2019 MoU, the renewed agreement streamlines and strengthens collaboration across all AU entities. It aligns efforts in support of Africa's health priorities and sets the stage for enhanced cooperation between WHO and the AU. It also reaffirms WHO's central technical and normative leadership role in global and regional health, and its commitment to supporting the AU and its institutions in achieving health-related Sustainable Development Goals.

This renewed agreement comes at a critical time, as cuts to bilateral aid imperil the health of millions in Africa. It reflects our determination to translate our partnership into tangible results for the people of Africa, and support countries to leave behind the era of aid dependency and transition to sustainable self-reliance. We are proud to stand with the African Union in driving forward the health priorities of the continent.""

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General

The Memorandum outlines five key areas of collaboration:

The timing of the renewed agreement is significant. It reflects the African Union's elevated voice in global health governance – bolstered by its G20 membership – and highlights WHO's ongoing key role as a trusted technical and operational partner.

The renewed MoU marks new momentum for regional and multilateral cooperation to address Africa's most pressing health challenges and deliver meaningful, lasting results on the continent.

The U.S. men's national team might not have Christian Pulisic or several other standout European faces for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup, but there's still much to like about the roster. 

Manager Mauricio Pochettino named 27 players from the tune-up friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland. He will further trim the squad to 23 ahead of the Gold Cup group stage against Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti and Saudi Arabia. 

With 16 MLS players, in addition to talents from leagues in England, Germany, the Netherlands and France coming together for the camp, what could a starting lineup look like?

Sports Illustrated takes a shot at picking it.

Zack Steffen has enjoyed a strong season so far with the Colorado Rapids, and he will have a chance to prove himself as a starting option for the U.S. He has an advantage over Matt Turner, who hasn't played significant minutes with Crystal Palace. 

This season, Steffen has made 44 saves on 60 shots, and has three clean sheets on a Colorado team that often relies on its defense to win games. 

Alex Freeman has had an explosive season in MLS with Orlando City SC and is proving to be one of the most exciting and dynamic fullbacks in the league. With outstanding pace, he has been able to take more chances going forward, while not sacrificing his defensive responsibilities, helping him score four goals and an assist.

Fresh off an FA Cup win, Chris Richards will anchor the American backline through the summer. He made 24 appearances with Crystal Palace in the Premier League this season and will be a key veteran voice at the heart of defense with hopes of rebounding from a dismal defensive display at last summer's Copa América. 

Mark McKenzie joins the USMNT after the end of his first full season in Ligue 1, where he made 33 appearances in all competitions for Toulouse. He ended the season with a 90-minute day and a 3–2 win against Saint-Etienne. 

He's continued to develop into a defensive stalwart for the French side and hopes to establish his connection with Richards at the center further back. 

As part of the American quartet that helped PSV win the Dutch title, Sergino Dest remains one of the best players in the USMNT pool and is one of the few to commit to the Gold Cup this summer. 

While he was limited to just seven appearances this season after recovering from an ACL injury suffered in April 2024, his form to the end the year stood out. He'll look to continue building up his game on the international stage this summer as well.

Given the USMNT's lack of fullbacks in the camp, the 24-year-old could switch sides, allowing the less experienced Freeman to stay in his familiar position. 

Debatably the strongest position for the USMNT on the 27-man roster, Tyler Adams and Johnny Cardoso come into camp after strong seasons in the Premier League and La Liga, respectively. 

With AFC Bournemouth, Adams was a regular contributor in 28 Premier League matches, helping them to a ninth-place finish. After returning from a back injury, he worked with manager Andoni Iraola and found consistency in midfield, which he hopes to bring to the USMNT in a double pivot.

Meanwhile, Cardoso scored three goals and provided an assist in 28 appearances with Real Betis as they finished sixth in La Liga and are set for the Europa Conference League final against Chelsea on May 28. 

There aren't many natural winger options for the USMNT in this window, but Haji Wright has spent time on that side for Coventry City, despite playing most of his season as a center forward. 

Wright scored 12 goals and an assist with Coventry in the English Championship this season, helping them finish fifth in the table before missing out on promotion to the Premier League in the playoffs. 

Diego Luna was among the few bright spots for the U.S. in their dismal showing against Panama and Canada at the Concacaf Nations League Finals in March. While he hasn't had as many elite attacking teammates this season with Real Salt Lake, he has still scored eight goals and an assist, taking on most of the team's attacking responsibilities. 

Keep in mind that he's also just 21, and he's already in his second season of being one of the best in MLS. 

Malik Tillman, another American to capture a title in Europe this season, looks to carry his form from PSV into this summer with the American squad. He played 26 games this season and scored 12 times to help PSV to their second-straight Eredivisie title. 

Two of those goals came earlier in May, when he scored a brace in a 4–1 win over Heracles to leap over Ajax and into first place in the table, where they remained. 

If Pochettino is true to his word of assessing MLS players in the same way as those in Europe, Brian White should be the surefire pick to start up top for the USMNT this summer. 

While Folarin Balogun comes back into the camp after missing the Nations League due to injury, he has struggled in Ligue 1, scoring just four times in 13 matches. Meanwhile, White has thrived as a standalone No. 9 for Vancouver, netting 15 goals in 17 games across all competitions in 2025. 

White will come into the camp looking to continue his strong form from the January camp and Nations League, and will be trophy-hungry, after a Concacaf Champions Cup final run with Vancouver.

Clock ticking for host cities in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, yet confidence is high just more than a year out from World Cup

In Kansas City, they have a countdown. On everyone's screen, it ticks down, day by day. When GOAL spoke with Pam Kramer, CEO of Kansas City's World Cup committee, the first thing she mentioned is that the World Cup was then 384 days away. It is on everyone's mind.

Elsewhere, there are checklists, notebooks, calendar invites, Zoom calls, meetings, community events, and everything in between. This is the life of a World Cup host committee in North America, with the 2026 event on the horizon. The biggest iteration of the tournament in the history of the game - 48 teams playing in 16 cities across three countries - is fast approaching. There is no escaping it.

Talk to the people involved, though, and it's generally a sense of the calm before the storm. Boxes are being checked, tasks worked through, logistics implemented, and initial planning well underway. Infrastructure projects have begun, while broader questions are being asked and then addressed. But for all of the planning best practices, the challenges are real. And the sheer number of unknowns, in most cases out of their control, make preparing for an event of this scale immensely difficult - and also, at times, a little bit insane.

“It's kind of gone from feeling like we're drinking out of a fire hose to now being in a place where we're really able to think critically about the planning,” Alex Lasry, CEO of the New York/New Jersey host committee, told GOAL. “As we get through the summer and into the fall, we're going to start to go into full execution.”","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

GOAL looks at the tiers of U.S. internationals playing in Europe, with some finding form and others needing a fresh start

It's been a year full of learnings for Americans Abroad. We know, at this point, that Christian Pulisic is really rather good at football. It's clear, too, that Ricardo Pepi and Antonee Robinson are real talents - who could be part of the USMNT for the foreseeable future.

Elsewhere, though, it's all a bit mixed. Weston McKennie did a bit of everything for Juventus, but it didn't amount to much in the end. Brenden Aaronson helped Leeds to promotion without really winning over the fans. A near-perfect campaign for Malik Tillman was once again disrupted by injury.

Meanwhile, a fair few, not least Gio Reyna and Matt Turner showed exactly why they badly need to move this summer. Piece it all together, though and it made for an interesting campaign in Europe, one that certainly offers plenty of promise - and questions - for the future.

GOAL counts down the most remarkable campaigns we've seen from a single player in England's top flight since 1992-93 

No player wins a Premier League title all on his own. It's simply impossible for any individual to lead a team to victory without a stellar supporting cast. 


However, there's no doubt that, over the course of an entire season, some players play a bigger role in a club's success than others, going above and beyond what's normally expected of a great goalkeeper, dominant defender, multi-talented midfielder or all-round attacker. 


Of course, sometimes such heroics don't even earn a winners' medal, although their Herculean efforts are usually - and rightly - recognised by their peers. 


With all of that in mind, then, GOAL counts down the greatest individual campaigns in Premier League history based on statistics, trophies and overall impact...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Recent ATP finalists Hubert Hurkacz and Flavio Cobolli will be making quick turnarounds to play at Roland Garros on Tuesday. Hurkacz faces Joao Fonseca, while Cobolli–who won Hamburg–meets Marin Cilic. (30) Hubert Hurkacz vs. Joao FonsecaHurkacz heads into the French Open with much-needed momentum on the heels of some injury-plagued months–and really almost a full year–due to a knee problem. The 28th-ranked Paul finally raised his level with a quarterfinal run at the Madrid Masters and a runner-up performance last week in Geneva. It could have been even better, though, since Hurkacz led Novak Djokovic by a break late in third set only to fall 5-7, 7-6(2), 7-6(2) as the 37-year-old Serb captured title No. 100.With only two days off, it doesn't get much easier with Fonseca on the other side of the net on Tuesday. The 18-year-old Brazilian has cooled off a bit since a scorching-hot end of 2024 and start of 2025, but he obviously remains one of the most dangerous unseeded players in the field. Fonseca also loves clay–as he proved with his first ATP title in Buenos Aires–and would prefer to face Hurkacz on this surface as opposed to any other. With the No. 30 seed likely fatigued both mentally and physically, this a great opportunity for Fonseca–especially if it turns into a long, physical match.Pick: Fonseca in 5    58WWW: Hurkacz vs. Fonseca?

The 26th-ranked Italian went on seven-match losing streak during the hard-court swing, but he has already captured two ATP titles on clay. He triumphed in Bucharest (250) in April before lifting the trophy in Hamburg (500) this past weekend.

Up first for Cobolli on Tuesday is a second meeting with Cilic, who lost their only previous encounter 6-4, 6-3 on the red clay of the Umag Challenger in 2023. At 36 years old, Cilic finds himself outside the top 100 at 104th in the rankings. Although injuries have been more of a problem than form, even when healthy he is obviously well past the prime that saw him win the 2014 U.S. Open. The Croat went to Paris on a three-match losing streak and fell to Lloyd Harris in the final round of qualifying, but he got a lucky-loser spot in the main draw. Facing a red-hot Cobolli, however, is not so lucky.Pick: Cobolli in 4    27WWW: Cobolli vs. Cilic?

Wouldnt  surprise me but Hurkacz has a history of just forgetting about a disappointing loss like it never happened. If so, he probably wins this in 4.

Taylor Fritz has battled an abdominal injury for much of this season and rolled his ankle last week in Geneva. While the American has been content with his level of play despite those issues, there is one particular aspect of his game that has plagued him recently: his ability to rise to the occasion on the big points.

After a 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 defeat to Daniel Altmaier on Monday in the Roland Garros first round, Fritz felt that trend continued.

""It's kind of what's been going on a bit lately. I think I'm playing generally fine. It's just a lot of important points, I just am playing horrendous tennis on a lot of the important points,"" he said. ""When I'm break point down, or I've got looks on his serve, like 0/30, 15/30, 30/30, break point — all the pressure, important points... I don't know what's going on. I'm finding ways to just play the worst point possible.""



Fritz converted just one of five break points in the opening round, while saving just three of eight, according to Infosys ATP Stats. While he said he has been feeling unusually uncomfortable on the clay in recent weeks — his run to the last 16 in Madrid the lone exception — Fritz still feels his game has held up overall.

Looking ahead to the grass-court swing, the No. 4 player in the PIF ATP Rankings is eager to show his top level when it matters most.

""The fact that I'm not just converting big points, not playing big points well, the only way to get rid of that is have a match or a couple matches where that just doesn't happen and I perform well on some of those points,"" he said. ""Once it's gone, it's gone. I'll never think about it again.

""That's the thing. It's tough. It's not something you can really fix in practice. I felt great about my game in practice. Overall I don't think I'm playing bad 90 per cent of the match, by any means. In any of the matches I played, by the way. The match last week in Geneva, the match just now, I think for 90 per cent of the match I'm playing normal. It's the 10 per cent which ultimately decides the tennis match, the really big points where it actually matters.""

Sinner 6-4 6-3 0-0 Rinderknech*

Top seed Jannik Sinner is cruising. He takes the second set thanks to a long forehand from Arthur Rinderknech and now the Italian is just one away from the second round.

*Sinner 6-4 5-3 Rinderknech

Rinderknech slices into the net. 40-15. Set point.

*Sinner 6-4 5-3 Rinderknech

That's too good. 15-15 and Sinner steps forward into a forehand, just kissing the line.]

Rinderknech checks the mark, but his face drops when he sees the ball bounced in.

*Sinner 6-4 5-3 Rinderknech

Arthur Rinderknech won't be going down without a fight. He holds to love in double-quick time and celebrates by pumping his fist.

He's asking the question of Sinner...

Sinner 6-4 5-2 Rinderknech*

Jannik Sinner is creating space for himself, smartly changing up the angles and building points.

Rinderknech can't get near him in his latest game as the Italian holds to love.

*Sinner 6-4 4-2 Rinderknech

Well, Rinderknech just about gets away with it. Holding after two big serves.

Sinner 6-4 4-1 Rinderknech*

40-0 and then Rinderknech tries a cheeky under-arm serve...

...which sinks into the net.

It's all fun and games until your opponent switches on. Sinner wins the next three points to force deuce, the last point a delicious lob winner at the net.

Sinner 6-4 4-1 Rinderknech*

That's more like it! Rinderknech asks the crowd for more after he fizzes a cross-court winner past a full-stretched Sinner.

30-0.

Sinner 6-4 4-1 Rinderknech*

No slowing down from Jannik Sinner. He rattles through his service game, swatting away two winners at the net to back up the break and take a solid 4-1 lead.

A long way back for Arthur Rinderknech now.

*Sinner 6-4 3-1 Rinderknech

Jannik Sinner gets it this time. Arthur Rinderknech was far too keen to play that forehand down the line and it's a wild miss.

Sinner takes the lead in this second set.  

Sinner 6-4 2-1 Rinderknech*

Arthur Rinderknech recovers with a pacey forehand winner and we go to deuce.

But another miss from the Frenchman gives Jannik Sinner a second chance.

Sinner 6-4 2-1 Rinderknech*

The drop shots aren't fooling Jannik Sinner. He's up to the net in a flash, and from there he is dictating the point each time.

The Italian top seed has got himself a break point after Rinderknech nets.

Sinner 6-4 2-1 Rinderknech*

Arthur Rinderknech glares at Jannik Sinner with a smirk after hitting a no-look winner and beating the Italian at his own game.

He, and the crowd on Philippe Chatrier, loved that.

But Sinner isn't fazed. He gets back to business and sweeps up the next two points with forehand winners.

*Sinner 6-4 1-1 Rinderknech

A mixed service game from Arthur Rinderknech, but he finishes it off with a blistering cross-court winner that wrongfoots Jannik Sinner.

Sinner 6-4 1-0 Rinderknech*

Jannik Sinner clips the net with a cross-court forehand, but it doesn't change the flight of the ball and Arthur Rinderknech has no hope of getting there. He's at the other side of the baseline.

The top seed is looking comfortable out there as he watches Rinderknech slice the air with his racquet and miss the ball completely.

A sliced backhand from the Frenchman goes long, and it's a straightforward hold for Sinner to get set two started.

*Sinner 6-4 0-0 Rinderknech

Jannik Sinner takes advantage of Arthur Rinderknech's weaker second serve with a blistering return that the Frenchman can only plant into the net.

That's the set. It's advantage Sinner on Court Philippe Chatrier. 

Sinner 5-4 Rinderknech*

That drop shot wasn't the one. Jannik Sinner was expecting it and he easily swats it down the line to bring up two set points.

Sinner 5-4 Rinderknech*

This is when Jannik Sinner can be ruthless. Arthur Rinderknech knows he has to keep his focus to hold serve and stay in the set.

Two wayward forehands won't help that. 15-30.

Sinner 5-4 Rinderknech*

Arthur Rinderknech doesn't even bother trying to reach that drop shot from Jannik Sinner. It came out of nowhere.

The world number one whips a wicked backhand across court before landing another drop shot that Rinderknech does get to this time, but he can't find the court with his lofted return. 

*Sinner 4-4 Rinderknech

Another serve-volley combo comes up trumps for Arthur Rinderknech.

Jannik Sinner, despite his best efforts, had no chance of reaching that.

And there's an ace to wrap up another hold. On we go...

PARIS (AP) — U.S. Open semifinalist Emma Navarro only lasted 57 minutes at the French Open, losing 6-0, 6-1 in the first round Monday to Jessica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain.

It's a major setback for the 24-year-old American, a New York native, who reached the fourth round in Paris last year before her first Grand Slam semifinal at Flushing Meadows. Navarro had a strong start to the season, including a quarterfinal at the Australian Open and a WTA 500 title, but has struggled on clay this spring.

The biggest active oddity in Australian tennis is over.

Alexei Popyrin signed off his promising junior career with the Roland-Garros boys' singles title eight years ago, but had won just once in the men's event from six trips to Paris – and not since 2019 – until he defeated Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka on Monday.

Nishioka did not make it to the finish line, retiring with a lower back injury while trailing 7-5, 6-4, 1-2 after Popyrin sizzled his 10th ace past the diminutive left-hander.

He was the first Australian to reach the second round at the claycourt major this fortnight after Rinky Hijikata and wildcards Destanee Aiava and Tristan Schoolkate bowed out on day one.

It was an anticlimactic end to 25th-seeded Popyrin's six-match losing streak at Roland-Garros, but he won't be picky, given his lean record at the tournament.

“I haven't thought about [the defeats]. Every match that I've played here has been really tough,” Popyrin said.

“I think I remember all the losses that I had. They've not been the easiest of draws. They've been tough first-round losses – ones that I've taken to heart. It is a nice feeling to get to the second round. At the start of the week, I was saying I thought my game was at a really good level.”

Ajla Tomljanovic, who made the last 16 at Roland-Garros 11 years ago, also progressed with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over in-form fellow Australian Maya Joint, the 19-year-old rising star who won her maiden WTA singles title in Morocco only a day earlier.

Hard-hitting Joint, one of only two teenagers in the WTA top 100 at a career-high No.53, struck one more winner than Tomljanovic, but delivered a wayward performance with 39 unforced errors to 18.

It was their second meeting within days after Tomljanovic retired due to illness just one set into their semi-finals in Morocco. Daria Kasatkina made it three Australian winners with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 dispatching of Czech Katerina Siniakova in her first grand slam for her adopted country.

Popyrin lost in five sets to countryman Thanasi Kokkinakis last year despite leading 2-0 in the final set, following defeats to Aslan Karatsev, Fabio Fognini, 14-time champion Rafael Nadal, Lloyd Harris and Laslo Djere in previous years.

The Djere loss was the only one not in the first round, but Popyrin deserved to advance against Nishioka, who looked physically compromised early in the match and took a medical timeout after dropping the opening set.

Nishioka, who was ranked No.24 two years ago, has retired or handed his opponent a walkover at six of his past 10 tournaments, and also called it quits one game into the fifth set in the first round of last year's US Open.

Popyrin has a good chance to go further, with another left-hander, Alejandro Tabilo, up next after the Chilean outlasted French wildcard Arthur Cazaux 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 1-6, 6-3. Roland-Garros has mostly been a challenging tournament for Australians, outside Alex de Minaur's surprise quarter-final run last year.

“I can speak only on my behalf that I'm happy that I finally got a win here, [but] I think it's not a secret that probably clay isn't the best surface for Aussies,” Popyrin said.

“Slowly, we're starting to see more and more results and more wins in the first round, which is great, both on the men's and women's side. Maya Joint just won a title on clay last week, which is massive for her.

“The clay court has not been our favourite, but ‘Demon' [de Minaur] is playing unbelievable on the clay this year. Hopefully, I can make some results also.”

It was obvious from the outset that the contest was on Popyrin's racquet. He boasts a 26-centimetre height advantage over Nishioka, and pounded 24 winners to 10 without facing a break point.

The hairiest it got for Popyrin was at 30-all in the sixth game of the second set, but he produced an excellent second serve then clobbered a big cross-court forehand that his Japanese rival could not retrieve.

The set was locked a point later before Nishioka dragged a forehand well wide to concede another break in the next game as Popyrin let out a guttural roar.

There was little explanation for Popyrin's claycourt struggles in the French capital, given the surface has been his most successful by win percentage across his tour career.

He reached last month's Monte-Carlo Masters quarter-finals – beating three top-20 opponents, including two-time Roland-Garros finalist Casper Ruud – and the same stage in Geneva last week.

Popyrin would dearly love that form to continue because he is defending more than half his ranking points in the second half of the year, including his Masters 1000 title win in Montreal and third- and fourth-round showings at Wimbledon and the US Open, respectively.

He risks going into ranking freefall unless he can finish the season well after an injury-marred beginning to the year that included his co-coach Xavier Malisse ending their partnership at Indian Wells in March.

Popyrin is still working with Neville Godwin but has added another South African, Wayne Ferreira, to his team.

“I feel the most positive I felt leading up to a tournament in a long time. That's very important for me,” he said.

“I think mentally it's been challenging, but since the start of the claycourt [season], I feel like my game is starting to come back to me; the results are starting to show a little bit more, there's more consistency and match wins every single week.”

Elsewhere, Jordan Thompson lost 6-4, 6-2, 6-1 to Czech Jiri Lehecka; Aleks Vukic went down 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to Russian 24th seed Karen Khachanov; and Kim Birrell exited 6-1, 6-0 to Jaqueline Cristian.

Defending champions Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek headlined the day's winners, but there were some major casualties, including Americans Emma Navarro and Taylor Fritz and Argentine Francisco Cerundolo.

No.10 seed Paula Badosa won her heavyweight battle with Naomi Osaka, 6-7 (1-7), 6-1, 6-4.

Sacreblue! Aussie crowds are as volatile as the feisty French fans who last year drew widespread condemnation from players? 

Get all the latest golf news, highlights and analysis delivered straight to your inbox with Fox Sports Sportmail. Sign up now!!!

That is the opinion of French Tennis Federation president Gilles Moretton who, while defending the passion shown by local fans at Roland Garros, cited the behaviour of patrons at the Australian Open as an example of why there is no difference around the world.

“You're talking about the French players playing? It was the same in Australia. I was in Australia,” he said on Monday in Paris.

“We have some people, they love tennis, and they know tennis very well. They know when to stop. They are not doing anything. That's the way French people are. I'm sorry. They support their players.

“Maybe they make too much noise. We feel like that atmosphere is good for tennis. If it goes too far, we will have to say something. I hope it not bother too much the players. That's the way it is.”





The issue of crowd behaviour in Paris was a hot topic in 2024, with four-time French Open champion Iga Swiatek and Belgian veteran David Goffin among those to complain about fans going beyond the traditional chant of “Allez. Allez. Allez!”

Goffin alleged he had chewing gum spat at him during a five set win over rising French star Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard at Roland Garros last year when liking the behaviour of the crowd to soccer hooligans.

“Clearly it goes too far, it is total disrespect. It's really too much. It's becoming football,” he told Belgian press.

“It's becoming football. Soon there will be smoke bombs, hooligans and fights in the stands. It's starting to become ridiculous. Some people are there more to cause trouble than to create an atmosphere.”

Swiatek, who arrived in Paris low on confidence but began her bid for a fifth Roland Garros title with a 6-3 6-3 victory over Rebecca Sramkova, was upset about the treatment she received in a thriller against Naomi Osaka, which prompted a call from the FFT for respect.

But Aussie Adam Walton, who plays German Maximillian Marterer in an opening round match on Tuesday, indicated there might be some truth to Moretton's point when discussing his clash with Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech last year.

“I mean, when I played the Australian Open, it was all for me and then obviously here, it was all against me,” he said.





To be fair, some ugly incidents aside in Paris, the atmosphere for matches at Roland Garros for finals and for big matches involving local favourites is superb given the passion the fans demonstrate. 

And Australian crowds have been the subject of criticism, with supporters of Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis drawing complaints during their run to the doubles crown at Melbourne Park in 2022, while some players are not fans of the “Party Court” at the complex.

Moretton, meanwhile, defended French officials against complaints men's matches were being played in the prime-time spot at night in Paris, while the women stars are taking to centre court for the early matches.

Swiatek posted her 22nd win in succession at Roland Garros in front of a half-empty crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday morning, with French fans typically arriving after lunch for action on the main stadium court.

On the first day of the tournament, world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka opened with a dominant win over Kamilla Rakhimova while former Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin will play the midday match on the main court on Tuesday.









In contrast, American Ben Shelton won a five set thriller on Sunday night in Paris that finished after midnight, while world No.1 Jannik Sinner was drawn to play Rinderknech on Monday night. French veteran Gael Monfils has the night slot on Tuesday.

While Moretton said he would leave the reasoning for the schedule to French Open boss and former world No.1 Amelie Mauresmo, he said the tournament had a duty to ensure fans for the night match are treated to the best match of the day. 

“Sometimes we need to put, I mean, for the night session, we need to put the better match (that), we think, could be for the spectators,” Moretton said.

“Maybe we will have a few, I have no idea, a few female matches on the night sessions. We'll see. (It) depends on the schedule, who is playing who, who will be the best match.”

Swiatek, for her part, has refused to buy into debate about the issue, in part because she prefers playing in the day in Paris.

“My position didn't change. I like playing days, so I'm happy that I'm done and I can have a longer rest,” she said.

“But on the other hand, people just try to look for, like, not even things between men and women. You can find that in the schedule a little bit, and you can ask us all the time, but honestly, my answers are not going to change, so I don't mind.”","{'href': 'https://www.foxsports.com.au', 'title': 'Fox Sports'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Ruud stays perfect in Roland Garros openers","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/ruud-ramos-vinolas-roland-garros-2025-monday","Mon, 26 May 2025 12:06:45 GMT","

Casper Ruud wasted no time making a statement on Monday at Roland Garros, where he extended his perfect record in opening rounds to 8-0.

The two time finalist put an end to Albert Ramos-Vinolas' career at the clay-court major with an impressive 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 first-round victory. Ruud, runner-up in Paris in 2022 and 2023, hit 34 winners en route to a second-round meeting with Portugal's Nuno Borges.

“It was a tough match against Albert, we played many times together,” said Ruud, who improved to 5-3 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head with the Spaniard, who is set to retire this season. “In the beginning of my career, he was always beating me, so I had a lot of work to do to get some revenge.

“Even though it was straight sets, every game was tough against him. It's amazing to start Roland Garros again, it's been some incredible years, the past three years. Yesterday was also spectacular with Rafa's tribute. It was a very nice way to start the tournament.”

While he was not present to watch Rafael Nadal's emotional farewell tribute live on Sunday, Ruud was watching from afar while the 14-time champion was presented with a permanent plaque on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Having lost to the Spaniard in his maiden Grand Slam final at Roland Garros in 2022, Ruud is well placed to talk about his lasting imprint at the tournament.
“The Philippe-Chatrier Court is like Rafa's backyard,” said Ruud. “When you step in there, he can toy with you, he can do whatever he wants it seems like. Yesterday, when they put the [plaque] on the court, it was a very nice moment. It proves to everyone that it's [his] playground.
“His record will stand unbeaten for many years to come, if not forever. 14-0 in finals, 14 titles, it's just incredible. I don't even know how to explain how crazy it is.”
Ruud claimed the biggest title of his career last month at the ATP Masters 1000 in Madrid, and is among the contenders for the second major of the season. With his two-hour, six-minute victory on Monday, the 26-year-old improved to a 24-7 tournament record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.
 





The former No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Ruud boasts the most tour-level wins on clay (129) since the start of the 2020 season. This year in Paris, he is seeded to set a quarter-final meeting with defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, who leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 4-1.

Sebastian Korda and Alexei Popyrin also sealed their spots in the second round on Monday. Korda, who reached the fourth round on debut in 2020, defeated Luciano Darderi 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, while Popyrin led Yoshihito Nishioka 7-5, 6-4, 1-2 before the Japanese retired.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Atmane: How self-belief allowed me to become a 'different person'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/atmane-roland-garros-2025-feature","Mon, 26 May 2025 03:36:07 GMT","

You never know how far your belief in someone can take them. Sometimes, it changes their life.


Such is the case for Terence Atmane, now thriving under the guidance of coach Guillaume Peyre, who has previously worked with the likes of Marcos Baghdatis and Richard Gasquet — the lefty's first-round opponent at Roland Garros, where a potential meeting with top seed Jannik Sinner looms in the second round.


Atmane's former coach Robin Boulé, who spent five years with the 23-year-old, referred the Frenchman to Peyre, confident it would be a perfect fit. In just a short time together, it's proven to be exactly that.


Set to compete at his home major as a wild card, Atmane has lifted two ATP Challenger Tour titles since joining forces with Peyre on a more full-time basis last month. Atmane is gleaming with confidence, and a big part of that is because of Peyre.


“When he came to me, he's telling me, ‘Man, you're a beast, you're playing so good, everything',” Atmane told ATPTour.com. “I'm like, ‘Man, if that guy thinks that about me, it means that there is something. He's not saying that just for me to feel good. I was like, ‘Man, come on, I have to fight also for this guy on court'.”




Spanning from mid-February to April, Atmane suffered a five-match skid and had lost six of seven matches. He was searching for answers. Reflecting on his weeks spent with Peyre across last year's Asian hard-court swing and this season's Australian Open, Atmane picked up the phone. 


“It's a bit weird to say, but every time he's with me, I perform,” said Atmane.


“His way of talking to me [is] making me confident, giving me a lot of energy, good vibes all the time, treating me like his own son. But also, someone who can be very tough with me really helped.”


Atmane travelled to South Korea to begin a four-week swing. Instantly, he returned to the winner's circle, earning his biggest career title at the Challenger 125 event in Busan. Two weeks later, Atmane triumphed again, this time in Guangzhou, China.


“I think [Guillaume] did a crazy job with me because I felt completely changed after like one week,” Atmane said. “It was very difficult for me to find my rhythm, very difficult for me to play and to enjoy the game because I was constantly losing. My coach found the perfect words for me, the support that I needed.”

Watch Atmane play and it's hard to miss his free-spirited, high-risk, high-reward style. It is the kind that is sure to electrify the French crowd, which will already be buzzing when Atmane faces Gasquet, the 38-year-old who is playing his final tournament.

Atmane wears his heart on his sleeve, a trait that Peyre has helped him manage.


“I feel like two different people. I feel more like an adult, more responsible on court,” Atmane said. “I didn't break any racquet the past six months. Last year, I broke more than 25 racquets. I felt myself completely changed and it's only because of him. I'm really grateful to have him every day with me. I'm going to try and keep this as much as possible.”


So how has Atmane made such a drastic change mentally?


“It's just realising that I was putting so much pressure on myself, even before starting the match when I was coming on court, I was already very tight, very emotional at the beginning,” Atmane said. “I'm a very sensitive, emotional guy. I like to show my emotions. I'm still showing my emotions on court, I still scream. I'm still like this, but every time I'm in control now.


“In the end, he put out all the pressure that I had before. He put out all the expectations and he was just saying, ‘Just go on court, give your 100 per cent, die on court, that's it. If you lose, then we work and don't worry about it'. As simple as that. And that completely changed my head.”




Atmane's bright personality shines off the court, too. He enjoys doing magic tricks and is nicknamed ‘The Magician', which is also his Instagram profile name. He boasts an impressive Pokémon collection. Atmane has an IQ score of 158, which he says offers some insight into his on-court demeanour.


“I'm more emotional than the usual guy because I'm thinking more. I have more thoughts in my head. I've always been someone very sensitive, very nice,” Atmane said. “I was always very nervous on court. I remember when I was 10 years old, I was already breaking racquets. It was like always part of me. So taking this off took a lot of time.”


It's not just Peyre that sees such high potential in Atmane, World No. 121 in the PIF ATP Rankings. When the Frenchman forced Daniil Medvedev to four sets at last year's Australian Open, the former No. 1 shared kind words when shaking hands with Atmane, who was forced to retire due to cramps.


“He was telling me, ‘Keep going, because you are unplayable'. It was something like that — I don't remember exactly — but it was something like ‘unplayable',” Atmane recalled. “And then after, he mentioned in the interview, ‘Yeah, that guy played like Top 20 for three sets'. He gave me big confidence. Daniil wasn't someone I knew from before.”


Atmane heard similar encouragement from Grigor Dimitrov last year in Rome and also from World No. 4 Taylor Fritz at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Shanghai, where the American needed two tie-breaks to scrape past the lefty. 


Moments like those have only added to Atmane's confidence as he continues to climb. Now the four-time Challenger champion will chase a milestone first main-draw victory at a major, but more than anything, he is enjoying this journey. 


“It's very beautiful that I can do it now as a living. If someone stops me to get a picture, I cannot say no. It's part of me. I want to connect with people,” Atmane said. “I'm very sensitive about it, very careful about it because I really like to have these little moments with people in general. It has always been like this. [I'm] someone who really loves what they are doing.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Alcaraz springs Roland Garros title defence into action","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-zeppieri-roland-garros-2025-monday","Mon, 26 May 2025 13:16:25 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz issued an early statement Monday that he remains the man to beat at Roland Garros.

The defending champion delivered a flashy first-round display to move past qualifier Giulio Zeppieri 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 at the clay-court major. Alcaraz, who is aiming to become the first man to successfully defend the title in Paris since Rafael Nadal in 2019-20, has now won 16 of his 17 tour-level matches on clay this year.

“It was really, really solid,” said Alcaraz. “The first round of the tournament is never easy, coming here as the defending champion could be even tougher. But I just started pretty well, and kept my good pace during the whole match. I tried to be focused on my game, to get a good rhythm.

“I'm just really proud of my start here at Roland Garros, where I was really excited to play my first match this year.”



Alcaraz claimed ATP Masters 1000 titles in Monte-Carlo and Rome before reclaiming the No. 2 spot in the PIF ATP Rankings a week ago. In Paris, the 22-year-old will continue his title defence in a second-round clash against Fabian Marozsan, with their Lexus ATP Head2Head series level at 1-1.

In his first round against Zeppieri, Alcaraz hit a series of stunning passing shots from all corners of the court, but was particularly clinical when advancing to the net, where he won 21 of 25 points, according to Infosys Stats. He also saved all three break points he faced during the one-hour, 56-minute clash.

Alcaraz now owns a standout 28-2 record on clay since last May, highlighted by his maiden Roland Garros title and a run to the silver medal at the Paris Olympics in 2024. The Spaniard has shown few signs of slowing down on the surface this year with memorable maiden triumphs in Monte-Carlo and Rome, where he soared past World No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the final and improved to a 7-4 lead in their gripping Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry.

""Right now, I think I found a really good path again,"" said Alcaraz of his season. ""I'm just starting to get it, feeling more comfortable approaching these matches. Once I start the matches, I'm just keeping the high level [throughout] the match and the whole tournament.""

And loosening up at a concert might be just the thing that Swiatek needs to spur her on to the type of Roland Garros result that will turn her season around. She hasn't reached a final of any kind since lifting the trophy in Paris a year ago—the longest streak of her career—and she comes into the event at her lowest ranking in more than three years.But if there's anywhere she'll do it, it is at her self-described happy place.Read more: Iga Swiatek set to be seeded No. 5 at Roland Garros after Jasmine Paolini's title run in Rome""I love playing tennis here,"" Swiatek said in her pre-tournament press conference.

Red Bull's offset strategy for Max Verstappen saw him leading until making his compulsory second pit stop on the penultimate lap. It was the only hope of trying to snatch a victory for a Red Bull, which was not as competitive around the bumps and slow speed corners of the street track as on the faster circuits.

The strategy involved running a long first stint on the hard tyre from his fourth place starting slot, then a very long (50 laps) stint on the medium to the penultimate lap.

Wolff reveals Williams boss Vowles sent him an apology text during Monaco GP

Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli left Monaco keen to bounce back after experiencing one of the most frustrating race weekends of his maiden season so far, with the Silver Arrows coming away empty handed.

The Italian driver's competitive running was brought to an early end in Qualifying as he hit the wall while trying to shave time off his lap, which meant he was unable to continue and settled for P15 on the grid.

With his team mate George Russell suffering an unfortunate technical issue and lining up just ahead in P14, Mercedes were forced to adopt an alternative strategy to fulfil the recently introduced two pit stops rule in Monaco.

They elected to go long into the race before bringing either car into the pits in the hope that there would be a late Safety Car or red flag that could grant them a free stop. As this failed to materialise, Antonelli was left as one of the last drivers to change his tyres as he dropped to last place on the track.

“It was quite relaxing, to be honest,” the 18-year-old said optimistically. “It was a very chill race – only on Lap 1 there was action. We were trying to go long straight away.

“I was doing what the team asked me to and we were trying to get at least one of the cars into the points. Unfortunately it didn't work out but there was nothing more I could have done there. I was just trying to help the team as much as possible.

“At least for the last five laps I could push, which was fun. It was also kind of expected when you start this far back in Monaco.

“You know it's going to be hard to make up places but I also believe that I shouldn't have been in that position. The mistake yesterday was definitely costly and I'll make sure I don't make it again.”

Antonelli has not scored points since the Miami Grand Prix

In a similar approach to Racing Bulls and Williams, he was able to play the team game and hold up drivers behind him to allow Russell to pit twice without losing too much time, which led to the Brit crossing the line in P11.

While it was not enough for either of them to recover to the points, Antonelli was eager to focus on the lessons he gained from the race that he can carry forward through the rest of the season.

He explained: “This was a difficult weekend. I think there was a lot to learn, especially on the set-up decision. I also understood much better how to behave and what feedback to give to the team.

“I think during the weekend, we kind of went in one direction and then started coming back to where we started so I think on my side there was good learning for the future. It was also good to manage the frustration during the race.”

The 'Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning' director said that it's about ""finding the right emotional balance"" for the 'Top Gun' films. 


							By 

	Lexi Carson



Christopher McQuarrie gives an update on Top Gun 3. 


	McQuarrie, who was a writer-producer on 2022's Top Gun: Maverick, was a guest on the most recent episode of the Happy Sad Confused podcast, posted on Monday, where he told Josh Horowitz that he already has the ideas set for the third installment. 




	“Is Top Gun 3 harder to crack in some ways than Top Gun: Maverick?,” Horowitz asked, to which McQuarrie responded, saying, “No, it's already in the bag.”

	Horowitz followed up by asking, “You've cracked it?” And the Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning director said, “Yeah, I already know what it is.”

	“It wasn't hard. I thought it would be, and that's a good place to go from is you walk into the room going, ‘Come on, what are we going to do?' and Ehren Kruger pitched something and I went, ‘Mhm actually,' and we had one conversation about it and the framework is there,” McQuarrie explains. “So, no, it's nothard to crack. The truth of the matter is, none of these are hard to crack.” 


	He continued, “It's as you start to execute it, and as you start to interrogate it, as you start [to think] why these movies are made the way they are. It's not the action, it's not even the level of or intensity of or the scope and scale of the action [or] the engineering around the action, it's none of those things — it's the emotion.”


	Horowitz noted that what he remembers from the film (one of the many things) is at the moment end between Tom Cruise‘s Maverick and Miles Teller's Rooster. By the end of Top Gun: Maverick, the characters reconcile after Rooster resents Maverick because he blames him for his father, Gooses' death in the original '86 movie. 


	McQuarrie said that the film is all about “getting to that place” and “finding the right emotional balance,” which is what he and Cruise were focused on, making sure audiences “feel affinity” for Rooster. 


	News of another Top Gun film came in Jan. 2024, when it was announced that Top Gun 3 was in the works at Paramount. The Hollywood Reporter reported that Top Gun: Maverick co-writer Ehren Kruger would be penning the script and sources said Joe Kosinski would direct again. It's also intended that Teller and Glen Powell will return.

""He's entirely committed to making a full recovery,"" she wrote.


													By
												

	Mitchell Peters



Billy Joel's daughter is speaking out in support of her father following his recent health diagnosis.


Alexa Ray Joel — the daughter of the “Piano Man” and his ex-wife, model Christie Brinkley — took to Instagram on Sunday (May 25) to thank fans for their support and share an uplifting message after her father revealed he had been diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a type of brain disorder.


	“SOUND UP 🕊️ We love you and we got you, Pop!” Alexa wrote alongside a black-and-white illustration of a father holding his young daughter's hand. “I just wanted to thank you all for the beautiful outpouring of love and support amid the recent news of My Father's health diagnosis.”


	She continued, “My Dad is the strongest and most resilient man I've ever known… and he's entirely committed to making a full recovery with ongoing physical-therapy treatments as he continues to regain his strength.”

	











	Last week, Joel announced the cancellation of all upcoming performances due to complications related to NPH.


	“This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance,” he said in a statement. “Under his doctor's instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period. Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritizing his health.”


	The cancellations include several scheduled appearances throughout summer and fall 2025, as well as early 2026, including joint shows with Sting, Rod Stewart, and Stevie Nicks.


	Alexa Ray concluded her message with a touching quote from her father's 1993 ballad, “Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel),” from his River of Dreams album.


	“The genuine care, empathy, and concern from everyone means so much to him… it means a lot to me, too,” she wrote. “‘Someday We'll All Be Gone / But Lullabies Go On And On / They Never Die / That's How You And I Will Be.' ⚓️ The music continues…”


	A singer, songwriter and pianist in her own right, Alexa Ray has shared the stage with her father on several occasions, including shows in recent years during his historic residency at New York's Madison Square Garden.


	Christie Brinkley, Alexa's mother, also shared a message of support for her ex-husband on Saturday (May 24).

	











	“Dear Billy, the whole Brinkley gang is sending you lots of love and good wishes for a full and speedy recovery,” she wrote on Instagram. “I'm sure I'm speaking for everyone in that room when I say please take good care of yourself, we all want you back in that white hot spotlight, you're OUR piano man.”

From ""El Último Adiós"" to ""Y Yo Sigo Aquí,"" see which of the album's 11 tracks is our favorite.


	Twenty-five years ago, the self-proclaimed La Chica Dorada bid farewell to the old millennium in unparalleled style. With the release of her fifth studio album, Paulina, on May 23, 2000, in the U.S., Paulina Rubio reaffirmed her status as a Latin pop icon. It was the evolution of an artist who, despite an already impressive career, revealed that her true artistic brilliance was only beginning to unfold.


	Under the Universal Music México label, Paulina came to life thanks to the collaboration of a diverse and talented team of songwriters and producers, including Estéfano (lead contributor), Christian De Walden (“Yo No Soy Esa Mujer”), Armando Manzanero (“Tal Vez, Quizás”), and Juan Gabriel (“Cancún y Yo”), among others. The Mexican singer fused pop, Latin rhythms, and elements of dance and rock, crafting an album as bold and multifaceted as she is. The results? A record that celebrated love, independence, and empowerment with irresistible energy, transforming into an instant classic.


	The impact was instant. The album debuted at the top of Billboard's Top Latin Albums chart. It also made waves beyond the Latin music sphere, debuting at No. 156 on the Billboard 200 — a notable feat for a Spanish-language album at the time. The singles also dominated the charts: “Y Yo Sigo Aquí” landed at No. 3 on Hot Latin Songs and Latin Airplay, while “Lo Haré Por Ti” peaked at No. 13 and “El Último Adiós” reached No. 18 on Hot Latin Songs. On Latin Airplay, “Yo No Soy Esa Mujer” secured the No. 7 spot, and “Sexi Dance” made its way to No. 34.


	With over 2.5 million copies sold worldwide, Paulina marked a new era in Rubio's career. A quarter of a century later, we're diving back into the album's tracks, ranking them from least to most iconic. 


	We have to admit this isn't the most memorable track on the album and not because it's bad, but because you have really strong songs like “Y Yo Sigo Aquí,” “Yo No Soy Esa Mujer” and “El Último Adiós” that became instant hits and Spanish-language classics. “Mírame” is a fusion of Latin rhythms that gives the song an uplifting tempo — but it's the killer electric guitar solo mid-track that really elevates the song.


	An anthem to celebrate the last summer of the millennium, this drum and brass-driven track has a cheerful rhythm and an infectious chorus that invites you to enjoy every second of the season: “Live, live the summer/ Live, live/ Live, live life/ Live love/ Live, live summer/ Live, live/ Dance, dance my life/ Give me warmth.”


	Written by the great Juan Gabriel, “Cancún y Yo” is an evocative ballad about yearning for a loved one in the middle of a tropical paradise. “What a shame you're not here/ So you could see what a sea/ What water so blue/ And its waves,” Rubio sings with the perfect mix of melancholy and sensuality.


	In “Tan Sola,” La Chica Dorada is vulnerable, heartbroken and pensive. The rock ballad backs Rubio's soft and melancholic vocals, where she questions a relationship that didn't work out. She's unsure if she needs to change, wait, or stick to the routine, but she's certain that she feels very lonely. “Here I am, doing nothing/ Patching up my soul/ With your memory that kills me,” she sings.


	This passionate, electric-guitar-driven pop-rock song written by Estéfano narrates what it's like to be completely crazy about someone who leaves you breathless. “You hypnotize me/ You distract me/ Like an invisible warrior, you confront me/ And you defeat me, yes/ With that mouth and its deadly venom,” Rubio sings with an intensity that builds up to the potent chorus: “Breathless/ You leave me breathless/ Your love, a damn vice that I like/ And that I can't let go of.”


	“Sexi Dance” takes you straight to the heart of the dance floor, where the beat and your senses collide in a magnetic, euphoric trance. With an irresistible mix of techno and dance, the track is a burst of pure energy, while Rubio's sultry, hush-hush vocals turn up the heat with her seductive charm. The epic chorus — “No pares, no/ No te detengas, no...” — perfectly captures the moment: a frenzy you never want to end. Every feeling Paulina describes pulls you into the experience, lost in the adrenaline and thrilling escape of the music. It's glamorous, intoxicating and impossible to resist.


	Sonically, this song is a total party blending elements of pop, dance and techno. But the lyrics are about Pau waiting around for the guy who left her to come back. “And I'm still here, waiting for you and for your sweet mouth to roll across my skin,” she sings with conviction. “Y Yo Sigo Aquí” peaked at No. 3 on the Hot Latin Songs chart, becoming her biggest single since the 1993 “Mío.” After achieving commercial success in the U.S., Latin America and Europe, the song was critically acclaimed receiving a song of the year nomination at the 2001 Latin Grammys.


	There's a softness that sets the tone for this moody pop ballad that even requires Paulina Rubio to sing in an almost whisper-like tone. This may not be the high-energy pop anthem that she's known for, which is what makes this song stand out, showcasing a more romantic side of the Mexican star. Penned Armando Manzanero, the legendary Mexican singer-songwriter, Rubio sings delicately, “Maybe because you didn't decide to stay with me/ Maybe I have to resign myself to run away with you/ I don't know if next time/ I'll be imprisoned by you and you'll melt into me and you don't leave me.”


	The sensual electric guitar riffs in “Lo Haré Por Ti” kick off the 12-song set, Paulina. With its pop-rock melodies, Rubio delivers a love letter about a good girl and a bad boy who are meant to be together, and where she'll basically do anything for him. “I'll do it for you, because I believe in you/ Because your gaze is seeing the same sky/ And when I kiss you, I feel like you're shooting/ In the middle of my soul,” she deeply chants. “Lo Haré Por Ti” reached No. 7 on the Latin Pop Airplay chart, and also entered the top 20 on Hot Latin Songs and Latin Airplay.


	Before música mexicana soared to new heights on the Billboard charts during its recent resurgence, Paulina Rubio — an unstoppable force in Latin pop — had already dared to venture into the world of rancheras with “El Último Adiós,” and the results were nothing short of phenomenal. With a performance brimming with strength and personality, Rubio blended the classic essence of ranchera reveries with a fiery pop twist, creating a track that celebrated heartbreak with gusto.


	The song, which peaked at No. 18 on Hot Latin Songs, became one of Paulina's boldest moments. This success proved that La Chica Dorada had no limits and could effortlessly command not just pop, but also more traditional genres.


	Just as she has songs about being in love and getting heartbroken, Rubio also stood her ground in the empowered “Yo No Soy Esa Mujer.” Translated to “I'm not that woman,” the artist sings about caring and loving for a man, but letting him know that she will not be a submissive woman and will continue to be a free-spirited soul. Also, that he will never see her cry, fall, or get lost, because above all, she's her first priority. “I am not that woman who never leaves the house/ And who places the best of her soul at your feet/ I will not become the echo of your voice,” she sings. “Yo No Soy Esa Mujer” reached No. 4 on Latin Pop Airplay chart, and top 10 on both Hot Latin Songs and Latin Airplay, becoming a timeless staple from the album.

Though still in the thick of promoting “Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,” writer/director Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise are already working on their next pair-up — it just might not be what you expect.

“The conversations we've had about Les Grossman are so fucking funny,” McQuarrie said in a recent interview with Josh Horowitz on his “Happy Sad Confused” podcast. 

Cruise played the fictional Hollywood power player in the 2008 satire “Tropic Thunder” from director Ben Stiller. Heavily modeled on Scott Rudin, Grossman is a Diet Coke-swilling, obscenity-prone producer with no filter and tendencies toward anger, as well as dance. It may sound silly to center an entire film around him, but McQuarrie and Cruise are actively looking for a way in.

“We're having serious conversations about it and how best to do it,” McQuarrie said. “It ultimately comes down to what that character is.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






The big question remains whether people will want to watch a film with Grossman as the lead character. McQuarrie explained that the “leading man” status Cruise holds makes it difficult to place him in roles that are so monstrous. Even with “Magnolia,” which earned Cruise an Academy Award nomination, the actor was part of a very large ensemble, making it easier for him not to have to carry the whole film.

“Ethan Hunt, a character of whom people can be critical, is on rails,” said McQuarrie. “There's so little he is able to do outside of his responsibilities as a leading man and when you try and push those boundaries, ‘Mission' instantaneously cease to become ‘Mission.'”

Right now, McQuarrie and Cruise are not trying to figure out a plot to drop Grossman into as much as they're thinking of specific scenes they'd like to see him play. Moreover, discussing ideas around this character has offered a welcome reprieve from their other responsibilities, particularly on “The Final Reckoning.”

“Just to be sitting at the breakfast table, not talking about the movie we're making for a minute,” McQuarrie told Horowitz, “is such decompression. And just riffing with Tom, playing to Les Grossman — it was one of the real joys of making this movie.”

In addition to this possible “Tropic Thunder” spinoff, McQuarrie and Cruise are also working on a number of other ideas, including a “Days of Thunder” sequel, another installment in the “Top Gun” franchise, and a musical.

 










Watch McQuarrie's full interview on “Happy Sad Confused” below.

“Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning” is currently in theaters from Paramount Pictures.

President Donald Trump used his Memorial Day speech on Monday to boast that he would be the sitting president when the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics come to the United States.


	“Amazing, the way things work out,” Trump marveled. “I got the World Cup, and I got the Olympics.” 


	Addressing a crowd after visiting the Arlington National Cemetery with Vice President J.D. Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, where he laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Trump joked he was glad that he lost the 2020 U.S. Presidential election because he'd be able to commemorate the upcoming 250th anniversary of the United States Army. 


	“In some ways, I'm glad I missed that second term where it was, because I wouldn't be your president for that — most important of all,” Trump said before getting sidetracked. “In addition, we have the World Cup, and we have the Olympics. Can you imagine? I missed that four years, and now look what I have. I have everything.” 

	











	Trump only managed to get through four minutes of his speech before taking a swipe at the previous administration, saying that while soldiers had laid down their lives for the “most noble Republic ever to exist on the face of the earth,” he was now in the process of “fixing” the country. 


	“That was a hard four years we went through,” Trump said to applause. “Who would let that happen? People pouring through our borders, unchecked. People doing things that are indescribable and not for today to discuss.” 


	Still, Trump spent the majority of his address thanking the families of fallen veterans. “Every Gold Star family fights a battle long after the victory is won,” Trump said. “Today, we lift you up and we hold you high … Thank you for giving America the brightest light in your lives. It's what you've done. We will never ever forget our fallen heroes, and we will never forget our debt to you.”

	President Donald Trump and Republican leaders keep pretending they aren't cutting Medicaid with their new tax bill, which will further enrich the wealthy and pay for it in part by significantly slashing Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans. 


	Trump, who has repeatedly promised to protect Medicaid, and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) have both claimed that Republicans are simply targeting “waste, fraud, and abuse” in their tax bill, which passed the House last week.


David Sacks, who is serving as Trump's “AI and crypto czar,” put the Medicaid situation more plainly Saturday on his All In podcast: “This bill cuts $880 billion from Medicaid over a decade.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Like Trump's 2017 tax law, the GOP's reconciliation legislation is expected to disproportionately benefit the wealthy. This year's bill will even reduce the after-tax income of households earning less than $51,000 per year. 


	It is also expected to force at least 10 million Americans off Medicaid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. This carnage will primarily be achieved by imposing work requirements — a demand that any able-bodied Medicaid recipients work at least 80 hours a month. 

	











	Such requirements, which have previously failed at the state level, would come in addition to the program's existing income caps. Taken together, this means that Medicaid recipients will be expected to work low-paying jobs and deal with burdensome paperwork demands if they want to maintain their insurance coverage. Many eligible recipients will likely lose coverage due to the added bureaucracy. 


	The president and Republican leaders have nonetheless tried to argue they are not actually cutting Medicaid, and that their changes won't actually harm their constituents who deserve access to the program. 


	Trump said last week that his tax bill simply targets “waste, fraud and abuse for Medicaid,” and he promised that his working-class supporters “won't lose health insurance” as a result of the legislation. (Some of his supporters will certainly lose health insurance.)

	“We have not cut Medicaid,” Johnson falsely insisted in a Face the Nation interview on Sunday. He added that Republicans are simply “working on fraud, waste and abuse.” 

	











	A memo last week from the National Republican Congressional Committee, which elects GOP lawmakers, declared that “Republicans Are Strengthening Medicaid.” It urged Republicans to go on offense, and depict their changes as efforts to protect the program and “ensure Medicaid serves those who need it.”


	Sacks, a venture capital executive and Trump special government employee, skipped some of this pretense in the All In podcast, as he admitted the Republican tax bill “cuts $880 billion from Medicaid.” He noted that the cuts are “politically tough and controversial.”


	In the podcast discussion, Sacks was defending against the argument that the Trump tax legislation should do more to reduce spending. He said he wished the bill cut spending more, but he argued the Medicaid cuts are already “relatively tough things to do politically,” and that Republicans can't cut more and expect to pass the bill. 


	Even as Sacks acknowledged a basic truth that Republicans have denied — the Trump tax bill cuts Medicaid — he tried to spin the work requirements as a positive thing, as Republican leaders are doing now.

	“It imposes work requirements for able-bodied adults,” he said. “This is similar to what Bill Clinton did back in 1996 with welfare reform, basically saying that you can't be a layabout and get welfare.”


	Of course, many people on Medicaid are technically considered able-bodied, even if they are functionally disabled and cannot work, because they have not been approved for disability, which is an onerous process. These people will lose coverage — and they won't be able to replace it: The tax bill, as written, says that people who lose Medicaid coverage due to work requirements cannot sign up for alternate coverage on state marketplaces.


	Johnson, the Republican speaker, has claimed that Republicans are simply trying to remove “29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.” On Sunday, he said that “when you make young men work, it's good for them.” He framed this as “moral.”

	It feels wrong hearing Republicans describe the poor people whose insurance they're terminating as lazy couch-surfers — and hearing Sacks, who's worth at least hundreds of millions of dollars, describe them as “layabouts” feels even worse.


	At least he admitted what his boss, Donald Trump, won't: Republicans are about to make huge cuts to Medicaid. And they're doing so to help fund more big tax cuts for the super rich.

Billy Joel's wife shared her gratitude for the “outpouring of love and support” their family has received in the wake of the musician announcing he had been diagnosed with a rare brain disorder. “We are so grateful for the wonderful care and swift diagnosis we received,” Alexis Roderick Joel wrote in an Instagram post on Monday, sharing a photo of Joel, herself, and their two young daughters. “Bill is beloved by so many, and to us, he is a father and husband who is at the center of our world. We are hopeful for his recovery. We look forward to seeing you all in the future.”

A post shared by Billy Joel (@billyjoel)


	Joel, 76, announced Friday that he'd be canceling 17 upcoming shows across North America and Europe after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The condition is caused by excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulating in the brain's ventricles, which affects memory, movement, thinking, and concentration, according to the Cleveland Clinic. “This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision, and balance,” a statement from Joel's team read. “Under his doctor's instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period. Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritizing his health.”Over the weekend, Joel's daughter with ex-wife Christie Brinkley, Alexa Ray Joel, also shared her thanks for the kind messages that their family has received. “I just wanted to thank you all for the beautiful outpouring of love and support amid the recent news of My Father's health diagnosis,” Alexa Ray wrote, including lyrics from the song Joel wrote for her, “Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel).”

We go over these alien films and dissect which are our favorites. 

'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' 

Do you ever look up into the night sky and wonder whether or not we're all alone? Well, there are a ton of great movies that do that, and then try to provide answers to what would happen if we learned we were not alone. 

Today, I want to go over a list of UFO movies, that is, movies directly centered on unidentified flying objects, and their place in our society. 

So don't think of these as the best alien movies, think of these as a niche within a niche. 

Hopefully, we can find some poignant answers to life's biggest questions. 

Let's dive in. 


            
                1. Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)
            
            
        Steven Spielberg's masterpiece is arguably the quintessential UFO film. This is such a poignant and emotional look at what it would mean to make contact with life from elsewhere. The story is driven by the escalating appearances of mysterious lights and craft, leading to an obsessive quest for understanding by ordinary people. The UFOs themselves are central to the awe and wonder of the film.And you'll never forget the music. 
            
                2. Arrival (2016)
            
            
        To me, this feels like one of the most realistic depictions of what an alien invasion would entail. The crafts here land, but the real unidentifiable things in this movie are the human reactions to them. The film deeply explores humanity's attempt to understand the purpose and origin of these inexplicable objects before significant direct interaction with their occupants.
            
                3. Contact (1997)
            
            
        I love this movie so much. I think I watched it five times last year because I got so into it and the actual science depicted in the film. Based on Carl Sagan's novel, this Robert Zemeckis film stars Jodie Foster as a scientist who discovers a signal from an extraterrestrial intelligence, leading to a journey to make first contact. It's a more scientifically grounded and philosophical exploration of the implications of alien communication and it asks huge questions of the people in the movie that translate to the audience. 
            
                4. Flight of the Navigator (1986)
            
            
        As a kid, this VHS tape was heavy in rotation. This family-friendly film centers on a boy's encounter with a sleek, sentient alien spacecraft. Much of the film explores the ship's incredible abilities, its distinct design, and the mystery of its journey and purpose, making the UFO itself a key character.
            
                5. Independence Day (1996)
            
            
        This is also one of those massive cultural movies that I just thought was deeply fun and inventive. The sheer scale and destructive power of the city-sized UFOs are the primary drivers of this blockbuster. The initial awe at their arrival quickly turns to terror as their devastating capabilities are unleashed. There are points in this movie where I have no idea how the humans are going to make it out alive, and I've probably seen it like 20 times. It has such a fun hook and ending. 
            
                6. The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)
            
            
        UFOs have been in our minds since the dawn of cinema, and this science fiction classic stands with the best of them. The iconic flying saucer that lands in Washington, D.C. is a powerful thematic symbol. Its seamless design, advanced capabilities, and the silent, imposing presence of Gort, the robot guarding it, create an immediate sense of technological superiority and alien mystery before Klaatu even delivers his message of warning. It's a very prescient movie. 
            
                7. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)
            
            
        Another Spielberg classic, E.T. is a heartwarming tale of friendship between a lonely boy and a gentle alien stranded on Earth by his own UFO. The movie takes so many distinct points of view, but the idea of the recurring man with the keys, who turns out to be full of wonder, just like a child, sort of sums up the way we all think about UFOs. It remains a beloved film for its emotional depth and timeless story of understanding and connection.
            
                8. War of the Worlds (2005)
            
            
        I could have made a whole list of just Spielberg movies. His modern adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novel offers a visceral and terrifying depiction of an alien invasion, focusing on the desperate struggle for survival of one family. Its intense action and unsettling imagery make it a memorable entry in the genre.It has real 9/11 vibes and seems to be a deep exploration into the way the world handles terror and how hard it is to go back to our normal lives after trauma. 
            
                9. District 9 (2009)
            
            
        This is one of those movies that feels like it happened in real life. It uses UFOs for an allegory about immigration and humanity. Neill Blomkamp's powerful and thought-provoking film uses the arrival of alien refugees as a biting deconstruction of xenophobia and social injustice.
            
                10. Signs (2002)
            
            
        I am a massive fan of this crop circle movie, and I think it's one of Shyamalan's best. This thriller explores a family's experience with the sudden appearance of crop circles and the growing dread of an impending alien presence. It's a film that masterfully builds suspense and plays on primal fears of the unknown.And it all hinges on the core performances of an amazing cast. 
            
                11. Nope (2022)
            
            
         Jordan Peele's sci-fi horror film features a mysterious, predatory UFO that terrorizes a remote California horse ranch. It's such a good story about predators, prey, and documenting history that I often forget the alien aspect of the movie..even though the film is dedicated to the characters observing, attempting to understand, and ultimately trying to capture evidence of the elusive and uniquely designed object in the sky, which behaves more like a living creature than a traditional spacecraft.
            
                Summing It All Up 
            
            
        So, there you have it. That's my list for the best UFO movies, but by no means is it prescriptive. I'm sure you have a bunch to add, and I'm always looking for more of these kinds of films to watch.

(The Hill) — Scientists in Mexico are reportedly studying a metal orb that they think could have extraterrestrial origins after it was recovered in Colombia earlier this year, piquing online interest of a potential unidentified flying object (UFO).

The sphere marked with decorative etchings was filmed floating erratically through the sky before it crashed near Buga, Colombia, in March and captured the attention of UFO enthusiasts.

A video posted online that has racked up more than half a million views shows researcher Jose Luis Velazquez discussing the multilayered sphere with “no welds or joints” that would be expected of a man-made object of its kind.

Velazquez said in the video that an X-ray found the three layers of the sphere to be of different densities. 

Julia Mossbridge, founder of the Mossbridge Institute and an affiliate professor in the physics department at the University of San Diego, told Fox News that she doubts the “Buga sphere” has alien origins, though.

“It looks to me like a really cool art project,” she told the outlet.

The Pentagon released a report last year that found there have been no confirmed sightings of UFOs with alien origin or human interactions with extraterrestrial beings, despite a high-profile whistleblower's claims to the contrary without evidence.

PARANORMAL fanatics have spoken out after baseless rumors surrounding the disappearance of the supposedly haunted doll Annabelle went viral. 

Social media has been rife with conspiracy theories claiming the red-headed toy had vanished or been stolen. 

The doll burst onto the big screen via The Conjuring Universe horror franchise, but its real-life story dates back to the 1970s.

Baseless rumors have been swirling on TikTok that the real-life version of Annabelle escaped from its box, or went missing in Texas and Chicago. 

Tourists in Louisiana claimed the doll went missing after it failed to show up at an exhibition as part of the Devils on The Run Tour, as reported by the Fox affiliate WFLD-TV.

The speculation has even prompted the New England Society for Psychic Research to speak about the doll's whereabouts.

A TikTok video revealed Annabelle is still housed in the Warren's Occult Museum in Connecticut. 

The video showed the doll sitting in a case.

“Annabelle's not missing. She's not in Chicago,” the man in the video, known only as Dan, said.

Those who approach Annabelle's glass box are instructed not to touch it based on a note. 

The doll has been blamed for a blaze that gutted the Louisiana mansion, the Nottoway Plantation.

And, it has been bizarrely linked to a jailbreak that saw 10 inmates escape a New Orleans lockup. 

The Raggedy Ann doll was given to student nurse Donna in 1970 as a present from her mom.

She claimed the doll inexplicably moved to different locations within her and her roommate's homes. 

Donna recalled on one instance she put the doll on the couch before leaving work only to discover that it was on the bed.  

The doll apparently left notes and even turned violent against one of the student's friends. 

One of the notes said: “Help us,” while another reportedly said: “Help Lou,” according to the New England Society for Psychic Research.

Lou was a friend of the nurse and her mom.

The male friend claimed he woke up to a feeling of being strangled and had scratches on his body. 

Meanwhile, the doll just stared at him as he was being allegedly attacked.

The nurse and her mom called a medium, who revealed the story about a girl named Annabelle Higgins who was found dead at the age of seven.

The nurse called paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren and they probed the claims whether Annabelle was indeed haunted.

Legend has it that Annabelle was responsible for a man who died after visiting the museum.

The man apparently banged on the doll's case - despite being warned not to touch it. 

He then smashed into a tree while riding back from the museum with his girlfriend. 

Rumors about the doll mysteriously escaping the Warren's Occult museum circulated in 2020.

Tony Spera, the Warrens' son in law, debunked the rumors.

""I don't know if you're going to want to hear this or not, but Annabelle did not escape,"" he emphatically said in a YouTube video.

""Annabelle's here in all her infamous glory. She never left the museum.

""If she had left the museum, I'd instantly know if something happened or somebody broke in.""

Annabelle is set to make an appearance in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in July as part of the Devils on The Run Tour.

Home » News » Can't Knock The Hustle: Pro Wrestling Conspiracy Theories I Believe Are True

Conspiracy theories have been around forever.

Look no further than people who believe the United States faked the Apollo 11 moon landing over 55 years ago for quick proof of that.

It does seem like recent years have seen a spike in conspiracy theories, conspiracy theorists who believe them, and the battle between fiction and reality. Each and every one of us has a friend, family member, or co-worker that is on social media and posting “DID YOU HEAR WHAT JOE BIDEN SAID?!?” or “DID YOU READ WHAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO DO?!?” all the time.

The world of professional wrestling is no stranger to conspiracy theories, either. For as long as I've been a fan, I've seen, heard, or read about those types of things. Some of them seemed believable, while others were too insane to even consider for more than a second.

This week, I want to discuss some pro wrestling conspiracy theories. Not just conspiracy theories, though. I want to discuss pro wrestling conspiracy theories that I believe are 100% true. Some are big, some are small, some are silly, but they're all conspiracies that, somewhere along the line, I have bought completely.

Let's rock.

 

“Macho Man” Randy Savage Gave Hulk Hogan That Black Eye Before WrestleMania 9: Of all the conspiracy theories in the history of wrestling, there might not be any that are more believed to be true than this one.

Hulk showed up to WrestleMania 9 with a really nasty looking black eye, looking like there was no way in hell he'd be able to see well enough to even wrestle at the show. The story he told was that he was in a jet ski accident two days before WrestleMania, and that his face slammed into the craft's handlebar.

The other version is that Randy Savage confronted Hulk after finding out that Miss Elizabeth had run off to stay at Hulk's house because she was friends with Hulk's wife at the time, Linda. Savage, the most notoriously jealous and protective man in wrestling history, was enraged at Hulk's “betrayal” and punched him in the face because of it.

One way or another, Hulk put himself in this situation. On one hand, he could've/should've been up front with Randy about what was going on, and because of that, he nearly got knocked smooth out. Then, on the other hand, let's say that Savage never laid a hand on him. Why doesn't anyone believe him? Because Hulk has lied more times than there are stars in the night sky.

Personally, I'm fully behind the story that Savage took a swing at Hulk. Nothing that we've ever seen or heard about Randy Savage would tell us that he was incapable of something like that, and nothing that we've seen or heard about Hulk Hogan would tell us he didn't have it coming.

 

The Matt Hardy/Lita/Edge Love Triangle Was A Work: If you were around as a “smart” fan back then, do you remember how scandalous this entire thing was? Matt Hardy and Lita were dating, and really seemed to be heading to the point of marriage.

Then, just like that, their relationship was over. Not only that, but… Lita cheated on Matt with Edge while Matt was off the road with a knee injury?

Immediately, WWE fans all over the world felt so bad for Matt. That poor son of a bitch got his heart broken, and one of his closest friends was responsible for the heartbreak to boot?!?

Matt was clearly taking it hard, as he began lashing out online.

Again and again.

Then again.

And again some more.

Then again and again.

He was acting like a teen girl who just dumped by the captain of the football team. The only problem there, of course, is Matt was a 30-year-old man at the time, not a teen girl.

WWE released Matt because of his actions online after the affair was made public. He continued lashing out online, even cutting a “shoot” promo on WWE during an appearance for Ring Of Honor.

Three months after being released, Matt would return to WWE and have a feud with Edge. It went back and forth, but eventually, Edge won the feud, winning a Loser Leaves Raw match, sending Matt over to Smackdown.

I think that, at the very least, some of the aspects of the entire split were made up. The entire thing worked out way too conveniently, with Matt, Lita, and Edge all benefiting from everything for their careers. Edge and Lita used it to become two of the most over heels in the business, and that helped propel Edge to the main event scene, where he would win the Money In The Bank Ladder Match at WrestleMania and then win the WWE Title for the first time a few months later.

The only problem is that Matt's career never quite took off like everyone involved assumed it would. I know A LOT of Matt Hardy fans who were completely turned off by the way he handled the Lita breakup online. As time went on, Matt started letting less and less sympathy from people, instead of getting more and more of it.

I think the most likely scenario is that Matt and Lita were already broken up, and had done so quietly and privately. At some point, they got together with Edge to come up with the entire storyline, and went to pitch it to Vince McMahon. All Vince needed to know was that he was probably going to gain a brand new main event babyface and a brand new main event heel, and he signed off on it. Matt's release was part of the entire thing, allowing him to wrestle all over the place, before returning to the company at an agreed upon date.

Ideally, Matt and Edge would've went on to become megastars for WWE, using the storyline as fuel to the top. It just didn't work out for Matt. He has had a very solid career over the last 20 years, but it certainly didn't match what Edge has been able to do in that time frame. If Matt would've dialed back on the public whining and petulance, it's interesting to think about what could've been for him. Matt eventually won the TNA World Title twice, but if the storyline with Lita and Edge worked out the way it was planned to, how many World Title reigns would he have?

 

Paul Levesque and/or Stephanie McMahon Leaked The Vince McMahon Story To The Wall Street Journal: If you've ever watched murder mystery shows, or even police shows like Law & Order: SVU, Blue Bloods, Hawaii Five-O, NYPD Blue, and so on, you know about motive, means, and opportunity.

When a crime is committed, and a suspect is sought, the authorities look at motive, means, and opportunity to pin the crime on someone.

Did they have a reason or motivation to commit the crime? That's motive. Did they have the tools and the ability needed to commit the crime? That's means. Did they have adequate chances to commit the crime? That's opportunity.

Obviously, I'm only half serious here, as we're not talking about a crime when it comes to who leaked the Vince McMahon story to the media that would eventually lead him to leave the wrestling business altogether. However, the motive, means, and opportunity angle (pun intended) is still there.

Who leaked the story? Why would they do it?

I don't think there's any way possible that Paul Levesque and/or Stephanie McMahon aren't responsible for it.

You want motive? With Vince out of the way, look at the power that Mr. Levesque has gained. He has been able to swoop in and take WWE to incredible heights, becoming more of a fan-friendly figure in the process.

You want means? It wouldn't take much effort to collect information and relay said information to the right outlets.

You want opportunity? Months went by, and all of that aforementioned information that was collected continued to build.

I'm of the belief that Paul Levesque does love his father-in-law, and that he does owe him everything because of the career opportunities that Vince provided him, not to mention giving the green light to begin dating his daughter in the first place.

I'm also of the belief that Paul Levesque has held a bit of a grudge against Vince because of what Vince did to NXT while Paul was running the brand. At one point, Vince seemed completely hands-off with NXT, allowing those in charge there to run things however they saw fit. Then, at some point and for some reason, it was reported that Vince began meddling. He began taking more and more NXT names for call-ups, even though he clearly had no vision for what he was going to do with them. More and more “Paul Levesque Guys and Girls” were getting pushed to the side, if not pushed out of the company altogether. Vince saw the praise and love his son-in-law was getting for the way he was running NXT, and I think it ate away at him, so he wanted to show that he was the real boss.

As far as Stephanie is concerned, I think she loves her father very much, but it's also a different atmosphere for her. While Vince's departure from the company hasn't done anything for Stephanie's power, as she doesn't even work for the company anymore. Do you remember the timing of her departure from WWE? When Vince “retired” from WWE in 2022, Stephanie was named the company's new chairwoman and co-CEO. Less than six months later, Vince would return to the company, and Stephanie would immediately resign.

That's odd.

Stephanie's “issue” with Vince is what the accusations against him do for her as a woman. It would be difficult for her to do any of her pro-woman praise and have people not look at her in disgust. If she's the one who leaked the story, it was done to protect her own image, as well as to benefit her husband, who stood to gain the most by Vince's departure.

Like I said, there's no way you're going to convince me that one, or both, of them aren't behind the professional downfall of Vince McMahon.

 

Vince Russo Was Sent To WCW To Destroy It… Sort Of: A lot of people feel this one is legit, but it's mostly something along the lines of thinking that Vince McMahon and Vince Russo were in cahoots.

I do feel that Vince McMahon had no issue with Russo going to WCW because he knew the type of damage that Russo could do for the company without anyone to rein him in. Vinnie Mac didn't put up a fight, because he knew the type of roster he had, and the stars would more than balance out the loss of Russo (and Ed Ferrara) from the WWF creative team.

Russo, on the other hand, really thought he would be a game-changing addition for WCW. I mean… he was, just not in the positive direction.

Sure enough, the WWF roster got to flex their muscles, and sure-er enough-er, Russo's dumb ass helped to accelerate WCW's downward spiral from the moment he got there.

McMahon was playing 4D chess here, while Russo was playing Scrabble with nothing but Z's and Q's.

 

Shawn Michaels Wasn't As Injured In 1998 As We've Been Told: This is an interesting one, because I do believe it, but as far as the ins and outs of it are concerned, I'm not 100% sure.

The story we've all been told is that Shawn suffered an injury during his match against The Undertaker at the 1998 Royal Rumble. He herniated two discs in his back, and “crushed” a third disc, after taking a back body drop over the top rope and clipping his back against a casket at ringside. The injury was so bad that he needed to retire two months later, after dropping the WWF Championship to “Stone Cold” Steve Austin at WrestleMania 14. Obviously, he returned to the business four years later, but his initial retirement was a pretty shocking moment in the history of the sport.

The thing is, though… I don't think he had a back injury that was bad enough to force him into an early retirement.

I've seen a lot of people agree with this line of thinking, and there are a few paths people go down when it comes up.

Some people feel that Shawn did get hurt at the 1998 Rumble, and his injury was enough of an excuse for him to take time off, where he would find himself going to rehab to deal with the personal issues he had in his life at the time. While he was fixing those issues, his relationship with Rebecca Curci, aka Nitro Girl Whisper, blossomed, and he also found religion. With his personal demons being dealt with, his love life growing strong, and his faith turning his life around, he didn't need to return to the ring. Eventually, though, he felt that itch, and the rest was history.

Another theory has a similar beginning, with his Rumble injury giving him the right “excuse” to go off to rehab. While he was away at rehab, Vince McMahon made the decision to keep Shawn away, probably with the line of thinking that a return to the road would only make things difficult for Shawn again. Shawn was paid for the duration of whatever contract he had, but he was happy to stay home once he began turning his life around.

The first theory makes more sense to me. With everything going on in his life, and all of it being so positive for his mental and physical health, there was no need for Shawn to return to the company. He was fulfilled, and he found other things besides pro wrestling and drugs to take the pedestal positioning in his life. Once his life had pulled out of the nose dive it was in years before, that's when HBK had the confidence to return to the ring.

 

Shawn Michaels Had Some Major Dirt On Vince McMahon: When you think about Shawn Michaels in the late-90's, a lot of things come to mind. One of the first things, though, is just how much of a self-admitted asshole he was to damn near everyone he came in contact with. Think about all the stories that we've heard about Shawn's behavior. Now think about the probable amount of stories that took place, but that we never got to hear about.

Can you think of any jobs, anywhere on the planet, where you can continuously get away with damn near everything without being the boss, being related to the boss, or being in a romantic/sexual relationship with the boss? By the way, that last part is an entirely different conspiracy theory with Vince and Shawn, but it's one I don't believe in.

Vince let Shawn get away with so much. SO MUCH. While it's common sense that bigger stars would get preferential treatment, Shawn took things to such a ridiculous level, and caused so much trouble in so many ways, that you really wonder why Vince wouldn't just let him go.

Is it as easy as Vince just being afraid that Shawn would go to WCW? It can't be, right? Right?

No, I think Vince's hands were tied. Somewhere along the way, Shawn was able to uncover some dirt on Vince that guaranteed him a well-paying job, no matter what he did that would've gotten anyone else fired. Now… based on the information we've heard through the years, I think we can draw our own conclusions on the type of dirt that Shawn knew about.

It makes perfect sense that Shawn would be able to have that kind of power in the company because he was able to discover some things he wasn't supposed to discover.

 

“Green Shirt Guy” Is A WWE Employee: You know the guy… sitting in the front row at damn near every WWE event, and in the same seat, no less. There have been multiple people saying that they've seen him conversing with different WWE wrestlers before shows, after shows, during commercial breaks, etc. Wrestlers talk to fans in the front row all the time. I've seen it with my own eyes, having sat in the front row for an episode of Raw and Smackdown a few years back. However, the fans who say they've seen wrestlers talk to him say that it looks more like he's relaying information to them, or even directing them on what to do.

The popular theory is that he works for WWE's social media team. He's in the front row, and he's almost always taking pictures and filming things with his phone, so that makes sense.

WrestleMania 40 is when I really started to realize something was up. During the main event of Roman Reigns vs Cody Rhodes, we got the moment when The Shield's music hits during the match. Everyone seen on-camera is looking all over the stadium, trying to anticipate where Seth Rollins (and/or Dean Ambrose, in the wildest dreams of some fans) were preparing to make their entrance. Well, almost everyone, that is. Green Shirt Guy and the person he always sits next to were focused on the ringside area, with their phones out. They JUST SO HAPPENED to be looking in the direction that Seth Rollins hopped the barricade, seconds before Rollins could be seen by anyone else.

Yeah, the guy definitely works for WWE in some shape or form.

Now, let's move on to my Weekly Power Rankings, before closing things out for the week with the list of songs I was listening to as I put this column together.

 

 

Weekly Power Rankings

Anarchy In The Arena: Absolutely everything you could ever want out of a match like this, combining a bloody spectacle with tons of great action, and even mixing in some comedy.

Will Ospreay vs “Hangman” Adam Page: They wrestled like two men who knew people were going to question whether or not they should've been in the main event spot. With so much on the line, both men delivered a fantastic match that came with what I believe was a surprising outcome.

Jamie Hayter vs Mercedes Moné: Like her or not, Mercedes really may be the best in-ring performer in the history of women's wrestling. She continues to deliver time and time and time again, no matter where she is and no matter who she's facing.

Oba Femi vs Myles Borne: We already know that Oba is going to deliver in a big match scenario, but it was nice to find out that Myles Borne could rise to the occasion, as well. NXT might have something special in him moving forward.

Mark Briscoe vs Ricochet: Like Anarchy In The Arena, this was a nice combination of a bloodbath, exciting action, and comedy work.

Stephanie Vaquer vs Jordynne Grace: Styles make matches, and that was the case here. Both women were able to showcase what they do best.

Sol Ruca vs Kelani Jordan: Two of the most athletic women in all of wrestling… maybe in the entire history of women's wrestling… trying to out-athletic the other one.

CM Punk & Sami Zayn vs Seth Rollins & Bron Breakker: A hot match performed in front of a hot crowd, kicking off a hot show. Works for me.

The Street Profits vs FrAxiom: They were building an absolute banger together until the ending was ruined by the return of the Wyatt Sicks. If history is any indication, the Wyatts will be back off of television sooner than later because of injuries or shoddy creative work. Meanwhile, the Profits and FrAxiom will continue to do great work. Let the Wyatts story go away already. WWE has completely destroyed it at this point.

Kazuchika Okada vs “Speedball” Mike Bailey: A really fun match that was hurt a bit by something of a predictable outcome.

AJ Styles & Penta vs Finn Balor & JD McDonagh: Lots to like here, with all four men putting in work as the battle of the Bullet Club leaders continues.

Natalya vs Becky Lynch vs Roxanne Perez: A freshly motivated Natalya, the new kid on the block trying to prove herself on a bigger stage, and perhaps the greatest overall performer in women's wrestling history, all coming together with big stakes on the line. Simple enough.

Joe Hendry vs Trick Williams: We really live in a timeline where an NXT wrestler is the current TNA World Champion, winning the match on an NXT pay-per-view against the former champion, who just wrestled at WrestleMania a month ago.

Samoa Joe, Swerve Strickland & Powerhouse Hobbs vs Jon Moxley & The Young Bucks: A fun little amuse-bouche to hold us over until Anarchy In The Arena.

Damian Priest vs Drew McIntyre: Both men wrestled hurt here, and maybe that's why I felt the match wasn't quite as good as it could've been. Still very entertaining, with two of wrestling's hardest hitters throwing everything at each other.

Evolution: WWE's all women's pay-per-view returns in July. The last one took place in 2018, but WWE is in an entirely different place with their women's division now. They could easily have an entire pay-per-view with their current roster, without having to dip too many times in the “Legends” well to fill the card out.

Daniel Garcia & Nigel McGuinness vs FTR: I really hope someone finally gets their hands on Tony Schiavone one day. He has spent too many decades talking spicy behind the announce desk, and he needs to pay for it.

Zelina Vega vs Charlotte Flair vs Giulia: Another simple concept… take some competitors and put them in a match where some big stakes are on the line, then watch them go to work.

LA Knight vs Aleister Black vs Shinsuke Nakamura: Another simple concept… take some competitors and put them in a match where some big stakes are on the line, then watch them go to work.

Bronson Reed: He was involved in a big storyline last year when he got injured and needed to take time off. Now, he returns and is involved in another big storyline that has spun off from that initial storyline. Hopefully, we get an explanation soon as to why he and Seth Rollins are working together after trying to kill each other for so long, but hey, it's a good start for Big Bronson.

Oba Femi & Myles Borne: They had a good promo segment on NXT, leading up to their match at Battleground. Oba was a very confident champion, but still able to give praise to his underdog challenger. Borne did a fantastic job delivering a promo that should've motivated anyone out there who has faced an uphill battle in life, who has told they can't do something, and who has ever been defined by their supposed “disabilities.”

Jey Uso vs Bron Breakker: Whenever I watch Bron wrestle, it's hard not to envision someone who is going to be the WWE Champion or the World Heavyweight Champion much sooner than later.

Chris Sabin vs Tommaso Ciampa: Whenever a tag feud is going on, we always get singles matches involving members of the teams. This was no different, but Sabin and Ciampa are old pros that delivered something fun. We also got the added bonus of Candice LeRae aligning herself with Ciampa and her husband, Johnny Gargano.

Je'Von Evans vs Ashante Adonis vs Sean Legacy: Spots! Spots! Spots! Spots! Spots! Spots! Everybody!

Jimmy Uso & Rey Fenix vs Solo Sikoa & JC Mateo: I'm not sure what was stranger… seeing the former Jeff Cobb wrestling in a WWE ring, or seeing one-half of The Usos teaming up with one-half of The Lucha Bros.

ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) — President Donald Trump paid tribute to fallen service members during a Memorial Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday, in an address that honored the “great, great warriors” yet also briefly veered into politics as he boasted of a nation he is “fixing after a long and hard four years.” 

Though the holiday is one that U.S. presidents typically treat with pure solemnity, Trump began it with an all-caps Memorial Day social media post that attacked his predecessor and called federal judges who have blocked his deportation initiatives “monsters who want our country to go to hell.”

Yet at Arlington National Cemetery, where more than 400,000 have been laid to rest, Trump commemorated the sacrifice of U.S. service members and singled out several Gold Star families to tell the stories of their fallen relatives. 

“We just revere their incredible legacy,” Trump said. “We salute them in their eternal and everlasting glory. And we continue our relentless pursuit of America's destiny as we make our nation stronger, prouder, freer and greater than ever before.”

“Their valor,” he said, “gave us the freest, greatest and most noble republic ever to exist on the face of the earth. A republic that I am fixing after a long and hard four years.”

During his remarks, Trump told the story of Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Shannon Kent, killed along with three other Americans by a suicide bomber in 2019 in Syria, leaving behind her husband, 3-year-old son and 18-month-old son.




The Pine Plains, New York, native was on her fifth combat deployment, he said, embedded with a team hunting Islamic State group militants in Syria, serving as linguist, translator and cryptologic technician working alongside special forces. 

“She was among the first women ever to do it, and she did it better than anyone,” Trump said, calling out Kent's family for applause at the ceremony.

The crowd also heard of Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Elroy Harworth from Erhard, Minnesota, whose plane went down in enemy territory during the Vietnam War, dying while his wife was seven months pregnant. His son, who was cheered in the audience, followed his father's path and has been in the Army for 20 years.

There was also the story of Army Cpl. Ryan McGhee of Fredericksburg, Virginia, who enlisted after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and whose mother was in the audience.

Trump said McGhee knew he wanted to be an Army Ranger since he saw the towers fall on that day, did three tours in Afghanistan, then deployed to Iraq. Sixteen years ago this month, the president said, McGhee died in a firefight, and “gave his life at 21 years old.”

Vice President JD Vance, who spoke before Trump, said the lesson of all the gravestones is: “We must be cautious in sending our people to war.” He urged the crowd to push political leaders to treat the lives of soldiers as the “most precious resource.”

Later in his remarks, Trump pointed to a “big, big celebration” coming next year as the U.S. celebrates its 250th birthday, joking that “in some ways, I'm glad I missed that second term” when he lost to Joe Biden. 

“Because I wouldn't be president for that,” Trump said, as the crowd laughed. “In addition, we have the World Cup and we have the Olympics. Can you imagine? I missed that four years. And now look what I have, I have everything. Amazing the way things work out.”

Prior to speaking, Trump placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a somber tradition for U.S. presidents. The president paused after placing the wreath, then stepped back and saluted during the playing of taps. Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth joined him. 

The president began the day with a decidedly different tone. 

In a social media message in all capital letters, Trump ranted at Biden, calling him the “scum” who spent the last four years trying to destroy the country with radical leftism and who, he said, left behind an open border.

That was after he posted a separate message proclaiming “HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY!” Wishing people a happy Memorial Day is regarded as verboten because the day is considered a somber one to honor soldiers killed in service.

Vance emphasized as much when he spoke to U.S. Naval Academy graduates in Annapolis on Friday, when he said that he and Trump would “lead the most solemn occasion in our nation, Memorial Day at Arlington Cemetery. 

“You will learn as I have that when people say things like ‘Happy Memorial Day,' you appreciate the sentiment behind it but know that it's wrong because Memorial Day is not a happy day,” Vance said last week. “Memorial Day is not for those who served and came home, it is for those who served that didn't.”

Quantum error correction [1–4] is essential for bridging the gap between the error rates of physical devices and the extremely low error rates required for quantum algorithms. Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors [5–8] have focused primarily on the surface code [9], which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. The color code [10] enables more efficient logic, but it requires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures like superconducting qubits is challenging, and realizations of color codes [11–19] have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here, we present a comprehensive demonstration of the color code on a superconducting processor [8]. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of Λ3/5 = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the threshold of the color code, and the color code may become more efficient than the surface code following modest device improvements. We test transversal Clifford gates with logical randomized benchmarking [20] and inject magic states [21], a key resource for universal computation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99 % with post-selection. Finally, we teleport logical states between color codes using lattice surgery [22]. This work establishes the color code as a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation on superconducting processors in the near future.

					By Greg Evans 

NY & Broadway Editor


	When Jonathan Spector first staged his now-Tony-nominated play Eureka Day in 2017, he couldn't have known just how timely it would be eight years later. The Manhattan Theatre Club's Broadway production, directed by Anna D. Shapiro, was a twice-extended hit with critics and audiences last fall, earning raves for its very funny look at the chaos and infighting that erupts at the very progressive (and fictional) Eureka Day School in Berkeley, California, when a mumps outbreak forces the board of directors to issue a vaccine mandate.


	After the production closed in November, the plan for Eureka Day was a staging at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Then along came Donald Trump in February, taking over as the Kennedy Center chairman, filling the board with his acolytes. Scheduled shows began disappearing from the arts institution line-up, and one of the first to go – for “financial reasons,” the center said – was Eureka Day.












	Deadline spoke with Spector about the cancellation – his response might surprise you – as well as how he came to write this season's funniest scene on Broadway that didn't feature Mary Todd Lincoln. (See a clip of the scene below.)




			Watch on Deadline		







Eureka Day has been nominated for two Tony Awards: Best Revival of a Play and Best Featured Actress in a Play for Jessica Hecht. In addition to Hecht, the original Broadway cast featured Amber Gray, Bill Irwin, Thomas Middleditch, Chelsea Yakura-Kurtz and Ebony Flowers. 


This interview was condensed and edited for length and clarity.


Deadline: Did you ever think in 2017 that Eureka Day would fare as well as it has, or that it would be so on point in 2025?


SPECTOR: I certainly never imagined that it would have so much life beyond Berkeley. You know, it was commissioned for a theater in Berkeley – and I was living in Berkeley – and really I was just trying to write something that would be the most Berkeley thing I could for that audience and that theater. And people responded really positively to it in that first production in Berkeley, but you know, I didn't really know if that was just because people like seeing themselves reflected on stage. Would it actually resonate with anybody outside of Berkeley?

	











	So it was really exciting to see how much people connected to it I guess in that classic universality through specificity kind of thing. 


	And then with the pandemic, I was very strange. Any time you write a play, at least when I write a play but I think most people, you become very obsessed with something to the degree that you're much more obsessed with it than everybody else and they get annoyed hearing you talk about it. So it was very strange that what felt like a private obsession of mine became sort of a global obsession. We all had to wrestle with these ideas and these terms and these realities and these choices.


DEADLINE: So was there something specific that piqued your interest in the subject of vaccines three years before Covid?


SPECTOR: Yeah. There had been a little sort of controversy uptick in California because in 2014 there was an outbreak of measles at Disneyland and at that point California had one of the loosest vaccine requirements in the country and had what's called a personal belief exemption. So, you could just say I don't believe in vaccines and then that was it. And then following that outbreak, a couple of years later they changed to have one of the strictest school vaccination requirements in the country.


	There was a lot of agita about that, and so it was sort of in the air a little bit but more specifically it was having the experience a couple of times of talking to somebody who was a friend or an acquaintance, somebody who was like really smart, at least as well educated as me, and more importantly with whom I shared pretty much all the same politics and values and then discovering they don't vaccinate their kids. Like, how is that we can basically agree on everything except for this one thing where we seem to live in different realities? I was curious about that and sort of started to follow that.


	Part of the impetus for writing it was also that at that time vaccines were maybe the only contentious issue that was not correlated with politics. Knowing somebody didn't vaccinate their kids didn't automatically tell you if they were liberal or conservative because there were vaccine skeptics on the fringes of both sides but they got there by different ways.


	And then that got totally scrambled by COVID and by Trump and now if you know somebody doesn't vaccinate their kids you can guess pretty well what their politics are. It was quite shocking because I had done all these interviews with experts when I was researching the play and one thing everybody would say is that we know it's extremely difficult to change people's minds about vaccines once they have a firmly held view, and then that turned out not to be true when Donald Trump gets involved. He can actually change the points of view of enormous numbers of people on both sides. 


	A woman I interviewed who had not vaccinated her kids and she herself was not vaccinated but when Covid hit she got the Covid vaccine as quickly as possible in part I think because not getting the vaccine was what the Trump people did and she didn't want to be associated with that. Whether that was conscious or not I think that dynamic was sort of at play.


DEADLINE: For so many of us who grew up with vaccines as just a part of life, who are old enough to have the little round smallpox vaccine scar on our arms, the vaccine skepticism just seemed to come out of nowhere. Did it start with the quickly debunked autism correlation?












SPECTOR: I think that was a shift, and now it is so strongly enforced by the fractured way we receive information with social media and TikTok. The thing that I think is very strange about this current moment is that historically if you had a community that had a low rate of vaccination and there was an outbreak and people got sick, suddenly everybody was like oh shit I've got to get vaccinated. But that isn't happening now even while we're having the biggest measles outbreak in decades and kids have died. Whether it's partisan identity or information, something strange is happening where even kids dying is not breaking through. It's just pretty scary.


	And it doesn't help when you have the official information from the Department of Health and Human Services coming out and promoting skepticism of vaccines. You know, in that live stream scene in the play there's this comment that I had kind of gone back and forth about whether I should cut it because I was like maybe it's just too extreme, but it's where somebody says something about how all these vaccines are made from the cells of dead fetuses, and then Robert Kennedy said that in a press conference two weeks ago.


DEADLINE: I was going to ask you about that scene later but since you brought it up let's talk about it. Besides, we're sounding way too serious because one thing everyone needs to understand about Eureka Day is that it is a funny, funny play. Describe the scene you're talking about.


SPECTOR: Sure. So, the school had started to have these big town hall meetings where they'd get everybody together and endlessly talk for hours and hours whenever they had a kind of issue to work through. But now they're dealing with an outbreak of mumps so they can't gather in person. Instead they decide to have a sort of live streamed conversation, with the board of directors all in a room together and then the parents at home watching and commenting [in a chat box].


	It begins to go very quickly off the rails with the parents both kind of sidetracking the conversation for their own obsessions, which is what always happens to online conversations. But there's also the disconnect of having the board in a room reading the comments as people get more and more worked up and vicious with each other as always happens in conversations like this. Back in the pre-Covid days of 2017 people didn't know that this was such a bad idea.


DEADLINE: You must have done tons of research just to see how people talk on the internet because you absolutely nailed it.


SPECTOR: You know, I hadn't myself been in a lot of conversations like that yet when I was writing that scene in 2017. I mean the technology in the play was Facebook Live, which I think now is forgotten technology but it was what people were beginning to use at the time for this kind of thing.When I was researching the play I was looking at internet message boards where people would argue with each other about vaccines and they would just get so nasty with each other. 


DEADLINE: I'd guess most people who have not seen the play imagine it is vert hard on the anti-vaxxers. But one of the characters, Suzanne, played by Jessica Hecht who is up for a Tony, is very anti-vaccine and she's so sympathetic and she's so smart and engaging that we start thinking well maybe she does have a point.


SPECTOR: The character has a bit of a tragic arc through the play in that she has committed her life to building this community and then because of this irreconcilable conflict that she's ultimately forced to leave it. There is something tragic in that even if I personally disagree with her beliefs. But of course, anytime you're writing anything..it's much more interesting if the people you disagree have the most honest and complex reasons for thinking what they think rather than just being strong man idiots.

	











	When I was researching the play I watched this sort of fake documentary by Andrew Wakefield, the doctor who first claimed the link between autism and vaccines and he lost his medical license on that. Of course he's a charlatan but they also interview these parents who have kids with severe developmental disabilities that they believe was caused by a vaccine. Now even if I think they're wrong about what they think happened, the pain they're feeling is real. Something about that really hit me. Just because somebody may not be right doesn't mean they're not feeling all the things they're feeling.


DEADLINE: The play begins as a sort of parody of these wealthy, privileged, California liberals who live in their little bubble, but then grows in other ways…


SPECTOR: No. I honestly never thought of it as a parody or even to some degree satire, but as a realistic portrayal, which I actually think is how it was received by people in Berkeley in 2017. One of the things that's happened in the years since is that the space in the culture for quote, wokism and that was not even a word people were using at the time…People have a lot of feelings about it now, especially after the election, in a way that they didn't back then. The play was received in 2017 kind of like, oh that's just how these people in California are. It wasn't freighted in the same way that it is now.


DEADLINE: Can I ask you about the Kennedy Center situation and what happened with Eureka Day getting canceled there?


SPECTOR: Had the show gone forward there, in a sense it would have been great to be having that conversation at the Kennedy Center at this moment when, you know, the director of Health and Human Services is a Kennedy who is creating a lot of real harm in the country by spreading vaccine and other kinds of medical misinformation.


	But at the same time I think it would have been really difficult to be there because once Trump has appointed himself king of the Kennedy Center and they've fired a lot of people and pushed out a lot of artists for political reasons, I don't know if it's possible to be there and not on some level sort of be complicit in all that. So if a show is a big hit and they sell out, then it can be claimed as proof of how well they're doing. On the other hand if nobody comes to see it then what's the point of doing it at all. I feel like you're caught in an impossible situation as an artist.


DEADLINE: Do you feel you were pushed out for political reasons?


SPECTOR: I don't exactly know how it went down but I was, in the end, relieved that we weren't going there. I feel like there were really good compelling arguments on both sides. I just had a play in Florida at a theater called Miami New Drama and it's run by a man named Michel Hausmann who fled Venezuela because of anti-Semitism and political oppression, and he was saying, “No, you should fight to stay because the mistake we made in Venezuela was giving up our cultural spaces too easily rather than forcing them to take them away from us.”


	I was really compelled by that but I was also compelled by the idea that you can't be there and make your work with clean hands. 


DEADLINE: The official word from the Kennedy Center is that it's truly financial decisions that were driving these cancellations but when you look at the shows that were canceled, there was Eureka Day and there was the kid's musical about a gay shark. There was gay pride programming that was canceled. You start seeing a pattern. I'm just curious if they actually conveyed anything to you or to your team what's really happening?












SPECTOR: Nothing has ever been communicated that got to me of anybody explicitly saying that there's a political reason.


DEADLINE: Where does Eureka Day go from here and who gets to see it? Are there any upcoming productions and is there any possibility of TV adaptation or a film?


SPECTOR: Yes to all of those things. There are conversations about a film adaptation. There had been earlier conversations about doing it as a series but I don't really feel like it makes as much sense. So, yeah, I've had some conversations. And there will be a lot of regional productions and international productions next season, the fall season. It looks like Eureka Day will have a lot of life next season, which is really exciting.
