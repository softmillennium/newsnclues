                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Climate change and extreme weather events are threatening the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of young adolescents in Kenya, according to a new study published earlier this month in BMJ Global Health. The study reveals that food, water, and sanitation insecurities are placing young adolescents aged 10-14, especially girls, at increased risk of school dropout, transactional sex, gender-based violence, and early pregnancy. In our study, we heard stories from young adolescents and community elders describing how drought, floods, and resource shortages are pushing children to drop out of school or exchange sex for food, water, or menstrual products." Dr. Carmen Logie, Lead Author, Professor at the University of Toronto's Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work (FIFSW) and Canada Research Chair in Global Health Equity and Social Justice with Marginalized Populations The study involved 297 participants, including 119 elders and 178 young adolescents across six climate-affected regions in Kenya: Mathare, Kisumu, Isiolo, Naivasha, Kilifi, and Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement. Using focus groups, walk-along interviews, and participatory mapping workshops, the study examined how climate change-induced resource insecurities are shaping SRH risks among youth. "Girls told us about the shame of not having clean clothes or menstrual supplies, and how it led them to stay home from school or enter exploitative relationships just to meet basic needs," says co-author Aryssa Hasham, Research Officer at FIFSW. The study identified multiple direct and indirect pathways linking extreme weather events to poor SRH outcomes. Lack of access to safe sanitation contributed to menstruation-related school absences and coercive sexual encounters in exchange for menstrual supplies. The authors call for climate-informed SRH interventions tailored to the realities of young adolescents in low-resource, high-risk settings. Their findings offer a roadmap for policy makers, NGOs, and health systems working at the intersection of environmental justice and adolescent health. "We must act quickly to develop climate-informed, adolescent-centred, and gender-transformative programs," says co-author Dr. Julia Kagunda, Director of Elim Trust. "These programs must address the root causes of insecurity to protect young people's health and futures."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although studies identified adenocarcinoma-like driver mutations in LSCC using next-generation sequencing (NGS), the disease is challenging to treat due to the limited number of detectable mutations for targeted drug therapy. This study aimed to evaluate the mutation profiles of LSCC detected by NGS to assess the relationships between different driver mutations and clinicopathological parameters. NGS with a panel of 72 cancer-related genes was used to evaluate the driver mutation profiles of 41 lung resection specimens from patients with LSCC at the Molecular Pathology Laboratory of Aydın Adnan Menderes University in Türkiye. Clinical and histopathological features were recorded for analysis. Detection of 94 mutations in 23 genes in DNA extracted from the tissue samples of 36 patients revealed that the most prevalent mutations were TP53 (30.85%), NF1 (20.20%), PTEN (11.70%), PIK3CA (5.31%), FBXW7 (4.25%), KRAS (3.20%), respectively. In the era of personalized medicine, treatment for LSCC lags behind that for LADC, but new developments in this field. Careful selection of therapeutic targets is essential, as grouping multiple alterations together may lead to the oversight of true driver mutations. Similarly, drug selection and potential combinations will play a crucial role In treatment efficacy. Given the molecular heterogeneity observed in LSCC, it is imperative to ascertain the mutational profile in all LSCC patients to identify driver mutations that are amenable to targeted therapy. Our data suggest that certain histopathological features may be associated with mutations, providing reliable information to enhance treatment and follow-up decisions. Çetin, N. K., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent study published in Engineering delves into the advancements in wound management, specifically focusing on microenvironment-sensitive bioactive dressings for diabetic wounds. Diabetic wounds (DWs) are a major complication of diabetes mellitus. The lifetime risk of developing DWs for diabetics ranges from 19% to 34%, and the recurrence rate is high, posing a significant challenge to patient health. In the hemostasis phase, patients with diabetes often experience abnormal platelet aggregation and fibrin network formation. The inflammatory phase is prolonged due to impaired immune cell function, imbalance of inflammatory mediators, enhanced oxidative stress, microvascular complications, and an increased risk of secondary infections. The microenvironment of DWs is characterized by high glucose levels, persistent inflammation, persistent infection, hypoxia, disordered factors, and dynamic pH disruption. High glucose promotes the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which not only extend the inflammatory response but also affect the migration and proliferation of key healing cells. Persistent inflammation is caused by factors such as excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and imbalanced macrophage polarization. Hypoxia impairs the functionality of cellular populations and angiogenesis. The pH of DWs is often alkaline, which promotes bacterial growth. To address these challenges, researchers have developed microenvironment-sensitive bioactive dressings with on-demand regulation. These dressings can be classified into passive and active on-demand management strategies. However, the clinical application of bioactive dressings still faces challenges. The biosafety of innovative materials needs to be rigorously analyzed, and they must comply with regulatory standards. Future research should focus on smart response mechanisms, delivery system construction, biocompatibility, mechanical property optimization, integration of sensors, and multifunctional design to further improve the efficacy of these dressings in treating diabetic wounds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This could make KRAS-mutated colon cancer more treatable than previously thought. Our results show that EGFR, a receptor on the cell surface of many cells, also plays an active role in KRAS-mutated colorectal tumours - and in a different way than previously thought. This finding contradicts the long-held assumption that this receptor has no therapeutic relevance in tumors with a KRAS mutation." Using so-called tumor organoids - mini-tumours made from colon cancer cells isolated from specific mouse models - the research team was able to demonstrate that the removal of EGFR has a profound effect on the metabolism of cancer cells. The cells processed sugar and amino acids in a completely different way - an indication of new vulnerabilities in KRAS-mutated tumours. In addition, EGFR blockade activated a specific gene signature associated with longer survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with KRAS mutations. EGFR was previously considered an ineffective therapeutic target in KRAS-mutated tumours. However, metabolic analyses have now shown that EGFR blockade in colorectal organoids slows down sugar metabolism (glycolysis) and causes tumour cells to switch to glutamine instead - a fundamental change in cell metabolism. At the same time, key growth signalling pathways were significantly weakened. Also surprising was the observed reduction in cell size and the activation of stem cell signatures and the Wnt signaling pathway known to be involved in CRC development - an indication that the tumor cells respond to EGFR blockade with an alternative developmental program. The Smoc2 gene was discovered to play a key role in these processes: it is responsible for rewiring the cell metabolism and for activating new signalling networks. By analysing extensive patient data sets, the researchers were also able to show that the identified gene signature is associated with better survival in patients with KRAS-mutated CRC. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for why EGFR also plays a role in KRAS-mutated tumours - and call into question the current practice of excluding such patients from EGFR-targeted therapies. Although clinical trials are still pending, the data show that KRAS-mutated CRC may be more treatable than previously thought. "This research shows how important it is to critically question assumptions - especially in diseases for which there are currently few effective therapies," emphasizes study leader Maria Sibilia, Head of the Center for Cancer Research at MedUni Vienna.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new guideline to diagnose and treat hypertension is aimed at helping primary care clinicians, including family physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists, manage the disease. Hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor for heart disease and death, affecting about 1 in 4 adults in Canada. Canada has been a leader in hypertension treatment and control, but this success has been on the downward trend in recent years. Discrepancies in optimal blood pressure targets, complex guideline recommendations, less engagement with front-line health care providers and other factors may be fuelling this decline. As primary care is where most hypertension is managed, supporting primary care practitioners to better diagnose and manage this disease will improve hypertension care at the population level and benefit people in Canada. We hope these practical recommendations will help with implementing hypertension care in everyday clinical practice." Developed by Hypertension Canada, the guideline uses the World Health Organization's (WHO) HEARTS framework to improve cardiovascular health around the globe with an adaptable approach that can be tailored to countries' unique needs. In the part of the United States where it was developed, it improved local hypertension control rates from 44% to 90% in just over a decade. The guideline, based on the latest evidence, provides recommendations most relevant to primary care on assessing blood pressure (BP) and definitions of hypertension for diagnosis, healthy lifestyle changes, and pharmacotherapy for treatment, including hard-to-treat hypertension. In selecting medications to treat hypertension, the guideline committee considered efficacy, tolerability, cost, coverage, availability, protection from future drug shortages, and ability to split pills. One important change is a lower threshold for BP targets. "The lower BP thresholds adopted for both defining hypertension and treatment targets relative to previous Hypertension Canada guidelines means that more people will be labelled as having hypertension, which may have meaningful personal implications, like stigma, insurance coverage, and more," says guideline co-chair Dr. Greg Hundemer. In addition, 4 patient partners with lived experience of hypertension provided feedback during guideline development and helped create a patient support tool. Separate guidelines are available for these patient populations. Rather, it is a complement to an upcoming comprehensive guideline aimed to help with more complex and nuanced aspects of hypertension management, such as resistant hypertension, but should cover about 95% of most uncomplicated hypertension cases in the community," says Dr. Rémi Goupil, guideline co-chair.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new global review reveals how rapidly evolving H5 bird flu viruses are reaching new species, including dairy cattle, and stresses the urgent need for coordinated action to prevent the next pandemic. Note: Layout incorporates two CDC transmission electron micrographs that have been inverted, repositioned, and colorized by NIAID. Since its discovery in 1996, the Gs/Gd lineage of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses with H5 haemagglutinin, including H5N1 and other H5Nx subtypes, has caused widespread infections and mortality among numerous animal species and sporadic infections among humans, with outbreaks now reaching every continent, even Antarctica. Influenza A viruses have caused four human pandemics and countless outbreaks among animal populations in the past century. Among them, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) pose a major threat due to their ability to evolve rapidly. While most avian influenza viruses circulate harmlessly among wild waterbirds, some have mutated into more deadly forms, particularly the H5 and H7 subtypes. When these viruses spill over to poultry, they can evolve into highly pathogenic forms that cause severe disease and death. The Gs/Gd lineage of H5 viruses, which includes the well-known H5N1 subtype (first identified in humans in Hong Kong in 1997) and other H5Nx variants, emerged from a complex mix of avian viruses and has since diversified into numerous lineages. This lineage has become a dominant global threat, spreading across continents and infecting a wide range of birds and mammals. Furthermore, despite ongoing surveillance and control efforts, gaps remain in understanding how this virus spreads, evolves, and adapts to new hosts, including humans. The researchers conducted a comprehensive review of scientific literature, surveillance reports, and genetic analyses to understand the evolution and spread of highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza viruses of the Gs/Gd lineage. They traced the virus's origins back to a 1996 outbreak in domestic geese in Guangdong, China, and followed its genetic diversification through global outbreaks over the past 25 years. The team examined how the virus has changed through a process known as reassortment, where gene segments from different influenza viruses mix in co-infected hosts, creating new virus variants. This included reviewing molecular data on mutations in viral proteins, including hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and polymerase components, that help the virus adapt to mammalian cells. Structural features of hemagglutinin that affect binding to host receptors, as well as changes in viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase that enhance replication in mammals, were examined. The virus, which originally circulated in poultry, has now spread to wild birds and mammals, including rare spillovers into humans. Most alarmingly, it has recently reached dairy cattle in the United States, where it has spread primarily due to the movement of infected animals between farms. Contaminated milking equipment facilitates transmission within farms and causes widespread infections. The virus has now been detected on every continent, including Antarctica, marking an unprecedented expansion. Its ability to reassort with other influenza viruses has also generated multiple variants, including those with new gene combinations that enhance adaptation to mammals. This genetic mixing has also improved the virus's ability to bind to human-like receptors and resist mammals' innate immune defenses. Since 1997, there have been over 1,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of Gs/Gd lineage infections in humans, with more than 500 reported deaths; however, the true case fatality rate is uncertain due to likely underreporting of mild and subclinical infections and variability in severity between outbreaks. Most infections occurred after direct contact with infected poultry, but recent cases in the U.S. involving dairy farm workers suggested new transmission routes. Though sustained human-to-human transmission has not occurred, the increase in mild or undetected human infections raises concerns about pandemic potential. The virus has also had devastating impacts on wildlife, with high mortality among sea lions, seals, and birds being documented across the Americas and Europe. Mammal-to-mammal transmission, especially in farmed mink and sea lion colonies, also indicates that the virus may be evolving toward more efficient spread among mammals. The review highlights that available options for managing outbreaks in wildlife are limited and may include carcass removal and targeted vaccination of endangered species. With increasing evidence of cross-species transmission and global distribution, this virus remains a looming concern. The review highlights the critical need for a unified “One Health” approach that integrates animal, human, and environmental health strategies at a global level. The review indicated that strengthening surveillance, advancing vaccine strategies, expanding the use of newer vaccine technologies, coordinating international vaccine stockpiling and deployment, and integrating efforts across animal and human health sectors are crucial steps towards preventing future outbreaks and reducing the risk of a potential pandemic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drinking more alcohol, especially beer or liquor, modestly raises your risk of pancreatic cancer, according to one of the world's largest and most comprehensive studies. Study: Alcohol intake and pancreatic cancer risk: An analysis from 30 prospective studies across Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. The analysis of a large-scale dataset derived from four continents identified a modest positive association between alcohol intake and pancreatic cancer risk. Pancreatic cancer is the 12th most common cancer worldwide, associated with a high mortality rate when diagnosed at advanced stages. It accounted for 5% of all cancer-related deaths worldwide in 2022. The incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer are 4-5 times higher in Europe, North America, Australia, and Eastern Asia compared to other regions. Smoking, obesity, chronic pancreatitis, and diabetes mellitus are some of the major risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Evidence linking alcohol intake to pancreatic cancer risk remains inconclusive, despite the classification of alcohol as a group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). A previous analysis of large-scale observational data from 14 cohorts in the Pooling Project of Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer showed that the risk of pancreatic cancer can increase by 22% in individuals who consume at least 30 grams of alcohol per day, which is equivalent to two US standard alcoholic drinks per day. However, the majority of existing studies showed inconsistent associations by type of alcoholic drinks and across geographical regions. The study analyzed population-based, individual-level data from 30 prospective studies across four continents: Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. The pooled dataset included a total of 2,494,432 participants without cancer at baseline. In analyzed studies, self-reported information on alcohol intake (in grams of ethanol per day) was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire or a lifestyle questionnaire. The first primary incident of pancreatic cancer cases were determined by self-report with subsequent medical record review, cancer registry linkage, or both approaches. A significant positive association was observed between alcohol intake and pancreatic cancer risk. No significant impact of participants' gender or smoking status was found on the observed association. The reference group for risk comparison was light drinkers (0.1 to less than 5 grams per day), not absolute non-drinkers, to reduce bias from former drinkers. The analysis adjusted for a range of confounders, including detailed smoking variables (status, duration, intensity, and cessation), diabetes, body mass index, physical activity, education, and race/ethnicity. Among the analyzed geographical regions, the positive association between alcohol intake and pancreatic cancer risk was observed in Europe, Australia, and North America. However, in Asia, this association was not present. Among tested alcoholic drinks, beer and liquor were identified as significant risk factors for pancreatic cancer. However, no significant association was observed between drinking alcohol from wine and the risk of pancreatic cancer. The study reveals that intake of alcohol, especially beer and liquor, moderately increases the risk of pancreatic cancer in both men and women, irrespective of previous or current smoking habits. The study mentions explicitly that compared to light drinkers (drinking 0.1 to 5 grams per day), men who consume at least 30 grams of alcohol per day and women who consume at least 15 grams of alcohol per day are at higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer. A stronger association has been observed for alcohol intake of 60 grams per day or more. For women, risk categories were combined for those consuming 30 grams per day or more due to limited numbers at the highest intake levels. Asian populations have a higher prevalence of genes encoding for the fast alcohol dehydrogenase metabolizer and slow aldehyde dehydrogenase metabolizer than Whites. Asian people who carry these genotypes experience flushing reactions in response to alcohol ingestion and tend to either avoid or drink less alcohol. This explains the observation that alcohol intake is not associated with higher pancreatic cancer risk among Asians. Alcohol as a carcinogen can trigger inflammation, oxidative stress, free radical production, microbiota dysbiosis, and DNA damage. Notably, the study finds that previous or current smoking habits do not influence the negative impact of alcohol intake on pancreatic cancer risk. This observation does not refute the well-established impact of smoking on pancreatic cancer risk, but rather suggests that the effect of alcohol on pancreatic carcinogenesis is independent of smoking habit. The study analyzed a single timepoint data on participants' alcohol intake during mid-to-late adulthood and included a limited number of Asian cohorts.
