Please note there may be errors present which affect the content, and all legal disclaimers apply. Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors [5–8] have focused primarily on the surface code [9], which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures like superconducting qubits is challenging, and realizations of color codes [11–19] have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of Λ3/5 = 1.56(4). Finally, we teleport logical states between color codes using lattice surgery [22].

The University of Hong Kong (HKU) is offering international students at Harvard dedicated scholarships, accommodation assistance and guidance on transferring academic credit, according to a letter addressed to them, which was posted on X yesterday by Zhigang Suo, a materials engineer at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “We recognise that recent developments in the US may have created significant uncertainties for many international students. HKU stands ready to welcome affected students at Harvard who wish to explore options and pathways for continuing their studies with us,” a spokesperson for the university told Nature. The US Department of Homeland Security, which terminated Harvard's ability to enroll and host international students on 22 May, said in a press release that the university had “created an unsafe campus environment by permitting anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators to harass and physically assault individuals, including many Jewish students.” Harvard hosts more than 7,000 international undergraduate and postgraduate students with visas. It is extreme cruelty for the government to make innocent people collateral damage,” says Suo. Harvard has become a target of the Trump administration in recent weeks.

(2025)Cite this article The psychedelic drug psilocybin demonstrates rapid and long-lasting efficacy across neuropsychiatric disorders that are characterized by behavioral inflexibility. However, its impact on the neural activity underlying sustained changes in behavioral flexibility has not been characterized. To test whether psilocybin enhances behavioral flexibility by altering activity in cortical neural ensembles, we performed longitudinal single-cell calcium imaging in the mouse retrosplenial cortex across a 5-day trace fear learning and extinction assay. We found that a single dose of psilocybin altered cortical ensemble turnover and oppositely modulated fear- and extinction-active neurons. Suppression of fear-active neurons and recruitment of extinction-active neurons predicted psilocybin-enhanced fear extinction. In a computational model of this microcircuit, inhibition of simulated fear-active units modulated recruitment of extinction-active units and behavioral variability in freezing, aligning with experimental results. These results suggest that psilocybin enhances behavioral flexibility by recruiting new neuronal populations and suppressing fear-active populations in the retrosplenial cortex.
