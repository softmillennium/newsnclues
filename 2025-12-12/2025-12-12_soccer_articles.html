                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The manager believes both player adaptation and tactical integration are essential as Gyokeres searches for form. After an injury setback and a slow Premier League start, expectations remain high for the summer arrival. Gyokeres arrived at Arsenal in the summer after scoring heavily for Sporting CP, but his transition to the Premier League has been slower than expected. The striker managed just one league goal since September and missed crucial development time after joining without a proper pre-season and then picking up an injury. Despite Gyokeres' struggles, Arsenal have remained competitive, but Arteta is aware that the No.9 position must eventually provide greater scoring output. With Gabriel Jesus returning to fitness, competition for minutes is intensifying at a key point in the campaign. As pressure around Gyokeres grows, questions have been raised about whether Arsenal must change their approach to suit him or whether he must mould himself to their tactical demands. Arteta, addressing this balance directly, outlined the combined responsibility needed from both sides. His explanation offers the clearest insight yet into how the club sees Gyokeres' long-term development and what must happen for his £64m move to be considered a success. Addressing Gyokeres' progress and fitness, Arteta said: “Those interactions, that understanding, how it develops. And before the injury, I think he was in a great place. That's logical, but for the rest, I think he's in a really good place. Arsenal believe his profile still fits the long-term vision, especially with Arteta seeking more vertical threat and penalty-box presence. Players who join late or return from injury often struggle with Arsenal's high-intensity demands, which rely on timing, pressing structure and positional rotations. Gyokeres' lack of rhythm made it difficult for him to integrate in the same way as those who completed a full summer programme. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Arsenal plan to continue giving Gyokeres minutes as he rebuilds sharpness, but he now faces competition from Jesus, whose return naturally increases expectations for goal output. Arteta is convinced that Gyokeres will eventually “explode” once adaptation and tactical cohesion fully align, but patience will be required from fans and analysts alike. If Gyokeres can begin converting chances, the long-term outlook changes dramatically, as Arsenal believe he has all the tools to become a top Premier League striker. Should the drought continue, pressure will inevitably increase, but Arteta remains publicly unwavering in his support.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fabrice Coffrini / AFP via Getty Images Ticket prices released by FIFA this week for the men's World Cup in 2026 were, on average, 174 per cent higher than projected in the official bid book submitted by the joint proposal from the United States, Canada and Mexico to soccer's world governing body. As part of an official FIFA process to be considered to host a World Cup, bidding nations must submit a bid book, which can be studied by both FIFA and federations across the world, who in turn judge its merits and decide who to vote for. The so-called ‘United' bid, which brought the American, Canadian and Mexican bids together under one umbrella, was published by FIFA in March 2018. The bid said that it made projections after “careful research and consultation with various resources and industry experts.” This week, in a phase which opened on Thursday, FIFA sold tickets in its “lottery phase” for specific matches, adjusting its prices based on the anticipated demand for each fixture. The vanishingly small number of Category Four tickets available in previous phases of sales were not present at all for this lottery phase. This represents an increase of 204 per cent for those seeking to watch the USMNT play Paraguay, Mexico play South Africa, or Canada play the winner of a UEFA playoff between Wales, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Italy, or Northern Ireland. An even more dramatic increase is present in the average price across the three categories for the World Cup final, which will take place at MetLife Stadium in New York/New jersey on July 19. While the bid book projected an average price of $1,099 across the three categories, FIFA has increased this by 459 per cent, with their average at $6147. The increases in the group stage, round of 32 and round of 16 is more modest, but still substantial, with increases of 49 per cent, 61 per cent and 94 per cent respectively. FIFA's elimination of category four tickets also counters the projections in the bid book, which had indicated that seven per cent of available seating would be set aside for the lowest price point. FIFA did have some of these available in previous phases of sales, priced at $60 for some group stage matchups, but they never confirmed how many existed and those which did appeared to be very small in number, often limited to the upper corners of upper decks of NFL stadiums. Football Supporters Europe has called on FIFA to “immediately halt” ticket sales for participating member associations (PMA) due to what it calls a “monumental betrayal of the tradition of the World Cup”. FIFA has been approached for comment but did not do so by the time of publication. Adam Crafton  is a British journalist based in New York City, having relocated from London in 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than two dozen American cities are eager to host matches as part of U.S. Soccer's joint bid with Mexico, Jamaica and Costa Rica for the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup. Those cities, however, declined to sign long-form agreements that FIFA expected ahead of last month's bid deadline. So far, they have only been willing to sign non-binding, one-page memorandums of understanding provided by U.S. Soccer. These fall well short of the commitments required to make the bid compliant with FIFA's rules, which state that host city and stadium agreement templates must be submitted “signed and in unaltered form.” FIFA plans to formally award hosting rights to the four Concacaf member nations at its annual congress on April 30, 2026, in Vancouver. Whether it will do so without more concrete commitments from American host cities remains to be seen. Under the agreements they signed in 2017, those cities have taken on most of the costs of hosting matches and FIFA fan fests — a burden local leaders have pegged at $100 million to $200 million per city — while having limited ability to generate offsetting revenue. Each city is allowed to sell up to 10 supporter packages (apart from New York/New Jersey, which can sell 20), but the 16 host cities across the U.S., Mexico and Canada have thus far combined to announce only 35 supporters, or 2.2 per city, with six months remaining before the tournament. FIFA has softened some of its most onerous demands on 2026 host cities, eliminating a requirement that cities provide free public transportation to matches and offering them more flexibility to determine the scope of their fan fests. “There's had to be this growth and evolution between when the [2026] bid was first sent out to all of us and where we are today,” Zaileen Janmohamed, president and CEO of the Bay Area Host Committee, said at a public event in June. “There has been some progress in that, and I think that progress will continue for the Women's World Cup. Several representatives for prospective host cities spoke with Sports Business Journal on the condition of anonymity to ensure FIFA doesn't hold their participation against their market in the selection process. They all stressed that they want to host the competition, but need certainty the terms will be more favorable than in 2026. U.S. Soccer issued a statement, saying in part, “We look forward to continued collaboration with local partners and FIFA as we prepare to deliver a tournament of unprecedented success and drive the women's game forward.” In April 2025, U.S. Soccer formally confirmed its interest in teaming with other Concacaf member nations to bid for the 2031 Women's World Cup. At an information session for leaders from interested cities in July, U.S. Soccer assured the cities that FIFA's terms would be more practical and take their concerns into account, but the national federation could not yet provide details. It wasn't until early November — weeks before the bid submission deadline — that the cities got their first look at FIFA's proposed terms. With the cities themselves, those included public transit and fan fest requirements. Even with those assurances, though, host city leaders were uncomfortable signing the underlying agreement. For starters, the cities are seeking to negotiate new terms on a much wider range of issues than were carved out in the side letters, including potential revenue sharing. Furthermore, several city leaders felt it was unreasonable to be given mere weeks to commit to terms for an event more than five years away, particularly with some in the throes of preparation for the 2026 men's event. “Some of these things have to go in front of city councils and get approvals, and that just doesn't happen overnight,” one host city leader said. Multiple sources said leaders from nearly all of the prospective U.S. host cities signed a draft letter to FIFA informing the governing body of their decision to decline to sign the agreements and requesting broader negotiations. The cities agreed and are now awaiting guidance from either FIFA or U.S. Soccer on next steps. Despite U.S. Soccer's previous insistence that it only wants to host the event if it benefits host cities, several host city leaders said they are unsure whether U.S. Soccer will advocate for them in negotiations with FIFA or prioritize getting FIFA what it needs to secure the bid. A source with knowledge of U.S. Soccer's thinking said the organization is aiming to get firmer commitments than the MOUs from host cities ahead of the FIFA Congress in April, but there is an understanding that some key issues won't be resolved until after the 2026 World Cup. Those issues could be agreed upon during FIFA's 2031 host city selection process, which would likely take place in 2027. In that case, cities that are most amenable to FIFA's terms would likely have a leg up in the selection process. There's a widely held sentiment that the issues at stake are reconcilable.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scotland fans and politicians have criticised Fifa over its "outrageous" ticket prices for next summer's World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico. The Scottish Football Association (SFA) - which brokered a deal to secure priority tickets for Scotland Supporters' Club (SSC) members - said pricing was a matter for Fifa. World Cup ticket ballot opens - here's all you need to know BBC Scotland has asked football's world governing body for comment. Fans' group Football Supporters Europe have condemned the "extortionate" pricing strategy as have supporters' groups on both sides of the Scotland-England border. Politicians also united on the BBC's Question Time to voice their concerns. Steve Clarke's Scotland side qualified for the finals last month after a thrilling 4-2 Hampden victory over Denmark. Both fixtures will be played in the 63,815 capacity Boston Stadium. For the clash with five-time champions Brazil on 24 June Scotland have been granted 3,736 tickets. It will be played in the Miami stadium which has a capacity of 64,091. She told the BBC's Radio Scotland Breakfast programme: "They are just making it unaffordable for fans essentially." Karen, who lives in Glasgow, has decided not to enter the ballot. "We could go and soak up the atmosphere but, by the same token, we could just stay here and have a great party at home." Daris Nesbitt will be in the US for the tournament after booking a £300 flight from Barcelona to Boston before last Friday's draw. Daris, of Bishopton, Renfrewshire, also saved money by pre-booking 22 hotels in advance but he still faces a expensive trip. The IT analyst said: "I would say so far, totalling up, it has cost me about £4,000 - and that's before I even get a beer." "I know there's people on third party websites paying £1,000 for games." Supporters have also voiced their concerns on social media. Writing on X, Stephen Watson said: "I've followed Scotland home and away for 27 years in the SSC. Have a decent enough regular income; and I'm sitting here contemplating if I can afford/justify paying for a R32 ticket at the World Cup having already decided just to take in 2 group games. SPSA chief executive John MacLean also criticised the "poor level" of ticket allocations and what he described as the "unacceptable" dynamic pricing model. He said: "Fifa take your money, stick it in their back pocket for a game you might never go to and then give it back to you less an administration fee. "That's the worst bank you have ever heard of." Flynn told the programme that supporters were being "fleeced" and called on football bodies to get together and "demand an end to this". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the pricing structure was "utterly shameful". He added: "We all have to gang up with confederations and nations across the globe and say to Fifa: 'Not a chance'." Scottish Conservatives leader Russell Findlay, who travelled to France for Scotland's last World Cup appearance in 1998, said: "The ticket prices are completely outrageous." Findlay added that the Scottish government could help supporters at home by ensuring pubs are open "in the wee small hours" for Scotland's matches which kick off at 02:00 and 23:00. Former Conservative business and Scotland Office minister, Lord Malcolm Offord, who last week defected to Reform UK, plans to attend the Brazil match. He told the programme: "It is a commercial venture. But Lord Offord agreed with fellow panellist, journalist Angela Haggerty. He added: "The best parties will actually be at home." The 2026 World Cup will feature 48 teams and be played from 11 June to 19 July in 16 cities across the US, Canada and Mexico. On Monday, SSC members will be sent an access code to apply for Scotland's three group stage matches and potential knock-out matches. For each match that is oversubscribed, a ballot using a loyalty points system will be used to determine who is successful in receiving their chosen category ticket. "We are glad that this has been achieved and are preparing for the Participating Member Association sales window opening next week."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In World Cup parlance, Qatar was Fifa president Gianni Infantino's qualifier. Now it's the big time for Trump's dictator-curious protege I used to think Fifa's recent practice of holding the World Cup in autocracies was because it made it easier for world football's governing body to do the things it loved: spend untold billions of other people's money and siphon the profits without having to worry about boring little things like human rights or public opinion. Which, let's face it, really piss around with your bottom line. But for a while now, that view has seemed ridiculously naive, a bit like assuming Recep Erdoğan followed Vladimir Putin's election-hollowing gameplan just because hey, he's an interested guy who likes to read around a lot of subjects. So no: Fifa president Gianni Infantino hasn't spent recent tournaments cosying up to authoritarians because it made his life easier. And his latest decree this week simply confirms Fifa is now a fully operational autocracy in the classic populace-rinsing style. (Admittedly, still marginally cheaper than an off-peak single from London to Manchester.) Like all dictator-curious populists, Fifa loathes its people – the fans. Thinking back, I've even been at tournaments where the governing body has sponsored show trials. In South Africa in 2010, we had something called the Fifa World Cup Courts – 56 courts where Fifa indicated it had finally outgrown fast food tie-ins and slapped its branding on justice itself. Or rather, on summary justice – which became an official tournament partner as cases were rushed through to appease the governing body. Again, in retrospect that all seems rather small beer (sorry). Orange-coated faux fans are positively encouraged these days, but only if they come in the sole form of US president Donald Trump, whose bromance with Infantino has been one of the more mesmerisingly weird developments of his presidency. But now that we've seen Infantino pop up everywhere from Gaza peace conferences to regular turns in the Oval Office, it almost feels strange when he isn't part of Trump's malarial travelling court – the Dontourage, if you will. Whether Infantino will at some point end up in the woodchipper, just like everyone does with Trump, is unclear. For now, the president is enjoying having his tummies tickled. We have to come up with another name for the NFL. It really doesn't make sense when you think about it.” This is what happens when the president gets booed at the Super Bowl, instead of being given an inaugural award like he was at Infantino's fever dream of a draw. Yes, even though you couldn't believe the shamelessness until you actually saw it with your own eyes, it was incredibly credible that Infantino would indeed confect some nutty “Fifa peace prize” and award it to Trump. Furthermore, this World Cup is already shaping up to be the sort of reciprocally abusive arrangement we've seen when the tournament previously tipped up in non-democracies. Trump can use it to threaten Democrat mayors with loss of city hosting rights, while Infantino can charge genuinely crazy money and have Fifa run the entire secondary ticketing/scalping market without interference. Fifa elections have effectively been hollowed out by the strong-arm practice of buying off the votes of smaller nations via disproportionately large grants. The dictator makes sure countries know what's good for them. Maybe one day football will have some kind of revolution, in which hordes of endlessly oppressed people who actually like the sport will storm Infantino's Zurich palace, and loot all the valuable gifts of obscure provenance. Until then, we'll just have to accept that there is simply no one who cares less than Infantino, and simply no sport that hates its fans quite as much as football.</p>

If you're still hoping for a chance to see your favorite team play in Atlanta, the random selection phase of ticketing is on now and will continue until Jan. 13. Here's how to enter the draw. The Random Selection Draw period, the third round of ticketing, opened Dec. 11 and will remain open until Jan. 13 at 11 a.m. When you enter the drawing during that time will not impact your chances of winning a chance to purchase tickets, officials said. You will then be asked to choose what team you root for, where you'd like to see a match and your contact information. "Fans will be able to select which match(es), respective ticket category(ies), and number of tickets per match they'd like to purchase, subject to household restrictions," FIFA officials said. "All successful and partially successful ticket applicants will receive communications via email and subsequently will be automatically charged for their tickets in February. If you don't want to leave your World Cup dreams to chance, there are a few other options for purchasing tickets. First, if you would only like to attend a game for a specific team, you may be eligible for a Participating Member Association. Each association has their own process of designating tickets, but members may be able to purchase tickets from a section of tickets pre-determined for supports of their team. Information about PMAs is available on the FIFA ticketing site. Some fans can also purchase "premium, elevated matchday" ticket experiences through hospitality packages, found at FIFA.com/hospitality, or from On Location, the group curating the experiences for the World Cup. Qatar Airways is also offering travel packages for out-of-town fans. Resale tickets may be available through other, unofficial outlets after that period.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the U.S. and Canada prepared for the 2026 soccer World Cup tournament, rumors abounded about the rapport between U.S. President Donald Trump and the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the international self-regulatory body for association soccer. FIFA President Gianni Infantino has been criticized for violating ethics rules when he created a FIFA Peace Prize for Trump, including by former FIFA President Sepp Blatter. Infantino is no stranger to controversy, having been implicated in the Panama Papers scandal in 2016, targeted in a FIFA ethics committee investigation for alleged malpractice in 2017, and investigated for criminal conduct in Switzerland in 2020. The recent relationship between Trump and FIFA under Infantino's leadership has raised many questions and fueled several rumors, true and false, eight of which Snopes investigated. Here they are: "Gianni Infantino Faced Investigation by Fifa Ethics Committee for Alleged Malpractice."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new-look FIFA Intercontinental Cup sees the six reigning champions of every major continental club competition battle it out for a chance of silverware to end the year. The winners of the UEFA Champions League, Copa Libertadores, Concacaf Champions Cup and all other current holders of the premier continental tournaments in FIFA's six confederations have a shot at the title. With Los Blancos vacating their Champions League crown back in May, they won't participate in the 2025 Intercontinental Cup, opening the door for a new champion to be crowned. The inaugural 32-team Club World Cup took centre stage in the summer of 2025 and will be played every four years, whereas the Intercontinental Cup will continue to be an annual event that takes place to close out the calendar year. Every single match in the FIFA Intercontinental Cup is a straight elimination bout. The FIFA Intercontinental Cup final will take place on Wednesday, Dec. 17. The game will be played at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan, Qatar, a venue that hosted seven matches during the 2022 World Cup. Paris Saint-Germain, the 2024–25 Champions League winners, are immediately placed into the Intercontinental Cup final because of the competitiveness and historical ranking of European football's primary club competition. It means Luis Enrique's side only need to overcome one hurdle to pick up another trophy—victory in the final would add to the Ligue 1, Coupe de France, French Super Cup and UEFA Super Cup crowns they have won this calendar year. Some sort of annual FIFA Intercontinental club competition has been around since 1960, with various changes to the format occuring over that time. In 2005, the tournament merged with the Club World Cup, but things have reverted back to how they were after FIFA's decision to expand the latter into a four-yearly 32-team format. AC Milan, Boca Juniors and two Uruguayan rivals, Peñarol and Nacional, won three under the old banner but only Madrid's current reign is recognised in the current lineage. The Club World Cup will be held every four years, presumably as a warm up for the World Cup the following year. Meanwhile, as mentioned previously, the Intercontinental Cup will be held every year. As continental champions, all six teams that participate in the Intercontinental Cup every year are also granted direct qualification intp the next edition of the Club World Cup. As a result, Auckland City FC, Al Ahli, Pyramids FC, Cruz Azul, Flamengo and PSG will participate in the 2029 Club World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The "Futbol Americas" crew react to USMNT's 2026 FIFA World Cup group draw. The U.S. men's national team, it seems, is back to a good place. The Americans are undefeated in five matches, all against World Cup-qualified opposition. It's similar to what Mauricio Pochettino did in his one year at Chelsea, and it has coincided in an uptick in both performances and results for the World Cup co-hosts. But a national team manager can only have a minor impact on the true quality of the players at his disposal. We learn a lot more about them when they're at their day jobs: playing for club teams. I use the word "trying" because it's not perfect -- ranking soccer players, especially across multiple competitive contexts, is impossible -- but it's useful. To come up with the rankings, we use a combination of talent, playing time, team quality and ... that's it. This isn't a one-to-one match for talent, but it's close enough, and having it as part of the input ensures that the rankings don't stray too far from what the world thinks of a given player. For playing time: We simply take the percentage of available minutes each player has played for his team in their domestic league. These ratings aren't perfect either -- MLS teams are ranked a little too highly, for one -- but they offer a uniform way of assessing the quality of the teams every American plays for. And so, the rankings work off a simple premise: if you're playing a lot of minutes and your team has a high rating, then you're likely contributing valuable performance to your team. I've also added a 10%-of-minutes threshold, and that means Cole Campbell (1.8% of minutes for Borussia Dortmund) and Antonee Robinson (4.5% of minutes for Fulham) both miss out. Some other notable absences: Norwich City's Josh Sargent, Orlando City's Alex Freeman, and Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna didn't make the top 50. Were I doing this more subjectively, Luna still wouldn't be in the top 50, I don't think -- he's been way better for the USMNT than in MLS over the past year. Freeman, however, would easily be top 50 because he was probably the best fullback in MLS. And Sargent also would be somewhere on the list. But none of their club teams were good enough for them to make the cut in this edition of the USMNT PPI. - O'Hanlon: Why Christian Pulisic is having his best season ever - Predicting the USMNT's starting lineup at the World Cup - How Roldan went from USMNT afterthought to Pochettino fave Ten years ago, Richards would've been playing for a Champions League team in Italy, Spain or Germany. Such is the financial might of the Premier League that Palace, according to these ratings, would be the second-best team in France, Italy, and Germany, while they'd be behind only Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain. After a nightmare start that got Erik ten Hag fired as manager before the transfer window had even closed, Leverkusen has stabilized. After Bayern Munich, Leverkusen is battling it out with RB Leipzig and Borussia Dortmund to be the second-best team in Germany. And outside of his injuries, Tillman has been close to an automatic first-choice starter under both of his managers. But he moved for a major transfer fee over the summer, and he's starting for a Champions League-quality side. Unfortunately, Pulisic no longer qualifies for FBref's leaderboards after dipping slightly below the one-third-of-the-minutes threshold. But after his two goals earlier this week, he's now averaging 1.82 non-penalty goals+assists per 90 minutes. That's almost half a goal/assist more than Harry Kane, who leads Europe's Big Five top leagues (among qualified players) with 1.36 per 90. If I told you that Adams had played nearly 90% of the minutes for a good Premier League team so far this season, you probably would have one of two reactions: (1) Wow, that's such good news for the World Cup! Or (2) Oh my god, no, he's going to get hurt before the World Cup. He's first in progressive passes and second in progressive carries for a team that has beaten the defending English and Italian champs by a combined 10-3. Given Antonee Robinson's injury problems and Weston McKennie's inconsistent call-ups, it seems as if there's now a core four of close-to-irreplaceable players for the USMNT ahead of next summer: Richards, Pulisic, Adams and Dest. Since the end of August, Cardoso has played only 71 minutes for Atletico across all competitions. If you thought this move seemed like too big of a jump for a player with a solid season and a half in Spain, then nothing about the first few months of this season will have convinced you otherwise. McKennie wasn't playing for Juventus to start the season and everyone freaked out. And as always, he's just doing a little bit of everything, everywhere: But with this new system, Pochettino has leaned more toward inside-forward types rather than pure wingers as the two players next to his striker. That doesn't suit Weah at all, so his path to a starting spot with the U.S. might be as a wingback after all. He's no longer putting up Messi-like per-minute numbers for PSV anymore -- and that's a good thing. Because it means he's no longer just coming in during garbage time and pummeling Eredivisie clubs that are way worse than PSV. Pepi still isn't first choice at PSV, but he already has 515 minutes in the league this season. Here's how he fares compared to his peers in Ligue 1, per the various grades from Gradient Sports: It has been a terrible season for the two young American midfielders on Champions League clubs and Pochettino doesn't seem to like them. Musah even made this list only because he'd played 90 minutes in a match for Milan before moving to Atalanta. With his new club, he has played 60 total minutes and hasn't appeared in a league match since before Halloween. Jeff Carlisle recaps Folarin Balogun's big night for Monaco in the Champions League. I like how such a simple rating system can discover the same thing Pochettino has found out over the past couple of months: Roldan is very good at soccer. Delgado, a midfielder, and Haak, a midfielder-turned-defender, haven't been called up by Pochettino and probably won't be any time soon, but they've both played a ton of minutes for two of the better teams in MLS. In the past, they'd probably be in the mix for one of the final few roster spots, but now this pool has guys who play for Champions League clubs such as Atletico Madrid and Atalanta and probably won't even make next summer's roster, either. It's funny that perhaps one of the best MLS teams of all time that relied heavily on Americans is also the one that plays its home games in Canada. White, Sabbi, Berhalter and Blackmon combined to play all but one minute of the 3-1 MLS Cup loss to Inter Miami. I don't want to alarm anyone, but Banks was 18 at the beginning of the season, and he's now just a full-time starter for a team in the Bundesliga at a position that peaks later than average and typically favors older players. But Augsburg has been a lot better -- a roughly average side -- in the minutes when Banks has played. It's all really promising, and if you were going to pick one out-of-nowhere player to not only make the World Cup roster, but start next summer, then Banks would be your guy. As long as he keeps playing, I'd be very surprised if he doesn't get a call-up to the next full camp. It feels as if he moved to Manchester City just last year, but he's somehow already 28 years old. But now he's quietly just a starter for one of the biggest clubs in Greece, where he's managed by ... (cleans off glasses in a theatrical fashion that suggests I am familiar with the meme of Tobey Maguire in "Spider-Man") ... Rafa Benitez. A quick shoutout to Sands, who recovered from a gruesome ankle break earlier in February to become one of St. Pauli's most reliable ball-winners this season. And a not-unrelated question to that: Can he start having more of an impact when he gets out there?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That record is in no small part thanks to the stellar play of goalkeeper Brad Friedel. In that match, the Stars and Stripes shocked a team talented enough to win the World Cup. The Americans came away with a 3-2 win, however it was in the next match that Friedel began notching his name in the history books. The USA went ahead 1-0 against South Korea thanks to Clint Mathis scoring in the 24th minute. That lead would be in jeopardy when Jeff Agoos committed a foul in the box on a free kick. This video really captures the moment and is only helped by the music selection. This moment would be critical because the Americans got beaten soundly 3-1 by Poland in the final group match. Had the penalty against South Korea gone in, the USA would have dropped the point they ended up needing to advance. While the final game in the group was a wash, it would be when Friedel stepped up and made another penalty save. That save saw him become just the second keeper in World Cup history to save two penalties given in regular play in the same tournament. He joined, fittingly enough, Polish keeper Jan Tomaszewski who set the mark in 1974. It would add to his legend as he would continue his terrific career abroad and earned him being nicknamed “The Human Wall” in the tournament. MLS crowns its champion today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 53-year-old Argentine is, by his own admission, emotional. It's something fans of the U.S. men's national team came to learn after a narrow loss to rival Mexico in the Gold Cup final in July, when Pochettino broke down while addressing his players. But this time, his vulnerability wasn't public. It occurred last month in Tampa after Pochettino sparred with reporters — full disclosure, I was one of them — about the idea of the U.S. team having "regular" players following a resounding 5-1 win over two-time world champion Uruguay. It was when Scott Goodwin pulled him aside. And one that was made into a Disney movie. At those Games, a team comprised of amateur college players somehow defeated the fully professional four-time defending champion Soviet Union en route to the gold medal. Five decades later, the "Miracle on Ice" team and its story is still considered one of the greatest upsets in global sports history. That squad was coached by Herb Brooks, a no-nonsense taskmaster who despised entitlement above all else and who demanded total sacrifice and buy-in from his players. In the film, Brooks was deftly portrayed by actor Kurt Russell, who delivered on those great movie scenes that make you want to run through a wall. Pochettino, for all his obvious charm and warmth in social settings or in front of the cameras, is every bit as demanding on the training field — and, if necessary, as ruthless — as Brooks was on the ice. "When Mauricio was mad at your question after the Uruguay game, he said something like, ‘These are the players today. It's not the A players or the B players' — that was a repeat of a scene from the film," Goodwin told me when I spoke to him this week. "I said, ‘Watch this movie on the flight home.' Since he was hired to replace Gregg Berhalter almost 15 months ago, Pochettino has tried to remake the U.S. team in his own image. With the all-important 2026 FIFA World Cup looming, the need for a world-class coach who could hold a group that had become far too comfortable to account and get the best out of them was obvious. Having successfully managed the egos of bona fide superstars like Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar over a 15-year European club career, Pochettino would not tolerate even the most decorated U.S. veterans putting themselves ahead of the greater good. After losing to Panama and Canada in March, the U.S. ended the year on a five-game unbeaten streak (with four wins) — all against nations who have qualified for the World Cup next summer. It took some time, but Pochettino's message has clearly gotten through. The goal, he said again after last week's World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., is to win the World Cup — nothing less. Previous U.S. coaches didn't dare set the bar so high publicly. Jürgen Klinsmann, a World Cup-winning player with Germany who helmed the Americans at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, famously said flat out it was impossible beforehand. Although it might engender increased pressure and expectations — just eight countries have ever hoisted the World Cup — there's a good reason Pochettino and his staff aren't setting any limits on what the U.S. can accomplish on home soil. In just his second full season coaching in England's Premier League, Leicester City overcame 5000–1 odds to win the title. Greece won the Euros in 2004 as a 150-1 underdog. (The 1980 Olympic hockey team's chances of beating the Russians were as high as 1000-1, based on some estimates.) There's even a precedent with the U.S. team, which stunned pre-tournament favorite England 1-0 at the 1950 World Cup in Brazil — a result so unlikely some news outlets reported it as a 10-1 victory for the Three Lions, assuming the wire services were in error. But to "do the impossible," as the coach likes to say, all of Pochettino's charges have to believe that they can achieve what most clear-eyed outsiders are convinced they can't. "If we don't have this synergy and that energy in between 26 players, we can win one game," Pochettino told reporters last week after the U.S. drew Paraguay, Australia and a yet-to-be-determined European side as their World Cup opponents. "But [to win] a competition like the World Cup, it's impossible." "Good and right is completely different," he said, yet another reference to "Miracle." "I'm in love with this movie," he told FOX Sports colleague Jenny Taft, who moderated the discussion. "We identified with so many things in the movie, how a group of 20 players who really believed in an idea [made it come true]. That was Goodwin's idea when he made the recommendation. "It's an American story about grit," he said. "I thought the movie would allow him to connect with American culture more and understand a little bit more about our sports culture," Goodwin added. "Because in this country, sports is a lot of the culture. "So for him to get to see that, and know that this kind of thing happened in this country, it made him believe a bit more that the kind of passion and belief and grit that he says the Argentinian national team has also exists here." Which is why Pochettino even attended a New York Rangers hockey game at Madison Square Garden – coincidentally, the team that Brooks coached from 1981-85. "This is an unbelievable country, unbelievable people," said Pochettino during an appearance on the Pat McAfee Show on Monday, a day after the Rangers game. It's the most powerful country in every single area. He has the same question for those who doubt that the U.S. can orchestrate its own miracle next summer: "Why not us?"

Vales was stunned by the soaring costs in this latest sales window, which offered fans another chance to secure seats for the tournament set to take place next summer in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. AT&T Stadium in Arlington will host more matches than any other venue, with nine games scheduled, including a semifinal.

Last weekend's announcement of the groups, schedules and venues for all 104 matches only pushed ticket prices higher. The most expensive group-stage ticket currently listed is for the United States vs. Paraguay opener on June 12 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, priced at $2,735 in Category 1. The opening match of the tournament, Mexico vs. South Africa on June 11 at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, is listed at $2,355 for Category 1 seats. “Today's prices are insane,” said Vales, who displayed a Category 1 ticket for which he paid $175 to attend the group-stage match between Mexico and Croatia at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. To attend the 2026 World Cup, fans can purchase individual tickets through FIFA's site if selected in a lottery. Otherwise, they must turn to hospitality packages, which cost thousands of dollars. On the secondary market, prices have skyrocketed even further. Before, you could buy tickets knowing the price wouldn't change regardless of which teams played. Fan organization Football Supporters Europe (FSE) echoed those concerns, calling the current prices “extortionate.” The group-stage prices stand in stark contrast to FIFA's claims that $60 tickets would be available. After that, FIFA will randomly select applicants, charge them the listed prices, and distribute tickets in February. Before Thursday's announcement, and even before the official World Cup draw, FIFA had already sold nearly 2 million tickets across two early lottery phases. In October, the organization set prices based on round and venue. By November, it had raised some of those prices in response to surging demand. Vales, a veteran fan who has traveled across three continents to watch World Cup matches, now wonders if he'll be able to attend the tournament being staged in his own backyard. “The only thing we're asking FIFA for is fair prices.” Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA President Gianni Infantino speaks during the match schedule reveal for the 2026 soccer World Cup in Washington, Saturday, Dec. 6, 2025. From left: Alexi Lalas and Ronaldo listen as FIFA President Gianni Infantino and host Andrés Cantor applaude as Francesco Totti, and Hristo Stoichkov look on during the match schedule reveal for the 2026 soccer World Cup in Washington, Saturday, Dec. 6, 2025. Soccer fans have accused FIFA of a “monumental betrayal” after latest prices for World Cup tickets began to circulate on Thursday. And a list published by the German soccer federation revealed prices ranged from $180-$700 for varying group stage games. Those group-stage prices are very different from FIFA's claims of $60 tickets being available, while the target from United States soccer officials when bidding for the tournament seven years ago was to offer hundreds of thousands of $21 seats across the opening phase of games. Fan organization Football Supporters Europe (FSE) described the current prices as “extortionate.” The English Football Association shared pricing information with the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) on Thursday evening, which showed that if a fan bought a ticket for every game through to the final it would cost just over $7,000. FIFA said in September that tickets released through its website would initially range from $60 for group-stage matches to $6,730 for the final. But those prices are subject to change as it adopts dynamic pricing for the first time at the World Cup. The lowest priced ticket was $180 for Germany's opening group game against Curacao in Houston. The FSE called on FIFA to immediately halt ticket sales via national associations “until a solution that respects the tradition, universality, and cultural significance of the World Cup is found.” FIFA launched its third phase of widespread ticket sales Thursday, with fans now able to apply for specific matches for the first time through its “Random Selection Draw.” Following last week's draw for the 2026 tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, an updated schedule has been published. Previous ticket ballots were blind as the qualification period had not even been completed and the draw was yet to take place. Now participating nations have been placed in groups, with their paths through the tournament determined. For instance, Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo could go on to meet in the quarterfinals in Kansas City if both Argentina and Portugal top their respective groups. FIFA says ticket applications can be made at any point during this window and the timing of entry will not impact the chances of success. Fans can apply via FIFA's website for a maximum of four tickets per household per match and a maximum of 40 tickets throughout the tournament. Fans will need a FIFA ID to apply for tickets and can pick which matches and which pricing category they want to apply for. Successful applicants will be notified by email in February and charged automatically. Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium on July 19 are already going for in excess of $11,000 on secondary resale sites. For this tournament FIFA has also set up its own resale platform where it charges a 15% fee based on the total resale price. FIFA said that closer to the tournament any remaining tickets will go on general sale on a first-come, first-served basis. It did not reveal a time frame for the release of those remaining tickets.
