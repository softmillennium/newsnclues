(AP) — A U.S. Navy admiral who oversees military operations in Latin America handed off command responsibilities Friday as scrutiny increases over the Trump administration's deadly strikes on alleged drug boats in the region. Adm. Alvin Holsey has retired one year into a posting that typically lasts three to four years and transferred leadership duties to his top military deputy, Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Pettus, during a ceremony at U.S. Southern Command headquarters near Miami. With the campaign facing growing scrutiny by Congress, Holsey briefed key lawmakers earlier this week. The ceremony Friday was more subdued than past retirements, held outdoors amid a small crowd of mostly Southern Command staff and without Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, because President Donald Trump has yet to nominate Holsey's replacement. “You've never said ‘I' in all the conversations we've had. … The impact you've had will last for a long time.” Holsey is departing as Congress is scrutinizing the boat attacks, including one that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of an initial strike. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Hegseth and other top officials have given classified briefings on Capitol Hill this week. Holsey also spoke this week to key lawmakers overseeing the U.S. military by classified video call. Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said afterward that Holsey answered senators' questions but that “there are still many questions to be answered.” Reed later added that Holsey did not give a reason for his retirement other than saying it was a personal decision. The 22 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels are being supported by a giant flotilla of U.S. warships, attack helicopters, thousands of troops and even the nation's most advanced aircraft carrier. Trump's Republican administration has defended its aggressive tactics, designating several drug cartels in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations and declaring that the U.S. is in armed conflict with those criminal organizations, relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The campaign has ramped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. In a sharp escalation Wednesday, U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration has accused of smuggling illicit crude. A native of rural Fort Valley, Georgia, whose father and several uncles served in Vietnam, Holsey relinquished his command to Pettus to a soulful rendition of “Midnight Train to Georgia.” Pettus, a fighter jet pilot with combat experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, had been serving as Holsey's top deputy since late 2024. Whomever Trump nominates must be confirmed by the Senate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prominent Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi is seen in a meeting on women's rights in Tehran, Iran, on July 3, 2008. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has arrested Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, her supporters said Friday. A foundation in her name said she was detained in Mashhad, some 680 kilometers (420 miles) northeast of the capital, Tehran, while attending a memorial for a human rights lawyer recently found dead under unclear circumstances. A local official reportedly acknowledged arrests had been made, but did not directly name Mohammadi, 53. It wasn't clear if authorities would immediately return her to prison, where she had been serving a sentence until her temporary release in December 2024 for medical purposes. However, her detention comes as Iran has been cracking down on intellectuals and others as Tehran struggles with sanctions, an ailing economy and the fear of a renewed war with Israel. Arresting Mohammadi may spark increased pressure from the West at a time when Iran repeatedly signals it wants new negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program — something that has yet to happen. Her supporters on Friday described her as having been “violently detained earlier today by security and police forces.” They said other activists had been arrested as well at a ceremony honoring Khosrow Alikordi, a 46-year-old Iranian lawyer and human rights advocate who had been based in Mashhad. “The Narges Foundation calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all detained individuals who were attending a memorial ceremony to pay their respects and demonstrate solidarity,” a statement read. “Their arrest constitutes a serious violation of fundamental freedoms.” Alikordi was found dead earlier this month in his office, with provincial officials in describing his death as a heart attack. However, a tightening security crackdown coincided with his death, raising questions. It also reveals the extraordinary bravery of Iranians who refuse to surrender their dignity.” Footage purportedly of the ceremony showed Mohammadi with a microphone, calling out to the crowd gathered without wearing a hijab, or headscarf. Other anti-government chants could be heard in purported video footage of the event. Supporters had warned for months that Mohammadi was at risk of being put back into prison after she received a furlough in December 2024 over medical concerns. While that was to be only three weeks, Mohammadi's time out of prison lengthened, possibly as activists and Western powers pushed Iran to keep her free. She remained out even during the 12-day war in June between Iran and Israel. Mohammadi still kept up her activism with public protests and international media appearances, including even demonstrating at one point in front of Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where she had been held. Mohammadi suffered multiple heart attacks while imprisoned before undergoing emergency surgery in 2022, her supporters say. “Mohammadi's doctors recently prescribed an extension of her medical leave for at least six more months to conduct thorough and regular medical examinations, including monitoring the bone lesion which was removed from her leg in November, physiotherapy sessions to recover from the surgery and specialized cardiac care,” the Free Narges Coalition said in late February 2025. “The medical team overseeing Mohammadi's health has warned that her return to prison — especially under stressful conditions of detention and without adequate medical facilities — could severely worsen her physical well-being.” An engineer by training, Mohammadi has been imprisoned 13 times and convicted five.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The nation's top historic preservation group is suing the Trump administration to block construction of President Donald Trump's plans for a massive new White House ballroom until review boards weigh in on the project. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a congressionally chartered non-profit tasked with preserving historic buildings, said it was bringing the suit because its previous letter urging a pause on the project had gone unheeded. “The White House is arguably the most evocative building in our country and a globally recognized symbol of our powerful American ideals. As the organization charged with protecting places where our history happened, the National Trust was compelled to file this case,” said Carol Quillen, the group's president and CEO. The White House's East Wing is now demolished. The suit names Trump as a defendant, along with the National Park Service, the Department of Interior, and the General Services Administration, along with officials who work in those agencies. The case is assigned to District Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee. “President Trump has full legal authority to modernize, renovate, and beautify the White House – just like all of his predecessors did,” White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement to CNN. While Trump announced months ago his plans to replace the East Wing with the new ballroom — a necessary addition, he says, to accommodate large events — the demolition proceeded without an extensive public review process. “No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Joe Biden, and not anyone else,” the complaint from the trust says. In October, the group addressed a letter to the administration  “respectfully” urging it to “pause demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes, including consultation and review by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, and to invite comment from the public.” The current chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, Will Scharf, who also serves as Trump's staff secretary, said during a meeting of the commission last month that its jurisdiction covers construction, but not demolition — suggesting the body would eventually be involved in the project, but not until after the East Wing was demolished. At an early December NCPC meeting, Scharf said he has been told by colleagues at the White House that the ballroom plans will be submitted to the agency this month.

Harvard medical student Nick Norwitz reveals the science behind his food experiment, in which he consumed 133,000 mg of dietary cholesterol Millions of Americans battle chronic anxiety — but new research claiming a missing brain nutrient may be partly to blame is already drawing skepticism from experts who say the findings are far from conclusive. Using a non-invasive MRI-based technique that measures brain chemicals, researchers at UC Davis Health in California looked at data from 25 previous studies, comparing 370 people with anxiety disorders to 342 without anxiety. They found that, across the combined studies, individuals with certain anxiety disorders showed an average of about 8% lower choline levels in brain regions that help regulate thinking and emotions. "An 8% lower amount doesn't sound like that much, but in the brain, it's significant," said senior study author Richard Maddock, a medical doctor and research professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, Davis. Choline — found in foods such as eggs, beef, chicken, fish and soybeans — plays a key role in memory, mood and cell health, according to experts. The findings don't prove that low choline causes anxiety. The research does, however, reveal a pattern across three major anxiety disorders that could shape future research into how nutrition and brain chemistry interact with anxiety disorders, they said. "It suggests nutritional approaches — like appropriate choline supplementation — may help restore brain chemistry and improve outcomes for patients," study co-author Jason Smucny said in a statement. Anxiety disorders affect nearly 30% of U.S. adults, according to experts. But several clinicians and nutrition experts told Fox News Digital the results should be interpreted cautiously and warned Americans against assuming anxiety is caused by a nutrient deficiency. Maddock said more research is needed to learn if increasing choline will reduce anxiety. He warned that heavy choline supplements can cause side effects. Experts note that people may benefit from reviewing their choline intake as part of routine nutritional guidance and recommend discussing any changes — especially for those with anxiety — with a healthcare provider. Choline is considered "essential" because the body makes only a small amount of it, and the rest has to come from food, research has shown. Some omega-3 fats found in fish, such as salmon, may be "especially good" at delivering choline to the brain, Maddock noted. Nona Kocher, a board-certified psychiatrist in Miami Beach, agreed that an 8% drop is not "trivial." "We know from the clinic that this kind of burden is associated with feeling easily overwhelmed, feeling less resilient under stress and being mentally tired earlier in the day," she told Fox News Digital. The MRI technique they used captures chemical stress signals in the brain, so low choline may reflect metabolic strain and not simply a nutrient deficiency. "One big misunderstanding is thinking that a nutrient deficiency is the main cause of anxiety," said Lauren Manaker, a registered dietitian nutritionist in South Carolina. Researchers say lower choline levels in brain regions are responsible for emotion regulation and stress response. "Anxiety is complicated and usually involves a mix of factors, like genetics, life experiences and brain chemistry," Manaker, who was not involved in the research, told Fox News Digital. "While low choline might have an association, it's not the whole story." Mood and anxiety disorders have been tied to other nutrient deficiencies, including vitamin D, Manaker said. A balanced diet that includes foods like dairy milk and eggs — which provide choline, vitamin D, B12 and other brain-supporting nutrients — may help address those gaps, but nutrition is only one piece of managing anxiety, she emphasized. Experts caution that more research is needed before recommending choline supplementation. Manaker said a choline-rich diet is important for overall brain health, regardless of whether someone has anxiety. Fox News Digital reached out to the study authors for comment.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts break down the latest legal clashes over President Donald Trump's deportations of illegal immigrants. Lawyers for the Trump administration are seeking to shut down a revived contempt inquiry led by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, arguing in new filings that the court should cancel two scheduled witness examinations next week or allow the administration to block testimony on grounds of "executive privilege." In filings earlier this week, Justice Department lawyers argued the court is exceeding its authority. "Criminal contempt is a criminal offense, and the investigation and prosecution of crimes is [a] core executive power reserved to the Executive Branch," they added. Judge James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., stands for a portrait at E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse in Washington, D.C. on March 16, 2023. (Carolyn Van Houten / Washington Post via Getty) Boasberg this week requested testimony from two current and former Justice Department officials who played a key role in the Trump administration's use of the 18th century wartime law to quickly deport the migrants to El Salvador in March, despite his temporary restraining order and subsequent oral order that attempted to block — for 14 days — the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to immediately deport the migrants. He is now weighing whether senior Trump officials willfully defied that order. To wit, he ordered Drew Ensign, the Justice Department's deputy assistant attorney general, to appear in court Monday for questioning and for cross-examination from lawyers representing the class of deported Venezuelan migrants. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks at a news conference at Harry Reid International Airport, Saturday, Nov. 22, 2025, in Las Vegas. He also ordered testimony and cross-examination the following day from former Justice Department lawyer Erez Reuveni, who since parting ways with the Justice Department has publicly accused the administration of ignoring court orders — including in this case. Circuit, sitting en banc, vacated an earlier ruling and returned the matter to Boasberg. Still, court filings revealed that the Trump administration plans to fight those efforts at every turn. "If the Court does proceed with testimony, it should grant a protective order with respect to privileged information or provide Defendants with an opportunity to seek appellate relief in advance of any testimony; and the Court should also limit the scope of the testimony and preclude Plaintiffs from participating," they told Boasberg. A person holds up a sign referencing the Centre for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT) prison in El Salvador during a May Day demonstration against President Donald Trump and his immigration policies in Houston, Texas, on May 1, 2025. Last month, DOJ officials identified DHS Secretary Kristi Noem as the official who authorized the transfer of the Venezuelan migrants after being briefed on Boasberg's emergency order by lawyers for the Justice Department and acting general counsel for DHS. Boasberg said earlier this week that it would be "premature" to refer anyone for prosecution under the revived contempt probe, and declined to immediately compel testimony from Noem at this stage in the process. Noem said in a declaration of her own that she made that call based on legal advice from lawyers for the Justice Department, as well as the acting general counsel for DHS. The fresh action on the contempt issue is almost certain to spark the ire of some Republicans in Congress and from Trump himself, who has repeatedly excoriated Boasberg as an "activist judge" for his role in the Alien Enemies Act case and resulting inquiry. Boasberg, for his part, has appeared unfazed. "This has been sitting for a long time," Boasberg said late last month of the contempt inquiry, "and I believe justice requires me to move promptly on this." The government, he added, "can assist me to whatever degree it wishes."

Department of Justice attorneys haven't elaborated on how doing so might hamper the portrayal President Donald Trump seeks to present to the public. But overturning policies encompassing diversity, equity and inclusion have become a hallmark of his second administration, starting with his very first week back in the White House. Government attorneys also argued that it provides the hard of hearing or Deaf community with other ways to access the president's statements, like online transcripts of events, or closed captioning. The administration has also argued that it would be difficult to wrangle such services in the event that Trump spontaneously took questions from the press, rather than at a formal briefing. In their June filing, government attorneys questioned if other branches of government were being held to a similar standard if they didn't provide the same interpretative services as sought by the association. As home to Gallaudet University, the world's premier college for the deaf and hard of hearing, Washington likely has an ample pool of trained ASL interpreters into which the White House could tap. Mayor Muriel Bowser has made ASL interpretation a mainstay of her appearances, including a pair of interpreters who swap in and out. Last month, a federal judge rejected that and other objections from the government, issuing an order requiring the White House to provide American Sign Language interpreting for Trump and Leavitt's remarks in real time. The White House has appealed the ruling, and while the administration has begun providing American Sign Language interpreting at some events, there's disagreement over what services it has to supply. On his first week back in office, Trump signed a sweeping executive order putting a stop to diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government. In putting his own imprint on the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in January issued an order stating that DEI policies were “incompatible” with the department's mission, This week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered diplomatic correspondence to return to the more traditional Times New Roman font, arguing that the Biden administration's 2023 shift to the sans serif Calibri font had emerged from misguided diversity, equity and inclusion policies pursued by his predecessor.</p>

Ilhan Omar in Minnesota's 5th Congressional District, about the unfolding fraud scandal in his home state. MINNEAPOLIS, MN – Republican John Nagel, who is running against Dem. Rep. Ilhan Omar in her Minneapolis district, spoke to Fox News Digital about the responsibility she holds in the unfolding massive fraud scandal that has garnered national headlines. Her legislation actually started and it allowed people to get into Feeding Our Future. If you look at where the fraud is, it's primarily her [5th Congressional District], the district that I'm running in against her. And it's really odd to think that you know all the fraud just happened in a particular area, and it was a bill that she, you know, particularly put together." He told Fox News Digital the public deserves to know who helped her craft that legislation. Members of Omar's inner circle personally profited from the $1 billion welfare fraud scandal in her district that has placed her Somali constituency under a White House microscope, Nagel said. He also said that Omar held events at one of the restaurants, Safari Land, which was named in the fraud case, knew one of its now-convicted owners and had a staffer who was also convicted. Rep. Ilhan Omar has been accused of having ties to individuals embroiled in the Minnesota fraud scandal by her opponent, John Nagel. "If you look at the Safari Land restaurant, if you're gonna be in politics, you need to go through the people at the Safari Land restaurant," Nagel said. I mean, that was sort of her hangout. Guhaad Hashi Said, sometimes referred to as an "enforcer" for Omar's campaign, is one of the over 70 people who have been indicted for his role in the Feeding Our Future scandal. Nagel told Fox News Digital the public deserves answers on that relationship and what Omar knew about the fraud. "I think time will tell with the investigation. But again, there's just too much circumstantial evidence to look at this and say, she had to have known something, or what staff member knew something?" The Small Business Administration is investigating a network of Somali groups in Minnesota that it says is tied to the scandal, and a House Oversight Committee has opened an investigation into Minnesota Gov. Despite the accusations of widespread fraud, Minnesota Gov. President Donald Trump last week criticized Omar and blamed the Somali community for the scope of fraud occurring in Minnesota. Nagel also asserted that there was a money trail potentially funneled to Omar from her associates tied to the Feeding Our Future fraud scandal, and he said that she has returned some of the money but not all of it. Omar says that she gave the money back," Nagel said. "Well, if you go into public records, she gave some money back, but there's a whole lot more money there that she didn't report. And I think if people were just to go through the everyday records that are out there, you'll find out that her involvement in the money that she has is questionable." Nagel told Fox News Digital, "If she truly cared about the fraud, her name wouldn't be attached all over to these other people. She came on and she made a statement about how terrible it is to basically steal food from children. Now she yells racism anytime somebody puts any pressure on her." Fox News Digital asked Nagel what can be done to fix the fraud issues. He said, first and foremost, Minnesota must elect a new governor. "The things that we can do to fix this is you get yourself a new competent, honest governor, you get yourself a new honest, competent AG," Nagel said. "We get rid of Ilhan Omar, and we put people in the state of Minnesota that actually want to do the right thing. That's what we're gonna have to do. Nagel described the fraud situation in Minnesota as a "cancer" that will continue to "spread" unless "you cut the entire cancer out." Fox News Digital reached out to Omar's office for comment. "I think what happened is that, you know, when you have these kind of new programs that are, um, designed to help people, you're oftentimes relying on third parties to be able to facilitate. And I just think that a lot of the COVID programs that were set up — they were set up so quickly that a lot of the guardrails did not get created," Omar said last week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Construction of a new ballroom continues on the East Wing of the White House, Tuesday, Nov. 23, 2025, in Washington. President Donald Trump was sued on Friday by preservationists asking a federal court to halt his White House ballroom project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and wins approval from Congress. The National Trust for Historic Preservation is asking the U.S. District Court to block Trump's White House ballroom project, which already has involved razing the East Wing, until it goes through comprehensive design reviews, environmental assessments, public comments and congressional debate and ratification. The National Trust, a privately funded organization, argues that Trump, by fast-tracking the project, has committed multiple violations of the Administrative Procedures Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, while also exceeding his constitutional authority by not seeking congressional approval for a project of such scale. “No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit states. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not immediately respond to Associated Press questions about the lawsuit and the project, including whether the president had any intention of consulting Congress. Trump has emphasized since announcing his plans that he's doing it with private funding, including his own money. But that would not necessarily change how federal laws and procedures apply to what is still a U.S. government project. Trump, a Republican, already has bypassed the federal government's usual building practices and historical reviews with the East Wing demolition. Trump has said a ballroom is overdue for the White House, previously complaining that events were held outside under a tent because the East Room and the State Dining Room could not accommodate bigger crowds. Trump, among other complaints, said guests get their feet wet if it rains during such events. The White House is expected to submit plans for Trump's new ballroom to a federal planning commission before the year ends, about three months after construction began. Will Scharf, who was named by Trump as chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, said at the panel's monthly meeting last week that he was told by colleagues at the White House that the long-awaited plans would be filed in December. “Once plans are submitted, that's really when the role of this commission, and its professional staff, will begin,” said Scharf, who also is one of the Republican president's top White House aides. He said the review process would happen at a “normal and deliberative pace.”</p>

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, discusses the subpoena of former special counsel Jack Smith on ‘Hannity.' House Democrats plan to urge a federal judge in Florida to unseal former special counsel Jack Smith's final report, escalating their push to obtain the document ahead of Smith's deposition with Congress next week. The 19 Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said, according to an amicus brief reviewed by Fox News Digital on Friday, that Judge Aileen Cannon's longstanding order blocking the release of the report, which details Smith's investigation and prosecution of President Donald Trump related to classified documents, had no basis and unconstitutionally hindered Congress from performing its duties. Then-special counsel Jack Smith delivers remarks on an unsealed indictment including four felony counts against then-former President Donald Trump on Aug. 1, 2023, in Washington. The Democrats, led by ranking member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., also sent a demand letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, the latest of several letters they have sent to her on the matter, saying she had no justification for withholding the report. They also said Bondi could easily ask Cannon to unseal it, but she has not done so. Rep. Jamie Raskin speaks during a House Judiciary Committee hearing with FBI Director Kash Patel (not pictured), on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Sept. 17, 2025. "This Administration has repeatedly boasted that President Trump is ‘the most transparent and accessible president in American history.' Your campaign to bury Mr. Smith's report makes a joke out of that claim," the Democrats wrote. "You are permitting prosecutors to be hauled before Congress to defend their work while denying Congress and the American public the written record that would explain it." Fox News Digital reached out to the DOJ for comment. House Judiciary Committee Republicans subpoenaed Smith to testify next week behind closed doors as part of their investigation into his special counsel work, despite Smith asking to testify at a public hearing. Democrats have been pushing as part of that probe for the second portion of Smith's final special counsel report, which likely contains Smith's deeply detailed account of how he went about investigating and charging Trump for allegedly retaining classified documents. Attorney General Pam Bondi speaks during a news conference at the Department of Justice (DOJ) in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2025. House Judiciary Republicans noted in a statement to Fox News Digital that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ordered Cannon to decide on whether to unseal the report by next month. "Judge Cannon will decide by January 2026 whether Volume II should be released. Jack Smith will be questioned about his entire investigation next week before the Judiciary Committee," a committee spokesman said. "Of course, Ranking Member Raskin knows all of this, but despises President Trump so much that he would rather mislead the American people than get the facts straight." Smith dropped Trump's charges alleging he mishandled national defense information after Trump won the election, citing a policy discouraging the DOJ from prosecuting sitting presidents.

Brian Walshe, who declined to testify at his murder trial, tried to take control of his late father's estate soon after he was indicted on art fraud charges in 2018, according to a report. Brian and Thomas Walshe had been estranged for years, but the only child argued that his dad didn't leave a will and convinced the Plymouth County Probate Court in Massachusetts to name him as personal representative for the estate that December, according to The Boston Globe. Brian's claim to Thomas' estate was later challenged by his father's family and friends, arguing the only child had actually destroyed the will, sold off his belongings and wiped out his father's bank account. Brian allegedly took and sold off a total of over $500,000 after the late Walshe stripped his son from the will. Fred Pescatore, a longtime friend of Thomas, reportedly said in a signed statement to the court that Brian stole from his father. "Brian and Tom's estrangement had everything to do with money," Pescatore said. "Brian stole money from Tom and swindled him out of almost one million dollars…" "I saw Brian attempt to smuggle out antiquities from China," Pescatore added. When Thomas died, Brian "almost had zero" contact with him for over a decade, friends and family wrote to the probate court. Brian Walshe arrives at Norfolk Superior Court in Dedham, Massachusetts, on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025. Walshe is accused of killing his wife, Ana, in January 2023 after learning she was having an affair. Ana disappeared on New Year's Day and was never seen again. The defense unexpectedly rested its case on Thursday morning without calling any witnesses and did not put Brian on the stand. On Tuesday, a forensic scientist testified that DNA consistent with Ana's profile was found on a hatchet and hacksaw recovered from the trash. Tools that tested positive for blood are submitted as evidence in the murder trial of Brian Walshe, of Cohasset, at Norfolk Superior Court in Dedham on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025. (Greg Derr/The Patriot Ledger / USA Today Network via Imagn Images) 2023 with a shopping list buying $463.26 in goods, including cleaning supplies. (Greg Derr/The Patriot Ledger / USA Today Network via Imagn Images) Brian's wife had a $2.7 million life insurance policy which he was the beneficiary of, court records show. He owed nearly $500,000 in restitution for his federal case. Another one of Thomas' longtime friends, Jeffrey Ornstein, said in a signed statement to the probate court that he had proof Brian was taken out of the will. Ornstein said Brian reached out to him following Thomas' death and asked if he had the keys to his father's house in Hull, Massachusetts. "I noticed a list of beneficiaries, but as Tom had told me many times over the years, he had expressly disinherited Brian." Brian Walshe was charged with murder and misleading a police investigation in Cohasset, Massachusetts on Jan. 17, 2023. Walshe was already behind bars for misleading a police investigation into the disappearance of his wife, Ana Walshe, when he was charged with her murder. Brian bought the house, with his father reportedly agreeing to fund renovations with the stipulation that he'd be paid back, which never happened. "It is clear that Brian destroyed the Last Will and Testament which excluded him from any inheritance, when he gained access to the Hull property," Andrew wrote in a statement to the court. "Brian R Walshe had estranged himself from all Walshe family members due to their knowledge of the theft he had committed to his father." "I hereby bequeath to Brian R. Walshe my best wishes but nothing else from my estate," Thomas wrote in the will. Ana Walshe was last seen at her home in Cohasset, Mass., shortly after midnight on Jan. 1, 2023. Andrew unsuccessfully pressured Brian to account for what happened to the estate and alleged that the only child drained at least $250,000 from Thomas' bank account and sold his possessions, worth about $250,000.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This photo provided by the New York State Sex Offender Registry shows Jeffrey Epstein, March 28, 2017. (New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP, File) The 19 photos released by Democratic lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee were a small part of more than 95,000 they received from the estate of Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting sex trafficking charges. The photos were released without captions or context and included a black-and-white image of Trump alongside six women whose faces were blacked out. Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, did not say whether any of the women in the photos was a victim of abuse, but he added, “Our commitment from day one has been to redact any photo, any information that could lead to any sort of harm to any of the victims.” A spokesperson for the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee accused Garcia and Democratic lawmakers of “cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump,” adding that nothing in the documents the committee has received shows “any wrongdoing” by the president. Garcia said that his staff had looked through about a quarter of the images it had received from Epstein's estate, which included photos that were sent to him or that he had in his possession. Trump, once a close friend of Epstein, has said that he parted ways with him long before he faced the sex trafficking charges. Clinton, too, has minimized his relationship with Epstein, acknowledging that he traveled on Epstein's private jet but saying through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes. Clinton also has never been accused of misconduct by Epstein's known victims. However, Republicans on the House committee are pushing him and Hillary Clinton to testify in their investigation. Andrew lost his royal titles and privileges this year amid new revelations of his ties to Epstein, though he has denied wrongdoing. The photo release also included images of the right-wing political operative Steven Bannon, billionaires Richard Branson and Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and law professor Alan Dershowitz. The men have denied any wrongdoing in their associations with Epstein, who kept many high-profile figures in his circle of friends. Amid a release of emails between Summers and Epstein, Summers stepped away from his teaching position at Harvard University and faced other fallout to his standing in academic circles. Allen has faced allegations from his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, of molesting her as a child. Some lawmakers, however, believe that other high-powered figures could be implicated in Epstein's abuse if the full case files from the Justice Department are released. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who was instrumental in passing a bill to require the public release of the files, said it was a good sign that the Department of Justice has sought to have grand jury material released from several courts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But a few thousand feet underground is a hidden source of abundant clean energy — and it was discovered in an unusual way. Utah-headquartered startup Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals announced last week it had used artificial intelligence to locate a 250-degree Fahrenheit geothermal reservoir under this stretch of land. They named it “Big Blind,” because this kind of site — which has no visual indication of its existence, no hot springs or geysers above ground, and no history of geothermal exploration — is known as a “blind” system. It's the first industry-discovered blind site in more than three decades, said Carl Hoiland, co-founder and CEO of Zanskar. He believes there are many more hidden sites across the Western US. The problem, however, has been how to find and scale it. It requires a specific geology: underground reservoirs of hot water or steam, along with porous rocks that allow the water to move through them, heat up, and be brought to the surface where it can power turbines. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were high levels of excitement around geothermal, with oil and gas giants spending huge amounts drilling to find hidden systems, Hoiland said. It's a “classic needle in the haystack problem,” said Joel Edwards, co-founder and CTO of Zanskar. “There's no one type of data that tells you that a system is below you, even if you're right on top of it.” Instead, there are multiple indicators which are really hard for humans to put together to figure out if a system exists. The AI models Zanskar uses are fed information on where blind systems already exist. This data is plentiful as, over the last century and more, humans have accidentally stumbled on many around the world while drilling for other resources such as oil and gas. AI models have “gotten really good over the last 10 years at being able to pull those types of signals out of noise,” Hoiland said. Once a potential location has been found, the next step for the company is to drill down to confirm the reserve exists and is hot enough to produce utility-scale power. That's exactly what they did at Big Blind over the summer, drilling wells to depths of around 2,700 feet where they found porous rock at 250 degrees Fahrenheit. They know the site is at least the minimum size needed to support a power plant, but don't yet have a sense of how big it could be. There is also work to be done to navigate permitting processes and grid interconnection, but the company estimates the first electricity could be produced here in three to five years' time. Zanskar's discovery “is very significant,” said James Faulds, a professor of geosciences at Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology. (Faulds does not work with the company, but two of his former graduate students do.) Estimates suggest over three-quarters of US geothermal resources are blind, Faulds told CNN. “Refining methods to find such systems has the potential to unleash many tens and perhaps hundreds of gigawatts in the western US alone,” he said. An oft-cited government analysis from 2008 estimated undiscovered geothermal reserves in the US could provide around 30 gigawatts of power, enough to power around 25 million homes. Hoiland thinks the real figure could be at least 10 times higher. Big Blind is the company's first blind site discovery, but it's the third site it has drilled and hit commercial resources. If Zanskar can keep its costs down, “that will go a long way in attracting investment,” said Sophia Bauer, geothermal project manager at Global Energy Monitor, a non-profit. Geothermal has a big advantage because it can harness drilling techniques already fine-tuned by the oil and gas industry, she told CNN. While the Trump administration has taken an ax to solar and wind, geothermal has gone under the radar and is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years, according to a March report from Global Energy Monitor, authored by Bauer. Some experts hope geothermal will help fulfill the soaring electricity demand from data centers, many of which are used for AI. Zanskar's discovery is the latest development in what some are calling a geothermal renaissance. Much of the recent buzz has been around next-gen geothermal techniques, which use advanced tools of the oil and gas industry — including fracking — to drill very deep wells and artificially create the conditions needed to harness geothermal energy. But Hoiland says Zanskar's work shows conventional geothermal still has huge untapped potential. Joseph Moore, a University of Utah geologist, said AI could be a “gamechanger” for the industry, provided its success at finding hidden geothermal systems can be replicated multiple times. “It's the latest advancement for this benign, renewable energy source,” he told CNN.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They are considering discharge petitions, which allow members to force a bill out of committee and allow a vote, circumventing House leadership, provided they get signatures from the majority of the House (currently 218 votes are needed). Democrats are mulling either a bipartisan discharge petition led by Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) and Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) over a similar proposal from Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) to extend the Affordable Care Act‘s enhanced tax credits. Democratic leadership has yet to throw its support behind either measure. House Republican leadership has all but refused to entertain an extension of the tax credits, as conservatives have long been opposed to Obamacare. The leaders said they would put healthcare bills up for a vote next week, but they are expected to be more messaging-based than actual policy changes. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) told the Washington Examiner that leadership is “not in favor” of either petition. But that's not stopping rank-and-file GOP members from pushing their policy priorities. “You try to do things through the normal course,” Fitzpatrick said. The bill would also require a vote by July 2026 on other policies that would reduce Americans' health insurance premiums, as well as create new rules expediting floor time for the consideration of future “enhanced premium tax credit reform bills.” The bipartisan group for Golden and Fitzpatrick's bill said they did not seek support from the leadership of either party when bringing this measure forward, with Fitzpatrick telling the Washington Examiner they have still not had conversations with Democratic leadership as of Thursday evening. Support from Democratic leadership remains up in the air, and they have not offered guidance to their members on whether to vote for one or the other, per sources. In a caucus meeting earlier this morning, both House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone (D-NJ) had raised concerns that both discharge petitions only extend the subsidies for a short period of time. Ways and Means Committee Richard Neal (D-MA) said he does not support either petition so far, noting his staff is still going through details. The petition has received every Democrat's signature, but Republicans are all but assured not to join because the minority leader's proposal does not enact any reforms. “Those conversations can start now,” Golden told reporters, acknowledging the bill doesn't have full support yet. One House Democrat told the Washington Examiner that the caucus would prefer to see something more permanent so we “don't have a crisis every year.” “If [Republicans] support the tax credits, they should just make them permanent or extend them three years,” the lawmaker said.” Extending it less than that just looks like political cover for themselves.” From a policy standpoint, Democrats may be more likely to gravitate toward Kiggans's and Gottheimer's bill, given that it pushes for higher subsidies and no health savings account options. The party has long argued that HSAs do not actually lower premium costs, given that the accounts can't be used to pay for premiums under current law. When asked if he was pushing for his or Kiggans's to be considered for a vote by the speaker, Fitzpatrick said “either or.” He acknowledged that some members might be in favor of one or the other based on the details, but providing two options is their effort to try and “find a home for everybody where their most comfortable parking their positions.” That's not how we're viewing it,” the Pennsylvania congressman said. He said there are “further conversations” to be had about a plan, but he didn't want to get ahead of the speaker.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Justice Department's mortgage fraud investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James is on life support after a grand jury, for the second time, rejected an indictment that would have revived charges against her. The rejection is an embarrassing setback for the Justice department — which had sought to revive the criminal case after a federal judge ruled Halligan was appointed unlawfully — and for the administration, who had positioned James' case as a centerpiece in its retribution campaign. Prosecutors could go back to a grand jury again and continue their efforts to re-indict James over the same allegations in the hopes that one will approve charges. Continuing to pursue indictments is “exceedingly rare” in federal cases, according to former federal prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky. The Trump Justice Department, however, has shown a proclivity to try the strategy in some other immigration-related cases earlier this year. “One no true bill is a point. That line points to an acquittal at trial,” Zelinsky said. “The Government should hang it up at strike two rather than go down swinging.” In the original indictment, prosecutors said James had claimed on mortgage paperwork that a home she purchased in Norfolk, Virginia, would be her second residence, allowing her to get a favorable mortgage rate. Prosecutors said that James didn't use the house and rented it instead. James had pleaded not guilty to one count of making false statements to a financial institution and one count of bank fraud before the case was dismissed. In a statement to CNN, James' attorney Abbe Lowell said this “unprecedented rejection makes even clearer that this case should never have seen the light of day.” Legal experts told CNN that such repeated efforts to revive the case could raise policy and constitutional concerns. But such repeated attempts — if eventually successful — may help fuel James' allegation that she's being unfairly targeted for prosecution. “The evidence of vindictiveness is to go back and back before the grand jury, notwithstanding their inability to secure an indictment,” Gertner said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Less than six months after President Donald Trump deployed the National Guard to Washington, DC, the mission is becoming more perilous and complex — and perhaps more permanent. After last month's shooting near the White House left one National Guard member dead and another critically wounded, some troops are now conducting joint patrols with local police, a move intended to provide more security to the very people sent to make the city safer. While the DC Guard has already been extended to February, officials expect additional states will also be directed to keep their troops in place. Conversations have already started about keeping troops in Washington for the America 250th anniversary celebration next year — a major priority for the White House. This all comes as guard members and their families have grown increasingly uneasy since the November 26 shooting. One mother of a Mississippi guardsman, who has been in Washington since November, said she had initially taken comfort in knowing her son would be serving on US soil, which she figured would be safer. “My nerves went haywire and I immediately texted [my son's] phone just to get a response to see was he okay,” she said. Jacob Hill from Alabama died on November 13 while on the DC mission after what officials said was a medical emergency from an off-duty incident. A source familiar with the mission said Hill was found unresponsive in his room. The DC mission has taken an emotional toll, several service members said. While some who spoke to CNN said the shooting renewed many troops' sense of purpose for the mission, others said morale had been slumping because of mundane orders, like just standing around a metro station. Several service members expressed feeling their presence was resented by local residents. CNN is not naming the guard members or their family interviewed for this story because they're not authorized to speak to the media and feared reprisal. “It was hard to be around people that were anti-military or didn't like or appreciate you because of the orders that we were on, but you know, we were just doing our job,” said one guard member who had been deployed from Louisiana until recently. With no end in sight, National Guard troops deployed to DC grow weary But dying in our country is too close to home.” Schwalb noted that DC police officers have had to “coordinate with and escort” guardsmen in the city to minimize threats, a task Schwalb said has “redoubled” following last month's shooting. That's roughly one-third of the Metropolitan Police Department's annual budget. Democratic Sen. Gary Peters from Michigan said in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday that ongoing National Guard deployments to US cities around the country have so far cost $410 million “There is nothing conservative about this,” a federal military official told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid being perceived as criticizing the National Guard. “A fraction of this money could be far better spent directly on crime-prevention measures.” A far smaller sum, they note, could have gone toward addressing chronic short-staffing at the DC police department, which is about 800 officers below its recommended staffing level of 4,000. Trump officials had said the purpose of the National Guard in DC was to establish a presence at various locations – mostly federal monuments and metro stations – and act as a crime deterrent. No official plan, however, has been established for how to keep National Guardsmen safe from random attacks, according to one source familiar with the mission. A source familiar with the mission said officials are regularly doing assessments and making plans if the mission continues getting extended – looking at things like what would be needed for tourism season in DC and weather patterns in the spring. But lingering uncertainty about how long the mission will last also comes at a price, as officials are unable to make long-term arrangements that might be more cost-effective. Housing for out-of-state troops is among the biggest cost expenditures, with most out-of-town troops assigned to stay in suburban Virginia hotels. Housing allowances are also given to DC National Guard members, in some cases effectively paying them to stay in their own homes. In the summer months, the guard spent $5 million on a tent city, according to a CNN review of contracts, plus more than $1 million on renting air conditioning units and land mobile radios. Rumors of an extended deployment until next summer are already spreading through the ranks. A senior Republican official from a state that contributed troops said last month's shooting has made it harder for governors to publicly question the deployment. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it is a frequent conversation among governors, but none of whom are willing to raise it publicly to avoid alienating the White House. The challenge right now, the source said, is that there isn't any official guarantee of mission continuity, making it hard to recruit people away from civilian careers. But the person said “more than enough people” are already interested. “We are committed to treating every member of the community with dignity and respect,” said a Joint Task Force-DC spokesperson. “Our strong partnership with local and federal agencies ensures a coordinated and professional response as we work together to keep our capital safe.” The actual impact on crime in DC has so far been inconclusive. There has been a sustained decrease in reports of motor vehicle theft, according to DC crime data, every month since Trump announced his federal takeover of Washington's police department and surged National Guard and other federal law enforcement to the city in September. But other crimes, such as homicide, robbery, burglary and assault with a deadly weapon, which dropped initially at the start of the takeover, have risen at least a little since then. While some of the commissions accepted and were happy to see guard members then come through, others felt uneasy inviting the troops into their communities. “Some of us worried that the presence of the National Guard wouldn't actually make our neighborhood safer and it could actually present risks,” said Peter Wood, the commissioner in DC's Adams Morgan neighborhood. An amicus brief filed last week and signed by more than 30 retired former senior military officials argues against deploying the National Guard “in a highly politicized context,” as the administration has done in DC. The brief also says that most National Guard “have only limited law enforcement training,” which could put both them and civilians at risk. “If crime on the streets in Washington, D.C., is an issue, that's something for law enforcement to deal with,” retired Brig. “I would think that a reasonable chain of command would say, ‘We need to fortify, we need to strengthen a civilian law enforcement capability within the city of Washington, D.C.,'” said Smith. No one in the National Guard is trained to be a police officer.” He added that while public sentiment has typically been supportive of the guard as a presence available to help in emergencies, that image could “become tarnished” if the troops are used “as a political pawn.” “And yes, some people may target National Guardsmen” as a result, Smith said. Just days after the two members from their state were shot, a group of guardsmen from West Virginia were back on duty in Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood. The Louisiana guardsman who had been deployed to DC for several months before coming off the mission several weeks ago said soldiers “accomplished a lot, even if it didn't seem like a lot.” “Morale seemed to heighten when people were ready to go home because morale was kind of low when we were there, when people were just getting treated like scum or just treated like they didn't matter, especially when we signed up to serve our country and provide help where it's needed,” the guardsman said. A mother of an Oklahoma National Guard member said she'd been fully supportive of the mission as other states sent their troops to Washington. “We're terrified, that's all I can really say,” the mother said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Food and Drug Administration intends to put a “black box” warning on Covid-19 vaccines, according to two people familiar with the agency's plans, the latest move by President Donald Trump's health officials to undermine a vaccine that was a standout victory of his first term. A boxed warning, which appears at the top of prescribing information for medicines, is the agency's most serious, designed to warn about risks such as death or life-threatening or disabling reactions that should be weighed against the intervention's benefits. Boxed warnings on opioids, for example, warn about risks of abuse, addiction, overdose and death. The plan has not been finalized and may still change. “Unless the FDA announces it, any claim about what it will do is pure speculation,” US Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said Thursday. Recommending Covid-19 vaccines for everyone in the US could save thousands more lives than limiting to high-risk groups In response to CNN's inquiry about the FDA's plans, Moderna pointed to a statement it issued in September about the safety of its Covid-19 vaccine, SpikeVax. It notes that the safety of its vaccine is “rigorously monitored by Moderna, the US FDA, and regulators in more than 90 countries,” and that, with more than a billion doses distributed worldwide, those systems “have not reported any new or undisclosed safety concerns in children or pregnant women.” Pfizer too issued a statement in September supporting the safety and efficacy of its Covid-19 vaccine. The statements from both companies came after reports that federal health officials might seek to tie the vaccines to safety risks in pregnant women and children. One study estimated that in their first year of use, Covid-19 vaccinations averted almost 20 million deaths around the world. Children who received Covid-19 vaccines in the 2024-25 respiratory virus season also had a “substantially lower risk” of emergency department and urgent care visits related to the virus, according to a CDC report published Thursday. The vaccines were about 76% effective in preventing these outcomes among healthy children ages 9 months to 4 years and about 56% effective among children ages 5 to 17 compared with those who did not receive an updated vaccine for the 2024-25 season. But Trump installed as his Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who has faced criticism from public health experts and lawmakers for his efforts to impose his personal views despite the science. Prasad has been a controversial figure, both in his role at the FDA and previously, as a podcaster and professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California at San Francisco. A critic of the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccine policy, he was named CBER director under FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary in May before resigning in July under pressure from the White House and right-wing activist Laura Loomer. In late November, Prasad sent a memo to staff within CBER, the division at the FDA that oversees vaccines, claiming that staff in the agency's Office of Biostatistics and Pharmacovigilance had “found that at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving Covid-19 vaccination.” He did not provide additional information but promised “swift action” in response. “The FDA takes very seriously any death that is attributed to a regulated medical product,” Nixon, of HHS, said Thursday. Prasad focused on myocarditis, or heart inflammation, a very rare side effect after administration of the mRNA vaccines. It was detected with early use of those shots, when the first and second doses were recommended to be spaced as closely as three weeks apart, and was predominantly seen in boys and young men. HHS also said this week that the FDA was looking into whether deaths “across multiple age groups” might be related to Covid-19 vaccines. Prasad's memo, which promised an overhaul of how the FDA regulates vaccines more broadly, drew alarm from outside public health experts, many of whom demanded to see the data supporting Prasad's claims. A dozen former FDA commissioners wrote an open letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine expressing concern around “sweeping new FDA assertions about vaccine safety.” “What we're watching is misinformation and lies in aggregate that will discourage the population from vaccination. Covid-19 vaccination substantially lowered risks for children last season, CDC report says It may also convene an advisory committee — a panel of independent outside experts – to publicly vet the safety data and give advice. None of these steps seems to have been taken so far. “I guess my concern is that in this case, there's not a process,” said Kesselheim, who has studied the impact of black box warnings on drug labels. “My concern is that this will be seen as yet another in the long line of decisions that this FDA is making based on its own political goals, rather than after a dutiful and thoughtful and public review of the science.” Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, said, “Any questions regarding potential safety issues are being thoroughly reviewed by the FDA's established scientific and regulatory processes, ensuring that all decisions are based on rigorous, independent evaluation of the data.” “But to only talk about potential harms for vaccines, without talking about the thousands of hospitalizations and the many pediatric deaths that these vaccines prevented, is irresponsible and not how our government should be messaging about vaccines to the public.” How RFK Jr.'s misguided science on mRNA vaccines is shaping policy − a vaccine expert examines the false claims “Scientifically, I don't think it makes any sense at all, because we haven't seen any of this data,” she said. “Presumably it's going to say something like ‘this vaccine is dangerous.' The FDA puts those on things when there are serious safety risks associated with them. And so it doesn't make sense from an evidence-based perspective, at least based on any of the data that anybody's seen.” Rasmussen said Prasad has a longstanding and well-documented antipathy toward the Covid-19 vaccine, as do other administration officials. Nixon said it's “irresponsible for outside commentators to speculate about secondhand information they have not seen directly. We categorically reject the suggestion that anyone on our team is attempting to ‘manufacture evidence.</p>
