The humiliation Washington is inflicting on Western Europe today will shape an entire generation of politicians who will eventually have to rediscover how to deal with Russia. The lessons they are absorbing now may prove as important as those learned by previous Western European leaders who built a dialogue with the USSR after 1945.

Over the past year, we have grown accustomed to watching the US treat its European allies with increasing roughness. But it would be a mistake to simply enjoy the spectacle. Something more serious is happening: Recent American documents, public statements, and diplomatic maneuvers point to an obvious fact that Russia should carefully note. The US is not the EU's friend. It is not even a reliable ally. Its behavior is grounded in a deep cultural arrogance and an instinctive greed, and these are constants that will not change regardless of who sits in the White House.

Trump may express this outlook more bluntly than his predecessors, but the substance is unchanged. Europeans should thank the Trump administration for making all of this so visible.

Against this backdrop, Russia should not rule out the possibility that relations with our European neighbors could eventually be rebuilt. The half-continent is our neighbor, whether we like it or not. But that does not mean Russia wants to absorb or dominate it. Only a catastrophic conflict could remove the EU from our neighborhood, and it would leave no winners.

For any future restoration of ties, at least three conditions matter. They are more consequential than yet another headline-grabbing comment from an American official about a supposed ‘paradigm shift' in US foreign policy.

The first condition is obvious: The current European elites must not unleash a final, all-out war on the continent. They have already done so twice. Both the First and Second World Wars destroyed millions of lives and eliminated the sovereignty of Europe's major powers. World War I destroyed Europe's global empires. World War II consolidated American dominance over the half-continent. Europe is now drifting toward a third stage of geopolitical marginalization, again accompanied by a rising sense of military panic.

European politicians and generals have become so eager to talk publicly about war with Russia that President Vladimir Putin was forced to address the matter a few days ago. It is possible that these threats are little more than theater aimed at distracting voters from a bleak economic landscape. Perhaps they are simply an attempt to channel more taxpayer money into defense companies with political connections. But as a responsible nuclear power, Russia cannot ignore this rhetoric.

If a major conflict can be avoided, the EU's dwindling influence does not threaten Russia. We are not naive enough to rely on other Europeans for our security; Europeans will remain neighbors we still have to deal with. And frankly, weak neighbors are easier to manage than strong ones.

A second condition concerns the US itself. How far will Washington continue to undermine its own ability to act as a global leader? Right now, the trend is accelerating. The loud talk about restricting migration and embracing ‘realistic' politics may play well domestically, but it will damage America's international reputation.

Realism is not inherently negative. It signals a willingness to abandon unnecessary ideological dogmas. But there is a price. Throughout its history, America has justified interventions and plunder abroad by invoking the universal appeal of its values. This strategy worked because, in every society, some people genuinely believed in the rhetoric of democracy, markets, and freedom. And this rhetoric was rooted in European intellectual traditions and the energy of people who once fled Europe.

Trumpism is different. Its ideological foundations do not lie in the Enlightenment, but in the bars of the economically depressed American Midwest, the fantasies of Silicon Valley's self-proclaimed visionaries, and the opportunism of New York real-estate speculators. This is a far weaker basis for sustaining global influence.

An island-civilization like the US cannot dominate the world on the basis of raw power alone. It requires willing supporters. Will the same number of people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America rally behind Washington's new ‘realism' as they once did behind its claims to defend ‘freedom and democracy'? It is unclear.

Migration is another factor. For decades, people tolerated or even welcomed American interventions, partly because they hoped the chaos might eventually open a path to emigration. Few people admire US foreign policy, but many dream of living in the US. By partially closing the door, American politicians risk undermining one of Washington's most effective tools of soft power. Perhaps the US will eventually reverse course. For now, there is no sign of it.

Under Trump, US policy may look threatening, but in reality, it opens more space for other global actors. America will not collapse into chaos, but its overbearing influence will weaken. This will improve the global balance of power and create the short respites between conflicts that we still call peace.

The final condition relates to Europe's internal politics. The continent desperately needs new leaders. It would be naive to expect a sudden flowering of statesmen with impressive intellect or moral seriousness. But perhaps, at a national level, the current crop of hopeless figures from the 1990s and 2000s will gradually be replaced by people slightly better suited to today's reality.

For Russia, this shift would be useful. For the EU, it is essential.

The humiliation the US is inflicting on Europe today is not just an episode in transatlantic relations. It is a formative event. The politicians who will one day negotiate with Russia are watching the US treat them not as partners, but as subordinates. The more openly the Americans behave like demanding overseers rather than allies, the more enduring the lesson will be.

And that is ultimately good for Russia's long-term interests and for stability across the continent.

Russia is ready to help facilitate political dialogue in war-torn Sudan if the country's authorities request it, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during an embassy roundtable discussion on Thursday in Moscow.

Speaking at the event titled ‘Ukraine crisis. Diplomacy and settlement prospects', the minister said Moscow had consistently encouraged both Sudan's Sovereign Council and its opponents to engage in negotiations, but dialogue had not yet taken place.

The East African nation has been engulfed in a brutal civil conflict for more than two years.

Lavrov stressed that now is the time to focus on finding solutions to the crisis and reiterated that Russia “is ready to facilitate” peace efforts, noting that Moscow “has such capabilities” and “if your [Sudanese] government is in favor, we will try to make use of these capabilities.” 

He also addressed claims that foreign fighters, including Ukrainians, were participating in the Sudan conflict. Responding to a question that alleged Ukrainian mercenaries were committing atrocities, the minister noted Sudan could raise the issue directly with Ukraine, either to demand the cessation of mercenary activity or to press Kiev to investigate and take action, if it claims ignorance. 

In October, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova cited remarks attributed to Colonel Fath al-Sayid of the Sudanese military intelligence, who claimed that Ukrainian and Colombian mercenaries were fighting alongside the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). According to Zakharova, the fighters used Ukrainian-made drones.

Sudan descended into chaos in April 2023 when fighting erupted between the national army (Sudanese Armed Forces, SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). This occurred after months of tension between their commanders, army generals Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo ‘Hemedti', respectively, over a planned transition to civilian rule. What began in the capital, Khartoum, as a power struggle has devastated the country, killing tens of thousands and displacing millions.

Regional and international peace efforts, including African Union mediation and Saudi–US talks in Jeddah, have repeatedly stalled. Sudanese officials have named Colombians and Ukrainians among mercenaries backing the RSF against the army. Officials have also accused Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates of involvement and recently claimed the European Union has an “incomplete understanding of the complex situation” in the country.

Khartoum has also accused authorities in neighboring Kenya of backing the RSF and has broken ties with the East African grouping IGAD amid mistrust of regional mediation. In July, TASIS, a political coalition aligned with the paramilitary, announced the formation of a rival government months after its members signed a charter in Nairobi. It named Gen. Dagalo as chairman of a 15-member presidential council, a move rejected by the UN and AU.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly called for a peaceful resolution in Sudan. In May, it urged the sides to cease hostilities immediately and begin political negotiations. A ministry statement at the time emphasized the importance of an “inclusive intra-Sudanese dialogue without external interference” as the only path to restoring stability.

In addition, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin met in June with the UN secretary-general's personal envoy for Sudan, Ramtane Lamamra, to discuss ways to bring the armed conflict in Sudan to an end.

Last September, Lavrov voiced concern about Sudan's deteriorating situation, stating that Russia was actively seeking ways to contribute to a peaceful settlement.

Ukraine used a major chemical facility as a base for foreign mercenaries and their heavy weapons, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Friday, citing internal correspondence.

The allegation was presented by Major General Aleksey Rtishchev, head of Russia's Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Troops, during a briefing on alleged Ukrainian violations of international agreements governing weapons of mass destruction.

Rtishchev cited a letter from the management of the Odessa Portside Plant, a large chemical complex located about 35km from the eponymous port city. The letter, sent to regional authorities in September, complained about the presence of “foreign specialists” and military hardware at the site and warned that such activity could provoke Russian strikes and potentially trigger the release of more than 200 tons of liquid ammonia.

Rtishchev said the forces involved were Romanian mercenaries equipped with multiple-launch rocket systems. He claimed that since realizing Russian forces avoid targeting chemical industry sites, Kiev has been using such no-strike locations as a “technogenic shield,” ignoring the dangers posed to nearby residents.

During a briefing in July, the general reported a similar Ukrainian letter in which an executive of the state-owned company Ukrkhimtransammiak complained about unauthorized military use of an ammonia pipeline service station. The underground pipeline was originally built in Soviet times to transport ammonia from Russia to the Odessa Region plant.

According to the Russian military, Ukraine has repeatedly made reckless military use of hazardous infrastructure and would seek to blame Moscow should an industrial disaster occur.

During the Friday briefing, Rtishchev claimed that Ukrainian forces and intelligence services continue to employ chemical agents on the battlefield and in targeted assassination attacks. He said the Defense Ministry has gathered new evidence allegedly showing state-directed efforts to adapt heavy rotary-wing drones for the delivery of chemical munitions.

He further accused Kiev's Western supporters of enabling such activities, including by supplying protective equipment in quantities he described as excessive for a country that officially denies having a chemical weapons program. In 2025 alone Kiev requested over 200 additional gas masks and hazmat suits, he noted.

ASHGABAT, December 12. /TASS/. All of Donbass is Russian territory, Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov said, commenting on Vladimir Zelensky's idea to hold a referendum there.

""Donbass is Russian [territory],"" the Kremlin aide said in a comment to a Life reporter. ""All of Donbass is Russian,"" he emphasized, citing a provision in the Russian Constitution.

On Thursday, Zelensky said the question of territory as part of a peace plan for Ukraine should be answered through a referendum.

Peace talks have intensified since November when Washington proposed a 28-point peace plan. The document sparked dissatisfaction in Kiev and among its European partners, who sought significant revisions. On December 8, Zelensky announced that a new version of the peace proposal, drafted during his meeting with European leaders, would be handed over to the US. He claimed the plan had been reduced to 20 points. Ukraine delivered its response to the US-drafted peace plan to US President Donald Trump on December 10, asking for land concessions.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, December 12. /TASS/. It is absolutely impossible to negotiate on the new version of the US peace plan on Ukraine, drafted by Vladimir Zelensky and European leaders, former Ukrainian Prime Minister (2010-2014) Nikolay Azarov has told TASS.

""In fact, it is absolutely impossible to negotiate on the project they have just forwarded to [US President Donald] Trump, although I have no idea of what the reaction will be,"" Azarov said. ""Therefore, I don't think that [the conflict] can be settled before Christmas.""

He added that there was no chances of resolving the conflict by Christmas ""first of all because of the stance taken by Western countries and Zelensky.""

Washington had previously proposed a 28-point plan for settling the conflict in Ukraine. The document caused discontent among Kiev and its European partners, who tried to significantly revise it. Later, Trump said that the initial plan had been revised to address the concerns of both Moscow and Kiev, leaving only a few contentious issues. US representatives held talks with the Ukrainian delegation in Florida and with the Russian side in Moscow.

On December 8, Vladimir Zelensky promised to submit a 20-point peace plan to the US, developed during his meeting with European leaders. On December 10, they presented Trump with a proposal for Ukraine to make territorial concessions as part of a plan to settle the conflict. On December 11, ABC news reported, citing a Ukrainian official, that Ukraine has sent to the US another variant of a peace plan, consisting of 20 points.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, December 12. /TASS/. The Bank of Russia has filed a lawsuit against the Euroclear depository in the Moscow Arbitration Court for damages caused to the Bank of Russia, the regulator's press service reported.

The amount of the claim against the depository was not specified in the statement.

""In connection with the illegal actions of the Euroclear depository, which are causing damages to the Bank of Russia, as well as in connection with the mechanisms officially reviewed by the European Commission for the direct or indirect use of Bank of Russia assets without the consent of the Bank of Russia, the Bank of Russia is filing a lawsuit in the Moscow Arbitration Court against the Euroclear depository for damages caused to the Bank of Russia,"" the statement reads.

The regulator stressed that the actions of the Euroclear depository caused damage ""due to the inability to manage cash and securities belonging to the Bank of Russia.""

The majority of Russia's sovereign assets frozen in Europe (over €200 billion) are blocked on Euroclear's platform in Belgium. The depository repeatedly opposed the expropriation of the assets, warning that it could lead to Russia seizing European or Belgian assets elsewhere in the world through legal action.

Earlier Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the global financial and economic order would be destroyed, and economic separatism would only intensify, if the West stole Russia's frozen assets. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that Moscow would definitely respond to the theft of its assets in Europe. He stressed that the Kremlin intends to organize legal proceedings against those involved in this scheme.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Latest batch includes photos of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Richard Branson as top Democrat says ‘all we want is full transparency'

House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries has called on the Trump administration to “comply with the law” and release the full Epstein files, adding that his party would continue to pressure the justice department to release the files by the congressionally mandated 19 December deadline.

A reminder that the 19 images shared by the House oversight committee in today's drop are separate to the archive that the DoJ has been ordered to release, but they do add to the political momentum and pressure mounting on the Trump administration over the issue.

Jeffries told reporters earlier:

The so-called Department of Justice under the Trump administration needs to comply with the law.

These people who are part of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump and JD Vance himself, all said for years that they wanted to release the Epstein files.

Didn't they come into office and do the exact opposite, obstruct and obfuscate, hide stuff from the American people?

All we want is full transparency so that the American people can get the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. That's what the Epstein survivors deserve and have demanded and we are going to make sure that the Department of Justice complies.

In comments to reporters earlier, Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, said that just under 25,000 images had been examined out of the 95,000 photographs from the estate, and said that more photos from the Epstein estate would be released “in the days and weeks ahead”.

“Some of the other photos we did not put out today are incredibly disturbing,” he added.

So there's an enormous amount of photos that we have not gone through. It'll take days and weeks to make sure we have those photos and redaction is done in the appropriate way.

We will continue to put out more photos in the days and weeks ahead, but I caution folks at the redaction process, and ensuring we protect survivors and women abused by Epstein.

He accused the White House of a cover-up and implored the Trump administration to “release the files immediately”.

Republicans who lead the House oversight committee lambasted Democrats for the images they released from the Epstein estate today, accusing them of “chasing headlines by releasing a handful of selectively censored and cherry-picked photos”.

They added:

Democrats' hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. Nothing in the documents we've received shows any wrongdoing. Ranking Member Robert Garcia and Oversight Democrats should be ashamed of this disgusting behavior of putting politics above justice for the survivors.

Also included in today's trove of pictures is British billionaire and co-founder of Virgin group, Richard Branson.

Branson is seen smiling on a beach, sitting next to an unidentified man and holding up a pad of paper with indiscernible writing, as Epstein walks behind them.

Upon releasing the most recent trove of photos from the Epstein estate, the oversight committee's top Democrat – Robert Garcia – said “it is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends”.

The California congressman added that the 19 photos published today “raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW.”

Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon appears in several of the pictures released by House Democrats on the oversight committee.

As I reported earlier, in one of the photos Bannon is seen having a conversation while sitting across a desk from Epstein.

In another, Epstein is taking a selfie of the pair in front of a full-length mirror. Bannon, who was Donald Trump's top White House strategist until he was fired less than a year into the president's first term in office, is also pictured speaking with film director Woody Allen in one photograph.

Included in this latest batch of pictures from the Epstein estate are explicit photos of sex toys. One appears to show a black latex glove with ridges on the fingers, and another features ropes, restraints and a book on “shibari” – a type of Japanese bondage.

Another picture features a bowl of “Trump condoms” selling for $4.50. On the parody packaging it makes fun of the president's style of speech, reading: “I'm HUUUUGE!”

Included in the latest batch of photos from House oversight Democrats today, are several pictures of high profile individuals at public events.

The picture of former prince Andrew and Microsoft founder Bill Gates appears to be from at a summit in London, where the former's brother – King Charles III – was in attendance. The image in the House oversight batch appears to be a cropped version of a picture available on the photo agency Getty.

Here's the image from the news wires:

Similarly, a picture of Epstein and his former lawyer Alan Dershowitz is included in the drop of photos, but appears to be an older photo of the pair back in 2004 that was already published.

Here is the news wire image:

In the new batch of photos released by House oversight Democrats, there is also a picture of Donald Trump surrounded by women, some of whom are wearing leis around their necks. All of their faces have been obscured, but the president appears in the middle holding the waists of two of the women.

Democrats on the House oversight committee have published 19 new photos from the 95,000 they have received from Jeffrey Epstein's estate today. In the latest drop, there are pictures of Bill Clinton alongside the late sex-offender and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. There are also pictures of Donald Trump and Epstein at social events, and even a picture of the president onboard a plane, sitting beside a woman whose face has been redacted.

There are several pictures in the drop which include billionaire Bill Gates.

Another notable face is former Trump adviser and noted ally, Steve Bannon, who appears in one picture sitting across a desk, engaged in conversation with Epstein.

It's worth noting that appearing in pictures from the estate doesn't imply any wrongdoing.

According to multiple outlets, the navy has sent a report to the Pentagon about Senator Mark Kelly's role in a video published to social media last month, where six Democratic members of Congress urged active service members to “refuse illegal orders”.

The video sparked fury from the president, who said the lawmakers were guilty of “seditious behavior” that was “punishable by death”. Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said he would launch an investigation into Kelly – a decorated former navy captain – for possible breaches of military law. This included a memorandum to John Phelan asking the navy secretary to review Kelly and a group of fellow Democrats' comments in the video.

According to the New York Times, the Pentagon's office of general counsel is “providing a legal review and input” of the navy's report, per a Department of Defense official, who spoke to the Times on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.

In response, a spokesperson for Kelly told the Hill that “it defies belief that with all of the threats facing our country, Pete Hegseth initiated this ridiculous process to try to intimidate senator Kelly for saying something Pete Hegseth himself has said repeatedly.”

A reminder that footage from 2016, of the defense secretary repeatedly saying that service members should refuse “unlawful” orders from a potential president Trump on Fox News, was unearthed by CNN earlier this month.

Per our earlier post, a federal judge on Friday morning issued a temporary restraining order to prohibit immigration officials from detaining Kilmar Ábrego García just hours before he was scheduled to appear at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Baltimore.

His lawyers asked the judge to block authorities from detaining him again. The judge says officials cannot re-detain him until the court conducts a hearing on the motion for the temporary restraining order.

Ábrego had been freed from an immigration detention facility in Pennsylvania early on Thursday evening not long after a federal judge in Maryland ordered his release.

On Friday morning, Paula Xinis, a US district judge in Maryland, said that Ábrego cannot be re-detained and in her ruling she wrote that he was likely to succeed in further requests of “relief” from ICE detention, citing the merits of his case.

Donald Trump announced he would pardon former Colorado election clerk Tina Peters. In a post on Truth Social the president wrote that Peters – who is currently serving a nine-year state sentence for her attempts to overturn the 2020 election results – is a “Patriot who simply wanted to make sure that our Elections were Fair and Honest”.

Trump added that “Democrats have been relentless in their targeting” of Peters, who served as the clerk for Mesa county. She was found guilty on state charges of election interference, including four felony counts.

In response to Trump's announcement, several Democratic officials decried his efforts to overturn a state conviction. A reminder that the constitution grants the president pardon power for federal crimes.

“Tina Peters is rightfully in Colorado state prison,” said senator Michael Bennet. “Trump's corrupt and political attempts at a pardon won't work here. Once again, if you can't do the time, don't do the crime.”

Donald Trump is in Washington today. We'll see him at 3pm ET for a bill signing in the Oval Office. We'll make sure to bring you the latest lines.

Earlier, he'll take part in a swearing-in ceremony for Ben Black, the CEO of the US International Development Finance Corporation, and John Jovanovic, who serves as the chair of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM).

A reminder that Jovanovic is married to the daughter of Trump's administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz.

Exclusive: Congress members seek answers after Guardian revealed data to be shared for immigration enforcement

More than 20 members of Congress are demanding answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and homeland security officials after the Guardian revealed the VA is compiling a report on all non-US citizens “employed by or affiliated with” the government agency that will then be shared with other federal agencies, including immigration authorities.

The lawmakers, led by Illinois congresswoman Delia Ramirez – along with congressman Mark Takano of California and US senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, the top Democrats on the House and Senate veterans affairs committees – have written a group letter to be sent to the VA secretary, Doug Collins, and the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, on Friday.

The letter, shared with the Guardian, said the report, to be finalized this month, will “seed fear in noncitizens who perform duties in service to our nation's veterans” during a time when the Trump administration is aggressively arresting, detaining and deporting thousands of immigrants in communities nationwide.

Other co-signers of the letter include US senator Tammy Duckworth, of Illinois, California congressman Robert Garcia, the ranking member of the House oversight committee, Texas congressman Greg Casar, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, ranking member of the House judiciary subcommittee on immigration integrity, security, and enforcement.

The VA operates the nation's largest integrated healthcare system, serving 9 million veterans annually across 170 hospitals and more than 1,000 outpatient clinics. It employs 450,000 workers and enjoys relationships with most major medical schools.

“It is obvious that the VA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are conspiring to illegally intimidate, imprison, and deport individuals who perform duties at the VA in service to our nation's veterans,” the lawmakers wrote.

The VA has confirmed to the Guardian that the department intends to share some of the data it gathers with other federal agencies, including for immigration enforcement purposes. The report on the non-citizen individuals at the VA is due to be provided to Collins later this month.

The VA's leaked memo implies non-citizen doctors, nurses, researchers, medical students, contractors and more will be included in the report.

The Guardian sent the VA a detailed inquiry and request for comment.

VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz responded with the following statement: “VA is required by federal law to continuously vet all employees and affiliates, such as unpaid researchers and others who may have access to VA data or systems, to ensure they meet the federal government's trusted workforce standards.

“As part of this continuous process, VA on November 25 directed under secretaries, assistant secretaries and other key officials to provide a report on all non-United States citizens who are employed by or affiliated with VA. This will not affect veterans seeking care or services at VA, or the delivery of care and services.”

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for comment.

In an appearance on Fox News last weekend, Collins called the Guardian's report “a nothing story”.

However, lawmakers, veterans and VA employees said the mere act of compiling this data, exclusively on non-citizens, could lead qualified workers to quit and exacerbate existing staffing shortages.

In August, the VA inspector general reported “severe” staffing shortages at all of its hospitals. An analysis of VA data by the Guardian shows the agency has lost thousands of “mission-critical” healthcare workers since Trump returned to office – including nearly 3,000 nurses and more than 1,000 doctors.

Heather Fallon, an emergency department nurse at the Captain James A Lovell Federal Health Care Center, a veterans hospital in North Chicago, said conditions there are worsening daily.

On Tuesday night, the emergency department, which is typically staffed with seven to eight nurses – had three or four on duty, she said. The VA declined to comment on staffing at the hospital. Fallon said the VA's decision to allow ICE activities at the facility had already put fear into the hearts of veteran patients and health care workers and that report being compiled will further terrify patients and staff.

Fallon spoke to the Guardian in her capacity as a member of the union, National Nurses United, which also released a statement opposing the VA's creation of a database of non-citizens.

In New York City, a doctor working at a VA hospital, who asked that their identity not be published for fear of retaliation said she worried the agency's increasingly tough-on-immigration stance could have an especially severe impact on veterans' access to specialists.

About 30% of psychiatrists and neurologists and more than 50% of gerontologists and kidney specialists in the United States graduated from medical schools outside the country, according to published data.

Because many VA hospitals are in rural areas with chronic doctor shortages, the agency has traditionally recruited many foreign workers, including facilitating the physicians' legal status through the use of National Interest Waivers. The DHS and state department have sought to impose limits on visas for some healthcare workers this year, a move opposed by professional, medical associations and immigrant rights groups.

In Michigan, retired air force master sergeant Rachel Youkey said she is already experiencing delays in care linked to the immigration crackdown.

A munitions expert who sustained a brain injury from an Afghanistan bomb blast while serving there from 2010 to 2011, Youkey receives care at the VA hospital in Ann Arbor, where many workers are medical residents from the nearby University of Michigan.

She said she used to love her primary care physician, a student from Korea. But after he graduated last year, he was not replaced. She has not had a regular doctor since. “I don't care if someone is a citizen,” she said. “I care that they know what they are doing. Are they competent? I'll take competency above citizenship every time.”

In his appearance on Fox News, Collins attempted to downplay the VA's efforts to collect data on non-citizens, saying the forthcoming report is “simply us going back through the process, making sure that we have updated our rolls, updated our background checks, updated the folks so that they're actually supposed to be here”.

In their letter, however, the Democratic lawmakers express alarm over the breadth of the VA's data collection efforts.

“Foreign-born individuals fill critical roles at VA as employees, contractors, and volunteers, including in research, healthcare, and benefits delivery,” the letter says, adding that the data collection “comes at a time when nationwide healthcare provider shortages are limiting access to care for all Americans, including veterans”.

“The broad, undefined nature of the phrase ‘or affiliated with VA' used throughout the memorandum cited in the Guardian leads us to worry that the data collection could sweep far beyond the walls of VA and our own borders,” the letter adds. “It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the database of all non-US citizens employed by or affiliated with VA will only lead to more illegal detentions and deportations of individuals who dedicate themselves to improving veterans' lives.”

Kristofer Goldsmith, an Iraq war veteran who heads Task Force Butler, an advocacy group that counters extremism, said: “It seems like the Trump administration is trying to reduce – not just the availability of healthcare for veterans, but for all Americans.”

He added: “There are tons of immigrants who come to the United States, dream of being citizens, become doctors, are straight-A students, are law-abiding people, who then train or work at the VA saving lives.”

The lawmakers warn that the report could also lead to increased immigration enforcement against military veterans themselves, some of whom have already been deported under Trump. Veterans make up over a quarter of the VA's workforce, and it is not a requirement to be a US citizen to serve in the military.

“Worst of all, the proposed data collection could lead to the unlawful imprisonment or deportation of veterans who served our country and continued their service at VA, but were denied US citizenship following their military service,” the lawmakers write.

The VA directive requires “all needed data” to be provided by 26 December. A full report on all non-United States citizens with a relationship with the agency is to be provided to Collins 30 December.

In their letter, the Democratic senators and House members request documents and data from the VA and DHS, giving them a deadline of 24 December. They also requested a congressional briefing by 19 December.

At long last, vindication is at hand for an Oscar-winning composer who sought to prove he was just as capable of breathing life into Italy's grand theaters as gritty Hollywood films.

Naples' Teatro San Carlo yesterday evening staged composer Ennio Morricone's only opera, Partenope, three full decades after its composition. It is inspired by the mythical siren who drowned herself after failing to enchant Ulysses, her body washing ashore and becoming a settlement that grew over millennia into the seaside city of Naples.

When Morricone wrote Partenope in 1995, he was already the world-famous creator of the theme to the spaghetti Western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, and haunting soundtracks for epic films such as The Untouchables and Once Upon a Time in America.

He earned an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, but his compositions never resounded in the hallowed halls of opera houses — viewed in his home country as the elite musical echelon. To his great chagrin, Partenope gathered dust for decades; Morricone died without seeing it performed.

“In the end, he read as a sign of destiny the fact he would not make his debut in the opera world,” said Alessandro De Rosa, a close collaborator who coauthored Morricone's autobiography. “I'm sure that if he were alive now, he would have taken the challenge, and would have dialogued with the orchestra and the director, tirelessly, like a young kid.”

Director Vanessa Beecroft and conductor Riccardo Frizza had to find their way through the visionary work without the benefit of those notes.

“It would have been wonderful to be able to talk to Morricone about his musical choices... but we had to understand them from what he left us and tried to interpret them in the best way,” Frizza said.

For instance, Frizza said he chose not to use violins in this orchestra, instead favoring flutes, harps and horns, which appear in Greek mythology.

“Then you have the modern instruments, lots of percussion, with the Neapolitan sounds provided by tambourines and putipu,” he added, referencing a friction drum used in local folk music.

Teatro San Carlo on Thursday evening was filled with anticipation, as Neapolitans attended an open rehearsal. Free tickets were snapped up in just a few hours.

The mythical Partenope is part of Naples' culture, with tradition suggesting her voice represents the city's enduring spirit. The original Greek settlement was named for her. She is depicted at monuments such as the Fontana della Sirena, a fountain that has become one of the city's symbols. Young children all along the Gulf of Naples, living under Mount Vesuvius' shadow, learn the legend of Partenope from their parents.

Like Morricone's opera, Naples itself spent decades downtrodden and overlooked, but is enjoying resurgence: The UN recognized its pizza makers as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity; it was featured on foreign media lists of must-visit destinations; writer Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan novels were acclaimed bestsellers that became an HBO series; and its soccer team in 2023 took home the nation's top league trophy for the first time since Maradona played in the 1980s, then won again in May.

Naples has also been celebrating its 2,500th anniversary this year, and Morricone's opera marks the culmination of festivities. The protagonist in his adaptation is a woman who, after her husband dies and she is separated from her best friend, refuses the consolation of being transformed into a distant constellation. Instead, she asks the gods to let her stretch her wings along the gulf on which an immortal city will arise.

The production explores the link between the ancient legend and the modern city's identity, as two sopranos embody Partenope simultaneously, reflecting her dual nature as body and myth.


PARLIAMENT CHAOS:
                                         Police forcibly removed Brazilian Deputy Glauber Braga after he called the legislation part of a ‘coup offensive' and occupied the speaker's chair                                        Brazil's lower house of Congress early yesterday approved a bill that could slash former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro's prison sentence for plotting a coup, after efforts by a lawmaker to disrupt the proceedings sparked chaos in parliament.
Bolsonaro has been serving a 27-year term since last month after his conviction for a scheme to stop Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office after the 2022 election.
Lawmakers had been discussing a bill that would significantly reduce sentences for several crimes, including attempting a coup d'etat — opening up the prospect that Bolsonaro, 70, could have his sentence cut to

The party, which has long campaigned against immigration, argues that too-fast population growth is overwhelming housing, transport and public services. The level of support comes despite the government urging voters to reject it, warning that strict curbs would damage the economy and prosperity, as Swiss companies depend on foreign workers.
The poll by newspaper group Tamedia/20 Minuten and released yesterday showed that 48 percent of the population plan to vote

A tsunami as high as three metres (10 feet) could hit Japan's northeastern coast after an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 7.6 occurred offshore at 11:15 p.m. (1415 GMT), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said.
Tsunami warnings were issued for the prefectures of Hokkaido, Aomori and Iwate, and a tsunami of 40cm had been observed at Aomori's Mutsu Ogawara and Hokkaido's Urakawa ports before midnight, JMA said.

The 44-year-old senator said on social media that he will carry forward the political legacy that reshaped Brazilian politics. His announcement makes him an instant contender for the presidency.

Soccer fans have accused FIFA of a “monumental betrayal” after latest prices for World Cup tickets began to circulate on Thursday.

The governing body allocates 8 percent of tickets to national associations to sell for games involving their team.

A list published by the German soccer federation revealed prices ranged from US$180 to US$700 for group stage games. The lowest price for the final was US$4,185 and the highest was US$8,680.

The group-stage prices are very different from FIFA's claims of US$60 tickets being available, while the target from US soccer officials when bidding for the tournament seven years ago was to offer hundreds of thousands of US$21 seats across the opening phase of games.

Fan organization Football Supporters Europe (FSE) described the prices unveiled on Thursday as “extortionate.”

“This is a monumental betrayal of the tradition of the World Cup, ignoring the contribution of supporters to the spectacle it is,” it said in a statement.

The English Football Association shared pricing information with the England Supporters Travel Club on Thursday evening, which showed that if a fan bought a ticket for every game through to the final, it would cost just over US$7,000.

FIFA in September said that tickets released through its Web site would initially range from US$60 for group-stage matches to US$6,730 for the final.

However, those prices are subject to change as it adopts dynamic pricing for the first time at the World Cup.

FIFA tickets are available in four categories, with the best seats in Category 1.

In the price list published by the German federation, there were only three categories.

The lowest priced ticket was US$180 for Germany's opening group game against Curacao in Houston, Texas. The lowest price for a prospective semi-final was US$920, rising to US$1,125.

The FSE called on FIFA to immediately halt ticket sales via national associations “until a solution that respects the tradition, universality, and cultural significance of the World Cup is found.”



                                                                                The pressure was already on Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso before their 2-1 defeat to Manchester City on Wednesday in the UEFA Champions League raised further questions about his future.
Arsenal remain perfect in this season's competition and three points clear at the top of the standings after a 3-0 win against Club Brugge, while defending champions Paris Saint-Germain were held 0-0 at Athletic Bilbao.
The clash between Madrid and City was the standout game of the round amid reports this week that Alonso had lost control of the locker room. Speculation over his position is likely to intensify after the latest

Online forum Reddit yesterday filed a court challenge to Australia's world-first law that bans Australian children younger than 16 from holding accounts on social media platforms.

Reddit Inc's suit follows a case filed last month by rights group Digital Freedom Project. Both suits claim the law is unconstitutional, because it infringes on Australia's implied freedom of political communication.

“We believe there are more effective ways for the Australian government to accomplish our shared goal of protecting youth, and the SMMA [Social Media Minimum Age] law carries some serious privacy and political expression issues for everyone on the Internet,” Reddit said. “While we agree with the importance of protecting people under 16, this law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences [including political discussions], and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't.”

Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch from Wednesday face fines of up to A$49.5 million (US$33 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16.

Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant sent compulsory information notices to the 10 age-restricted platforms on Thursday demanding data on how many accounts of young children they had deactivated since the law took effect.

ESafety would send six monthly notices to gauge how effectively the platforms are complying.

Despite the court challenge, Reddit said it would comply with the law and continue to engage with eSafety.

Australian children are searching for alternatives to the age-restricted platforms. Downloads of Yope, an app for sharing photos within friend groups, increased by 251 percent since Monday, said Apptopia, an intelligence platform analyzing mobile apps.

Downloads of photo and video-sharing app Lemon8 increased by 88 percent, it said.

ESafety said it has written to Yope, Lemon8 and other smaller apps to ask them to self-assess whether they meet the definition of an age-restricted platform. If they do, they also face fines if they do not exclude young children.

The platforms' age-verification options were to ask for copies of identification documents, use a third-party to apply age-estimation technology to analyze an account holder's face, or make inferences from data already available, such has how long an account has been held.

The government has not told the platforms how to check ages, but has said requesting all account holders verify their ages would be unnecessarily intrusive, given the tech giants already have sufficient personal data on most people to perform that task.

For privacy reasons, the platforms also cannot compel users to provide government-issued identification.

By Motoshige Itoh / Special to The Yomiuri Shimbun

11:00 JST, December 12, 2025

A phenomenon known as the “weaponization” of trade policy is spreading around the world.

The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has been using the threat of higher import tariffs to force concessions from foreign countries in negotiations, an effective tactic because those countries would suffer if they lost their profits from the massive U.S. market.

Japan's ultimate goal in the tough negotiations with the United States over Trump's tariffs was to avoid losing the key export market for Japanese cars due to the U.S. president's plans to impose sharply increased tariffs on them.

The United States achieved a major success in the bilateral negotiations by making Japan increase its U.S.-bound investments. In other words, Trump successfully earned profits by utilizing trade policy as a weapon.

The United States is not the only country to do this. China has used restrictions on exports of rare earths, known as the strategically important “vitamins of industry,” thereby ensuring that trade negotiations with the United States would go in its favor. If China's rare earth shipments were to stop, the immediate consequence would be that the manufacturing of many products in the United States would come to a halt.

China has a high share of the global output of rare earths, so it has resorted to using this choke point as a weapon. When the issue of the Senkaku Islands came to the fore in 2010, China wielded the threat of restricting rare earth exports to pressure Japan.

The advancement of globalization has heightened many countries' dependence on exporting their goods abroad and importing raw materials. This, in turn, has made them vulnerable to significant economic harm from restrictions on exports and imports.

The weaponization of trade policy is rampant, therefore, as nations take advantage of this situation. Major powers like the United States and China are especially prone to using trade policy this way.

The fundamental idea behind the World Trade Organization is to prevent countries from unilaterally imposing trade restrictions. When this rule functioned effectively, global trade kept growing, with each country benefiting from it.

It is ironic that as countries have become increasingly dependent on foreign trade amid globalization, major powers have found the leeway to weaponize their trade policies.

The progress in economic globalization has become a double-edged sword, simultaneously leading to increased cross-border trade on the positive side and to the greater risk of weaponizing trade policy. It is not easy to stop the major powers from engaging in such weaponization.

The concept of “optimal tariffs,” which has been employed by the Trump administration in tariff negotiations, is noteworthy in terms of the strategic use of trade policy by a major power.

Optimal tariffs are an economic theory that describes a situation in which a major power can influence trade prices in its favor if it can restrict imports through tariffs. Let's look at Japan-U.S. trade in automobiles as an example.

The United States initially announced plans to impose a 27.5% tariff on Japanese cars. In theory, Japanese automakers had a variety of options, ranging from maintaining their cars' export prices while adding the tariff rate to those cars' U.S. prices, to lowering their export prices by the amount of the tariff to keep their U.S. sticker prices unchanged. So, how did Japanese companies actually respond in their pricing strategies?

Many chose to reduce export prices and leave their U.S. prices unchanged, in an apparent bid to not put themselves at a competitive disadvantage in the U.S. market. Additionally, Japanese automakers opted not to change U.S. sticker prices too often because while Japan-U.S. tariffs negotiations were underway, it was believed that the 27.5% rate was only provisional.

For the United States, the Japanese companies' decision to forego price increases in the U.S. market meant the burden on the U.S. consumer would not increase and higher tariff revenue would go to U.S. government coffers. In other words, the United States was able to make a profit from increased tariffs. Of course, if this situation continues for a long time, Japanese manufacturers may finally raise their U.S. prices.

The tariff rate on Japanese cars was eventually cut to 15% following further rounds of negotiations. Even so, it is unlikely that the U.S. prices of Japanese cars will be raised by a full 15%. According to the theory of optimal tariffs, only part of the tariff rate will be passed on to prices in the United States because Japanese makers will lower export prices by trimming their profits. Therefore, the increase in the burden on U.S. consumers will be limited, and the tariff revenue will benefit the United States.

Trump then drew the public's attention by floating the idea of paying $2,000 to every American from the tariffs collected. Regardless of whether the money will be actually paid, the revenue from Trump's tariffs is that large.

The point of the theory of optimal tariffs is that for major powers, free trade with zero tariffs cannot be said to be the best choice. Major powers feel tempted to impose tariffs for various reasons.

If a foreign country levies retaliatory tariffs in response to a major power's move to raise its tariffs, both countries will end up suffering harm. In the case of small countries, it is not realistic to charge retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.

Thinking in terms of the theory of optimal tariffs, the best situation for small countries is one in which every country keeps tariff rates low. If this is what is conceived as free trade, it can be said to be the most desirable situation for both small countries and the world economy as well.

However, China is not a small country. If Washington weaponizes trade policy, it is possible for Beijing to retaliate against the United States. Using such choke points as rare earth shipments, China can maintain negotiating power with the United States.

The problem with free trade is that major powers can benefit by breaking its rules. This is called the beggar-thy-neighbor policy, as a country seeks to gain profits by forcing sacrifices on other countries. The Trump tariffs fall into this category, and there are similar aspects to China's policy of disrupting global competitive conditions through excessive subsidies to domestic firms.

If major powers take the beggaring approach, prompting the entire world to lean toward protectionism, many small countries as well as major ones will face adverse effects.

This is exactly why international organizations such as the WTO were established, setting rules to prevent the implementation of the beggar-thy-neighbor policy by any country and playing an important role in protecting free trade. Thanks to these rules, world trade continued to expand. The United States was for many years instrumental in running the WTO.

However, the expansion of free trade has given rise to the weaponization of trade policy, leading to the adoption of the beggaring policy. The Trump administration is implementing policies that undermine the WTO system.

The weaponization of trade policy and the beggar-thy-neighbor policy bring short-term benefits to major powers, but they cannot generate long-term prosperity. It will not be an easy thing to do, but we must strive to rebuild a free and fair trade system, including restoring the function of the WTO.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Russia's Slavneft-YANOS oil refinery in Yaroslavl, one of the country's five largest, is reportedly on fire after being struck in an overnight drone attack on Dec. 12, officials and local Telegram channels said.

Residents reported at least seven explosions over the city, followed by reports of a fire at the Slavneft-YANOS refinery, located more than 700 kilometers (435 miles) from the Ukrainian border.

Open-source intelligence (OSINT) said the facility was struck, while Yaroslavl Governor Mikhail Yevrayev had earlier warned of a drone threat in the region.

Astra, an independent Telegram channel based in Russia, posted photos and video of an ongoing fire at the facility on the morning of Dec. 12. 

The Slavneft-YANOS plant is a major producer of fuels including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, with a processing capacity of about 15 million tons of crude per year.

Multiple other regions were targeted throughout the night, including Tver, Smolensk, and Moscow. In Tver, a drone explosion damaged the lower floors of a residential building and injured seven people, according to local authorities.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said Russian air defenses intercepted eight drones approaching the capital.

The extent of the damage remains unclear, and Ukraine has not commented on the reported strike.

Ukraine repeatedly uses homegrown long-range drones to launch attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure. Russia's oil and gas production has continued to come under attack as Kyiv attempts to cripple Moscow's primary source of funding for its war in Ukraine.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

A drone explosion damaged the lower floors of a residential building in the Russian city of Tver on Dec. 12, injuring at least seven people, according to regional officials and local Telegram channels.

Residents reported several loud blasts and saw a plume of smoke rising over the area, eyewitness videos showed. Nearby buildings and parked cars were also damaged in the explosion, according to the independent Russian Telegram channel Astra.

Acting Governor Vitaly Korolev said all the injured were taken to hospitals and that emergency services, medics, and rescue crews were working at the scene.

Korolev added that the evacuation of residents was underway and that temporary shelters were being prepared for those displaced.

Ukraine has not commented on the incident, and the Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.

As Russia intensifies aerial attacks on Ukraine and the civilian death toll climbs, Ukraine has stepped up its drone attacks on Russian territory.

U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order at the White House in Washington on Thursday.AL DRAGO/Reuters

The latest United States National Security Strategy, an outline of the proposed ends and means of U.S. foreign policy, has set alarms ringing among traditional American allies, and champagne corks popping in the capitals of traditional foes. It's not pleasant reading.

The current occupant of the White House, an idiosyncratic, instinctive and impulsive policy maker, will feel no obligation to follow the strategy. But it represents what the MAGA movement, or at least part of it, hopes and believes. It's also a primer on where the Republican Party's head is at – and how Donald Trump's eventual successor may think and act. 

It's also entirely in step with a speech given last February in Munich by the likely successor, Vice-President JD Vance. European leaders looking for the reassurance of American support against Russia were instead surprised to find themselves the target of a Moscow-sympathetic, anti-woke harangue. 

Konrad Yakabuski: Trump's National Security Strategy is more of a MAGA rant than foreign-policy playbook

It was the equivalent of an earlier generation of Europeans dialling 911, hoping to hear the reassuring voice of Franklin Delano Roosevelt – and instead getting Philippe Pétain, the collaborationist dictator of Vichy France. Send help? No. You are the real enemy, your society is decadent and you deserve defeat. 

The national security document, released late last week, reimagines the world in light of America's culture wars. There's no mention of “human rights,” but multiple references to “God-given natural rights.” And one of America's key foes is identified as “the sovereignty-sapping incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations.” 

Which organizations? The only specific examples given of “transnationalism” are European.

Whereas America once built alliances and transnational organizations – the most important being NATO – to defend Europe against the military threat of Soviet communism, the new strategy document sees the elected, centre-right and centre-left governments of Europe, and the European Union, as somehow cultural threats to Europe and the U.S. 

There is no criticism of Russia or China on human rights and democracy. The document also says that it's time for “dropping America's misguided experiment with hectoring” the Middle Eastern monarchies and dictatorships “into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government.”

Some realism about the limits of American power is not unreasonable. But this isn't that. It's a flip from targeting dictatorships to alleging that allied democracies are, in fact, not democracies at all. 

Europe is portrayed as a kind of toxic woke dump. (This is beyond weird, given that woke racial categories and DEI are American inventions, exported to Europe.)

Andrew Coyne: Donald Trump – and American democracy – is getting exponentially worse

The document worries about relative European economic decline, but quickly pivots to its real concern: the “stark prospect of civilizational erasure” in Europe, due to “mass migration.”

“Over the long term,” says the paper, “it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain NATO members will become majority non-European. As such, it is an open question whether they will view their place in the world, or their alliance with the United States, in the same way as those who signed the NATO charter.”

It's as if the authors read Michel Houellebecq's novel Submission, in which an Islamist party takes over France, and took it as a news report.

One of the ironies of this obsession with immigration to Europe is that the U.S. has, and has always had, a much higher percentage of non-white citizens than any major European country. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that, in less than a decade, a majority of Americans will be non-white. What does this suggest about that administration's view of that?

Much of the document is devoted to economic and military security. It hints at a return to a world of spheres of influence, with the Americas as an exclusive American sphere.

Opinion: Trump's National Security Strategy is hostile to Canada – and the democratic world

It announces a “Trump corollary” to the 1823 Monroe Doctrine: “We will deny non-Hemispheric competitors the ability to position forces or other threatening capabilities, or to own or control strategically vital assets, in our Hemisphere.” 

What does it all mean for Canada? 

We only get a single passing mention in the document, on a list of countries who are urged to work with the U.S. to stop China from dumping subsidized manufactured goods. It's an example of the kind of co-operation that the U.S. needs, and allies want to offer. But this document mostly disdains co-operation for America Alone – a vision of untrammelled exercise of power and imposition of national will. 

Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, once interviewed people in and around the administration, searching for a definition of the Trump Doctrine. The most concise and accurate? “We're America, bitch.” 

That about sums it up.

Prime Minister Mark Carney is expected to officially announce that he's chosen financier Mark Wiseman, pictured in 2017, to be Canada's ambassador to the U.S. this weekend or early next week.MIKE SEGAR/Reuters

Canadian financier Mark Wiseman has officially been selected by Prime Minister Mark Carney to take up Canada's most important diplomatic role as ambassador to the United States as the country prepares for tough USMCA trade talks, two sources say.

The appointment was approved by cabinet on Thursday, the sources said. The Prime Minister is to make the announcement in the coming days.

The Globe and Mail is not naming the sources who were not authorized to discuss cabinet discussions.

Mr. Wiseman, 55, replaces Kirsten Hillman who served in Washington since 2017, including the past six years as ambassador.

One of the sources said the Prime Minister chose Mr. Wiseman, a close friend, because of his extensive business connections in the United States. President Donald Trump and key advisers, such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, would also respect Mr. Wiseman's financial background, the source said.

Opposition parties warn PM not to appoint Mark Wiseman ambassador to U.S.

Mr. Wiseman has been heavily involved in institutional investments and mergers and acquisitions, including as chair at Lazard Canada, BlackRock and Boston Consulting Group.

Canada had been holding talks for months to remove tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump on Canadian goods such as steel, aluminum and softwood lumber, but those negotiations were stalled after Ontario ran anti-tariff ads.

The focus is now on the United States-Mexico-Canada free-trade deal, which requires all three countries to review the agreement in 2026. The U.S. is expected to seek to renegotiate sections of the pact.

The USMCA has been a vital shield for Canada during the trade war with the United States. Mr. Trump has imposed a 35-per-cent blanket tariffs for Canadian products that aren't compliant with the USMCA's rules of origin, but the carveout means most Canadian goods continue to enter the U.S. tariff-free.

Ms. Hillman said Tuesday she decided to leave the post to give the Prime Minister the ability to put “a team in place” as negotiations get under way on the review of the USMCA.

Mr. Wiseman has no diplomatic or government experience, but he is a seasoned institutional investment player. He was formerly chair of the Alberta Investment Management Corporation, CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and a top manager at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.

Carney rejects idea Trump wants to exit USMCA

He was forced to leave his senior executive position at BlackRock in 2019 for failing to disclose a consensual relationship with a colleague, a violation of the company's policy.

He is now chair of Lazard, a boutique financial advisory and asset management service. In March, the Prime Minister named Mr. Wiseman to his council of advisers on Canada-U.S. relations.

Ms. Hillman told The Globe that the next ambassador must quickly build bridges with Mr. Trump's White House, senior cabinet secretaries and congressional leaders. The new ambassador must also reach out to Mr. Trump's business and political allies outside Washington, she said.

Above all, she said, it's important to listen to what Mr. Trump says and “to find a path forward that works for Canada.”

Earlier this week, the Conservatives and Bloc Quebecois warned Mr. Carney against appointing his long-time friend to Washington.

They seized on comments that Mr. Wiseman made as the co-founder of the Century Initiative. The non-profit organization advocates increasing Canada's population to 100 million by 2100 solely through immigration.

Mr. Wiseman shared a social-media post in May, 2023, that said “100 million may not be federal policy, but it should be – even if it makes Quebec howl.”

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre told the House Wednesday that Mr. Wiseman “is someone who has shown contempt for Quebec and cannot negotiate for Quebec.”

Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, said the Century Initiative's call for 100 million population “is not government policy and never will be.”

The Conservatives also noted that Mr. Wiseman has been quoted as being opposed to supply management, arguing that it inhibits productivity.

Mr. LeBlanc told the House that “we will not negotiate supply management with the Americans,” even though President Trump said he wants the Canadian market to be more open to imports from U.S. farmers.

Faiz Hameed served under jailed ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan. The 14-year prison term is rare for a once-powerful general in Pakistan.

Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed was sentenced to 14 years in prison by a military court in Pakistan on Thursday.

Hameed was the head of the country's Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency from 2019 to 2021 under jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Hameed was convicted on four charges relating to abuse of power and betraying state secrets.

""After lengthy and laborious legal proceedings, (the) accused has been found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment by the court,"" read a judicial statement, without giving details of Hameed's alleged crimes.

Hameed has notably stayed loyal to Khan, who was removed from power following a no-confidence vote in parliament. Khan has been in prison since 2023 after he was convicted on a number of corruption charges.

Khan has accused the US of helping orchestrate his ouster with Pakistan's powerful military. In particular he has pointed to Field Marshal Asim Munir, an army leader once fired by Khan who is now considered the most powerful man in the country.

Hameed is also being investigated over riots in 2023 that saw thousands of Khan supporters attack military buildings.

He has also been convicted of violating the Pakistan Army Act and stripped of his rank.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Why US giant Chevron, not China, may save oil-rich Venezuela","https://www.dw.com/en/why-us-giant-chevron-not-china-may-save-oil-rich-venezuela/a-75117400","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 10:19:06 GMT","

Chevron is driving Venezuela's oil rebound while China is pulling back. As the fate of President Nicolas Maduro grows uncertain, Washington's renewed leverage is reshaping the country's economic and geopolitical future.

Speculation over President Nicolas Maduro's political future has intensified after US forces seized a Venezuelan oil tanker off the country's coast. The incident on Wednesday underscored Washington's longstanding interest in a nation that holds the world's largest proven oil reserves — an interest shared, albeit for different reasons, by China.

""Whoever comes to power, I can assure you, the first call will be Trump, but the second will be Xi Jinping,"" said Parsifal D'Sola Alvarado, a specialist in China–Latin America relations.

D'Sola Alvarado heads the Fundacion Andres Bello (Latin American-Chinese Research Center) based in Bogota, Colombia and the Spanish capital, Madrid. He previously worked with Venezuelan opposition figure Juan Guaido, where he managed contacts with Chinese officials.

Speaking with DW, D'Sola Alvarado said he doubts China would stand firmly behind Maduro in the event of a confrontation with Washington.

Beyond diplomatic and political support, he finds it ""highly unlikely that China will offer more proactive support to Maduro, selling arms, or new large investments. China doesn't want more problems with the US.""

China still purchases the majority of Venezuela's oil. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), nearly two-thirds of Venezuelan crude exports went to China in 2023, while 23% went to the US.

Before Washington imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA in 2019 — having earlier blocked its access to US financial markets in 2017 — the US had been the country's largest customer. Production and exports tumbled soon afterward.

OPEC data show that Venezuela's crude exports fell to just under 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2021, continuing a decline that long predated sanctions. Output had peaked at almost 2 million bpd in 2015 before sliding steadily due to years of mismanagement, corruption and chronic underinvestment.

Only in 2023 did production begin to recover, with exports rising to 655,000 bpd in 2024 and reaching 921,000 bpd in November this year.

The rebound owes much to the United States, not China.

In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Washington eased some restrictions on Venezuela, with the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control granting US oil major Chevron special licenses to resume exports from its Venezuelan joint ventures. In October 2025, the company received fresh authorization to produce oil there.

""The recovery of oil production in Venezuela has happened because of Chevron,"" Francisco J. Monaldi, an energy policy specialist at Rice University's Baker Institute in Houston, Texas, told DW. Chevron now accounts for nearly a quarter of Venezuela's total output.

Maduro greeted the renewed US permissions with enthusiasm. Speaking on state broadcaster Telesur in July, he said: ""Chevron has been present in Venezuela for 102 years, and I hope the company works here for another 100 years without problems.""

While Chevron expands, Chinese investment is limited to smaller-scale projects. China Concord Resources Corp has reportedly begun developing two oil fields, with an investment of about $1 billion (€850 million) planned to boost production to 60,000 bpd by the end of 2026.

But Beijing's state-backed development lenders such as the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China have effectively shut their wallets by not issuing new loans to Caracas since 2016, according to the Global Development Policy Center — a think tank based at Boston University in the US.

Much of Venezuela's roughly $60 billion debt to China has been reduced through restructurings and oil-for-loan deals.

Combined with the lack of new lending, scaled-back diplomacy and quiet outreach to Venezuela's opposition, D'Sola Alvarado sees unmistakable signs that Beijing is ""not completely backing Maduro.""

He notes China had already grown frustrated by 2011, when $8 billion in Chinese funds ""just disappeared"" from the Sino-Venezuelan Investment Fund. ""Chinese authorities were very disappointed how everything turned out and [how] all this crumbled because of corruption,"" said D'Sola Alvarado.

US sanctions, he argues, were not the main reason for China's retreat, rather ""just one more nail in the coffin"" of bilateral relations.

Even if power changes hands in Caracas, D'Sola Alvarado believes China would face limited economic consequences and no ""major losses.""

The bigger shift would be geopolitical, however, with Beijing no longer having direct access to the Venezuelan government and its networks. "" So it's always worthy to have one foot inside for the Chinese,"" he added.

The torrential rainfall in the Pacific Northwest is due to a weather phenomenon called an atmospheric river.

Tens of thousands of people in the US state of Washington were ordered to evacuate on Thursday evening amid surging floodwaters that have inundated farmland.

At least 78,000 people in the state's agricultural region were told to flee the floodplain, one day after the state declared a state of emergency.

Over 12,000 homes were without electricity on Thursday night, according to PowerOutage.us.

The northwest of the United States has seen torrential rainfall in the past few days due to a weather phenomenon called atmospheric river, in which a band of extremely moist air delivers intense rainfall for days. 

""The flooding levels we're looking at are potentially historic in nature, so we just want to emphasize how serious the situation is,"" Governor Bob Ferguson said at a news briefing Thursday.

He said more than 30 major highways had been closed due to traffic.

On Friday, Pierce County's fire department posted a video of emergency crews rescuing stranded residents in the city of Puyallup.

""Turn around, don't drown. Never drive through flooded roads. Stay out of floodwaters. They can hide debris, other hazards, and have strong currents,"" they said, advising people to follow evacuation orders. 

The local county website warned of possible mudslides, flooded roads and broken river banks.

""While the rains have slowed down, many rivers and creeks across Pierce County remain at elevated flood Levels,"" one advisory said.

Meanwhile, the National Guard has been deployed with helicopters and boats being used to bring people to safety.

Along the river in Mount Vernon, teams knocked on doors in low-lying areas to inform them of evacuation notices, city authorities said.

Jeffrey Epstein kept a photograph of Donald Trump surrounded by a group of young women, a new file release has revealed.

Democrats published 19 new images from the paedophile financier's estate showing Mr Trump, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, Bill Clinton, Woody Allen, and Steve Bannon.

The US president, who was friends with Epstein, has his arms around two of the women, who are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks.

In a separate image kept by Epstein, he is seated on what appears to be a private jet alongside a blonde-haired woman, whose face has also been blocked out.

Mr Trump was friends with Epstein in the nineties but said he severed ties with the financier around 2004 after he poached staff from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.

The president maintains he ended his friendship with Epstein long before he was first convicted for soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.

A third image shows Epstein standing alongside Mr Trump while a woman in the side of the frame smiles at the men.

The White House has denied any wrongdoing on behalf of the president and said he kicked Epstein out of his club “for being a creep” to his female employees, including the late Virginia Giuffre.

Elsewhere in the release, Mr Clinton is pictured alongside Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, the financier's former girlfriend and associate, who is currently serving 20 years in prison for sex trafficking minors.

The photo of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, pictured in a suit alongside Mr Gates, will place further scrutiny on the King's brother, who gave up his titles in October following a string of new scandals concerning his relationship with Epstein.

The picture appears to be a cropped version of a photo which also featured the King standing to the right of Andrew, according to the BBC.

It was purportedly taken during a Commonwealth heads of government meeting focusing on malaria in London on April 18, 2018, its caption states.

Mr Gates appears twice in the series of photos, which were held by Epstein before he died. In one image, the Microsoft founder can be seen posing with a suitcase in front of a private jet.

One image shows a framed photo sitting on Epstein's desk of what appears to be an unconscious woman. In the picture, Epstein is facing Mr Bannon, one of Mr Trump's staunchest allies, across his desk.

A mirror selfie featuring Epstein and Mr Bannon shows the financier dressed in an oversized, sand coloured jacket and black glasses.

Some of the more unsettling images feature Donald Trump branded condoms, a latex glove, and restraints among other sex paraphernalia.

The photograph showing a bowl full of condoms features Mr Trump's face and the words “I'm HUUUUGE”. Above it sits a sign saying: “Trump condom $4.50”.

The inside of what appears to be one of Epstein's properties also features in another picture, showing a stark black cabinet with photographs hanging against the wall. The identity of one of the women pictured in the frames is redacted.

Mr Branson, the founder of Virgin, also features in the release. In the photograph, Mr Branson is grinning and holding up a notepad that appears to have numbers written on it.

A man wearing aviator sunglasses and a blue shirt is patting Mr Branson on the shoulder, and all three men are smiling.

Allen, the filmmaker, also features prominently. In one shot Epstein stands with Allen on what appears to be a film set. In another he sits with Epstein and an unknown woman at a table.

A third shows him alongside Larry Summers on what appears to be Epstein's private jet. Mr Summers is facing the camera with his two companions looking away, towards the former US treasury secretary.

Mr Bannon can be seen with his arms crossed, chatting to Allen in another photo included in the release.

The images will pile pressure on the US department of justice to release the files the government holds on the convicted sex offender.

On Nov 19, Mr Trump signed a bill to release the Epstein files within 30 days after bowing to pressure from his party.

The head of the US army has been sidelined from peace talks to end the war in Ukraine by Pete Hegseth.

Dan Driscoll, seen as the rising star of the Pentagon, was “reeled in” by the increasingly paranoid defence secretary, sources told The Telegraph.

Mr Driscoll, a former soldier, was cut out of negotiations by Mr Hegseth after he was seen to overstep his brief, it is understood.

On Thursday, diplomatic sources thought the defence secretary would attend talks in his place, although that is no longer the case, it is understood.

“He was seen to be exerting himself a bit too much, and he had his hand slapped,” a person close to the fallout said.

While the Pentagon under Mr Hegseth's direction has descended into a bed of paranoia, chaos and controversy, Mr Driscoll had – until now – largely managed to steer clear of the mudslinging.

Already a close friend of JD Vance, the vice-president, his stock had been quickly rising within the Trump administration, and he was becoming increasingly favoured by the Europeans for his experience and level-headedness.

This led him to take on high-profile roles during the peace talks.

In November, he was charged with presenting Volodymyr Zelensky the 28-point plan that Donald Trump hopes will lead to peace between Russia and Ukraine.

With it, he became the most senior member of the Trump administration to have visited Ukraine, a sign of his growing status.

During that trip last month, Mr Driscoll was tasked with securing the buy-in for a US-backed peace plan from Mr Zelensky.

However, the meeting was unsuccessful and reportedly became heated as the Ukrainian president refused the plan, which counted on Ukraine agreeing to cede territory to Russia.

European ambassadors involved in the talks described Mr Driscoll as an official who showed little interest in compromising to help the Ukrainian side. It is no surprise that Mr Driscoll's negotiating style has caught the president's eye, with Mr Trump priding himself on his tough dealmaker persona.

“We are not negotiating details,” he reportedly said during one of his huddles in Kyiv.

Mr Driscoll was meant to return to the Ukrainian capital for more talks two weeks ago, but was a no-show.

The Ukrainians had also been told he would be in Paris for talks between Mr Zelensky and Emmanuel Macron on Dec 1, but again cancelled at short notice.

“Our delegation was surprised,” a Ukrainian official said, speculating that Mr Driscoll “had not been allowed to come”.

The White House insisted Mr Hegseth has not cut Mr Driscoll out of any talks.

Ukrainian and European officials believe Mr Driscoll's absence is part of a wider power struggle for control over the peace negotiations.

The army secretary is seen as part of an anti-interventionist Maga group of delegates led by Mr Vance, who triggered the infamous row between Mr Zelensky and Mr Trump in the Oval Office in February.

A second establishment group, led by Marco Rubio, the US president's national security adviser and secretary of state, has played a more prominent role in the talks. That group is set to be at a meeting in Paris between the US, European and Ukrainian officials on Saturday.

Mr Trump has been invited to the talks, but said he had not yet made up his mind on whether he would attend.

However, it is the business group, marshalled by Steve Witkoff, Mr Trump's top envoy, and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and an informal adviser, who are leading the charge when it comes to peace talks.

One source familiar with the discussions said it was “funny” that the tone of negotiations would often change depending on which of the groups is in the driving seat.

Last month, The Telegraph revealed that Mr Driscoll was seen as a favourite to replace Mr Hegseth as Pentagon chief should the position become available.

A former senior White House official described the army chief as the “workhorse” who is “exactly” what Mr Trump is looking for.

Mr Trump refers to him as his “drone guy,” owing to his push to modernise America's forces with military tech and move away from heavy, outdated defence systems.

“Any anonymous sources who claim to have inside information about Secretary Hegseth's role have no idea what they are talking about,” Anna Kelly, the White House deputy press secretary, said.

She added: “These anonymous sources have no idea what they are talking about. President Trump is extremely pleased with Secretary Hegseth's work leading the Pentagon, which includes facilitating the sale of US-made weapons to Nato allies, providing battlefield updates, participating in the president's intelligence briefings, and more.

“Likewise, Secretary Driscoll has been very helpful gathering feedback from the Ukrainians in order to craft a deal.

“While the media wants to manufacture controversy, the Trump administration is working in lockstep to stop the killing in this brutal war brought on by Joe Biden's incompetence.

“The United States will only participate in talks this weekend if there is a real chance of signing a peace agreement and it is a worthwhile use of time – the president is frustrated with both sides of the war and wants action, not talk.”

The order threatens to withhold federal funding from states or sue states that implement AI regulations.

Truthout's December fundraiser is our most important of the year and will determine the scale of work we will be able to do in 2026. Please support us with a tax-deductible donation today.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aimed at preventing state-level regulation of the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry, a gift to tech corporations that bankrolled his inauguration and are currently funding his White House ballroom project.

Trump's order instructs the US Justice Department to establish an AI Litigation Task Force with a single mandate: sue states that enact AI laws that the administration deems “onerous and excessive.” The order also threatens to withhold federal funding from states that implement AI regulations.

Public Citizen, a watchdog group that has tracked increasingly aggressive AI influence-peddling in Congress and the administration, said Trump's order “grants his greedy Big Tech buddies' Christmas wish.”

“This reward to Big Tech is a disgraceful invitation to reckless behavior by the world's largest corporations and a complete override of the federalist principles that Trump and MAGA claim to venerate,” said Robert Weissman, Public Citizen's co-president. “Everyone should understand why this is happening: During and since the last election cycle, Big Tech has spent at least $1.1 billion on campaign contributions and lobby expenditures. Big Tech corporations poured money into Trump's inaugural committee and to pay for his garish White House ballroom. A major Big Tech and AI investor is serving as Trump's ‘AI czar' and driving administration policy.”

“While Trump has ensured the federal government is doing almost nothing to address the harms that AI is already causing, states are moving forward with sensible AI regulation,” Weissman added. “These include efforts to address political deepfakes, nonconsensual intimate deepfakes, algorithmic pricing manipulation, consumer protection measures, excessive data center electricity and water demand, and much more. Big Tech is whining about these modest measures, but there is zero evidence that these rules are impeding innovation; in fact, they are directing innovation in more positive directions.”

Jenna Sherman, a campaign director focused on tech and gender at Ultraviolet Action, said Trump's order “only has one group of winners: his wealthy donors in the tech sector.”

“Every other person loses from this wildly unpopular move. And not just in theory, as stripping away state AI regulations puts many — namely, women and children — at risk of real harm,” said Sherman. “These harms of AI — which the Trump and the tech sector are clearly happy to ignore — are already here: non-consensual deepfake porn sexualizing women and girls, children being led to suicidal ideation by AI chatbots, and AI-powered scams and crimes targeting older Americans, especially women, to name but a few.”

The US Chamber of Commerce and other corporate lobbying organizations representing tech giants such as Microsoft and Google celebrated the order, predictably characterizing it as a win for “small businesses.”

The leaders of California and other states that have proposed and finalized AI regulations were defiant in the face of Trump's threats of legal action and funding cuts.“

“President Trump and Davis Sacks aren't making policy — they're running a con,” said California Gov. Gavin Newsom, referring to the scandal-plagued White House AI czar. “Every day, they push the limits to see how far they can take it. California is working on behalf of Americans by building the strongest innovation economy in the nation while implementing commonsense safeguards and leading the way forward.”

Trump signed the order after the Republican-controlled Congress repeatedly rejected efforts to tuck a ban on state AI regulations into broader legislation.

“After months of failed lobbying and two defeats in Congress, Big Tech has finally received the return on its ample investment in Donald Trump,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said in a statement Thursday. “With this executive order, Trump is delivering exactly what his billionaire benefactors demanded — all at the expense of our kids, our communities, our workers, and our planet.”

“A broad, bipartisan coalition in Congress has rejected the AI moratorium again and again,” he added, “and I intend to keep that streak going. I will use every tool available to challenge this indefensible and irresponsible power grab. We will defeat it again.”

Traditional Chinese medicine regards the body's five organs as more than physiological structures—viewing them as interconnected systems related to the mind. Each organ also corresponds to a specific emotion—joy, worry, grief, anger, or fear.

In the Yuan Dynasty, around the 14th century, a brilliant physician named Zhu Zhenheng (1282–1358) faced a puzzling case. A young lady, bedridden for six months, had lost all desire to eat, and no doctor could revive her. After carefully checking her pulse, Zhu uncovered the root of her ailment: lovesickness. Her fiancé had been away for five years with no word of his return, leaving her thinking about him all the time.

Zhu, known for blending medical expertise with keen psychological insight, devised an unconventional plan. He told the girl's father, “This illness needs to be shocked with anger to heal.” Boldly entering her room, Zhu confronted the young woman, scolding her sharply: “You're an unmarried lady, yet you're pining for a man!” Stung by his words, the girl erupted in tears, her pent-up emotions pouring out.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

JENNIFER LIND is Associate Professor of Government at Dartmouth College and an Associate Fellow at Chatham House. She is the author of Autocracy 2.0: How China's Rise Reinvented Tyranny.

 Why America and China Are the World's Only Great Powers

 Jennifer Lind

The churn of great-power politics shapes the world and touches, for good or ill, the lives of people everywhere. Wars among great powers have killed millions of people; victorious great powers have also set up international orders whose norms and rules affect global peace and prosperity. Great powers also intervene in other countries' politics, covertly and overtly, sometimes violently. In other words, great powers matter.

Polarity—how many great powers there are—matters, too. Consider the past three decades of U.S.-led unipolarity. Freed from the constraining effects of a great-power rival, Washington deployed its forces around the world and conducted military actions in multiple countries, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Serbia. The dangers of bipolarity, however, are different. Superpowers in a bipolar structure compete obsessively, creating spheres and buffers by cultivating protégés and installing puppets. Multipolarity, meanwhile, in which three or more great powers are present, is said to be the most prone to war because alliances are precarious and the fluidity of alignments makes the balance of power harder to estimate.

Although it matters how many great powers there are at a given time, no one agrees on how to define them (and thus count them). People also disagree about the requirements—what a country must do or possess—to be considered a great power. Yet all the time, relative power among countries is shifting. During the Cold War, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev vowed that his country would “bury” the United States, and many people feared it would. And in the 1980s, Americans watching Japan's economic boom worried that the United States would be overtaken by the “rising sun.” Today, scholars and policymakers debate whether China will rival the United States as a superpower or is already in decline. The rise of India and the resurgence of Russia, meanwhile, have led many to proclaim the arrival of multipolarity. Widely divergent views about the balance of power are common because power, although foundational to international politics, remains an elusive concept.

To reckon with this challenge, I developed a methodology for comparing national power—one that uses common metrics (GDP, for instance, or military expenditure) in modern and historical data to determine a threshold for great-power status. My study found that arguing about whether China is catching up to the United States misses the point. Great powers have often been far weaker than the leading state—the most powerful country in the global system—but nevertheless engaged in dangerous security competitions. Moreover, my methodology revealed that China today is already more powerful than the Soviet Union was during the Cold War. Modern China, then, is not just a great power but a superpower.

The world, in short, is bipolar. Many middle powers are influential actors within their regions, but only the United States and China exceed the great-power threshold. This development explains rising tension in U.S.-Chinese relations and suggests that other countries will find it increasingly difficult to stay out of the crossfire of the rivalry. Bipolarity, for instance, helps explain the recent U.S. preoccupation with Latin America, where China has gained significant economic and political influence. As the dynamic between China and the United States grows only more competitive, Washington will find such encroachments intolerable—just as China may similarly refuse to accept U.S. political and military involvement in its own backyard.

My methodology began with a list, generated with help from historians and political scientists, of great powers across different historical systems since 1820. Although scholars often debate definitions of “power” and “great power,” the list reflected a consensus, and established a “ground truth,” about the balance of power over time. Using historical data, I then evaluated which metrics most accurately re-created this list. Each country's metrics were assessed as a ratio—the country's power in that metric compared with the power of the leading state during the period being analyzed. For example, the metrics show that the United States was not yet a great power in the early nineteenth century; it still lagged behind the United Kingdom on economic as well as military metrics. These same metrics, however, then illustrate how the United States overtook the United Kingdom to become a great power in the late nineteenth century.

The methodology shows that two economic metrics successfully identify great powers: GDP, as well as a composite metric that multiplied GDP by GDP per capita. Previous scholars have argued that the second metric captures two key dimensions of great power—a state's economic size versus its wealth. My metrics supported this argument by effectively distinguishing between great powers and other countries. That is, lesser powers scored low on both of these economic metrics, whereas great powers scored high, and there was a large gap between the metrics of great powers and lesser powers. GDP per capita, however, proved a poor indicator of power and failed to separate the great powers from the lesser powers. Many lesser powers have high GDP per capita. GDP per capita is also misleading because it risks obscuring regional heterogeneity. China and India, for instance, have millions of people generating high-incomes as well as regions with very low-incomes. Because it takes the average, GDP per capita obscures this heterogeneity and might misdiagnose a country as middling rather than one with wealthy, technologically advanced regions—regions with latent power and potential geopolitical implications.

Overall, this method provides a quantifiable threshold for identifying great powers. I define “normal” great powers as those falling in the middle 50 percent of the distribution of historical great powers (thereby excluding the strongest and weakest countries). The GDP range for normal great powers is between 17 and 45 percent of the leading state's GDP, with a median of 27 percent. Thus, countries with more than roughly 27 percent of the leading state's GDP possess greater economic capabilities than the median great power across history. Whether or not a country can be considered an overall great power depends on how it performs in the other metrics, but this method can reveal whether a country is above or below the basic great-power threshold. It also identifies the dimensions in which a country is stronger or weaker. Such assessments contribute to studies of power transitions in world politics, and create a valuable means of assessing contemporary changes in the balance of power—the extent to which China is declining or India is rising, for example.

Asking whether China can catch up to or overtake the United States economically is the wrong question, based on this analytical method. Historically, the leading state competed fiercely with other, far weaker great powers, which often possessed only a quarter or a third of the leader's GDP. China, in other words, does not need to match nor surpass the United States in order to be a great power and competitor. The Soviet Union was a prime example of this reality.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was widely deemed a superpower and major geopolitical competitor to the United States. But the Soviet Union had, at most, about 40 percent of U.S. GDP. Despite this large imbalance, the Soviets posed a threat of regional hegemony in Europe. Moscow managed complex global intelligence operations, supplied arms to insurgents across the globe, quashed national liberation movements in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, and spread communist ideology around the world. Although it trailed the United States economically, the Soviet Union preoccupied U.S. national security policy for more than three decades. The United States and the Soviet Union built massive armies, competed in a nuclear arms race, and, during numerous crises, moved the world dangerously close to nuclear war.



China, which today vastly exceeds the Soviet Union in terms of economic power, has the capability to do all this and more. In the composite metric (GDP multiplied by GDP per capita), the normal range for great powers is between eight and 28 percent of the leader's score, with a median of 15. China today, at 36 percent, has a much higher composite score than normal great powers across history. China's score also exceeds that of the Soviet Union, which reached only 16 percent at its peak in 1970. China's relative strength is also captured by the GDP metric: China's score of 130 percent is far higher than the 27 percent median. Skeptics may rightly question China's dodgy economic statistics, but even if China's true GDP is much smaller than it reports, China's margin above the normal range for GDP is so large that it would still be a great power, and well above the Soviet score of 44 percent.

China falls short of the Soviet Union in just one dimension—military expenditure. The Soviets spent 100 percent of the United States' military expenditure, whereas China today spends 32 percent. For the Soviets, however, generating such high military spending required devoting a huge share of the economy (as much as 14 percent of GDP) to defense, which ultimately proved unsustainable. China, by contrast, currently spends only about two percent of its GDP on defense, meaning it could ramp up defense spending and yet keep it at a manageable level overall. In short, my metrics suggest that China doesn't need to catch up to the United States but is already a great-power competitor both economically and militarily—one with power that far exceeds that of the United States' last bipolar competitor, the Soviet Union.

Critics might doubt whether Beijing can in fact compete, arguing that China's growth is slowing, its economy is suffering from numerous problems, and increasingly repressive policies by Chinese leader Xi Jinping will harm future innovation. Such observations identify important challenges China's economy is facing but miss the mark in a few ways.

First, China's growth plateau was a predictable outcome. Fast-growing economies always slow down at about the middle-income stage, and economies that manage to sustain growth typically settle into levels of about one to two percent per year. As has happened in the past with high-growth economies—in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, for instance—slowed growth can be caused by a number of factors, such as increasingly unfavorable demographics, rising wages, and financial crises caused by years of massive investment. Thus, China's success isn't a question of whether it can maintain its sky-high growth rates of the 1990s, but whether its economy can settle into mature and far lower rates of growth.

In this transition, the Chinese economy indeed faces major challenges, including a troubled real estate sector, massive debt, and the problem of what scholars call “involution”—hypercompetition among firms over shrinking profit margins. Nobody can predict how effectively the CCP will handle these challenges, but declarations of “peak China” are premature. Previously, skeptics have argued that China's regime would be toppled, or its economic growth torpedoed, by a variety of maladies—public backlash in response to repressive COVID-19 policies, for example, or the costs of mitigating environmental devastation. These predictions were not borne out. Most important, assuming that one's competitor will collapse, particularly when that competitor has a leadership as adaptive and capable as China's, is a poor guide for policy.



Other skeptics argue that Xi's policies—tightening controls on civil society, increasing oversight of the private sector (as seen in the tech industry crackdown after 2020), and pursuing a variety of other “neo-authoritarian” approaches—undermine China's innovative capabilities. Innovation is indeed vital for Chinese geopolitical competitiveness, and great powers must compete at the technological cutting edge. If Xi pursues policies that stymie innovation, China will struggle to keep up. But many of Beijing's policies seem to be working. Heavy investment in highly-skilled human capital, as well as research and development, has created an advanced workforce. Large government investment in key sectors such as green energy, robotics, and biotechnology has helped Chinese firms innovate and become more commercially competitive. And Xi's neo-authoritarianism has not prevented China's success in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and communications, supercomputing, and other technology arenas. In fact, in many sectors, China is not merely competitive with the United States but is vying for dominance.

Critics of the bipolar assessment might also argue that the world is actually multipolar. Russia, after all, invaded neighboring Ukraine in 2022, and its alliance with China has powerful geopolitical consequences. Germany and Japan are prominent economically, technologically, and diplomatically, and there is a growing group of influential middle powers that includes Brazil, India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey. Indeed, in 1990, middle powers produced about 15 percent of global GDP, whereas in 2022 they produced about 30 percent. Militarily, too, they are more capable. Whereas in 1990, middle powers accounted for about seven percent of global military spending, the 2022 figure was about 15 percent.

The increasingly influential role of middle powers, however, should not be confused with multipolarity, because none of these middle powers exceeds the great-power threshold for economic and military power. Germany's and Japan's low rates of military mobilization have kept them out of the great-power ranks. Whether they follow through on pledges to increase defense spending and break the great-power threshold as a result remains uncertain. Russia sits below the threshold, too. If Russia were a great power, it would have defeated Ukraine and threatened regional dominance over western Europe, as the Soviets did in the Cold War. India may someday reach great-power status if it continues to grow economically and increases its military expenditures, but it currently sits below the great-power bar. Only China and the United States currently exceed both the economic and military thresholds for great-power status.

In these early years of the bipolar era, competition between China and the United States is growing across every domain: trade, finance, technology, global governance, and military power. The reverberations of this rivalry are being felt all over the world, proving the political scientist Barry Posen's assertion that in a bipolar order, “peripheries disappear.” The United States, for example, is worrying about China's gains in the Middle East, where Beijing is increasingly becoming an important economic, technological, and security partner despite the United States' many long-standing relationships there.

The first rule of bipolarity, however, is secure your backyard. Nicolás Maduro's government in Venezuela has pursued close economic ties with China, and recent U.S. military pressure in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific is in part a warning to Caracas and other governments in the region about the consequences of cozying up to Beijing. Earlier this year, the Trump administration similarly signaled to Panama that continuing to allow Chinese firms to control strategic infrastructure at the Panama Canal would prompt U.S. military action. Latin America felt the sting of bipolarity during the Cold War, and, in the emerging superpower competition between China and the United States, it is starting to feel it again.

In East Asia, China will likely move to enforce its own version of the Monroe Doctrine. Beijing will continue to use incremental tactics and economic coercion against neighbors to pressure them to decouple or distance themselves from Washington. In coming years, the extent to which Beijing attempts to eject the United States from its region politically and militarily will likely define the principal arena of U.S.-Chinese strategic rivalry. “Don't make us choose” has been the mantra of many East Asian countries, including some U.S. treaty allies. But under bipolarity, the luxury of choice is not one afforded to small countries in a superpower's backyard. Countries will be forced to choose, and choose correctly according to their neighbor, or risk the consequences. The return of bipolarity means it's time to remember—with regret and trepidation—the nature, intensity, and global reach of superpower competition.

 Can the Continent Escape Its Trump Trap?

 Matthias Matthijs and Nathalie Tocci

  Jan/Feb 2026 

When U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office in January 2025, Europe faced a choice. As Trump made draconian demands for greater European defense spending, threatened European exports with sweeping new tariffs, and challenged long-held European values on democracy and the rule of law, European leaders could either assume a confrontational stance and push back collectively or choose the path of least resistance and give in to Trump. From Warsaw to Westminster, from Riga to Rome, they chose the latter. Instead of insisting on bargaining with the United States as an equal partner or asserting their self-declared strategic autonomy, the EU and its member states, as well as nonmembers such as the United Kingdom, have reflexively and consistently adopted a posture of submission.

To many in Europe, this was a rational choice. Centrist proponents of appeasement argue that the alternatives—resisting Trump's demands on defense, resorting to Chinese-style tit-for-tat escalation in trade negotiations, or calling out his autocratic tendencies—would have been bad for European interests. The United States might have abandoned Ukraine, for example. Trump could have proclaimed the end of U.S. support for NATO and announced a significant withdrawal of U.S. military forces from the European continent. There could have been a full-scale transatlantic trade war. In this view, it is thanks only to Europe's cautious attempts at placation that none of those things came to pass.

This, of course, could well be true. But the perspective ignores the role that Europe's domestic politics played in pushing for accommodation in the first place, as well as the domestic political consequences that appeasement could have. The rise of the populist far right is not just an American political phenomenon, after all. In a growing number of EU states, the far right is either in government or the largest opposition party, and those in favor of appeasing Trump do not readily admit how hamstrung they are by these nationalist, populist forces. Moreover, they often ignore how this strategy in turn serves to further strengthen the far right. By giving in to Trump on defense, trade, and democratic values, Europe has effectively bolstered those far-right forces that want to see a weaker EU. Europe's Trump strategy, in other words, is a self-defeating trap.

There is only one way out of this cycle. Europe must take steps to restore agency where it still can. Rather than wait it out until January 2029, when magical thinking assumes the current transatlantic nightmare will come to an end, the EU needs to stop groveling and build greater sovereignty. Only then will it neuter the political forces that are hollowing it out from within.

Europe's acquiescence to Trump on defense spending makes the most sense. The war in Ukraine is a European war, with Europe's security at stake. The catastrophic Oval Office meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in February 2025, in which the latter was berated and humiliated, was an ominous sign that the United States could abandon Ukraine entirely, immediately threatening the security of Europe's eastern flank. As a result, at the NATO summit in June 2025, European allies acknowledged Washington's concerns about burden sharing in Ukraine and in general promised to drastically increase their defense spending to five percent of GDP while also buying a lot more American-made weapons in support of Kyiv's war effort.

Then, after Trump rolled out the red carpet for Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, in mid-August, a group of European leaders, including Zelensky, flocked to Washington in a collective effort to sweet-talk Trump. They managed to box in the U.S. president by backing his mediation ambitions and by developing plans for a European “reassurance force” to be deployed to Ukraine in the (unlikely) event that Trump succeeded in brokering a cease-fire. These careful placation efforts, one can argue, have worked: Trump today appears to have much higher regard for European leaders; he seems to have settled on allowing Europeans to buy weapons for Ukraine; he has extended sanctions to the Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft; and he has not actually pulled out of NATO.

But this outcome is more the product of Putin's intransigence than European diplomacy. It is also a success only when compared with the worst possible alternative. So far, Europeans have failed to secure further American support for Ukraine. They have also failed to nudge the U.S. president into endorsing a package of comprehensive new sanctions on Russia, with a bipartisan bill of crippling active measures on hold in Congress. And by focusing on scoring political wins with Trump, they still have not developed a robust and coherent European strategy for their long-term defense that does not in essence rely on the United States.



The new five percent target for military spending, for example, was not driven by a European assessment of what is feasible but rather by what would please Trump. This cynical ploy was made plain when NATO's secretary-general, Mark Rutte, sent text messages to Trump hailing his “BIG” win in The Hague—texts that Trump later gleefully reposted on social media. Meanwhile, many European allies, including large countries such as France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, agreed to the five percent target knowing full well that they are not in the fiscal position to reach it any time soon. European commitments to “buy American” were also made enthusiastically without any concrete plans to significantly reduce those structural military dependencies in the future.

Europe's failure to organize its own defense can best be understood as a lack of ambition—one that is directly tied to the nationalist fervor that has swept the continent over the past five years. As far-right political parties have gained momentum, their agenda has dampened the European integration project. In the past, these parties pushed for exiting the EU altogether, but since the United Kingdom's withdrawal in 2020—now widely recognized as a policy failure—they have opted for a different, and more dangerous, agenda of gradually undermining the European Union from within and stifling any European supranational effort. To see the effect of far-right populism on European ambition and integration, one need only compare the significant response to the COVID-19 pandemic, when the EU collectively mobilized over $900 billion in grants and loans, and the underwhelming defense initiatives today. For collectively defending Europe against external aggression, which is arguably a much larger threat, the EU has mustered only about $170 billion in loans.

The irony, of course, is that precisely because far-right forces made a strong EU defense initiative impossible, European leaders felt they had no choice but to rely on a strongman from America. Yet the far right itself is unlikely to pay the political price for this submission. On the contrary, the five percent NATO defense and security spending target risks becoming further grist for the populist mill, especially in countries that are far from the Russian border, such as Belgium, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. European leaders may have to compromise public spending on health, education, and public pensions to meet the target, which fuels the “guns versus butter” narrative on the far right.

European capitulation to Trump's trade demands is even more self-destructive. At least in the defense realm, the transatlantic relationship was never one of equals. But if Europeans are military lightweights, they pride themselves on being economic giants. The sheer size of the European Union's single market and the centralization of international trade policy in the European Commission meant that when Trump unleashed a trade war on the world, the EU was almost as well positioned as China to drive a hard bargain. When the United Kingdom rapidly agreed to a new ten percent tariff rate with the United States, for example, the general assumption outside the United States was that the EU's much greater market power would enable it to extract a much better deal.

Trade was also the area in which, ahead of the 2024 U.S. election, a fair amount of “Trump proofing” had already taken place, with European countries wielding carrots, such as the acquisition of more American weaponry and liquefied natural gas, as well as sticks, such as a new Anti-Coercion Instrument, which gives the European Commission significant power to retaliate in the event of economic intimidation or outright bullying by unfriendly states.

For example, in response to the U.S. president's announcement of 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum in February 2025, European Commission officials could have immediately activated a prepared package of roughly $23 billion in new tariffs on politically sensitive U.S. goods, such as soybeans from Iowa, motorcycles from Wisconsin, and orange juice from Florida. Then, in response to Trump's reciprocal “Liberation Day” tariffs in April 2025, they could have chosen to trigger their economic “bazooka,” as the Anti-Coercion Instrument is often referred to. Since the United States continues to have a significant surplus in so-called invisible trade, EU officials could have targeted exports of U.S. services to Europe, such as streaming platforms and cloud computing or certain kinds of financial, legal, and advisory work.

But instead of taking (or even threatening to take) such collective action, European leaders spent months debating and undermining one another. This is yet another example of how increasingly strong far-right actors have been weakening the EU. Historically, trade negotiations have been led by the European Commission, with national governments taking a back seat. When the first Trump administration sought to increase trade pressure on the EU, for instance, Jean-Claude Juncker, who was then president of the European Commission, defused tensions by flying to Washington and presenting Trump with a simple deal framed around joint gains.



In the second Trump administration, however, the situation could not be more different. This time, the commission's bargaining position was undercut from the start by a cacophonous chorus, with key member states preemptively voicing their opposition to retaliation. Notably, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a far-right favorite of Trump's, called for pragmatism and warned the EU against setting off a tariff war. Germany also urged caution; the new government, led by the Christian Democrat Friedrich Merz, was concerned about recession, which would have further emboldened the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the main opposition party. France and Spain, by contrast, have centrist or center-left governments and favored a harder line and more biting retaliatory tariffs. (Spain, it is worth noting, is also the only NATO country that flatly refused to raise its defense spending to the new five percent norm.)

The level of European disunity was so profound that in late spring and early summer, companies even concluded they might do better negotiating on their own: the German car makers Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW conducted their own parallel negotiations with the Trump administration on auto tariffs. It wasn't until late July 2025, after months of paralysis, that Brussels accepted U.S. tariffs of 15 percent on most EU exports—five percentage points higher than what the United Kingdom had negotiated.

Faced with mounting internal criticism for the deal, European leaders have again claimed that the EU had no choice: since Trump was bent on imposing tariffs no matter what, they argue, retaliatory tariffs would have only ended up hurting European importers and consumers. Retaliation, in this view, would have amounted to shooting oneself in the foot. Worse, it could have risked triggering Trump's ire and seeing him lash out against Ukraine or abandon NATO.

But again, this is Catch-22 logic. A Europe that accepts transatlantic economic extortion as a fact of life is a Europe that allows its market power to erode while further emboldening the far right. According to a leading survey conducted late last summer in the five largest EU countries, 77 percent of respondents believed the EU-U.S. trade deal “mostly favors the American economy,” with 52 percent agreeing that it is “a humiliation.” Not only does Europe's submission make Trump look strong, increasing the appeal of imitating his nationalistic policies at home, but it also takes away the original rationale for European integration: that a united Europe can more effectively represent its interests. If a post-Brexit United Kingdom can extract a better trade deal from Trump than the EU can, many will rightly wonder why it is worth sticking with Brussels.

The starkest European accommodation has been on democratic values. Over the course of 2025, Trump has escalated his attacks on the free press, declared war on independent government institutions, and undercut the rule of law by putting political pressure on judges to take his side. And he has taken this fight to Europe: U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have openly meddled or taken sides in elections in Germany, Poland, and Romania.

Vance, for instance, did not meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during the Munich Security Conference in February 2025 but did meet with the AfD leader Alice Weidel and publicly criticized the German firewall policy that keeps the party excluded from mainstream coalition talks. In Munich, Vance also lashed out against the annulment of the first round of presidential elections in Romania by that country's Constitutional Court in light of significant evidence of Russian influence through TikTok. He said in his speech that the greatest threat to Europe came from “within” and that EU governments were “running in fear of their own voters.” Noem, meanwhile, took the extraordinary step of openly urging an audience in Jasionka, Poland, to vote for the far-right candidate Karol Nawrocki, calling his centrist opponent “an absolute train wreck of a leader.”

Instead of rejecting such hostile election interference, however, the EU leadership has largely stayed silent on the matter, likely hoping that cooperation elsewhere might survive. This transactional approach is most clearly seen in the European Commission's investigation into disinformation on X, the social media platform primarily owned by the former Trump ally Elon Musk. Initially, Brussels had robust accusations against X, including that the platform was amplifying pro-Kremlin narratives and dismantling its election-integrity teams ahead of the EU elections. But the investigation has since slowed and been downplayed: X has been granted repeated extensions for compliance, and Brussels has signaled a preference for “dialogue” over sanctions.



This strategy is not only failing to produce deals in the European interest but also comes at a political cost: it normalizes illiberal moves in the United States while narrowing Europe's own space to defend liberal standards at home and abroad. Right-wing leaders have already embraced the political messages coming from Washington. After Vance's comments in Munich, for instance, Hungarian officials praised the vice president's “realism.” And after the murder of the American right-wing personality Charlie Kirk, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban condemned the “hatemongering left” in the United States and warned that “Europe must not fall into the same trap.” Across the continent, far-right parties have seized on such moments to portray themselves as part of a broader Western counter-elite, while mainstream European leaders, wary of inflaming tensions with the United States, have refrained from denouncing the rhetoric as forcefully as they once would have.

As with defense spending and with trade, many in Europe argued that it wasn't worth it to poke the bear on U.S. democratic backsliding. European pushback was not likely to influence American domestic politics, after all. And some proponents of a more passive European response theorize that Trump's followers' abrasive support for the far right in Europe could sow the seeds of its own demise. In both Australia and Canada, the pro-Trump front-runner candidates ended up losing in the spring 2025 elections.

Some early results showed that this strategy could work in Europe, too. Vance and Musk, for instance, offered full-throated support for the AfD, but it had no discernible effect on the outcome in Germany. And in Romania, the pro-Russian and pro-Trump front-runner in the presidential election lost, while in the Netherlands, the liberals made an impressive comeback. But in Poland, the Noem-endorsed candidate ended up winning the presidential elections. And in the Czech Republic, the populist pro-Trump billionaire also won. While the evidence is not yet conclusive, what is clear is that appeasement has yielded little protection against Europe's own illiberal drift. By soft-pedaling its defense of democratic values abroad, the EU has made it harder to address their erosion at home.

Europeans already know what they need to do to stop this vicious cycle. The road map for a stronger EU was laid out in 2024 with two comprehensive reports by two former Italian prime ministers that aimed to build on the successes of the EU's post-pandemic recovery fund. Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi proposed deepening the EU's single market in areas such as finance, energy, and technology and establishing a new major investment initiative through joint borrowing.

But despite the positive attention these proposals initially received, most of them remain dead letters just one year later. European leaders face electorates that are anxious about the cost of living, skeptical of further integration, and sensitive to any large joint debt initiative that might appear to transfer sovereignty or raise fiscal risks. What is required, therefore, is not another maximalist blueprint but a focused effort on what is still politically achievable. Although there is no single remedy, the union can take smaller steps on defense and trade that would reduce its dependence on the United States, and it can make changes regarding its relations with China and its energy policy that would restore its agency and bolster its autonomy.

The EU has tried in recent years to address the problem of its security architecture. It has, for instance, launched the European Defense Fund, created a framework to coordinate joint projects, and established the European Peace Facility, which was used to finance arms deliveries to Ukraine (until Hungary blocked it). It has also developed a defense industrial policy and proposed a 2030 defense readiness plan featuring initiatives on drones, land, space, and air and missile defense. But these instruments are still mostly aspirational, and when they do deliver, the results are narrow and slow, focused mainly on defense-industrial coordination and small-scale missions.

They have also exposed the EU's Achilles' heel: its requirement for unanimity on foreign and security policy. An organization in which all 27 members have an equal say can easily be hijacked. Orban of Hungary, for instance, has vetoed aid to and accession talks with Ukraine and sanctions on Russia at least ten times. Beyond the veto, the Hungarian member of the European Commission, Oliver Varhelyi, was recently accused of being part of an alleged spy network in Brussels. While this is so far only an allegation, it raises the broader question of whether sufficient political trust still exists to discuss vital security questions.



The EU's members also have divergent sensitivities toward the United States: eastern and Nordic countries continue to see Washington as their ultimate security guarantor, while France, Germany, and parts of southern Europe favor greater autonomy. Meanwhile, EU members that are not in NATO, such as Austria, Ireland, and Malta, are hampered by constitutional neutrality laws that restrict participation in collective defense. And several members have unresolved bilateral conflicts, such as Turkey and Greece's dispute over Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean.

Instead of devising an EU answer to Europe's defense problem, a more realistic path lies in a European “coalition of the willing.” The group that has coalesced around military support for Ukraine provides a good foundation for such an alliance. Although still informal, this group—led by France and the United Kingdom and including Germany, Poland, and the Nordic and Baltic states—has begun to take shape through regular coordination meetings among defense ministers and bilateral security compacts, most notably the European-led security agreements with Kyiv signed in Berlin, London, Paris, and Warsaw last year. It has shown a commitment to Kyiv irrespective of political shifts in the United States or at home, backed by sustained arms deliveries, long-term bilateral aid pledges, and joint training and procurement programs designed to keep Ukraine's war effort viable even if U.S. support falters. Its rationale is both normative and strategic: these states understand that European security ultimately depends on Ukraine's military defense and national survival.

The coalition has not been perfect, of course. Its focus thus far has been too abstract, centered on the hypothetical reassurance force, and it has only recently shifted its attention to sustaining Ukraine's defenses without U.S. support. As it evolves, it should focus on boosting, coordinating, and integrating conventional forces. And ultimately it should tackle the hardest question facing European defense: nuclear deterrence.

Nuclear deterrence is almost a taboo subject in Europe, since there is no good alternative to the American umbrella: the French and British nuclear deterrents are ill equipped to counter Russia's vast nuclear arsenal. But Europeanizing such a deterrent opens countless dilemmas, such as financing an expanded French-British nuclear capability, determining how decisions would be reached on its use, and providing the conventional military support needed to enable a nuclear deterrent and strike force.

The question of how to ensure nuclear deterrence in Europe, however, is so vital that Europeans cannot continue ignoring it. Poland and France took a first step when they signed a bilateral defense treaty in May, and Polish leaders have welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron's idea to extend France's nuclear umbrella to European allies. This is a promising start, but these conversations should not take place bilaterally; ideally, they would extend to the coalition of the willing. The goal is not to replace NATO but to ensure that if Washington steps back abruptly, Europe can still stand on its feet as it faces external threats.

This same logic applies to trade. Europe's prosperity has always relied on openness, but the EU's uneven deal with Trump exposed how easily the bloc's commitment to free transatlantic trade and commerce can be exploited. Yet the EU has like-minded partners. It has already begun diversification efforts, signing and implementing trade deals with Canada, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. It should deepen these trade ties but also press ahead by signing and ratifying other agreements with India, Indonesia, and the Mercosur countries in Latin America, while accelerating negotiations and reaching deals with Australia, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, and others.

Beyond bilateral deals, the EU should invest in a broader strategy to sustain the global trading system itself. The World Trade Organization has been completely paralyzed since 2019, when its Appellate Body ceased to function because the United States had blocked the appointment of new judges. The EU, however, could develop an alternative mechanism for dispute settlement and rule-making by working with members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. With more than 20 countries collectively representing over 40 percent of global GDP involved in trade with the EU, such an effort would effectively create a complement to the WTO. It would offer an outlet for cooperation between middle powers that share Europe's interest in maintaining an open, rules-based order. And it would show that Europe remains capable of shaping global economic governance rather than merely reacting to U.S. or Chinese moves on the geopolitical chessboard.

To further demonstrate this agency, Europe needs to finally develop an autonomous policy toward China. As competition between the United States and China has grown, Europe's policy toward China has become a function of Washington's. During the Biden administration, this was not considered a problem: Europe was strategically dependent on U.S. intelligence and at the mercy of U.S. export-control frameworks, but it had a reliable and predictable partner across the Atlantic. Now though, as Trump's China policy oscillates between escalation and deal-making, Europe has lost its bearings. Brussels continues to enforce tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and to complain about Beijing's backchannel support for Russia's war efforts in Ukraine. But it is unclear how the EU can stand up to China while Washington strikes bilateral deals with Beijing behind its back.



To reclaim its credibility as a global actor, the EU should pursue a dual track with China: firm and clearheaded where its members' security is at stake, but pragmatic and economically engaged elsewhere. On security, Europe won't be able to convince China to stop trading with and buying oil and gas from Russia. But Europeans could persuade Beijing to stop exporting dual-use goods—those valuable to both military and civilian purposes—to Russia. China would expect something in return, of course, including concessions that some in Europe may consider distasteful, such as a pledge by NATO to no longer formally cooperate with East Asian partners.

Europe must also confront its energy predicament. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Europeans have replaced one vulnerability—reliance on Russian gas—with another, heavy dependence on U.S. liquefied natural gas. Although this shift was inescapable in the short term, it cannot be the basis for long-term energy security, especially given the volatile state of transatlantic relations. As a fossil-fuel-poor continent, the EU must forge a more sustainable path. At a minimum, this means broadening its network of energy partners and cultivating suppliers in the Middle East, North Africa, and other regions. But it also means doubling down on the European Green Deal, which is currently being diluted through omnibus laws backed by the center right and the far right.

The politics of the Green Deal are difficult, particularly amid a cost-of-living crisis and slow growth. But the alternative, continued fossil fuel exposure and geopolitical vulnerability, is much worse. The message should be clear: energy diversification is not just about climate change but also about sovereignty. Moreover, a credible green-industrial strategy would help create the high-technology jobs that nationalist parties claim to want to defend. It would show that decarbonization and economic strength can be mutually reinforcing in practice.

Taken together, these steps would not transform Europe overnight. They would, however, begin to alter the political dynamic that has trapped the continent in a cycle of deference and division. Each initiative—defense preparedness, trade diversification, a home-grown China policy, and energy transition and autonomy—would demonstrate that Europe can still act collectively and strategically in adverse conditions. Success on any one front would bolster confidence on the others and create political support for bolder steps.

The broader goal is to restore the sense that Europe's fate is still in its own hands. Strategic autonomy does not require confrontation with Washington or the abandonment of the Atlantic alliance. It requires the capacity to say no when necessary, to act independently when interests diverge, and to sustain a coherent project at home. Appeasement has been Europe's default posture for too long. It has been understandable, even rational in some cases, but ultimately it has been self-defeating and fanned the flames of a nationalist backlash.

The alternative is not grandstanding or isolation but steady, deliberate agency. If Europe can muster that, it may yet emerge from this period of transatlantic turbulence a more self-reliant, more united, and more respected actor in the world than it was before.

            Nothing on the surface of this scrubby expanse of western Nevada desert, overlooked by towering, craggy mountains, gives even a hint of what lies beneath. But a few thousand feet underground is a hidden source of abundant clean energy — and it was discovered in an unusual way.
    


            Utah-headquartered startup Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals announced last week it had used artificial intelligence to locate a 250-degree Fahrenheit geothermal reservoir under this stretch of land. They named it “Big Blind,” because this kind of site — which has no visual indication of its existence, no hot springs or geysers above ground, and no history of geothermal exploration — is known as a “blind” system.
    


            It's the first industry-discovered blind site in more than three decades, said Carl Hoiland, co-founder and CEO of Zanskar. “The idea that geothermal is tapped out has been the narrative for decades,” but that's far from the case, he told CNN. He believes there are many more hidden sites across the Western US.
    


            Geothermal energy is a potential gamechanger. It offers the tantalizing prospect of a huge source of clean energy to meet burgeoning demand. It's near limitless, produces scarcely any climate pollution, and is constantly available, unlike wind and solar, which are cheap but rely on the sun shining and the wind blowing.
    


            The problem, however, has been how to find and scale it.
    


            It requires a specific geology: underground reservoirs of hot water or steam, along with porous rocks that allow the water to move through them, heat up, and be brought to the surface where it can power turbines.
    


            In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were high levels of excitement around geothermal, with oil and gas giants spending huge amounts drilling to find hidden systems, Hoiland said. By the mid-80s, however, many had started to give up, put off by high costs and low success rates.
    


            It's a “classic needle in the haystack problem,” said Joel Edwards, co-founder and CTO of Zanskar. “There's no one type of data that tells you that a system is below you, even if you're right on top of it.” Instead, there are multiple indicators which are really hard for humans to put together to figure out if a system exists.
    


            That's where AI comes in.
    


            The AI models Zanskar uses are fed information on where blind systems already exist. This data is plentiful as, over the last century and more, humans have accidentally stumbled on many around the world while drilling for other resources such as oil and gas.
    


            The models then scour huge amounts of data — everything from rock composition to magnetic fields — to find patterns that point to the existence of geothermal reserves. AI models have “gotten really good over the last 10 years at being able to pull those types of signals out of noise,” Hoiland said.
    


            Once a potential location has been found, the next step for the company is to drill down to confirm the reserve exists and is hot enough to produce utility-scale power.
    


            That's exactly what they did at Big Blind over the summer, drilling wells to depths of around 2,700 feet where they found porous rock at 250 degrees Fahrenheit. They know the site is at least the minimum size needed to support a power plant, but don't yet have a sense of how big it could be.
    


             There is also work to be done to navigate permitting processes and grid interconnection, but the company estimates the first electricity could be produced here in three to five years' time.
    


            Zanskar's discovery “is very significant,” said James Faulds, a professor of geosciences at Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology. (Faulds does not work with the company, but two of his former graduate students do.)
    


            Estimates suggest over three-quarters of US geothermal resources are blind, Faulds told CNN. “Refining methods to find such systems has the potential to unleash many tens and perhaps hundreds of gigawatts in the western US alone,” he said.
    


            An oft-cited government analysis from 2008 estimated undiscovered geothermal reserves in the US could provide around 30 gigawatts of power, enough to power around 25 million homes. Hoiland thinks the real figure could be at least 10 times higher.
    


            Over the last three years of scouring the Western US, Zanskar has identified many “hotspots” with the same characteristics as Big Blind, Hoiland said.
    


            Big Blind is the company's first blind site discovery, but it's the third site it has drilled and hit commercial resources. “We expect dozens, to eventually hundreds, of new sites to be coming to market,” Hoiland said.
    


A new volcanic era



            If Zanskar can keep its costs down, “that will go a long way in attracting investment,” said Sophia Bauer, geothermal project manager at Global Energy Monitor, a non-profit. Geothermal has a big advantage because it can harness drilling techniques already fine-tuned by the oil and gas industry, she told CNN.
    


            Another advantage is political. “In the United States right now, the atmosphere is quite friendly to geothermal,” Bauer said. While the Trump administration has taken an ax to solar and wind, geothermal has gone under the radar and is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years, according to a March report from Global Energy Monitor, authored by Bauer.
    


            There's plenty of scope to grow. The US leads the world in geothermal energy, accounting for about 24% of global installed capacity, but geothermal accounts for only 0.4% of the country's electricity mix.
    


            Some experts hope geothermal will help fulfill the soaring electricity demand from data centers, many of which are used for AI. “Perhaps we have a close future of AI powered by geothermal discovering more geothermal!” Bauer said.
    


            Zanskar's discovery is the latest development in what some are calling a geothermal renaissance. Much of the recent buzz has been around next-gen geothermal techniques, which use advanced tools of the oil and gas industry — including fracking — to drill very deep wells and artificially create the conditions needed to harness geothermal energy.
    


            But Hoiland says Zanskar's work shows conventional geothermal still has huge untapped potential.
    


            Joseph Moore, a University of Utah geologist, said AI could be a “gamechanger” for the industry, provided its success at finding hidden geothermal systems can be replicated multiple times.
    


             “It's the latest advancement for this benign, renewable energy source,” he told CNN. “Frankly, it's all very exciting to see.”

            Less than six months after President Donald Trump deployed the National Guard to Washington, DC, the mission is becoming more perilous and complex — and perhaps more permanent.
    


            After last month's shooting near the White House left one National Guard member dead and another critically wounded, some troops are now conducting joint patrols with local police, a move intended to provide more security to the very people sent to make the city safer.
    


            Yet, even as the price tag is mounting – officials estimate the DC mission costs roughly $1.5 million per day – and the impact on reducing overall crime is mixed, officials say expectations are rising that the deployment of troops will continue.
    


            In a win for the Trump administration, a US appeals court last week froze a judge's previous ruling that the deployment was unlawful — potentially paving the way for a mission that is likely months, if not years longer.
    


            National Guard leaders are recruiting for a smaller full-time unit that will include military police deployed to DC as part of a two-year plan, according to a federal military official. Another source familiar with the planning compared a potential long-term guard presence in DC to the New York National Guard's anti-terrorism task force, stationed at transit hubs since the September 11 terror attacks.
    


            While the DC Guard has already been extended to February, officials expect additional states will also be directed to keep their troops in place. Conversations have already started about keeping troops in Washington for the America 250th anniversary celebration next year — a major priority for the White House.
    


            This all comes as guard members and their families have grown increasingly uneasy since the November 26 shooting.
    


            One mother of a Mississippi guardsman, who has been in Washington since November, said she had initially taken comfort in knowing her son would be serving on US soil, which she figured would be safer.
    


            Then she saw a news alert about the shooting near the White House.
    


            “My nerves went haywire and I immediately texted [my son's] phone just to get a response to see was he okay,” she said. He texted back quickly.
    


            Her son is one of more than 2,200 troops from multiple states deployed to DC as part of Trump's anti-crime crackdown. Even before the shooting, he'd felt conflicted about the mission, his mother said, particularly about the cost and whether those resources could be better used to bolster an already-strapped local police force.
    


            Meanwhile, a second death of a guardsmen two weeks before Thanksgiving garnered less attention. Staff Sgt. Jacob Hill from Alabama died on November 13 while on the DC mission after what officials said was a medical emergency from an off-duty incident. A source familiar with the mission said Hill was found unresponsive in his room.
    


            The DC mission has taken an emotional toll, several service members said. While some who spoke to CNN said the shooting renewed many troops' sense of purpose for the mission, others said morale had been slumping because of mundane orders, like just standing around a metro station. Several service members expressed feeling their presence was resented by local residents.
    


            CNN is not naming the guard members or their family interviewed for this story because they're not authorized to speak to the media and feared reprisal.
    


            “It was hard to be around people that were anti-military or didn't like or appreciate you because of the orders that we were on, but you know, we were just doing our job,” said one guard member who had been deployed from Louisiana until recently.
    


With no end in sight, National Guard troops deployed to DC grow weary



            “Unfortunately, we lost a soldier from it, and it breaks my heart,” the member said. “Doing our job is being at risk in that way, especially serving our country. But dying in our country is too close to home.”
    


            DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb argued in a court filing last week that allowing the troops to remain in the city any longer “requires the diversion of scarce police resources and exposes both the public and Guard members to substantial public safety risks,” especially in the wake of the shooting.
    


            Schwalb noted that DC police officers have had to “coordinate with and escort” guardsmen in the city to minimize threats, a task Schwalb said has “redoubled” following last month's shooting.
    


            Since then, Trump has requested 500 more soldiers to be deployed to DC, and new units from Florida, Oklahoma and Arkansas have already joined the mission or are preparing to do so.
    


            The Trump administration has repeatedly declined to place a firm price on the ongoing deployment, but officials familiar with the finances estimate the mission costs up to $1.5 million a day — which would tally up to more than $172 million since August. That's roughly one-third of the Metropolitan Police Department's annual budget.
    


            Democratic Sen. Gary Peters from Michigan said in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday that ongoing National Guard deployments to US cities around the country have so far cost $410 million
    


            “There is nothing conservative about this,” a federal military official told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid being perceived as criticizing the National Guard. “A fraction of this money could be far better spent directly on crime-prevention measures.”
    


            Some officials privately question the financial logic of the mission. A far smaller sum, they note, could have gone toward addressing chronic short-staffing at the DC police department, which is about 800 officers below its recommended staffing level of 4,000.
    


            Trump officials had said the purpose of the National Guard in DC was to establish a presence at various locations – mostly federal monuments and metro stations – and act as a crime deterrent. The intention was to free up law enforcement agents to address crime elsewhere in the city, but new joint patrols with guard members and police would seem to contradict that.
    


            Federal and local agencies scrambled in the wake of the shooting to determine how to protect National Guard troops. DC's police force was initially tasked with increasing check-ins and patrols with officers in the city.
    


            No official plan, however, has been established for how to keep National Guardsmen safe from random attacks, according to one source familiar with the mission.
    


            City officials are also unclear how long the Trump administration intends to keep the National Guard deployed in the city, speculating earlier this year that Trump might have the officers remain until next summer.
    


            A source familiar with the mission said officials are regularly doing assessments and making plans if the mission continues getting extended – looking at things like what would be needed for tourism season in DC and weather patterns in the spring. But lingering uncertainty about how long the mission will last also comes at a price, as officials are unable to make long-term arrangements that might be more cost-effective.
    


            Housing for out-of-state troops is among the biggest cost expenditures, with most out-of-town troops assigned to stay in suburban Virginia hotels. Housing allowances are also given to DC National Guard members, in some cases effectively paying them to stay in their own homes.
    


            In the summer months, the guard spent $5 million on a tent city, according to a CNN review of contracts, plus more than $1 million on renting air conditioning units and land mobile radios.
    


            Rumors of an extended deployment until next summer are already spreading through the ranks.
    


            A senior Republican official from a state that contributed troops said last month's shooting has made it harder for governors to publicly question the deployment. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it is a frequent conversation among governors, but none of whom are willing to raise it publicly to avoid alienating the White House.
    


            The DC Guard is currently working to recruit a potentially permanent, full-time security-focused unit, the source said, adding that it would be available for any need within the DC Guard and will be a separate group from the quick-reaction forces Trump has ordered for each state. The challenge right now, the source said, is that there isn't any official guarantee of mission continuity, making it hard to recruit people away from civilian careers. But the person said “more than enough people” are already interested.
    


            “We are committed to treating every member of the community with dignity and respect,” said a Joint Task Force-DC spokesperson. “Our strong partnership with local and federal agencies ensures a coordinated and professional response as we work together to keep our capital safe.”
    


            The actual impact on crime in DC has so far been inconclusive. Though Trump justified the troop surge to Washington by saying that crime was “out of control” in the city, violent crime declined in 2024 and has declined again so far in 2025.
    


            There has been a sustained decrease in reports of motor vehicle theft, according to DC crime data, every month since Trump announced his federal takeover of Washington's police department and surged National Guard and other federal law enforcement to the city in September. Theft from vehicles has also been on the decline compared to months before the National Guard deployment.
    


            But other crimes, such as homicide, robbery, burglary and assault with a deadly weapon, which dropped initially at the start of the takeover, have risen at least a little since then.
    


            At the start of the mission, the DC Guard sent a letter around to each of the city's neighborhood commission, offering to help clean trash from their local park or other “beautification tasks” if they needed it. While some of the commissions accepted and were happy to see guard members then come through, others felt uneasy inviting the troops into their communities.
    


            “Some of us worried that the presence of the National Guard wouldn't actually make our neighborhood safer and it could actually present risks,” said Peter Wood, the commissioner in DC's Adams Morgan neighborhood.
    


            An amicus brief filed last week and signed by more than 30 retired former senior military officials argues against deploying the National Guard “in a highly politicized context,” as the administration has done in DC. The brief also says that most National Guard “have only limited law enforcement training,” which could put both them and civilians at risk.
    


            “If crime on the streets in Washington, D.C., is an issue, that's something for law enforcement to deal with,” retired Brig. Gen. Paul “Greg” Smith, who had a three-decade career in the Massachusetts National Guard and is one of the signatories to the amicus brief, told CNN.
    


            “I would think that a reasonable chain of command would say, ‘We need to fortify, we need to strengthen a civilian law enforcement capability within the city of Washington, D.C.,'” said Smith. “National Guardsmen are war fighters. No one in the National Guard is trained to be a police officer.”
    


            He added that while public sentiment has typically been supportive of the guard as a presence available to help in emergencies, that image could “become tarnished” if the troops are used “as a political pawn.”
    


            “And yes, some people may target National Guardsmen” as a result, Smith said. “That is a concern.”
    


            Just days after the two members from their state were shot, a group of guardsmen from West Virginia were back on duty in Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood.
    


            “Of course we're sad, but we've got to keep doing our job,” one said.
    


            Asked if he was concerned about still being in DC, he responded, “No comment.”
    


            A service member from a different state said the shooting had been “a wake-up call,” and others echoed that it had taken an emotional toll.
    


            Within the DC Guard, several dozen service members have requested to be taken off this deployment for various reasons ranging from needing to get back to their civilian job or school to just not wanting to be a part of it, said a source familiar with the mission, adding that officials are working to help them come off the mission.
    


            A trio of guardsmen from a southern state walking near the White House on a recent afternoon said they had enjoyed their time, particularly as the hot summer days turned to a far more pleasant fall. They said they were happy to serve, but wished they had more concrete duties, as boredom has set in after being deployed for more than four months.
    


            The Louisiana guardsman who had been deployed to DC for several months before coming off the mission several weeks ago said soldiers “accomplished a lot, even if it didn't seem like a lot.”
    


            “I feel like we kept crime off the streets a little bit more,” the person said.
    


            The guardsman said the reception to them varied, with about half of the people they encountered thanking them for their service. The other half weren't as friendly.
    


            “Morale seemed to heighten when people were ready to go home because morale was kind of low when we were there, when people were just getting treated like scum or just treated like they didn't matter, especially when we signed up to serve our country and provide help where it's needed,” the guardsman said.
    


            A mother of an Oklahoma National Guard member said she'd been fully supportive of the mission as other states sent their troops to Washington. But when she heard that her son would be deploying there just after Thanksgiving, she was scared for him, she said.
    


            “We're terrified, that's all I can really say,” the mother said.
    


            “He's just going to be a little bit more extra with his head on a swivel now,” she said.

            The US Food and Drug Administration intends to put a “black box” warning on Covid-19 vaccines, according to two people familiar with the agency's plans, the latest move by President Donald Trump's health officials to undermine a vaccine that was a standout victory of his first term. The plan shocked outside experts, who said there was no basis for the warning.
    


            A boxed warning, which appears at the top of prescribing information for medicines, is the agency's most serious, designed to warn about risks such as death or life-threatening or disabling reactions that should be weighed against the intervention's benefits. They can also be used when a risk might be lowered by using a medicine in a targeted way, such as only in certain groups.
    


            Boxed warnings on opioids, for example, warn about risks of abuse, addiction, overdose and death. The acne medication Accutane carried a warning about the risks of birth defects when used during pregnancy. ACAM2000, a smallpox and mpox vaccine, has a warning about complications such as heart inflammation and encephalitis.
    


            The plan to install the warnings for Covid-19 vaccines is being orchestrated by Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's chief medical and scientific officer and director of the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, according to one person, who declined to be named because they weren't authorized to share the information publicly.
    


            The plan has not been finalized and may still change. It wasn't immediately clear whether the plans for the warnings, expected to be unveiled by the end of the year, would be applied only to mRNA vaccines or to all Covid-19 vaccines, or whether they would apply to all age groups. Three vaccines are approved by the FDA for use in the US, and two of them — from Pfizer and Moderna – use mRNA technology, which has been a key focus of the administration.
    


            “Unless the FDA announces it, any claim about what it will do is pure speculation,” US Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said Thursday.
    


Recommending Covid-19 vaccines for everyone in the US could save thousands more lives than limiting to high-risk groups



            In response to CNN's inquiry about the FDA's plans, Moderna pointed to a statement it issued in September about the safety of its Covid-19 vaccine, SpikeVax. It notes that the safety of its vaccine is “rigorously monitored by Moderna, the US FDA, and regulators in more than 90 countries,” and that, with more than a billion doses distributed worldwide, those systems “have not reported any new or undisclosed safety concerns in children or pregnant women.”
    


            Pfizer too issued a statement in September supporting the safety and efficacy of its Covid-19 vaccine. The statements from both companies came after reports that federal health officials might seek to tie the vaccines to safety risks in pregnant women and children. Pfizer declined to provide further comment Thursday.
    


            One study estimated that in their first year of use, Covid-19 vaccinations averted almost 20 million deaths around the world.
    


            Children who received Covid-19 vaccines in the 2024-25 respiratory virus season also had a “substantially lower risk” of emergency department and urgent care visits related to the virus, according to a CDC report published Thursday. The vaccines were about 76% effective in preventing these outcomes among healthy children ages 9 months to 4 years and about 56% effective among children ages 5 to 17 compared with those who did not receive an updated vaccine for the 2024-25 season.
    


            The record-speed development of Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic, under the project dubbed Operation Warp Speed, was a crowning achievement of President Donald Trump's first term, one that several Republican lawmakers have recently said should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But Trump installed as his Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who has faced criticism from public health experts and lawmakers for his efforts to impose his personal views despite the science.
    


            Kennedy and his allies have long questioned the safety and effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines, which were studied in placebo-controlled trials in about 75,000 people and given to millions of people in the US and around the world during the pandemic.
    


            Prasad has been a controversial figure, both in his role at the FDA and previously, as a podcaster and professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California at San Francisco. A critic of the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccine policy, he was named CBER director under FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary in May before resigning in July under pressure from the White House and right-wing activist Laura Loomer. Prasad then returned to the job weeks later.
    


            In late November, Prasad sent a memo to staff within CBER, the division at the FDA that oversees vaccines, claiming that staff in the agency's Office of Biostatistics and Pharmacovigilance had “found that at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving Covid-19 vaccination.” He did not provide additional information but promised “swift action” in response.
    


            “The FDA takes very seriously any death that is attributed to a regulated medical product,” Nixon, of HHS, said Thursday.
    


            Prasad focused on myocarditis, or heart inflammation, a very rare side effect after administration of the mRNA vaccines. It was detected with early use of those shots, when the first and second doses were recommended to be spaced as closely as three weeks apart, and was predominantly seen in boys and young men.
    


            A presentation from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in June said most adolescents and young adults recovered from myocarditis after vaccination, and it found no known deaths or heart transplants. Rates have declined significantly in more recent years as the recommended interval between the first and second doses in the initial series has been lengthened for the mRNA vaccines.
    


            Still, the FDA said in May that it was requiring safety warnings in the prescribing information for Pfizer and Moderna's Covid-19 vaccines about the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, or inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart, to be expanded to a broader age range. The labels now say, “the observed risk has been highest in males 12 years through 24 years of age.”
    


            On Tuesday, Children's Health Defense, the nonprofit led by Kennedy before his presidential bid, filed a citizen petition saying the agency should revoke the licenses for the vaccines. It argues that the mRNA vaccines are misbranded because they were initially approved under the standards of emergency use authorizations.
    


            HHS also said this week that the FDA was looking into whether deaths “across multiple age groups” might be related to Covid-19 vaccines.
    


            Prasad's memo, which promised an overhaul of how the FDA regulates vaccines more broadly, drew alarm from outside public health experts, many of whom demanded to see the data supporting Prasad's claims. A dozen former FDA commissioners wrote an open letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine expressing concern around “sweeping new FDA assertions about vaccine safety.”
    


            “What's happening now is death by a thousand cuts,” said a former federal health official who declined to be named because they were not authorized to share information with a reporter.
    


            Recent messaging by the administration that goes against established scientific evidence – saying, for example, that vaccines are riskier when given together and that kids get too many vaccines that have potentially dangerous ingredients – is working to weaken the public's confidence in lifesaving shots, the person said.
    


            “What we're watching is misinformation and lies in aggregate that will discourage the population from vaccination. It will lead us to, ultimately, to having loss of life unnecessarily, and it's very disturbing,” the former official added.
    


Covid-19 vaccination substantially lowered risks for children last season, CDC report says



            Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, who runs the Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law at Harvard University, said these kinds of warnings can be initiated by the manufacturer or the FDA, but typically, the agency notifies the public that it's looking into a safety question around a drug or vaccine. It may also convene an advisory committee — a panel of independent outside experts – to publicly vet the safety data and give advice.
    


            None of these steps seems to have been taken so far.
    


            “I guess my concern is that in this case, there's not a process,” said Kesselheim, who has studied the impact of black box warnings on drug labels. “There isn't that same opportunity for discussion and good-faith review of the data on which this decision is being made.
    


            “My concern is that this will be seen as yet another in the long line of decisions that this FDA is making based on its own political goals, rather than after a dutiful and thoughtful and public review of the science.”
    


            Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, said, “Any questions regarding potential safety issues are being thoroughly reviewed by the FDA's established scientific and regulatory processes, ensuring that all decisions are based on rigorous, independent evaluation of the data.”
    


            Others say they're disturbed by the lack of transparency around whether deaths can be directly linked to the vaccine.
    


            “The FDA has not released any data on how they determined that the Covid vaccines were linked to these pediatric deaths,” said Dr. Fiona Havers, a medical epidemiologist who resigned from the CDC in June over the administration's interference in the agency's vaccine programs.
    


            “Very rare adverse events with vaccines can occur. I don't know if they did in this case, because, again, they haven't released any information,” she said. “But to only talk about potential harms for vaccines, without talking about the thousands of hospitalizations and the many pediatric deaths that these vaccines prevented, is irresponsible and not how our government should be messaging about vaccines to the public.”
    


How RFK Jr.'s misguided science on mRNA vaccines is shaping policy − a vaccine expert examines the false claims



            Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan and co-editor-in-chief of the journal Vaccine, said the basis for a black-box warning was hard to understand.
    


            “Scientifically, I don't think it makes any sense at all, because we haven't seen any of this data,” she said. “Presumably it's going to say something like ‘this vaccine is dangerous.' The FDA puts those on things when there are serious safety risks associated with them. And so it doesn't make sense from an evidence-based perspective, at least based on any of the data that anybody's seen.”
    


            Still, the move doesn't surprise her. Rasmussen said Prasad has a longstanding and well-documented antipathy toward the Covid-19 vaccine, as do other administration officials.
    


            “Everything that they've done so far kind of signals to me that they're very opposed to the Covid vaccines, and they're really trying to manufacture evidence to justify something like that,” she said. “That's been clear for a long time.”
    


            Nixon said it's “irresponsible for outside commentators to speculate about secondhand information they have not seen directly. We categorically reject the suggestion that anyone on our team is attempting to ‘manufacture evidence.'”

President Donald Trump was sued on Friday by preservationists asking a federal court to halt his White House ballroom project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and wins approval from Congress. 

The National Trust for Historic Preservation is asking the U.S. District Court to block Trump's White House ballroom project, which already has involved razing the East Wing, until it goes through comprehensive design reviews, environmental assessments, public comments and congressional debate and ratification. 

The National Trust, a privately funded organization, argues that Trump, by fast-tracking the project, has committed multiple violations of the Administrative Procedures Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, while also exceeding his constitutional authority by not seeking congressional approval for a project of such scale.

“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit states. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.”

No more work should be done, the Trust argues, until administration officials “complete the required reviews — reviews that should have taken place before the Defendants demolished the East Wing, and before they began construction of the Ballroom — and secure the necessary approvals.”




White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not immediately respond to Associated Press questions about the lawsuit and the project, including whether the president had any intention of consulting Congress. Trump has emphasized since announcing his plans that he's doing it with private funding, including his own money. But that would not necessarily change how federal laws and procedures apply to what is still a U.S. government project.

Trump, a Republican, already has bypassed the federal government's usual building practices and historical reviews with the East Wing demolition. He recently added another architectural firm for a ballroom that itself would be nearly twice the size of the White House before the East Wing's demolition.

Trump has said a ballroom is overdue for the White House, previously complaining that events were held outside under a tent because the East Room and the State Dining Room could not accommodate bigger crowds. Trump, among other complaints, said guests get their feet wet if it rains during such events.

The White House is expected to submit plans for Trump's new ballroom to a federal planning commission before the year ends, about three months after construction began.

Will Scharf, who was named by Trump as chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, said at the panel's monthly meeting last week that he was told by colleagues at the White House that the long-awaited plans would be filed in December.

“Once plans are submitted, that's really when the role of this commission, and its professional staff, will begin,” said Scharf, who also is one of the Republican president's top White House aides.

He said the review process would happen at a “normal and deliberative pace.”

The Trump administration is arguing that requiring real-time American Sign Language interpretation of events like White House press briefings “would severely intrude on the President's prerogative to control the image he presents to the public,” part of a lawsuit seeking to require the White House to provide the services.

Department of Justice attorneys haven't elaborated on how doing so might hamper the portrayal President Donald Trump seeks to present to the public. But overturning policies encompassing diversity, equity and inclusion have become a hallmark of his second administration, starting with his very first week back in the White House.

The National Association for the Deaf sued the Trump administration in May, arguing that the cessation of American Sign Language interpretation — which the Biden administration had used regularly — represented “denying hundreds of thousands of deaf Americans meaningful access to the White House's real-time communications on various issues of national and international import.” The group also sued during Trump's first administration, seeking ASL interpretation for briefings related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a June court filing opposing the association's request for a preliminary injunction, reported Thursday by Politico, attorneys for the Justice Department argued that being required to provide sign language interpretation for news conferences “would severely intrude on the President's prerogative to control the image he presents to the public,” also writing that the president has “the prerogative to shape his Administration's image and messaging as he sees fit.”

Government attorneys also argued that it provides the hard of hearing or Deaf community with other ways to access the president's statements, like online transcripts of events, or closed captioning. The administration has also argued that it would be difficult to wrangle such services in the event that Trump spontaneously took questions from the press, rather than at a formal briefing.




A White House spokesperson did not immediately comment Friday on the ongoing lawsuit or answer questions about the administration's argument regarding the damage of interpretation services to Trump's “image.”

In their June filing, government attorneys questioned if other branches of government were being held to a similar standard if they didn't provide the same interpretative services as sought by the association. 

As home to Gallaudet University, the world's premier college for the deaf and hard of hearing, Washington likely has an ample pool of trained ASL interpreters into which the White House could tap. Mayor Muriel Bowser has made ASL interpretation a mainstay of her appearances, including a pair of interpreters who swap in and out.

Last month, a federal judge rejected that and other objections from the government, issuing an order requiring the White House to provide American Sign Language interpreting for Trump and Leavitt's remarks in real time. The White House has appealed the ruling, and while the administration has begun providing American Sign Language interpreting at some events, there's disagreement over what services it has to supply.

On his first week back in office, Trump signed a sweeping executive order putting a stop to diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government. In putting his own imprint on the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in January issued an order stating that DEI policies were “incompatible” with the department's mission, 

This week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered diplomatic correspondence to return to the more traditional Times New Roman font, arguing that the Biden administration's 2023 shift to the sans serif Calibri font had emerged from misguided diversity, equity and inclusion policies pursued by his predecessor.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats released a selection of photos from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, including some of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and the former Prince Andrew.

The 19 photos released by Democratic lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee were a small part of more than 95,000 they received from the estate of Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting sex trafficking charges. The photos released Friday were separate from the case files that the Department of Justice is now compelled to release, but anticipation is growing as the Trump administration faces a deadline next week to produce the highly anticipated Epstein files.

The photos were released without captions or context and included a black-and-white image of Trump alongside six women whose faces were blacked out.

Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, did not say whether any of the women in the photos was a victim of abuse, but he added, “Our commitment from day one has been to redact any photo, any information that could lead to any sort of harm to any of the victims.”

A spokesperson for the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee accused Garcia and Democratic lawmakers of “cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump,” adding that nothing in the documents the committee has received shows “any wrongdoing” by the president.

Many of the photos have already circulated in the public. Democrats pledged to continue to release photos in the days and weeks ahead, as they look to pressure Trump over his Republican administration's earlier refusal to release documents in the Epstein probe. Garcia said that his staff had looked through about a quarter of the images it had received from Epstein's estate, which included photos that were sent to him or that he had in his possession.




“Donald Trump right now needs to release the files to the American public so that the truth can come out and we can actually get some sense of justice for the survivors,” Garcia added.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the photos.

Trump, once a close friend of Epstein, has said that he parted ways with him long before he faced the sex trafficking charges. Clinton, too, has minimized his relationship with Epstein, acknowledging that he traveled on Epstein's private jet but saying through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes. Clinton also has never been accused of misconduct by Epstein's known victims. However, Republicans on the House committee are pushing him and Hillary Clinton to testify in their investigation.

Andrew lost his royal titles and privileges this year amid new revelations of his ties to Epstein, though he has denied wrongdoing.

The photo release also included images of the right-wing political operative Steven Bannon, billionaires Richard Branson and Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and law professor Alan Dershowitz. The men have denied any wrongdoing in their associations with Epstein, who kept many high-profile figures in his circle of friends.

Amid a release of emails between Summers and Epstein, Summers stepped away from his teaching position at Harvard University and faced other fallout to his standing in academic circles.

Allen has faced allegations from his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, of molesting her as a child. He has denied the allegations.

Some lawmakers, however, believe that other high-powered figures could be implicated in Epstein's abuse if the full case files from the Justice Department are released.

Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who was instrumental in passing a bill to require the public release of the files, said it was a good sign that the Department of Justice has sought to have grand jury material released from several courts.

“The grand jury material is just a small fraction of what the DOJ needs to release, because the FBI and DOJ probably has evidence that they chose not to take to the grand jury because the evidence they're in possession of would implicate other people, not Epstein or Maxwell,” he said.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A senior Kremlin official said Friday that Russian police and National Guard will stay on in eastern Ukraine's Donbas and oversee the industry-rich region, even if a peace settlement ends Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine. 

The remarks by Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov underscore Moscow's ambition to maintain its presence in Donbas post-war. Ukraine is likely to reject such a stance as U.S.-led negotiations drag on. 

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian units have recaptured several settlements and neighborhoods near the city of Kupiansk in the northeastern Kharkiv region, following a monthslong operation aimed at reversing Russian advances there. 

Kupiansk has in recent months been one of the most closely contested sectors of the around 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, and the claimed Ukrainian progress of around 40 sq. km. (15 sq. miles) would be a setback for Russia.

Less than two months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Ukrainian troops in Kupiansk were surrounded and offered to negotiate their surrender. He said a media visit to the area would prove it. Putin has sought to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of strength in the war. 




German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's office said he would host Zelenskyy on Monday for talks as peace efforts gain momentum and European leaders seek to steer negotiations. Afterward, numerous European heads of state and government, as well as the leaders of the European Union and NATO, will join the meeting, a statement said.

Moscow will give its blessing to a ceasefire only after Ukraine's forces have withdrawn from the front line, Ushakov also said in comments published Friday in Russian business daily Kommersant. 

He told Kommersant “it's entirely possible that there won't be any troops (in the Donbas), either Russian or Ukrainian” in a postwar scenario. But he said that “there will be the National Guard, our police, everything necessary to maintain order and organize life.”

For months, American negotiators have tried to navigate the demands of each side as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for a swift end to Russia's war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into a major obstacle over who keeps Ukrainian territory that Russian forces have occupied so far.

Since Moscow's 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea and the seizure of territory in the east by Russia-backed separatists later that year, as well as land taken after the full-blown invasion was launched on Feb. 24, 2022, Russia has captured about 20% of its neighbor.

Ukraine says its constitution doesn't allow it to surrender land. Russia, which illegally annexed Donetsk and three other regions illegally in 2022, says the same. Ushakov said that “no matter what the outcome (of peace talks), this territory (the Donbas) is Russian Federation territory.”

On Thursday, Trump compared the negotiations to a very complex real estate deal. He said that he wants to see more progress in talks before sending envoys to possible meetings with European leaders over the weekend.

In October, Trump said the Donbas region will have to be “cut up” to end the war.

In recent months, Russia's army has made a determined push to gain control of all parts of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, which together make up the valuable Donbas region.

Its slow slog across the Ukrainian countryside, using its significant advantage in troop numbers in a corrosive war of attrition, has been costly in terms of casualties and losses of armor. Although outnumbered, Ukrainian defenders have held firm in many areas and counterattacked in others.

Ukrainian forces said Friday that they had advanced around Kupiansk. They gradually cut off Russian supply routes into the city, starting on Sept. 22, and regained control of the villages of Kindrashivka and Radkivka, as well as several northern districts of the city, according to a statement by Ukrainian National Guard's Khartia Corps posted on Facebook.

Fighting is ongoing in central Kupiansk, where more than 200 Russian soldiers are encircled, the statement said.

Zelenskyy posted a video of himself standing on the road into Kupiansk on Friday. Explosions could be heard in the background as he spoke.

“Today, it is critically important to achieve results on the battlefield so that Ukraine can achieve results in diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said in the video, praising his troops on Ukraine's Ground Forces Day.

Russian officials made no immediate comment, and the Ukrainians statements couldn't be independently verified.

Ukraine also has developed its long-range strike capabilities using domestically produced weapons to disrupt Russia's war machine.

Its Special Operations Forces, or SSO, said Friday that an operation in the Caspian Sea struck two Russian vessels carrying military equipment and arms.

The ships named Kompozitor Rakhmaninov and Askar-Saridzha are under U.S. sanctions for transporting arms between Russia and Iran, the SSO said in a statement on social media. It didn't say what weapons it used in its attack.

A Ukrainian drone attack wounded seven people, including a child, in the Russian city of Tver, acting Gov. Vitaly Korolev said Friday. Falling drone debris struck an apartment building in the city, which lies northwest of Moscow, Korolev said.

Russia's air defenses destroyed 90 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia's Defense Ministry said.

Russian drones struck a residential area of Pavlohrad, in Ukraine's central Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one person and wounding four others, the head of the local military administration, Vladyslav Haivanenko, wrote on the Telegram messaging channel on Friday.

Ukraine's southern Odesa region came under a large-scale drone attack overnight, according to regional chief Oleh Kiper. The attack damaged energy infrastructure, he said. More than 90,000 people were without electricity on Friday morning, Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said.

Ukraine's air force said that Russia launched 80 drones across the country during the night.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has arrested Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, her supporters said Friday.

A foundation in her name said she was detained in Mashhad, some 680 kilometers (420 miles) northeast of the capital, Tehran, while attending a memorial for a human rights lawyer recently found dead under unclear circumstances.

A local official reportedly acknowledged arrests had been made, but did not directly name Mohammadi, 53. It wasn't clear if authorities would immediately return her to prison, where she had been serving a sentence until her temporary release in December 2024 for medical purposes.

However, her detention comes as Iran has been cracking down on intellectuals and others as Tehran struggles with sanctions, an ailing economy and the fear of a renewed war with Israel. Arresting Mohammadi may spark increased pressure from the West at a time when Iran repeatedly signals it wants new negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program — something that has yet to happen. 




Her supporters on Friday described her as having been “violently detained earlier today by security and police forces.” They said other activists had been arrested as well at a ceremony honoring Khosrow Alikordi, a 46-year-old Iranian lawyer and human rights advocate who had been based in Mashhad. 

“The Narges Foundation calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all detained individuals who were attending a memorial ceremony to pay their respects and demonstrate solidarity,” a statement read. “Their arrest constitutes a serious violation of fundamental freedoms.”

Alikordi was found dead earlier this month in his office, with provincial officials in describing his death as a heart attack. However, a tightening security crackdown coincided with his death, raising questions. Over 80 lawyers signed a statement demanding more information. 

“What we witnessed today is the Islamic Republic's latest assault on the most basic human freedoms — where even mourning a slain lawyer becomes a punishable act,” said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran.

“When peaceful citizens cannot mourn without being beaten and dragged away, it reveals a government terrified of truth and accountability. It also reveals the extraordinary bravery of Iranians who refuse to surrender their dignity.”

Footage purportedly of the ceremony showed Mohammadi with a microphone, calling out to the crowd gathered without wearing a hijab, or headscarf. She started the crowd chanting the name Majidreza Rahnavard, a man whom authorities hanged from a crane in a public execution in 2022. 

Footage published by her foundation also showed her without a hijab, surrounded by a large crowd.

Hasan Hosseini, the city governor of Mashhad, said prosecutors ordered security officials to temporarily detain a number of participants at the ceremony after the chanting of “norm-breaking” slogans, Iranian state television reported. 

Hosseini described the detentions as preventive to protect those there from others in the crowd, but did not address claims that security forces used violence in making the arrests. 

Other anti-government chants could be heard in purported video footage of the event. 

Supporters had warned for months that Mohammadi was at risk of being put back into prison after she received a furlough in December 2024 over medical concerns.

While that was to be only three weeks, Mohammadi's time out of prison lengthened, possibly as activists and Western powers pushed Iran to keep her free. She remained out even during the 12-day war in June between Iran and Israel.

Mohammadi still kept up her activism with public protests and international media appearances, including even demonstrating at one point in front of Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where she had been held.

Mohammadi had been serving 13 years and nine months on charges of collusion against state security and propaganda against Iran's government. She also had backed the nationwide protests sparked by the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, which have seen women openly defy the government by not wearing the hijab.

Mohammadi suffered multiple heart attacks while imprisoned before undergoing emergency surgery in 2022, her supporters say. Her lawyer in late 2024 revealed doctors had found a bone lesion that they feared could be cancerous that later was removed.

“Mohammadi's doctors recently prescribed an extension of her medical leave for at least six more months to conduct thorough and regular medical examinations, including monitoring the bone lesion which was removed from her leg in November, physiotherapy sessions to recover from the surgery and specialized cardiac care,” the Free Narges Coalition said in late February 2025. 

“The medical team overseeing Mohammadi's health has warned that her return to prison — especially under stressful conditions of detention and without adequate medical facilities — could severely worsen her physical well-being.”

An engineer by training, Mohammadi has been imprisoned 13 times and convicted five. In total, she has been sentenced to over 30 years in prison. Her last incarceration began when she was detained in 2021 after attending a memorial for a person killed in nationwide protests.

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian accident investigators on Thursday released dramatic images of a skydiver's parachute becoming entangled on an airplane's tail, leaving him dangling at 4,500 meters (15,000 feet.)

The skydiver, Adrian Ferguson, used a hook knife to cut himself free and sustained minor leg injuries during the incident on Sept. 20 that began at Tully Airport in Queensland state. The pilot and 16 other parachutists on board the Cessna Caravan that day were not hurt.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau released the video with its report on its investigation into the mishap.

The plane had reached the desired altitude where the skydivers were planning to execute a 16-way formation jump. A 17th parachutist was at an open door waiting to record video as the others jumped.

Ferguson was leaving the plane when the ripcord of his reserve chute became snagged on a wing flap, the report said.

The chute released and immediately jerked Fergson backward. He knocked the camera operator clear from the plane and into a free fall. Ferguson's legs then struck the trail's horizontal stabilizer before the chute tangled around it and left him dangling.

Ferguson used a knife to cut 11 lines that enabled him to fall from the plane with part of the torn chute.

He released his main chute, which fully inflated despite becoming entangled with remnants of the reserve chute, and he landed safely.




Meanwhile, most of the other skydivers had jumped. The pilot was left with two skydivers aboard battling to control the plane with part of the chute still tangled around the tail.

The pilot made a mayday call and was prepared to bail out wearing an emergency chute. But Brisbane air traffic authorities decided he had enough control of the plane to land safely at Tully. It landed without incident.

“Carrying a hook knife — although it is not a regulatory requirement — could be lifesaving in the event of a premature reserve parachute deployment,” the bureau's chief commissioner Angus Mitchell said.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts break down the latest legal clashes over President Donald Trump's deportations of illegal immigrants.

Lawyers for the Trump administration are seeking to shut down a revived contempt inquiry led by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, arguing in new filings that the court should cancel two scheduled witness examinations next week or allow the administration to block testimony on grounds of ""executive privilege.""

In filings earlier this week, Justice Department lawyers argued the court is exceeding its authority. ""At the outset, the Court's inquiry exceeds its authority and is now intruding on the prerogatives of a co-equal branch,"" they wrote, adding that criminal contempt falls within the executive branch's power.

""Criminal contempt is a criminal offense, and the investigation and prosecution of crimes is [a] core executive power reserved to the Executive Branch,"" they added. 

The filings are part of a revived contempt inquiry that will bring to the fore longtime tensions between the Trump administration and the chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., who sparked Trump's ire earlier this year after he attempted to temporarily block the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in March.

NOEM GREENLIT DEPORTATION FLIGHTS AFTER JUDGE'S EMERGENCY ORDER, DOJ REVEALS — FUELING CONTEMPT FIGHT

Boasberg this week requested testimony from two current and former Justice Department officials who played a key role in the Trump administration's use of the 18th century wartime law to quickly deport the migrants to El Salvador in March, despite his temporary restraining order and subsequent oral order that attempted to block — for 14 days — the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to immediately deport the migrants. 

He is now weighing whether senior Trump officials willfully defied that order. To wit, he ordered Drew Ensign, the Justice Department's deputy assistant attorney general, to appear in court Monday for questioning and for cross-examination from lawyers representing the class of deported Venezuelan migrants.

He also ordered testimony and cross-examination the following day from former Justice Department lawyer Erez Reuveni, who since parting ways with the Justice Department has publicly accused the administration of ignoring court orders — including in this case.

""The Court thus believes that it is necessary to hear witness testimony to better understand the basis of the decision to transfer the deportees out of United States custody in the context of the hearing on March 15, 2025,"" Boasberg wrote in scheduling the appearances.

""The events surrounding this decision should shed light on this question,"" he said.

The inquiry was revived after the D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, vacated an earlier ruling and returned the matter to Boasberg. New details about the government's handling of the March flights have already emerged, with additional disclosures expected in the coming days.

Still, court filings revealed that the Trump administration plans to fight those efforts at every turn. 

""If the Court does proceed with testimony, it should grant a protective order with respect to privileged information or provide Defendants with an opportunity to seek appellate relief in advance of any testimony; and the Court should also limit the scope of the testimony and preclude Plaintiffs from participating,"" they told Boasberg.

Last month, DOJ officials identified DHS Secretary Kristi Noem as the official who authorized the transfer of the Venezuelan migrants after being briefed on Boasberg's emergency order by lawyers for the Justice Department and acting general counsel for DHS.

Boasberg said earlier this week that it would be ""premature"" to refer anyone for prosecution under the revived contempt probe, and declined to immediately compel testimony from Noem at this stage in the process.

Noem said in a declaration of her own that she made that call based on legal advice from lawyers for the Justice Department, as well as the acting general counsel for DHS.

The fresh action on the contempt issue is almost certain to spark the ire of some Republicans in Congress and from Trump himself, who has repeatedly excoriated Boasberg as an ""activist judge"" for his role in the Alien Enemies Act case and resulting inquiry.

Boasberg, for his part, has appeared unfazed. 

""This has been sitting for a long time,"" Boasberg said late last month of the contempt inquiry, ""and I believe justice requires me to move promptly on this.""

The government, he added, ""can assist me to whatever degree it wishes.""

Fox News Digital spoke to John Nagel, who is running against Rep. Ilhan Omar in Minnesota's 5th Congressional District, about the unfolding fraud scandal in his home state.

MINNEAPOLIS, MN – Republican John Nagel, who is running against Dem. Rep. Ilhan Omar in her Minneapolis district, spoke to Fox News Digital about the responsibility she holds in the unfolding massive fraud scandal that has garnered national headlines.

""Where did this actually start?"" Nagel told Fox News Digital. ""She passed legislation. Her legislation actually started and it allowed people to get into Feeding Our Future. If you look at where the fraud is, it's primarily her [5th Congressional District], the district that I'm running in against her. And it's really odd to think that you know all the fraud just happened in a particular area, and it was a bill that she, you know, particularly put together.""

Nagel is referring to allegations that the free meals at the center of the massive fraud scandal were made possible by the 2020 MEALS Act, introduced by Omar and passed with bipartisan support. He told Fox News Digital the public deserves to know who helped her craft that legislation.

Members of Omar's inner circle personally profited from the $1 billion welfare fraud scandal in her district that has placed her Somali constituency under a White House microscope, Nagel said. He also said that Omar held events at one of the restaurants, Safari Land, which was named in the fraud case, knew one of its now-convicted owners and had a staffer who was also convicted.

""If you look at the Safari Land restaurant, if you're gonna be in politics, you need to go through the people at the Safari Land restaurant,"" Nagel said. ""They kind of control the politics. She had all of her fundraising things. I mean, that was sort of her hangout. That's where she spent money, got donations.""

Guhaad Hashi Said, sometimes referred to as an ""enforcer"" for Omar's campaign, is one of the over 70 people who have been indicted for his role in the Feeding Our Future scandal. Nagel told Fox News Digital the public deserves answers on that relationship and what Omar knew about the fraud.

""There's a lot of really deep, deep ties,"" Nagel said.

""I think time will tell with the investigation. But again, there's just too much circumstantial evidence to look at this and say, she had to have known something, or what staff member knew something?""

The Small Business Administration is investigating a network of Somali groups in Minnesota that it says is tied to the scandal, and a House Oversight Committee has opened an investigation into Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's role.

President Donald Trump last week criticized Omar and blamed the Somali community for the scope of fraud occurring in Minnesota. 

Nagel also asserted that there was a money trail potentially funneled to Omar from her associates tied to the Feeding Our Future fraud scandal, and he said that she has returned some of the money but not all of it.

""A whole lot of people that were convicted donated a whole lot of money. Omar says that she gave the money back,"" Nagel said. ""Well, if you go into public records, she gave some money back, but there's a whole lot more money there that she didn't report. And I think if people were just to go through the everyday records that are out there, you'll find out that her involvement in the money that she has is questionable.""

Nagel told Fox News Digital, ""If she truly cared about the fraud, her name wouldn't be attached all over to these other people. She came on and she made a statement about how terrible it is to basically steal food from children. Yeah, okay, that's a really nice thing to say, but you have way too many people that you're associated with that actually did that. Now she yells racism anytime somebody puts any pressure on her.""

Fox News Digital asked Nagel what can be done to fix the fraud issues. He said, first and foremost, Minnesota must elect a new governor.

""The things that we can do to fix this is you get yourself a new competent, honest governor, you get yourself a new honest, competent AG,"" Nagel said. ""We get rid of Ilhan Omar, and we put people in the state of Minnesota that actually want to do the right thing. They're not in it for the money, they're in it because they're great state employees and they're serving the public. That's what we're gonna have to do. You're gonna have to entirely root the Democratic Party, and then anybody that's been appointed to a position, we're gonna have to root them out too, to find out if you know they've been letting things slide.""

Nagel described the fraud situation in Minnesota as a ""cancer"" that will continue to ""spread"" unless ""you cut the entire cancer out.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Omar's office for comment. 

""I think what happened is that, you know, when you have these kind of new programs that are, um, designed to help people, you're oftentimes relying on third parties to be able to facilitate. And I just think that a lot of the COVID programs that were set up — they were set up so quickly that a lot of the guardrails did not get created,"" Omar said last week.

Closing arguments expected in murder trial of Brian Walshe over wife's disappearance.

Brian Walshe, who declined to testify at his murder trial, tried to take control of his late father's estate soon after he was indicted on art fraud charges in 2018, according to a report.

Brian and Thomas Walshe had been estranged for years, but the only child argued that his dad didn't leave a will and convinced the Plymouth County Probate Court in Massachusetts to name him as personal representative for the estate that December, according to The Boston Globe.

Brian's claim to Thomas' estate was later challenged by his father's family and friends, arguing the only child had actually destroyed the will, sold off his belongings and wiped out his father's bank account. Brian allegedly took and sold off a total of over $500,000 after the late Walshe stripped his son from the will.

Fred Pescatore, a longtime friend of Thomas, reportedly said in a signed statement to the court that Brian stole from his father.

""Brian and Tom's estrangement had everything to do with money,"" Pescatore said. ""Brian stole money from Tom and swindled him out of almost one million dollars…""

Pescatore added that Brian had a violent streak and said he was ""very angry"" and a ""sociopath.""

""I saw Brian attempt to smuggle out antiquities from China,"" Pescatore added. ""When Brian was confronted, he picked up a stanchion and literally attempted to kill four or five guards that had come to talk to him about his crime.""

When Thomas died, Brian ""almost had zero"" contact with him for over a decade, friends and family wrote to the probate court.

Walshe is accused of killing his wife, Ana, in January 2023 after learning she was having an affair. Ana disappeared on New Year's Day and was never seen again. Jurors will begin deliberations on Friday. The defense unexpectedly rested its case on Thursday morning without calling any witnesses and did not put Brian on the stand.

On Tuesday, a forensic scientist testified that DNA consistent with Ana's profile was found on a hatchet and hacksaw recovered from the trash.

Saman Saleem, a DNA unit supervisor at the state police crime lab, also said that several items found at a Peabody, Massachusetts, trash collection site also had Ana's DNA on it, which included pieces of a rug, a Tyvek suit, unknown tissue and slippers.

Brian's wife had a $2.7 million life insurance policy which he was the beneficiary of, court records show. He owed nearly $500,000 in restitution for his federal case.

Another one of Thomas' longtime friends, Jeffrey Ornstein, said in a signed statement to the probate court that he had proof Brian was taken out of the will. Ornstein said Brian reached out to him following Thomas' death and asked if he had the keys to his father's house in Hull, Massachusetts. Brian claimed he ""needed some paperwork.""

When Ornstein entered the house, he saw Thomas' will in the office.

""I reviewed the Will and left it where we found it, however, I took some pictures,"" Ornstein wrote. ""I noticed a list of beneficiaries, but as Tom had told me many times over the years, he had expressly disinherited Brian.""

Thomas' nephew, Andrew Walshe, was named as the executor of the will, Ornstein said. 

""I still felt bad,"" Ornstein continued, ""so when I texted Brian later that day to tell him that I had left him a set of keys under the mat, I did not tell him about being disinherited.""

Brian and Thomas' dispute stems from the acquisition of a home in Lenox, Massachusetts, according to the report. Brian bought the house, with his father reportedly agreeing to fund renovations with the stipulation that he'd be paid back, which never happened.

Andrew eventually asked the court in July 2019 to remove Brian as the estate's personal representative.

""It is clear that Brian destroyed the Last Will and Testament which excluded him from any inheritance, when he gained access to the Hull property,"" Andrew wrote in a statement to the court. ""Brian R Walshe had estranged himself from all Walshe family members due to their knowledge of the theft he had committed to his father.""

""I hereby bequeath to Brian R. Walshe my best wishes but nothing else from my estate,"" Thomas wrote in the will.

Andrew unsuccessfully pressured Brian to account for what happened to the estate and alleged that the only child drained at least $250,000 from Thomas' bank account and sold his possessions, worth about $250,000.

A woman was stabbed multiple times inside New York City's iconic Macy's Herald Square on Thursday, Fox News Digital has learned.

The victim was a 38-year-old from California who was shopping with her husband when the attack occurred, according to the New York Post. 

The NYPD told Fox News Digital that the 39-year-old victim had multiple stab wounds on her back and a laceration to her left arm. The victim was transported to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition.

The Post reported that the attack took place in the seventh-floor bathroom of the store.

Law enforcement sources told the Post that the victim, who was reportedly visiting from Jurupa Valley, works as a civilian in the sheriff's office where her husband serves as a sheriff.

The NYPD identified the individual who was arrested and charged in connection with the attack as 43-year-old Kerri Aheme of Tewksbury, Mass. Aheme has been charged with attempted murder, two counts of assault, criminal possession of a weapon and endangering the welfare of a child, according to the NYPD. The Post reported that Aheme was homeless.

With the Supreme Court set to hear the Little vs. Hecox case, Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador will have a big decision to make in the national movement to keep trans athletes out of women's and girls' sports.

Super Bowl-winning head coach Barry Switzer and 31 Olympians have signed an amicus brief in support of the legal defense to ""save women's sports"" ahead of two upcoming Supreme Court cases over trans athletes. The signees also include 12 Olympic medalists, including eight gold medalists. 

Switzer, women's tennis legend Martina Navratilova, Olympic gold medalists Kerri Walsh-Jennings, Summer Sanders, Donna de Varona, Nancy Hogshead, Laura Wilkinson, Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson, Monique Lamoureux-Morando, and Rhi Jeffrey, and former NFL quarterback Steve Stenstrom are among the top sports figures who signed the brief. 

The signees also include multiple female athletes who have had to compete against biological male trans athletes, including fencer Stephanie Turner, former NCAA volleyball player Macy Petty, former University of Pennsylvania women's swimmer Monika Burzynska, and U.S. Masters swimmers Wendy Enderle, Cissy Cochran and Angie Griffin.

The brief has a total of 124 signatures, which also includes the family members of athletes who signed.

The brief argues that state laws in Idaho and West Virginia that protect women's sports from trans athletes also protect women and girls from mental and physical harm. 

""By ruling in favor of West Virginia's and Idaho's laws, this Court can reaffirm that women should not lose their equal opportunity to compete in sports on a level playing field. By affirming the states' right to stand with women and girls, this Court can ensure that females' basic right to be treated equally is still the legal norm in the United States,"" the brief reads. 

""It is hard to express the pain, humiliation, frustration, and shame women experience when they are forced to compete against males in sport. It is public shaming and suffering, an exclusion from women's own category – a place that uniquely belongs to them… The shame does not disappear after competition is over. It stays forever as a memory of sanctioned public ridicule… The psychological, tangible, and long-term harm suffered by females forced to compete against males is irreversible.""

On the other side, 130 congressional Democrats signed an amicus brief supporting the trans athlete plaintiffs in the two cases. 

The coalition, which includes nine senators and 121 House members, is led by Congressional Equality Caucus Co-Chair Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., Democratic Women's Caucus Chair Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, D-N.M., and Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii.

The list of signees features prominent figures on the party's left wing, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. The list also includes House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Nancy Pelosi. The list does not include noted moderate Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

The Little vs. Hecox and West Virginia vs. BPJ cases were each initially legal wins that enabled biological males to bypass their state's laws to compete against females. But now that the cases will be heard by the Supreme Court, a decision could have a wide-ranging impact on the legality of trans athletes in women's sports going forward. 

The cases are set for oral arguments on Jan. 13 in Washington, D.C. 

The Little vs. Hecox lawsuit was initially filed by trans athlete Lindsay Hecox in 2020, when the athlete wanted to join the women's cross-country team at Boise State and had the state's law to prevent trans athletes from competing in women's sports blocked.

Hecox was joined by an anonymous biological female student, Jane Doe, who was concerned about the potential of being subjected to the sex dispute verification process. The challenge was successful when a federal judge blocked Idaho's state law. 

A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld an injunction blocking the state law in 2023, before the Supreme Court agreed in July to hear the case. Hecox then asked the court last month to drop the challenge, claiming the athlete ""has therefore decided to permanently withdraw and refrain from playing any women's sports at BSU or in Idaho.""

Hecox tried to have the case dismissed in September after the Supreme Court agreed in July to hear the case, but U.S. District Judge David Nye, appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017, rejected Hecox's motion to dismiss the case.

The West Virginia vs. B.P.J. lawsuit was brought against the state of West Virginia by trans athlete Becky Pepper-Jackson, who was initially granted a preliminary injunction allowing the athlete to participate on the school's sports teams. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the law violated Title IX and the equal protection clause. Now the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the state's appeal.

In a response brief, the athlete's mother, Heather Jackson, argued West Virginia's law that prohibits transgender athletes from competing in women's sports violates Title IX.

However, Title IX does not explicitly protect the right of biologically male transgender people to identify as women. The Trump administration and West Virginia state government do not interpret Title IX as protective of that right.

Sleep disorder specialist Dr. Qanta Ahmed discusses concerns about learning and longevity in the age of social media on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Insufficient sleep is one of the strongest predictors of shorter life expectancy in the U.S., surpassed only by smoking.

That's according to a new nationwide analysis published in the journal SLEEP Advances, led by senior author Andrew McHill, Ph.D., associate professor with Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU).

To explore how sleep habits relate to lifespan, the researchers examined data from surveys conducted by the CDC between 2019 and 2025 across more than 3,000 U.S. counties, according to a press release.

COMMON SLEEP PROBLEM TIED TO SERIOUS NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER IN MAJOR NEW STUDY

Sufficient sleep was defined as at least seven hours per night, consistent with guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.

The researchers compared average life expectancy in each county with the proportion of residents reporting sufficient sleep, controlling for traditional predictors of mortality such as smoking, diet, physical inactivity and loneliness.

Counties where more people reported insufficient sleep tended to have lower life expectancy. This pattern held across most states and years studied, even when accounting for other lifestyle factors.

""I didn't expect it to be so strongly correlated to life expectancy,"" McHill said in the press release, noting that although sleep's importance to health is well-established, its association with lifespan exceeded expectations.

""We've always thought sleep is important, but this research really drives that point home: People really should strive to get seven to nine hours of sleep if at all possible.""

The research builds on a broad body of evidence linking sleep duration to health outcomes, including mortality risk, heart health, immune strength and brain function.

However, this is the first analysis to map the relationship between sleep duration and life expectancy at a detailed, county-by-county level across multiple years, establishing a consistent association across diverse communities, the release states.

The study did have some limitations, including its reliance on self-reported survey data, which can be subject to reporting bias. It also cannot establish causation and does not explain the biological factors behind the results, the researchers noted.

Although the statistical models controlled for several lifestyle factors, other unmeasured variables could influence both sleep patterns and life expectancy.

Sleep duration alone does not capture other dimensions of sleep health, such as quality or regularity, which may also affect long-term outcomes, according to the study.

The authors emphasized that these findings highlight the importance of prioritizing sleep as a core pillar of health, on par with diet and exercise.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","‘Garbage time' for China's ‘last generation'","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/premium/3914421/garbage-time-china-last-generation-communist-regime-insecure/","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 09:08:12 GMT","

China's people, as is sometimes said, are “trying to breathe,” hoping to find some freedom from central control.

Four female college students in the central city of Zhengzhou tried to breathe in June 2024 as they decided to take an overnight 50-kilometer bike ride to Kaifeng, where they could enjoy a meal of soup dumplings. The craze caught on, and by November 100,000 young people were making the overnight treks.

Were the bike rides innocent activity?

Of course they were, but authorities were deeply concerned nonetheless and left nothing to chance. They tried to limit the number of riders, and there were even reports that colleges and universities were restricting students from congregating and participating.

For an insecure regime, just about everything is considered a threat.

Chinese society has always been volatile, but it is even more so now. President Xi Jinping's response to widespread unhappiness is to increase coercion. The Chinese Communist Party has developed and now operates the world's most sophisticated system of social controls, employing, among other things, neighborhood “grid management” monitors, an updated version of local “watchers” from the Maoist era; more than 700 million surveillance cameras; the Great Firewall cutting the country off from the global internet; and a standardized social credit system. The control and surveillance mechanisms, in their totality, are especially merciless. For instance, those with low social credit scores have been completely cut off from society and must sleep in the streets.

“Xi's response to widespread desperation has been to significantly enhance ‘stability maintenance' measures to suppress popular discontent through the use of digital technologies that menace and intimidate all expressions of resentment,” said Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in Beijing.

Chinese authorities should be especially worried at the moment because the economy is suffering a prolonged downturn, the first since the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976. China cannot be growing at officially reported rates, and it is probably contracting outright.

But the downturn is not the real problem for the CCP. The real problem is a growing public perception of unfairness. “China's economy is failing fast due to Xi Jinping's policies of repression to preserve the power and privilege of the corrupt Chinese Communist elite,” Burton, now at the Prague-based Sinopsis think tank, told me in November 2024. “More and more people have lost their life savings in the collapse of the housing market. Young people suffer the soul-destroying impact of unemployment.”

Xi, as Burton suggests, has tried to prevent as much as possible the sharing of benefits of growth with the laobaixing, the ordinary Chinese people. Resulting resentment scars China's society, even though Xi has tried to ban public displays of wealth by senior officials. “He will not adopt measures to address the root causes, instead heartlessly abandoning the Chinese people,” Burton said.

China's young people are not happy being part of what Dan Wang calls the Communist Party's “engineering state.” Wang, author of Breakneck: China's Quest to Engineer the Future, said Chinese leaders “treat society as a big engineering project, where people are yet another building material that the leadership just wants to tweak, and remold, and destroy if necessary.”

“These days, there is a sense of bitter anger among the people at being the voiceless victims of the state's obsession with world power and beating the United States,” Helen Gao wrote in the New York Times in November.

Xi's 15th five-year plan, which covers the next half-decade, emphasizes industrial production and technological development, not common welfare. “Many now feel that the very state policies that have made China appear strong overseas are hurting them,” Gao, a Beijing-based freelance writer, explained. “They see a government more concerned with building global influence and dominating export markets than in addressing the challenges of their households.” 

As a result of this general feeling of helplessness, horrific acts of violence are scarring China. For instance, for much of 2024, China suffered one mass killing after another. In an especially horrible incident in November of that year, a man drove his SUV on the exercise track of Zhuhai Stadium, killing 35 people and injuring 43 others. Disaffected Chinese are increasingly resorting to violence as their first choice instead of their last one.

The Communist Party's reaction has been to conceal what is going on, censoring news of such incidents and suppressing expressions of grief and mourning. These actions, by further bottling up emotions, are making a bad situation even worse.

People with resources are, not surprisingly, leaving China. Many others, who cannot get out, have dropped out of society. The University of Pennsylvania's Victor Mair put it this way in his Language Log: “‘Lying flat,' ‘Buddha whatever,' ‘Kong Yijiism,' ‘involution' — China today has so many memes for opting out.” Since Mair's July 2023 posting, young, educated Chinese people have also found a new way to show discontent, which is “retiring” by leaving cities and taking up farming.

The gloom in Chinese society is forcing down birth rates.“In this country, to love your child is to never let him be born in the first place,” is a popular sentiment. In 2022, a young man who was told by officials that his defiant conduct would cause troubles for the next three generations of his family answered, “We are the last generation, thank you.” The video of the threat and rebuff went viral.

There will, of course, be future generations, but the sharp drop in fertility is so serious that China could lose three-quarters of its population by the turn of the century. No aspect of society will be untouched as the People's Republic goes from the world's second-most populous state — it lost its population crown to India in the middle of 2023 — to a midsized one.

“China has embarked on a road of demographic no-return,” writes Wang Feng of the University of California, Irvine. Yi Fuxian of the University of Wisconsin-Madison talks about “a civilizational collapse.”

Xi is now out of touch because of Communist Party repression that prevents officials, especially the man at the top, from hearing authentic voices from those they govern. He started his rule in 2012 talking about the “Chinese dream” and later popularized the Maoist-era slogan “common prosperity.” Now, however, such optimistic and uplifting phrases ring hollow.

The Chinese people have a phrase of their own for all this — they refer to the “garbage time of history.” First coined in 2023 by essayist and editor Hu Wenhui, the words have captured the imagination of the disaffected, who now use China's rich past to criticize Xi obliquely. “As far as Chinese history is concerned, the Ming dynasty opened by Zhu Yuanzhang is a typical ‘historical garbage time,'” business writer Ma Xiangyang noted in February about the founder of that imperial ruling group. “He started his empire dream with severe punishments and harsh laws and wanted to protect the family name for generations. Objectively, it only extended the length and depth of this period of darkness.” In case anyone doubted what all this was about, Ma added that “garbage time” was starting to return to “the heart of Asia.”

In response to these expressions of deepening malaise, officials are attacking “excessively pessimistic sentiment.” As Burton pointed out in November, censors went on a tone-deaf, two-month campaign aimed at “curbing the spread of fear and anxiety.” For many, the interest of the Communist Party in Ma's writing confirmed that the country was heading into a grim period. The Chinese are especially dour, now spending time comparing their “misery points.”

“The key political drivers in modern China are the desire for central control at the top and pressure for decentralization from below,” wrote Lanxin Xiang of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva. Xi's top-down pressure is beginning to fail as the signs of societal fracturing are evident.

The country itself could fracture. There are always centrifugal forces in a “multicultural empire,” such as China's.

The Communist Party has sought to unify the country by reinforcing the notion of Han nationalism. The official line is that China is composed of the Hans, who comprise about 91% of the Chinese population, and 55 other ethnic groups. The Hans, considered the world's largest ethnicity, are not a single monolithic strain of humanity, however, but an amalgamation, the result of the assimilation of various peoples over centuries.

Chinese officials speak of a unified nation. “The people of all ethnic groups are tightly held together like pomegranate seeds, and together they are making arduous efforts for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation where they can all live a happy life,” said Yu Jianhua, the head of China's Mission to the United Nations office at Geneva, at the U.N. Human Rights Council in 2019. Xinhua News Agency reported at the time that all 56 ethnic groups are “living together like brothers and sisters” and “are all part of the big family of the Chinese nation.”

“No, we are not part of a happy Chinese family,” Nury Turkel, an American lawyer of Uyghur heritage, told me in December. “We're not the same family. We are not even the same race.”

“We want good relations with our neighbors, but they are our neighbors, they are not us,” added Turkel, former chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.

Today, conquered peoples such as the Tibetans and Uyghurs want their own countries. Some Mongolians hope their lands will become part of neighboring Mongolia.

Even some Han are eager to leave the People's Republic, especially those in southern areas. There has been an undercurrent in Guangdong that the province would be better off by itself, but separate sentiment has always been high in neighboring Hong Kong, one of China's two special administrative regions since July 1997. There, people are considered Han but have been abandoning “Chinese” identity. In 2019, the year of protests against Chinese rule, a stunning 92.5% of those in the 18-29 age group identified themselves solely as “Hongkonger.” Hongkonger identity has remained strong throughout this decade among most age groups.

In short, many in China do not want to be included in the Chinese nation. As the Chinese themselves correctly say, there are periods when their country gets larger, and there are periods when it gets smaller. In the interwar warlord period, for instance, the country was fracturing and almost split apart.

China is now held together by totalitarian controls, but those mechanisms could fail, especially if the Communist Party elites continue to quarrel. Then, unhappy people at the periphery just might make their break for freedom.

In the meantime, with an unhappy populace, explosion will become the model of social change. Why were officials in central China so worried about college students riding bikes for soup dumplings?

The Zhengzhou officials were still smarting from the uncontrollable protests that began in the same city in October 2022. Then, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of workers fled “iPhone City,” a manufacturing plant of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn. Videos of what is now called the “Foxconn Great Escape” or the “iPhone Long March” show workers scrambling over high chain fences. “Something snapped over the weekend,” Bloomberg News reported at the time.

To avoid detection, workers traveled through cropland by day and took to the roads at night. “Some people were walking amid wheat fields with their luggage, blankets, and quilts,” one poster said on WeChat, the popular Chinese social media platform. “I couldn't help but feel sad.”

Residents of neighboring areas rallied, for instance, leaving water and provisions in the open on roadsides. Social media postings reported signs such as “For Foxconn workers returning home.”

Truckers also pitched in to help. Risking detention, they gave workers rides in pick-ups, dump trucks, and flatbeds. One video shows a woman standing on the back of a big tank truck speeding down a highway in the rain.

Workers fled Foxconn's “closed loop” system, which isolated the plant from the rest of society during the COVID-19 epidemic. The Zhengzhou workers were not just rebelling against strict disease-prevention measures, but against their isolation and top-down constraints. More than a decade before their great escape, several Foxconn workers died by suicide by jumping off buildings at a self-contained plant in Shenzhen, in southern China.

The defiance of the fleeing iPhone City workers in Zhengzhou was contagious. The incident quickly led to spontaneous protests across the country as workers, homeowners, students, elderly people, and others took to the streets for more than two months to complain about a variety of long-simmering grievances. In November 2022, protesters in Shanghai publicly shouted revolutionary slogans. “Step down, Xi Jinping!” they demanded. “Step down, Communist Party!”

China's millennia of history have been marked by long periods of repression after spasms of violent political change, in seemingly impossible rebellions such as those that eventually toppled China's first imperial dynasty, the Qin, and the last one, the Qing.

The mighty Qin dynasty was ended by a revolt started by two lowly soldiers who faced execution. The Qings went down after an accidental explosion in Wuchang that Sun Yat-sen, who is considered the leader of the revolutionary forces, read about while he was in Denver. Chinese leaders didn't foresee the Beijing Spring of 1989, protests in more than 400 Chinese cities that led to the June 4 massacre in the capital, so we have to wonder what they are missing now.

Senior leaders have been desperately trying to set limits as to what is permissible, but their response, removing dissidents and activists from the streets, is not working. Instead, it is prompting even more calls for freedom and demands for political reform. In some cases, the Communist Party's methods have failed as authorities have had to arrest and rearrest people across the country. As my friend Christopher Tibbs, who was stationed in China as a banker, told me long ago, “There's a billion people who don't like following instructions.”

With the policies of repression and centralization with which they intend to create more national unity, Communist Party leaders are delegitimizing themselves. One crude act after another, they are galvanizing public opinion against themselves. The CCP's traditional methods, therefore, are losing effectiveness in China's increasingly forward-looking society. Protests today occur not so much because conditions are worse but because, among other things, fear is receding while thinking inside the country is changing, as it has in every modernizing society. “Modernity breeds stability, but modernization breeds instability,” the late Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington wrote.

The Communist Party should know a thing or two about instability in modernizing societies. Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the Kuomintang, had an overwhelming material and strategic advantage in his struggles as ruler for control of the country in the 1940s against Mao Zedong's Communist Party.

But toward the end of that decade, the population had had enough of Chiang's corruption and ineffectiveness, and it wanted something new. Mao said in 1948 that it would take him a decade to prevail. In fact, he needed only a year to get rid of Chiang's regime and establish the People's Republic.

Some analysts argue that the Communist Party will remain in power until an organized opposition appears, like Mao's CCP was to Chiang's Kuomintang. Since the Cold War, however, many seemingly stable governments have fallen to impromptu crowds in the street.

In January 2001, in Manila, Philippines, “People Power 2,” a mass protest, brought down the corrupt government of President Joseph Estrada. He was finished when an unknown Filipino sent out a text message urging people to congregate at a well-known intersection. The crowd grew geometrically, beyond the expectation or control of anyone. A demonstration that would never have happened in the past occurred spontaneously and grew electronically. Eventually, the military, gauging public opinion by the size and fervor of the crowd, switched allegiance and forced Estrada to resign.

Every revolution in history has had leaders, but today, their role is diminished because crowd formation is becoming the most important factor. As Vaclav Havel, the father of Czech freedom, wrote, “Without anybody organizing a demonstration, the passersby had turned into demonstrators who filled the main square in Prague.” Leaders these days are often the captives of events.

We have, in short, entered an age where spontaneous combustion has become the primary motor of revolutionary upheaval. As Mao himself famously noted, “A single spark can start a prairie fire.” No wonder Chinese officials were afraid of the soup-seeking bike riders in central China last year.

NATIONAL PRIDE IS ESSENTIAL TO NATIONAL SECURITY AND COUNTERING CHINA 

China is particularly combustible because the Communist Party has lost both the love and loyalty of large segments of the population, and its ability to inspire and lead is crumbling. It has, therefore, had to resort to short-term measures. “We have been evangelized for decades to think that China is a culture of strategy, that it always adopts the long, patient view,” Blaine Holt, a retired Air Force general and now-China watcher, told me in November. “The Communist Party today is hanging on by a thread and wondering how it will navigate the rest of November rather than the rest of this century. Long-term now means months, not decades.”

The ruling organization is old, and the people are restive. The Communist Party era in China is passing.

House Democrats are weighing up whether to take special measures to force a vote on extending Obamacare subsidies.

They are considering discharge petitions, which allow members to force a bill out of committee and allow a vote, circumventing House leadership, provided they get signatures from the majority of the House (currently 218 votes are needed). 

Democrats are mulling either a bipartisan discharge petition led by Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) and Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) over a similar proposal from Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) to extend the Affordable Care Act‘s enhanced tax credits. Democratic leadership has yet to throw its support behind either measure.

Both discharge petitions seek to extend the Obamacare subsidies, though each bill has a different approach to reforming the program.

House Republican leadership has all but refused to entertain an extension of the tax credits, as conservatives have long been opposed to Obamacare. The leaders said they would put healthcare bills up for a vote next week, but they are expected to be more messaging-based than actual policy changes.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) told the Washington Examiner that leadership is “not in favor” of either petition. But that's not stopping rank-and-file GOP members from pushing their policy priorities.

“You try to do things through the normal course,” Fitzpatrick said. “You try to do things through regular order. All those remedies are exhausted. Then you got to go this route, unfortunately.”

Though a majority of Democratic lawmakers haven't made a decision on whether to sign one or both, as of now, several in the party are leaning much more in favor of Gottheimer and Kiggans's bill. 

The legislation would include a one-year extension of the credits that includes new income caps and guardrails to crack down on fraud. The bill would also require a vote by July 2026 on other policies that would reduce Americans' health insurance premiums, as well as create new rules expediting floor time for the consideration of future “enhanced premium tax credit reform bills.”

Fitzpatrick and Golden's bill would extend the credits to 2027 and seeks to give families more tools to manage their healthcare costs, such as expanding health savings accounts.

A source familiar with both pieces of legislation told the Washington Examiner they are “very similar to the many other efforts” to provide an extension of the COVID-era subsidies. 

The bipartisan group for Golden and Fitzpatrick's bill said they did not seek support from the leadership of either party when bringing this measure forward, with Fitzpatrick telling the Washington Examiner they have still not had conversations with Democratic leadership as of Thursday evening. 

Support from Democratic leadership remains up in the air, and they have not offered guidance to their members on whether to vote for one or the other, per sources. In a caucus meeting earlier this morning, both House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone (D-NJ) had raised concerns that both discharge petitions only extend the subsidies for a short period of time. 

Ways and Means Committee Richard Neal (D-MA) said he does not support either petition so far, noting his staff is still going through details. 

A discharge petition filed by Jeffries would extend the ACA subsidies for three years, similar to the proposal that got voted down in the Senate earlier on Thursday. The petition has received every Democrat's signature, but Republicans are all but assured not to join because the minority leader's proposal does not enact any reforms.

Rep. Brittany Petterson (D-CO) told the Washington Examiner on her way to sign the Kiggans-Gottheimer petition that her concerns about the bill are that the timeline is too short and it needs clarity on details, but she is “grateful people are trying to find a path.”

The leaders of these petitions would ultimately need Democratic leadership's support to get the petition to the 218 required signatures. But neither the Democratic nor the Republican sponsors sought their approval before introducing their petitions. 

“Those conversations can start now,” Golden told reporters, acknowledging the bill doesn't have full support yet. “Yeah, I don't seek permission to act first.”

One House Democrat told the Washington Examiner that the caucus would prefer to see something more permanent so we “don't have a crisis every year.”

“If [Republicans] support the tax credits, they should just make them permanent or extend them three years,” the lawmaker said.” Extending it less than that just looks like political cover for themselves.”

As of Thursday evening, Gottheimer and Kiggans's petition has 35 signatures while Fitzpatrick and Golden's has 18. Both have attracted bipartisan support, although Gottheimer's has been seemingly more widely supported by both parties.

But Fitzpatrick said he and Kiggans introduced two bills and two discharge petitions “intentionally” to give members options.

“I signed hers, she signed mine, I cosponsored hers, she consponsored mine,” he said. “Both are two-party solutions.” 

From a policy standpoint, Democrats may be more likely to gravitate toward Kiggans's and Gottheimer's bill, given that it pushes for higher subsidies and no health savings account options. The party has long argued that HSAs do not actually lower premium costs, given that the accounts can't be used to pay for premiums under current law. Republicans, however, have eyed an expansion or reform to HSAs as a counter to Obamacare to put money in the hands of patients rather than insurance companies.

When asked if he was pushing for his or Kiggans's to be considered for a vote by the speaker, Fitzpatrick said “either or.” He acknowledged that some members might be in favor of one or the other based on the details, but providing two options is their effort to try and “find a home for everybody where their most comfortable parking their positions.”

JOHNSON GIVES 10 OPTIONS TO ADDRESS HEALTHCARE COSTS, NONE OF WHICH INVOLVE OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES

“It's all part of a joint effort. Everyone seems to be, like, keeping score. That's not how we're viewing it,” the Pennsylvania congressman said.

The Pennsylvania congressman said, “We'll see” when asked if Johnson would put a bill extending the subsidies on the floor next week, saying that was a goal of his and his allies. He said there are “further conversations” to be had about a plan, but he didn't want to get ahead of the speaker.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Crystal Wilsey, a cashier at a Cinnabon franchise in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin, said some unforgivable things to a Somali couple who had the temerity to request more caramel on a pecan cinnamon roll. But I don't think she should have been summarily fired.

Wilsey's is just the latest high-profile tale of an American who lost her job on account of a viral video. The racism she's accused of is not debatable. In the TikTok video that circulated last week, Wilsey, a 43-year-old white woman, hurled a racist epithet at her customers and declared, “I am racist, and I'll say it to the whole entire world.” She gestured to her crotch and added: “Suck it!”

According to the Somali couple, before the camera started rolling, Wilsey had called the woman's hijab a “witchcraft bandana.” Wilsey alleges that the couple had been harassing her, but she has not provided any details to substantiate that claim.

When I saw the video, I naturally sympathized with the Somali couple. The slurs came at a time when Somali Americans are being persistently targeted in racist attacks from the right, including by President Donald Trump himself. And yet, as repugnant as Wilsey's behavior was, I couldn't help but consider that she was a single mother whose wages helped feed a child.

Cinnabon was quick to terminate Wilsey's employment and declare that her actions didn't reflect the “values of Cinnabon.” Progressives who abhor racism may applaud this move. But as a socialist, I can't easily take the side of a billion-dollar corporation over that of an ordinary worker. (Cinnabon is owned by the Georgia-based conglomerate GoTo Foods, which also owns Auntie Anne's, Schlotzsky's, and many other brands popular in the South.)

Sure, Wilsey might not be a great fit for a customer-facing position. Her critics online also point to her long rap sheet, which includes charges of child endangerment, disorderly conduct, marijuana possession, and driving while intoxicated. We should nevertheless resist the urge to tell a simple moral story that celebrates someone losing their livelihood. That job at the shopping mall may be the bare minimum she needs to support herself.

Jonathan Chait: The MAGA campaign to suppress dissent—even on the Right

The lack of proper labor protections that allows for workers to lose their job over a single incident can cut in more than one direction. A Starbucks worker in Middletown, Ohio, was fired in September for writing “racists fav drink” on someone's cup after they ordered a Mint Majesty tea with two honeys, reportedly Charlie Kirk's order of choice. NPR documented numerous cases of people—schoolteachers, firefighters, military members—losing their job for sharing negative opinions of Kirk online following his assassination. A health-care employee in Kentucky lost her job in 2023 for using a racial slur in a comment to a Facebook group for a youth football league.

Not everyone is equally vulnerable to being fired on the basis of one-off accusations. In a high-profile 2018 case, Smith College disciplined a janitor for alleged racism toward a Black student, but a formal investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing on the janitor's part. Two years later, the then-editor of British Vogue, Ghanian-born Edward Enninful, complained about being “racially profiled” by a security guard who asked him to enter the building where he worked through the loading bay. The guard was dismissed from the site in the midst of the pandemic and placed under investigation by his employer.

In each of these cases, the workers' actions have carried a different moral valence—some repugnant, some careless, some ambiguous. But in all of them, an employer has presented a moral rationale for withdrawing a worker's livelihood. Workers have too little legal protection against hasty or arbitrary decisions in this regard, and the public has gotten too comfortable responding with schadenfreude.

I am not arguing that all workers should have guaranteed jobs for life. Employees sometimes lose jobs for cause, such as when they fail to do assigned tasks or they endanger either their co-workers or their employer's business. But the impulse to celebrate a worker's firing is one we should check. Employers should be held rigorously to account for their reasons and procedures when they fire workers, even those who are guilty of repugnant acts such as hurling racist abuse or calling a customer “racist” because they ordered Kirk's favorite drink. This is especially true in the United States, which lacks a strong social safety net. Losing a job can be catastrophic. In a better America, firing a worker would require an exhaustive process, including disciplinary action prior to dismissal, and involve representation by workers' bodies. Such a process might still have ended by terminating Wilsey's employment. In this better world, unemployed workers would also have the means to support themselves until they return to the workforce.

Gillian B. White: Is being a white supremacist grounds for firing?

Those of us on the left should be fighting to improve protections for workers of all races, and thereby for the betterment of people's material conditions regardless of their views. Progressives should not write off any segment of the working class as beyond the pale. We should instead sow working-class solidarity as an antidote to the racial divisions the right cynically promotes.

Maybe I'm naive, or an incurable socialist. But I'd like to think that even if a worker is racist to my face, I'll never ask for their dismissal. I'll try instead to appeal to our common interest in improving the conditions of our lives.

How Trump's winning coalition is unraveling in real time.

The second Trump administration started off with a bang: riding the high of 2024's historic levels of new multiracial and working class support, bullying law firms and universities, flinging out executive orders and DOGE restructurings like nobody's business. A Republican-controlled Congress was ready to implement President Donald Trump's agenda, and his deportation and tariff policies were about to roll out.

If you fast-forward to today, however, the vibes are very different.

Whether it concerns his management of the economy or his program of mass deportation, each day seems to bring more evidence that Trump's 2024 coalition is disintegrating. Meanwhile, Trump's biggest supporters in the online influencer space and commentariat are either at war with each other or less than thrilled about him. Voters, for their part, have consistently registered their anger at the GOP, in elections from New Jersey to Tennessee.

It's clear, in other words, that Trump's 2024 coalition is fraying. What is less clear is exactly why. What I found in my reporting, though, suggests that while the ultimate answer may still be beyond our reach, there are three broad theories that have taken hold among pollsters, politicos, and others with a professional focus on this central question in American politics. The three theories are as follows:

While these three explanations are hardly mutually exclusive, a lot hinges on which theory Republicans conclude best explains their recent political struggles — if they acknowledge they have a problem, that is.

If they believe their fortunes are riding on low-propensity voters, for example, they may be more likely to try different media or campaign messaging, pull back on tariffs, or try to appeal to more college-educated voters to right the ship. If they believe in the new entrant theory, on the other hand, it's possible they might try to wade into the online debates over the future of the right, or try to moderate some social positions instead. Democratic strategists will, of course, be drawing their own conclusions, too. And the answers both parties reach could have a major influence on US politics in the years to come.

Patrick Ruffini, a founding partner at the research firm Echelon Insights, is a longtime Republican Party pollster and strategist, as well as the author of Party of the People, a 2023 book that, I admit, was remarkably prescient about what would happen in the 2024 election.

As much as there are worrying signs for Republicans, I found one statistic about affordability voters that really jumped out to me, and should be worrying Democrats. Democrats are lagging tremendously in winning over support of white affordability voters: While 77 percent of nonwhite affordability voters disapprove of Trump and 73 percent prefer Democrats, 48 percent of these white voters disapprove but only 40 percent prefer Democrats.

That big gap suggests white, moderate, and conservative affordability voters aren't sold on Democrats yet.

More recently, however, Ruffini has been criticizing the narrative that there is a MAGA crack-up happening at all, arguing that much of the recent intra-GOP squabbling (between Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene, for example) is an elite fixation: “The media and influencer discourse can be pretty disconnected from the voter reality,” he said on a recent New York Times podcast. “If MAGA were really cracking up, you'd see it in the polls. In our polling, Trump has been above or near a 95 percent approval rating among supporters since he took office in January.”

Instead, Ruffini argues, the drop in Trump's support is being fueled by independent, low-propensity voters who voted for Trump in 2024 but, generally, are less connected to politics, younger, and more racially diverse. These people, Ruffini argues, aren't keeping track of the news, don't care for most of the big “scandals” of the era, and are only ambiently hearing or feeling the effects of the Trump administration.

This “low-propensity theory of everything” as Ruffini calls it, explains why Trump's approval has shifted so much: As swing independents, so swings the top-line number. This is why young voters have been swinging back and forth so much over the last few years: Because they don't have strong partisan ties, their politics are still forming and changing, and they just don't seem to care that much about what's happening around them. You can therefore imagine a whole segment of the electorate, beyond just young voters, who don't really have a strong allegiance to one party or another, feeling dissatisfied and annoyed at the status quo, and thus swinging away from the incumbent party.

“People were so shocked at young voters swinging to the right and then swinging to the left again,” Lakshya Jain, the elections analyst and head of data at The Argument, told Vox. “But this is a group that is extremely disengaged in politics and has the lowest income relative to other groups in society. Obviously, the economy being bad means they're going to get pushed away.”

These “low-propensity” and low information voters used to vote for Democrats at higher rates, but have begun to occupy a bigger subset of the Trump electorate, meaning any swings are probably going to look bigger than before.

But as Jain points out, these swingy voters aren't swinging over nothing. It's all about the economy. And that's where a second theory, which Jain argues for, is helpful to layer on top: that Trump is specifically losing the most support among a cohort of 2024 voters who prioritized affordability above everything else.

Some of the split in the Trump coalition potentially transcends partisanship, likeliness of voting, or news engagement.

In polling that Jain conducted for The Argument, he found that Democrats are gaining, and Trump is losing, specifically among nonwhite voters, voters under the age of 45, and among non-college educated voters. This makes the potential blue wave of 2026 look like the inverse of the 2018 blue wave, where Democrats made huge gains with white, older, and college-educated voters.

Underlying these shifts is one thing: affordability. A full 60 percent of respondents in the latest Argument poll rank cost of living as one their top two most important issues. “Nothing else even came close,” Jain says. “What's more, it's clear voters absolutely detest the way Trump is handling it.”

By his estimate, these “cost-of-living as a top-2 issue” voters have swung from supporting Trump by a six-point margin last year to disapproving of him by a 13 point-margin, a bigger swing than any other kind of voter.

Poll after poll shows this: Republicans themselves are increasingly dissatisfied with the state of the economy, and are torn over how much to blame Trump for this. Some of the split in the Trump coalition, therefore, potentially transcends partisanship, likeliness of voting, or news engagement. Voters who are paying attention to current events are paying attention to the state of the economy, and report overwhelmingly negative feelings over rising costs of groceries, housing, utilities, and health care.

This also explains the large swings among Latino and young voters we've seen over the last few months: Many of these voters opted for voting for Trump at higher rates last year as one-off, trusting him to actually improve their economic conditions. This doesn't seem to be happening, and they are paying attention, so they're swinging toward Democrats.

“In 2024, Trump had promised a group of disillusioned young people that he would continue to tear everything down, but he isn't rebuilding in a way that's improving their quality of life,” Rachel Janfaza, a writer and analyst focused on Gen Z, told Vox. “We know that the top issues for young people are affordability, housing, and economic concerns. They're very stressed about AI, they're being told it's coming for their life, their jobs, their futures. And yet they aren't seeing him talk about it. Instead, he's calling affordability a con job.”

Janfaza doesn't fully agree with Ruffini and Jain's description of “low-propensity” voters: “The young people I speak to are very well aware of what's happening. They don't mince words. They're very nuanced on the topics. They're disappointed, they're frustrated.”

But she does buy the description of these voters as being particularly swingy over the economy. She also noted that this might mean that they run to the Democratic Party and turn out for Democrats next year, but cautioned that this shouldn't be taken as evidence that they have returned to the progressive and liberal bona fides of previous cohorts of young voters.

The third theory comes from the conservative Manhattan Institute's recent study of the Republican electorate.

The 2024 coalition is not a durable, lasting one — much like Democrats discovered after the Obama era, segments of it can, and are, shifting.

They divide up the Trump coalition into two parts: Two-thirds belong to the “Core Republican” identity — these are consistently conservative Republican voters who embrace the traditional tenets of MAGA and conservative politics. Then there's the idiosyncratic mix of “New Entrants” — about 30 percent of the coalition — which holds political opinions that clash with the MAGA-fied majority of GOP voters.

“They are younger, more racially diverse, and more likely to have voted for Democratic candidates in the recent past,” Jesse Arm, the author of the Manhattan Institute study, writes.

Arm notes that these “New Entrants” are less conservative than “core” Republicans on just about every policy issue: backing abortion rights, a more pro-immigrant policy agenda, and more progressive social views. A majority do not support Trump's tariffs. They are also more open to believing conspiracy theories, especially those concerning Israel and Jewish people, and more willing to justify political violence. They are more likely to have voted for a Democratic candidate before, and have lower approval ratings for Republican figures than the “core” group.

“They're disgruntled Obama-to-Trump or Biden-to-Trump voters whose politics are all over the map,” Arm says. “The racist in your X mentions who thinks the moon landing was faked and that George Bush arranged 9/11 is just as likely to want higher taxes and abortion-on-demand as he is to support eradicating DEI bureaucracies or doing anything to rein in the welfare state.”

Crucially, there are overlaps between this category and the last two: These are also voters who are probably less informed or engaged in politics, who cared about affordability, who are younger, who are more likely to be Black or Latino, and who are new Republican voters. And crucially for the future of our politics, this segment of voters is much less likely to vote for another Republican candidate in the future, per Arm. The survey finds that while 70 percent of Core Republicans would “definitely” vote for a GOP candidate in 2026, only 56 percent of the New Entrants would.

But taken together, this shows the stakes of Trump and his party holding together a winning coalition. The 2024 coalition is not a durable, lasting one — much like Democrats discovered after the Obama era, segments of it can, and are, shifting. And actions that Republicans take, whether in substance or in message, to try to win back or hold support from any one of these types of voters could endanger their support from the other two types. That's assuming, of course, that low-propensity voters don't simply disengage from politics completely.

Of course, first Trump has to admit that voter discontent is real, and probably not give himself an A++++ rating for his stewardship of the economy. That might be the first obstacle GOP strategists must overcome as they attempt to chart their party's future.

Both parties have turned their backs on traditional economic advice. Is the country paying the price?

The US's two major parties can agree on one thing: They don't have much use for economists anymore.

President Joe Biden ignored economists' warnings about the risks of inflation. President Donald Trump dismissed economists' arguments against his tariffs. And now, rising Democrats are backing price controls, even though mainstream economists aligned with both parties say they typically backfire.

Economists' way of thinking has fallen out of favor among the political class more broadly. The right has embraced Trump's zero-sum worldview and lost faith in expertise generally. Many progressives have rejected economists' fundamental focus on trade-offs and the unintended consequences of policy interventions. Both sides are down on the free market.

All this marks a major change from many previous decades of US policymaking, in which economists were viewed as having a special sort of status among experts. Believed to epitomize intelligence and technocratic competence, their recommendations were viewed as more high-minded than those from ideologues or grubby interest groups.

Economists were the gurus of growth — and while, of course, they weren't always listened to, it was widely believed that a president who wanted a strong economy should take their counsel seriously.

Not so much anymore. Economists, Ezra Klein has written, were “simply far less influential” in the Biden administration, which turned instead to elite lawyers, activists, and the nonprofit world for expertise. And Trump isn't particularly interested in economists' recommendations — he has his own vision of how the economy works, and trusts it more than theirs.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

The reasons economists fell off their lofty perch are in part personal: Neither Trump nor Biden enjoys highfalutin academic debates (in contrast to Obama and Clinton, who did). They're in part coalitional: The free market GOP establishment was roiled by Trump's rise, while Democrats accommodated a rising progressive faction who blamed neoliberalism for the disappointments of the Clinton and Obama presidencies. And the reasons may also be partly structural, connected to bigger-picture changes in the economy, politics, or the information environment.

“I tie it to the rise of populism on both the left and the right,” Greg Mankiw, a Harvard economist who advised George W. Bush's administration, told me. “Both have a degree of skepticism toward traditional economic viewpoints from both the center-right and center-left.”

“There are certain commonalities between Biden and Trump, in their rejection of a technocratic approach that thinks seriously about tradeoffs,” said Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who advised the Clinton and Obama administrations. “I often find myself in despair about the direction.”

It isn't surprising that economists would bemoan their own loss of influence. But the question remains: Can a political system that sidelines economists deliver a prosperous, growing economy?

So far, the results have not been promising. The public's economic confidence turned sharply negative under Biden, as inflation wrecked his presidency and sunk his party's 2024 chances. It's remained quite negative after Trump's return, turning what was his greatest political strength into his greatest weakness.

There's another problem. Even if you think mainstream economists have gotten a lot wrong in recent decades, their basic toolkit — modeling that assesses incentives and market behavior — is highly useful if you want to design policies that will actually work. Sidelining economic analysis, in practice, means we'll get more badly designed policies pleasing ideologues and interest groups — policies that will do little to help the American people or deliver the growth the country needs.

Economists' influence pervaded the policymaking world for much of the 20th century and into the beginning of the 21st.

The dominant economic thinking varied, depending on the problems of the time and the party in power — from laissez-faire conservatives advocating noninterference with markets to Keynesian interventionists to the neoliberals who wanted to roll back certain interventiosn. But across administrations, economists were useful to politicians when they seemed to have expertise that could help fix the country's problems.

In the neoliberal era, especially, economists' stature soared. Their advice for escaping the economic woes of the late 1970s — raise interest rates to cut inflation, then get government out of the way and let markets go to work — appeared, amid an economy that boomed for much of the 1980s and '90s, to have been proven out.

Though economists aligned with the two parties disagreed on many things, they shared an analytical toolkit and many core ideas: support for free trade, skepticism of unions, a belief that government intervention in markets often backfires, a concern that social programs distort incentives, a dread of running large deficits, and a fear inflation might return. This was the neoliberal consensus.

We shouldn't exaggerate how much sway economists had back then — politicians often rejected their advice, and individual economists couldn't depart too much from their party line if they wanted to keep their seats at the table.

Still, they mattered. The Federal Reserve, chaired by elite economists like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, became a de facto fourth branch of government, and won glowing media coverage; presidential interference in their workings was deemed unacceptable.

In Congress, modeling from the Congressional Budget Office was deemed hugely important in estimating the economic impact of new bills. “CBO is God around here, because policy lives and dies by CBO's word,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said in 2006.

And across many different issues — education, health care, environmental regulation — economists' wonky analysis and modeling became central to policy debates, inside and outside the executive branch.

The Great Recession is often said to have ended this era, shattering confidence in economists and neoliberalism. But in practice, the Obama administration kept neoliberal wonkery alive and well. Obama thought it was important to hear out those he deemed to be the smartest economists, like Larry Summers. Meanwhile, the Romney-Ryan GOP of 2012 zealously defended free market economics. The true rupture came after that — under Presidents Trump and Biden.

For the GOP, the reason is simple enough: Trump. He carried out an outsider takeover of the party and the free-market-loving establishment. While Trump is sensitive to market reaction and relies to some extent on the advice of financiers, he is largely uninterested in the counsel of economists, unless, of course, they tell him what he wants to hear.

Trump came to office with his own intuitions and beliefs about how the economy actually works, shaped by his career in business and real estate. His worldview is fundamentally zero-sum. He rejects economists' idea that more immigration and freer trade can grow the “pie” — the size of the economy — overall. Instead, he obsessively views the world in terms of who is winning or losing: who is getting the biggest slice. Furthermore, his desire to amass personal power clashes with economists' skepticism, particularly within his own party, of government intervention and belief that markets tend to know best.

For the sake of his trade war, Trump often urges voters to simply make do with less, saying: Your kids don't really need so many dolls, do they?

Immigration was likely more important than economics in powering Trump's initial rise among GOP voters. But once he did rise, it became clear those voters didn't actually care so much about conservative elites' free market consensus. By maintaining those voters' loyalty, Trump has dominated the party for a decade, and the old economically conservative institutions have either dwindled in relevance or adapted to better fit his worldview.

The breakup went both ways, as much of the party's old economics establishment was — like many other college-educated professionals — repulsed by Trump on personal and policy grounds. “Even though I'm supposed to be associated with the right, I view myself as closer to [Democrat] Jason Furman than Donald Trump,” Mankiw told me.

And while mainstream economists had much to dislike about Trump's first term, his second term has horrified them even more.

For one, there's his tariff agenda. Economists think tariffs are, fundamentally, taxes that make things more expensive and suppress economic activity — and that while there are certain situations where they could be useful, Trump's broad (and erratic) use of them makes little sense, will hurt growth, and will make many things more expensive for American consumers.

Trump's attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve — the citadel of economists' influence — have also been shocking. Trump is frustrated that Fed chair Jerome Powell won't lower interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who comes from the world of finance, has made another complaint: “All these PhDs over there, I don't know what they do,” he said in July. “This is like universal basic income for academic economists.”

Finally, this administration has purchased stakes in major companies and often pressured businesses in ways that look quite corrupt, raising economists' fears of “crony capitalism.”

So far, the public has hated the results — Trump's polling on the economy has been dismal this year, as voters remain irate about high prices. Rather than put forward a pro-growth agenda, though, Trump has insisted that the tariffs will continue until morale improves. For the sake of his trade war, he often urges voters to simply make do with less, saying: Your kids don't really need so many dolls, do they?

Democrats didn't have an outsider populist takeover of the party that chucked out their old elites. Rather, their own party elites fell out of love with economists — because they concluded that the economists' consensus had failed both substantively and politically, and arguably brought Trump to power in the first place.

According to many leftists and progressives, the failures were obvious. Unfettered free trade had despoiled the heartland. Inequality got out of control as the ultra-rich amassed more of the gains from growth and big corporations exercised more and more power over American life. Millions of Americans faced foreclosures and unemployment, while the crooked bankers who got us in the mess got off scot free. The rot of neoliberalism had been building for years, the Great Recession finally exposed it for all to see — and it was the economists (specifically, a particular clique of well-connected elite economists) who led us there.

Critiques like these gained steam among progressive activists and thinkers in the late Obama years. When the enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders's campaigns seemed to show there was populist energy behind this critique, Democratic elites tried to accommodate it. Still, we shouldn't be so quick to conclude that the general public thought the economy of the late 2010s was a hellscape. Indeed, just before the beginning of the pandemic, Gallup's Economic Confidence index hit a 20-year high, even though most of the problems above persisted.

Economists have been skeptical of the claim that economists screwed up everything. But some — for instance, Berkeley economist Brad DeLong — have argued that Obama's team did screw up one big thing: the recovery from the Great Recession. Per this argument, policymakers were too worried about the nonexistent problem of inflation and deficits, failed to stimulate the economy sufficiently, and the resulting unsatisfactory recovery left voters unhappy. (But it's questionable whether voter anger at Obama spurred Trump's win specifically; Obama was quite popular in 2016.)

Other changes may have played a role. The internet and social media were part of a broader decline in gatekeeping that meant economists' knowledge was no longer exclusive. A smart person online can now obtain data and crunch numbers on their own. Furman told me that, during the Clinton administration, staff economists reviewed new economic research papers and brought some to the communications team; under Obama, it was just as likely that the comms team “would see someone tweeting a paper and come to us about it.”

With the rise of social media came a leftward shift in how Democrats thought about a host of issues. In the age of virality, analyses offering moral clarity and obvious villains tended to win out. Progressives increasingly tended to scoff at the warnings and concerns of economists, believing they were too disposed to excuse an unjust status quo.

A new counter-establishment that relied far more on elite lawyers and the nonprofit world was formed and became highly influential in the Biden administration. There were, of course, economists among Biden's appointees, such as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen — but in practice, she was somewhat marginalized. Policy was often driven by White House advisers and independent agency chiefs, some of whom were bold progressives and some of whom were focused on national security or politics.

Biden himself was uninterested in academic policy debates, particularly on economics. A former Biden administration official told me last year that it was “very, very rare” for Biden to be sent a decision memo asking him to choose between different courses of action; the norm was for advisers to reach consensus and send up a “joint recommendation memo” for his signature.

As Biden was taking office, he had planned on a $1.3 trillion stimulus, but this was increased to almost $2 trillion — reportedly because Senate Democrats' policy wish list added up that high. Economists like Summers and Furman, now on the outside, warned that that was far too big and risked spiking inflation. But they were ignored, as Democrats sought to avoid what they viewed as Obama's mistake of doing too little stimulus.

At this point, mainstream economists were viewed as the boys who cried wolf on inflation, but this time, the wolf was coming. (To be clear, inflation was primarily brought about by global circumstances and not Biden's stimulus, but his administration was slow to recognize just how serious the problem would be, and made it somewhat worse.)

Other important policies also seemed to be set without much regard to economic thinking or analysis. Democrats' childcare proposal — at one point, a key part of Biden's legislative agenda — had deep design problems that only got attention after the commentator Matt Bruenig made some basic economics-informed critiques. On climate policy, Furman said, the Biden team “really ignored the economists who had the modeling capability to tell them how to maximize emissions reduction per dollar spent.” Advocates pushed border policies that paid little heed to the incentives they were giving people to come.

To voters, the purported neoliberal hellscape of the 2010s pales in comparison to the post-neoliberal hellscape of the 2020s. Polls show Americans have positively loathed the state of the economy for the past four years.

But this has not spurred either party to re-embrace economists with open arms. And in part, that's because economists aren't really sure about how to solve the US economy's 2025 problems — or aren't sure what the problems even are.

Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, speculated that we might be entering a period of “modest stagflation,” in which inflation and unemployment increase simultaneously. In that situation, he told me, “there is no economic consensus about what to do.” Lowering interest rates could worsen inflation, and raising them could cause a recession. “You're damned if you do, damned if you don't.”

Economist Brad DeLong of Berkeley told me that he thought Biden's economic record was actually rather good in a very difficult situation, since it avoided a prolonged recession or a slow recovery, and inflation was generally countered with wage growth. “The problem is that voters really do not agree,” he said. “The pollsters tell me people would be happier if unemployment had been higher and real incomes had been lower. They're feeling betrayed by the price level. So we scratch our heads and say, ‘Is money illusion a real source of utility?'”

There is, however, some economist consensus about what not to do about high prices — namely, price controls, which economists typically feel will have counterproductive or undesirable consequences. Many would prefer something more akin to the “abundance agenda,” which is focused on increasing the supply of housing, clean energy, and other things the economy needs, often by trying to reduce procedural or legal roadblocks.

Abundance has won a dedicated following among center-left wonks and certain politicians, but so far, it has been less potent as an electoral message than price controls and promises for cheaper stuff — promises that may be impossible to fulfill. “People want the price level to go back to what it used to be, which is not possible without a massive recession which would not be desirable,” Furman said.

Economists are useful to political elites when it's believed they know how to solve major problems of the day.

﻿It's been a long road to ensure that testing on human subjects is ethical. AI could send us backward.

If you're a human, there's a very good chance you've been involved in human subjects research.

Maybe you've participated in a clinical trial, completed a survey about your health habits, or took part in a graduate student's experiment for $20 when you were in college. Or maybe you've conducted research yourself as a student or professional.

As the name suggests, human subjects research (HSR) is research on human subjects. Federal regulations define it as research involving a living person that requires interacting with them to obtain information or biological samples. It also encompasses research that “obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates” private information or biospecimens that could be used to identify the subject. It falls into two major buckets: social-behavioral-educational and biomedical.

If you want to conduct human subjects research, you have to seek Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. IRBs are research ethics committees designed to protect human subjects, and any institution conducting federally funded research must have them.

We didn't always have protection for human subjects in research. The 20th century was rife with horrific research abuses. Public backlash to the declassification of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study in 1972, in part, led to the publication of the Belmont Report in 1979, which established a few ethical principles to govern HSR: respect for people's autonomy, minimizing potential harms and maximizing benefits, and distributing the risks and rewards of the research fairly. This became the foundation for the federal policy for human subjects protection, known as the Common Rule, which regulates IRBs.

It's not 1979 anymore. And now AI is changing the way people conduct research on humans, but our ethical and regulatory frameworks have not kept up.

Tamiko Eto, a certified IRB professional (CIP) and expert in the field of HSR protection and AI governance, is working to change that. Eto founded TechInHSR, a consultancy that supports IRBs reviewing research involving AI. I recently spoke with Eto about how AI has changed the game and the biggest benefits — and greatest risks — of using AI in HSR. Our conversation below has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

You have over two decades of experience in human subjects research protection. How has the widespread adoption of AI changed the field?

AI has actually flipped the old research model on its head entirely. We used to study individual people to learn something about the general population. But now AI is pulling huge patterns from population-level data and using that to make decisions about an individual. That shift is exposing the gaps that we have in our IRB world, because what drives a lot of what we do is called the Belmont Report.

That was written almost half a century ago, and that was not really thinking about what I would term “human data subjects.” It was thinking about actual physical beings and not necessarily their data. AI is more about human data subjects; it's their information that's getting pulled into these AI systems, often without their knowledge. And so now what we have is this world where massive amounts of personal data are collected and reused over and over by multiple companies, often without consent and almost always without proper oversight.

Could you give me an example of human subjects research that heavily involves AI?

In areas like social-behavioral-education research, we're going to see things where people are training on student-level data to identify ways to improve or enhance teaching or learning.

In health care, we use medical records to train models to identify possible ways that we can predict certain diseases or conditions. The way we understand identifiable data and re-identifiable data has also changed with AI.

So right now, people can use that data without any oversight, claiming it's de-identified because of our old, outdated definitions of identifiability.

Where are those definitions from?

Health care definitions are based on HIPAA.

The law wasn't shaped around the way that we look at data now, especially in the world of AI. Essentially it's saying that if you remove certain parts of that data, then that individual might not reasonably be re-identified — which we know now is not true.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

What's something that AI can improve in the research process — most people aren't necessarily familiar with why IRB protections exist. What's the argument for using AI?

So AI does have real potential in improving health care, patient care and research in general — if we build it responsibly. We do know that when built responsibly, these well-designed tools can actually help catch problems earlier, like detecting sepsis or spotting signs of certain cancers with imaging and diagnostics because we're able to compare that outcome to what expert clinicians would do.

Though I'm seeing in my field that not a lot of these tools are designed well and nor is the plan for their continued use really thought through. And that does cause harm.

I've been focusing on how we leverage AI to improve our operations: AI is helping us handle large amounts of data and reduce repetitive tasks that make us less productive and less efficient. So it does have some capabilities to help us in our workflows so long as we use it responsibly.

It can speed up the actual process of research in terms of submitting an [IRB] application for us. IRB members can use it to review and analyze certain levels of risk and red flags and guide how we communicate with the research team. AI has shown to have a lot of potential but again it entirely depends on if we build it and use it responsibly.

What do you see as the greatest near-term risks posed by using AI in human subjects research?

The immediate risks are things that we know already: Like these black box decisions where we don't actually know how the AI is making these conclusions, so that is going to make it very difficult for us to make informed decisions on how it's used.

Even if AI improved in terms of being able to understand it a little bit more, the issue that we're facing now is the ethical process of collecting that data in the first place. Did we have authorization? Do we have permission? Is it rightfully ours to take and even commodify?

So I think that leads into the other risk, which is privacy. Other countries may be a little bit better at it than we are, but here in the US, we don't have a lot of privacy rights or self data ownership. We're not able to say if our data gets collected, how it gets collected, and how it's going to be used and then who it's going to be shared with — that essentially is not a right that US citizens have right now.

Everything is identifiable, so that increases the risk that it poses to the people whose data we use, making it essentially not safe. There's studies out there that say that we can reidentify somebody just by their MRI scan even though we don't have a face, we don't have names, we don't have anything else, but we can reidentify them through certain patterns. We can identify people through their step counts on their Fitbits or Apple Watches depending on their locations.

I think maybe the biggest thing that's coming up these days is what's called a digital twin. It's basically a detailed digital version of you built from your data. So that could be a lot of information that's grabbed about you from different sources like your medical records and biometric data that may be out there. Social media, movement patterns if they're capturing it from your Apple Watch, online behavior from your chats, LinkedIn, voice samples, writing styles. The AI system then gathers all your behavioral data and then creates a model that is duplicative of you so that it can do some really good things. It can predict what you'll do in terms of responding to medications.

But it can also do some bad things. It can mimic your voice or it can do things without your permission. There is this digital twin out there that you did not authorize to have created. It's technically you, but you have no right to your digital twin. That's something that's not been addressed in the privacy world as well as it should be, because it's going under the guise of “if we're using it to help improve health, then it's justified use.”

What about some of the long-term risks?

We don't really have a lot we can do now. IRBs are technically prohibited from considering long-term impact or societal risks. We're only thinking about that individual and the impact on that individual. But in the world of AI, the harms that matter the most are going to be discrimination, inequity, the misuse of data, and all of that stuff that happens at a societal scale.

“If I was a clinician and I knew that I was liable for any of the mistakes that were made by the AI, I wouldn't embrace it because I wouldn't want to be liable if it made that mistake.”

Then I think the other risk we were talking about is the quality of the data. The IRB has to follow this principle of justice, which means that the research benefits and harm should be equally distributed across the population. But what's happening is that these usually marginalized groups end up having their data used to train these tools, usually without consent, and then they disproportionately suffer when the tools are inaccurate and biased against them.

So they're not getting any of the benefits of the tools that get refined and actually put out there, but they're responsible for the costs of it all.

Could someone who was a bad actor take this data and use it to potentially target people?

Absolutely. We don't have adequate privacy laws, so it's largely unregulated and it gets shared with people who can be bad actors or even sell it to bad actors, and that could harm people.

How can IRB professionals become more AI literate?

One thing that we have to realize is that AI literacy is not just about understanding technology. I don't think just understanding how it works is going to make us literate so much as knowing what questions we need to ask.

I have some work out there as well with this three-stage framework for IRB review of AI research that I created. It was to help IRBs better assess what risks happen at certain development time points and then understand that it's cyclical and not linear. It's a different way for IRBs to look at research phases and evaluate that. So building that kind of understanding, we can review cyclical projects so long as we slightly shift what we're used to doing.

As AI hallucination rates decrease and privacy concerns are addressed, do you think more people will embrace AI in human subjects research? 

There's this concept of automation bias, where we have this tendency to just trust the output of a computer. It doesn't have to be AI, but we tend to trust any computational tool and not really second guess it. And now with AI, because we have developed these relationships with these technologies, we still trust it.

And then also we're fast-paced. We want to get through things quickly and we want to do something quickly, especially in the clinic. Clinicians don't have a lot of time and so they're not going to have time to double-check if the AI output was correct.

I think it's the same for an IRB person. If I was pressured by my boss saying “you have to get X amount done every day,” and if AI makes that faster and my job's on the line, then it's more likely that I'm going to feel that pressure to just accept the output and not double-check it.

And ideally the rate of hallucinations is going to go down, right?

What do we mean when we say AI improves? In my mind, an AI model only becomes less biased or less hallucinatory when it gets more data from groups that it previously ignored or it wasn't normally trained on. So we need to get more data to make it perform better.

So if companies are like, “Okay, let's just get more data,” then that means that more than likely they're going to get this data without consent. It's just going to scrape it from places where people never expected — which they never agreed to.

I don't think that that's progress. I don't think that's saying the AI improved, it's just further exploitation. Improvement requires this ethical data sourcing permission that has to benefit everybody and has limits on how our data is collected and used. I think that that's going to come with laws, regulations and transparency but more than that, I think this is going to come from clinicians.

Companies who are creating these tools are lobbying so that if anything goes wrong, they're not going to be accountable or liable. They're going to put all of the liability onto the end user, meaning the clinician or the patient.

If I was a clinician and I knew that I was liable for any of the mistakes that were made by the AI, I wouldn't embrace it because I wouldn't want to be liable if it made that mistake. I would always be a little bit cautious about that.

Walk me through the worst-case scenario. How can we avoid that?

I think it all starts in the research phase. The worst case scenario for AI is that it shapes the decisions that are made about our personal lives: Our jobs, our health care, if we get a loan, if we get a house. Right now, everything has been built based on biased data and largely with no oversight.

The IRBs are there for primarily federally funded research. But because this AI research is done with unconsented human data, IRBs usually just give waivers or it doesn't even go through an IRB. It's going to slip past all these protections that we would normally have built in for human subjects.

At the same time, people are going to be trusting these systems so much they're just going to stop questioning its output. We're relying on tools that we don't fully understand. We're just further embedding these inequities into our everyday systems starting in that research phase. And people trust research for the most part. They're not going to question the tools that come out of it and end up getting deployed into real-world environments. It's just consistently feeding into continued inequity, injustice, and discrimination and that's going to harm underrepresented populations and whoever's data wasn't the majority at the time of those developments.

﻿Why are we letting the meat industry ruin one of modern medicine's greatest miracles?

Around a decade ago, the US implemented new rules to limit the widespread use of antibiotics in meat and dairy production, in an effort to combat the nation's antibiotic resistance crisis. The regulations helped: Antibiotic sales for use on farms plunged by 43 percent from 2015 to 2017, and plateaued thereafter.

But now, that progress appears to be backsliding. According to recently published data from the Food and Drug Administration, sales of antibiotics for use in livestock surged by an alarming 15.8 percent in 2024 from the previous year.

The sudden increase worries the scientists I spoke with who track the issue.

“It's disappointing to see such a substantial increase,” Meghan Davis, a veterinarian and associate professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told me over email. “Antimicrobial use in food-producing animals matters for human health.”

Antibiotics are a bedrock of modern medicine, used to treat common bacterial infections from strep throat to urinary tract infections to E.coli, and they're a major reason why common infections are generally no longer extremely dangerous in the modern world. According to one estimate, antibiotics have increased average human life expectancy by over 20 years since the early 20th century.

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

But in the US and around the globe, most antibiotics aren't used in human medicine, and instead are fed to farmed animals as a means to prevent and treat illness in unhygienic, overcrowded factory farms where disease is prevalent and spreads quickly.

The meat industry's dependence on antibiotics has, in turn, contributed to the rise of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotic treatment. When someone becomes infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, also known as “superbugs,” certain antibiotics are less effective — or entirely ineffective — making common infections harder to treat.

The World Health Organization considers antimicrobial resistance to be “one of the top global public health and development threats.” In 2019, it was responsible for an estimated 1.27 million deaths globally, with 35,000 of them in the US — and 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur in the US each year.

For a time, the US demonstrated it could make progress on the antibiotic resistance problem. Ten years ago, the livestock industry was even voluntarily pledging to reduce antibiotic use. But now that all appears to have been lip service — and regulators are doing little to rein in the industry's overuse.

There are only two legitimate reasons why livestock producers might have ramped up their antibiotic purchases in 2024: either they raised a lot more animals or they had to fight off a lot more diseases than usual.

But neither explanation makes sense for 2024. Meat production grew by just 0.65 percent last year, and according to several experts I spoke with, there weren't especially notable disease outbreaks that would explain the sharp increase.

A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services told me that “animal sectors experienced several health challenges in 2024,” pointing to the spread of the avian metapneumovirus in poultry birds and avian influenza, or bird flu, in poultry birds and dairy cattle. But Gail Hansen, an antimicrobial expert and former state public health veterinarian in Kansas, told me that these are viral infections, not bacterial, so using antibiotics to treat them does not make sense.

A spokesperson for the National Chicken Council said over email that the increase in antibiotic use on chicken farms is likely due to treating secondary infections from avian metapneumovirus, though that doesn't explain the overall increase of antibiotic sales in the meat industry, because the chicken sector uses a small share.

Hansen's guess as to what's going on: Meat producers are “not being good stewards of antibiotics,” she said, and are likely using them to prevent, rather than treat, disease. It's a “crazy concept,” she said, but it's common practice in the meat industry.

Hansen's not alone in her frustration; public health experts have long argued that feeding antibiotics to healthy animals as a way to prevent disease — as opposed to treating animals when they're actually sick — is a dangerous misuse of the drugs because it increases the chance that bacteria on farms develop resistance, which then makes them less effective when treating humans.

Over email, the chief science officer of the National Milk Producers Federation, Jamie Jonker, said he can't comment on the increase in antibiotics in cattle production because the FDA does not separate antibiotic sales for beef vs. dairy cattle, and that “the majority of antibiotic use in dairy is for intramammary infections, i.e. mastitis, and the use of antibiotics that treat those conditions declined 11.5% from 2023 to 2024.”

The National Cattlemen's Beef Association, meanwhile, said in a statement that decisions about antibiotic use “are made by individual farmers and ranchers in consultation with their veterinarians. Because of those unique factors, we can't generalize across the entire industry.”

The National Pork Producers Council did not respond to a request for comment.

US meat and dairy producers don't actually need to use tons of antibiotics to manage disease spread. Europe is proof: As of a few years ago, antibiotic use per animal there was about half that of the US. European producers have managed to slash their reliance on antibiotics by using other, more responsible means to prevent disease, including more frequently and thoroughly cleaning barns, increasing ventilation, giving animals more space, and using more vaccines.

In the US, antibiotics are heavily used as a shortcut to avoid these costs and additional labor. “It is cheaper to compensate for unhealthy conditions with antibiotics than to raise animals under healthy conditions,” Steven Roach of the nonprofit Food Animal Concerns Trust told me over email.

Over the last 15 years, as public attention to the harms of antibiotic resistance grew, dozens of large US livestock companies, fast food chains, and supermarkets pledged to cut back on antibiotic use in farmed animals. But that attention has since faded, and the food industry has failed to decrease antibiotic use since 2017. There's even evidence that they may be deceiving the public on the issue.

Last year, the US Department of Agriculture sent letters to dozens of beef producers — including some of the world's largest, like JBS, Tyson, and Cargill — warning that the beef they were marketing as “antiobiotic-free,” “raised without antibiotics,” or bearing similar claims, contained traces of antibiotics. Twenty percent of beef samples tested by the agency were positive for antibiotic residues.

“This strongly suggests that the US antibiotic-free beef supply is deeply contaminated and deeply deceptive to American consumers,” Andrew deCoriolis, the executive director of the nonprofit Farm Forward, told Sentient earlier this year.

Hansen and other experts I spoke with want to see the FDA take more action to restrict unnecessary use, including setting concrete goals for national reductions in antibiotic use on farms, barring meat producers from using antibiotics preventively (something Europe did in 2022), and set more limits on the maximum duration of antibiotic use.

Without these basic steps, the FDA is essentially gambling the future effectiveness of these miracle drugs to let the meat and dairy industries marginally increase their profits.

Lululemon knows it's got a store layout problem, and it's rolling out a fix.

During a Thursday earnings call, company executives announced plans to enhance the athleisure giant's in-store experience by reducing clutter and curating pieces better.

""We plan to reduce the density of our assortment on a local basis to better highlight styles that are most relevant,"" Meghan Frank, Lululemon's finance chief, said.

""This will enable improved visual merchandising for the styles we know are most important to the guest in each local market,"" she added.

CEO Calvin McDonald added that the company was testing the new store experience in Los Angeles and Miami, working on ""curating the stores, desorting, taking product out, so that we could put focus on the newness.""

Representatives for Lululemon did not respond to a query from Business Insider regarding when the changes will be implemented across all stores.

The plan to improve store experience comes after analysts have criticized it for months.

Jefferies analysts said in a November note that Lululemon's store layout ""appeared disjointed, with an inconsistent color palette and lack of design cohesion.""

In an October note, they said the collection was ""fragmented"" and featured many ""logo-heavy designs"" that are not resonating with its core audience. An August note said that store inventory was ""very high"" as the brand tried to clear aged stock.

A July Jefferies note, analysts said some of the stores they visited were missing critical stock, like the brand's yoga leggings without front seams.

Lululemon reported a third-quarter revenue of $2.6 billion, a 7% increase from the same period last year. Its net revenue in the Americas decreased 2%, while its international sales increased 33%, buoyed by strong sales in China.

McDonald announced in the call that he would be stepping down at the end of January. Frank, as well as the CCO, André Maestrini, will serve as interim co-CEOs until the company finds a replacement for McDonald.

Its stock rose more than 10% in after-hours trading on Thursday after earnings and the announcement of McDonald's resignation. However, it's down about 50% since the start of the year.

Uber is preparing for a robotaxi surge, and its CEO says one market will drive it.

Dara Khosrowshahi said in an interview with Bloomberg Television published Friday that robotaxis are a ""trillion-dollar-plus"" opportunity and Asia is a huge growth market for the ride-hailing giant.

""I expect to be in 10-plus markets by next year. And we want those markets to be in the Asia-Pacific region as well,"" Khosrowshahi said. Uber has self-driving vehicles in the US and the Middle East.

Analysts have long touted autonomous mobility as one of the biggest bets in the transportation industry. In 2023, McKinsey estimated that if robotaxis and roboshuttles scale, the shared-mobility market could reach $1 trillion by 2030.

Khosrowshahi said Japan has ""great potential"" for its robotaxi push, despite being behind in regulation.

""With an aging population, there's a real need for transportation, not just in the large cities but in the rural areas,"" he added. He also pointed to Hong Kong and Australia as potential key markets for its robotaxi services.

Khosrowshahi said Uber now works with more than 20 autonomous-vehicle partners — including China's Baidu, WeRide, and Pony.ai, as well as Waymo in the US.

""We will have access to autonomous technologies in the large cities and markets that really count,"" he added.

With a market that large, Khosrowshahi said autonomous driving is unlikely to be a ""winner-take-all"" industry.

""It's an exciting technology, but there are many players getting to the finish line,"" he said.

""We just have to make sure that the players that we work with are safe and that again, we're working with the regulators in a constructive manner,"" he added.

Uber has been leaning hard into autonomous driving. During its third-quarter earnings call in November, Khosrowshahi said the company is already seeing signs that robotaxis can boost demand.

""The biggest scale operations that we've got are with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta,"" Khosrowshahi said. ""And what we are seeing is that those markets are growing faster than other US markets,"" he added.

Other industry leaders have also been hyping the sector.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly said that robotaxis will power the company's growth. In May, Musk said in an interview with CNBC that Tesla would hit one million self-driving cars by the end of next year, a claim he also made in 2019 that did not materialize.

The path to profitability remains murky. HSBC analysts warned in July that the robotaxi market has been ""widely overestimated,"" and said it could be years before fleets make real money.

Even the most advanced players are burning cash. Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" division — which includes Waymo, as well as other subsidiaries — lost $1.42 billion in the third quarter.

The cost of an autonomous driving vehicle is steep. Analysts estimate that each Waymo vehicle costs about $150,000 to produce. The high costs have squeezed some companies out of the robotaxi market, including Ford and General Motors.

For 16 hours, an AI agent crawled Stanford's public and private computer science networks, digging up security flaws across thousands of devices.

By the end of the test, it had outperformed professional human hackers — and at a fraction of the cost.

A study published Wednesday by Stanford researchers found that their AI agent, ARTERMIS, placed second in an experiment with 10 selected cybersecurity professionals. The researchers said the agent could uncover weaknesses that humans missed and investigate several vulnerabilities at once.

Running ARTEMIS costs about $18 an hour, far below the average salary of about $125,000 a year for a ""professional penetration tester,"" the study said. A more advanced version of the agent costs $59 an hour and still comes in cheaper than hiring a top human expert.

The study was led by three Stanford researchers — Justin Lin, Eliot Jones, and Donovan Jasper — whose work focuses on AI agents, cybersecurity, and machine-learning safety. The team created ARTEMIS after finding that existing AI tools struggled with long, complex security tasks.

The researchers gave ARTEMIS access to the university's network, consisting of about 8,000 devices, including servers, computers, and smart devices. Human testers were asked to put in at least 10 hours of work while ARTEMIS ran 16 hours across two workdays. The comparison with human testers was limited to the AI's first 10 hours.

The study also tested existing agents, which lagged behind most human participants, while ARTEMIS performed ""comparable to the strongest participants,"" the researchers said.

Within the 10-hour window, the agent discovered ""nine valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate,"" outperforming nine of 10 human participants, the study said.

Some of the flaws had gone unnoticed by humans, including a weakness on an older server that testers could not access because their browsers refused to load it. ARTEMIS bypassed the issue and broke in using a command-line request.

The AI worked in a way humans could not, the researchers said. Whenever ARTEMIS spotted something ""noteworthy"" in a scan, it spun up additional ""sub-agents"" to investigate in the background, allowing it to examine multiple targets simultaneously. Human testers had to do this work one step at a time.

But the AI isn't flawless. ARTEMIS struggled with tasks that required clicking through graphical screens, causing it to overlook a critical vulnerability. It is also more prone to false alarms, mistaking harmless network messages for signs of a successful break-in.

""Because ARTEMIS parses code-like input and output well, it performs better when graphical user interfaces are unavailable,"" the researchers said.

Advances in AI have lowered the barrier to hacking and disinformation operations, allowing malicious actors to enhance their attacks.

In September, a North Korean hacking group used ChatGPT to generate fake military IDs for phishing emails. A report from Anthropic in August found that North Korean operatives used its Claude model to obtain fraudulent remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies — a tactic that gave them insider access to corporate systems.

The same report also said a Chinese threat actor used Claude to run cyberattacks on Vietnamese telecom, agricultural, and government systems.

""We are seeing many, many attacks,"" Yuval Fernbach, the chief technology officer of machine learning operations at software supply chain company JFrog, told Business Insider in a report published in April. He added that hackers have been using AI models to extract data, shut systems down, or manipulate a website or tools.

British Airways passengers spent more than nine hours on a transatlantic flight that ended up back where it started.

Wednesday's Flight 243 took off from London Heathrow Airport at 1:22 p.m. and was supposed to land in Mexico City around 11 hours later.

However, five hours into the journey, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner turned around over the Atlantic Ocean.

It had already passed Greenland and was only about 150 miles off the coast of Canada's Nunavut territory, according to data from Flightradar24.

The plane then headed back across the ocean, arriving in London just after 10 p.m.

The airline said in a statement that the diversion was due to an unspecified technical issue.

""The flight landed safely and customers disembarked normally following reports of a technical issue with the aircraft. We've apologised to our customers for the delay, and our teams are working to get their journeys back on track,"" the statement said.

It can be frustrating for passengers when they're diverted to their origin — a so-called flight to nowhere — but often it's the best course of action.

Returning to Heathrow, BA's main hub, makes it easier for the airline to rebook passengers on alternative flights and fix any problems with the aircraft.

Diverting elsewhere might have also left the plane and crew out of place, disrupting the airline's schedule. Plus, a stopover in Canada or the US may have caused the crew to reach their maximum working hours.

When BA Flight 243 turned around, its closest airport was Iqaluit in northern Canada, less than 300 miles away.

Some flights have diverted to this remote town in the past, but it can ultimately be more disruptive.

Last year, an Air France flight diverted to Iqaluit after a burning smell was detected in the cabin.

The pilots declared an emergency, and a different plane was rerouted to rescue the passengers. It was originally scheduled for another flight, so that had to be canceled. Passengers were then taken to New York, where they were rebooked onto other flights to reach their intended destination of Seattle.

Ultimately, it depends on how urgent the diversion is, since safety is the top concern.

However, if possible, returning to the flight's origin can be the simplest option for both passengers and the airline.

US Stocks:

An upcoming US Supreme Court ruling on the legality of the sweeping tariffs that President Donald Trump rolled out in April — briefly sending markets worldwide into a tailspin — could be the next test for stocks that have been flying high. 

The S&P 500 Index has since rallied 39% from the lows hit that month. It closed at a record high Thursday, in part because tariffs have settled lower than Trump's highest threats, while support has come from an artificial-intelligence investment boom and a US economy that has kept expanding fast enough to throw off record corporate profits.

Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Friday explained why he voted against this week's interest rate cut, telling CNBC that policymakers should have waited until they had more information before easing further.

""I'm pretty optimistic that for 2026 rates will will be able to be a fair bit lower than they are today,"" the central banker said during a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""But I've just been uncomfortable front-loading too many rate cuts and assuming that what we've seen in inflation will be transitory.""

Goolsbee was one of three Federal Open Market Committee members to vote against the quarter percentage point reduction, the third consecutive easing measure. He was joined by Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, as well as Governor Stephen Miran, who preferred a steeper cut.

While he has said in the past he sees room for rates to come down further, Goolsbee said a lack of progress on inflation argued against moving now.

Recent readings show the annual inflation rate around 2.8%, well above the Fed's 2% target.

""There's no way around we've been four and a half years above the inflation target, and the last six months have shown no progress,"" Goolsbee said. ""Right before the lights went out [for the government shutdown], you saw a couple of relatively disturbing readings on services inflation. I just want to make sure that if we believe that this is transitory, let's not just put all our eggs in.""

""While I voted to lower rates at the September and October meetings, I believe we should have waited to get more data, especially about inflation, before lowering rates further,"" the policymaker said in a post on the Chicago Fed's website.

Goolsbee will not be a voter on the FOMC in 2026 but will still participate in meetings.

""Given that inflation has been above our target for four and a half years, further progress on it has been stalled for several months, and almost all the businesspeople and consumers we have spoken to in the district lately identify prices as a main concern, I felt the more prudent course would have been to wait for more information."" he wrote in a post on the Chicago Fed website.

 In the CNBC interview, he elaborated on his misgivings about cutting. 

While other Fed officials have expressed concern about the weakening labor market, Goolsbee said data has shown conditions to be ""pretty stable.""

""I'm pretty optimistic that for 2026 rates will will be able to be a fair bit lower than they are today. But I've just been uncomfortable front loading too many rate cuts,"" he said in the interview. ""We don't take a lot of extra risk, in my view, to just wait to Q1 2026, and make sure that we're back on path at 2% inflation.""

The FOMC on Wednesday voted to lower its benchmark rate to a range between 3.5%-3.75%. 

In his post-meeting news conference, Chair Jerome Powell expressed worry that the labor market looks weaker than the headline numbers suggest, saying he expects official nonfarm payroll counts to be lowered and show losses in recent months.

For his part, Goolsbee said he is ""one of the most optimistic people"" that rates will be lower in the year ahead.

Schmid also released a statement Friday explaining his dissent. He also voted against a rate cut in October.

""Inflation remains too high, the economy shows continued momentum, and the labor market—though cooling—remains largely in balance,"" Schmid said. ""I view the current stance of monetary policy as being only modestly, if at all, restrictive. With this assessment, my preference was to leave the target range for the policy rate unchanged at this week's meeting.""

Earlier Friday morning, Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson, who will vote in 2026, said she views policy as ""somewhat restrictive"" and is more worried about unemployment than inflation.

Also, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said she would prefer policy ""on a slightly more restrictive stance"" to guard against higher inflation, according to Reuters.

In total, six of the 19 participants at the Fed meeting indicated they opposed the cut, though only two were voters.

One of this year's top food trends is facing some tough competition.

Protein captivated consumers and food companies in 2025, but fiber is increasingly stealing the scene as people place an increasing emphasis on promoting gut health.

It's taken hold on social media, where ""fibermaxxing"" — or the concept of increasing fiber intake through whole foods like fruits and legumes — has seen thousands of posts.

""Fiber is finally getting a spotlight, which is a great thing because it's a nutrient that people need,"" said Stephanie Mattucci, principal strategist at food research company Mintel.

Currently, 90% of women and 97% of men in the U.S. are not meeting their daily fiber requirements, Mattucci said. For most Americans, that recommended range usually falls somewhere between 25 grams and 38 grams of fiber per day, she added.

But more people are beginning to take notice of those gaps.

According to Mattucci, 22% of consumers in the U.S. said high fiber content was one of their top three important factors when shopping for food — up from just 17% in 2021.

Wall Street's companies are taking note, too. On an earnings call with analysts in October, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said fiber was emerging at the forefront of the company's product goals as it looked ahead to 2026.

""I think fiber will be the next protein,"" Laguarta said. ""Consumers are starting to understand that fiber is the benefit that they need. It's actually a deficiency in U.S. consumers' diets, and that will be elevated.""

In February, the company is going a step farther and plans to launch Smartfood Fiber Pop, featuring six grams of fiber per serving, and SunChips Fiber, incorporating fiber variants like whole grains and black beans, Pepsi's chief science officer, Tara Glasgow, told CNBC exclusively.

And there's a reason companies are broadening their offerings. Research firm Datassential found that fiber is on track to be the ""next big health trend following on the heels of protein"" in its 2026 trends report.

Of the consumers the firm surveyed, 54% said they are interested in foods and beverages that are high in fiber. That number is even higher — reaching 60% — among members of Generation Z, who are pioneering the ""fibermaxxing"" trend on social media.

And 42% of consumers said they believe the attribute of ""high fiber"" on a nutrition label of any food or beverage product is important to defining that product as ""healthy,"" according to Datassential.

It's that momentum that landed fiber as one of Whole Foods Market's top trends for 2026.

Watching fiber intake isn't new, experts note, but it's often been associated with older people who require it for health reasons as they age.

""When I think of fiber, I immediately think of my grandfather. Every day, he had his little baggie of All-Bran, and he brought it everywhere he went, probably out of necessity,"" Mintel's Mattucci said, citing the slowing of digestive tracts as people age.

Still, something has shifted as consumers of all ages have started placing more emphasis on promoting gut health and digestive wellness — and fiber entered the spotlight.

The emphasis on diversity of fiber intake and finding it in everyday whole foods rather than through supplements or powders is part of what's allowing it to find popularity and align with current culture, according to Angela Salas, a senior dietitian at the University of California, Davis.

The two types of fiber — soluble and insoluble — work together to keep people fuller for longer, improve digestion, and lower blood pressure and cholesterol, Salas said. In some ways, fiber could mimic the effects of weight-loss drugs because it takes longer to break down food and therefore sits in the stomach for longer, she said, which could be a factor for its recent popularity.

""These nutrients have always been around and always kind of shifts, I think, from the food industry saying, 'What can we highlight? What do people want to be focusing on so that we can continue to sell the same product, just slightly altered?'"" Salas said.

Still, Kate Pelletier, a registered dietitian nutritionist at the University of Michigan Health, said it's important to note that fiber is not sufficient as an alternative to GLP-1 drugs, and a balanced plate is the best way to stay healthy.

Pelletier said fiber's use as a ""street sweeper"" for the body is likely one of the reasons it's been thrust back into the spotlight.

""There's been a really big shift into more natural plants instead of popping a supplement or using a protein powder,"" Pelletier said. ""We can get the benefit of fiber from thinking about adding more wholesome foods into our diet, versus typical diet culture [which] focuses on taking out X, Y or Z."" 

Food and beverage companies are jumping on the momentum, too.

Earlier this year, Coca-Cola launched its prebiotic soda, Simply Pop, with six grams of prebiotic fiber in five flavors to encourage gut health. Nestlé unveiled a new protein shake in June with four grams of prebiotic fiber designed specifically to support the digestive health of adults on GLP-1 medications.

Other companies like Olipop have also entered the prebiotic soda market, boasting recipes that promote gut health, while smaller businesses, like Floura fiber bars and Sola Bagels, have also begun selling fiber-rich products.

Pepsi's Glasgow told CNBC the company is taking every opportunity to explore consumers' newfound interest in fiber. Glasgow said the research and development team's work starts in science and follows trends to keep up with their audience's evolving tastes.

Pepsi already has products on the market that specifically boast high fiber content, like its prebiotic cola and Quaker oatmeal. As consumers start to explore the previously ""sleepy little nutrient,"" Glasgow said, Pepsi is innovating new products across its beverages and food brands.

""We hear it from consumers as well that they're becoming more knowledgeable about nutrition and their nutrition needs,"" Glasgow said. ""And I think that's where the excitement is coming from. I feel it growing.""

Glasgow said the company, which already launched successful protein-packed products this year, is moving toward products that incorporate multiple sources of gut-healthy ingredients.

""We saw protein grow in a big way in the last couple years,"" Glasgow said. ""I think [consumers] are then expanding their view, and they realize there's not one ingredient alone that is the silver bullet. It's about getting the right ingredients all together.""

For some, fiber isn't just a trend.

Naomi Aganekwu, a 27-year-old content creator, said she started incorporating fiber more intentionally into her diet last year. Now, she makes sure each meal she eats has at least five to 10 grams of fiber through foods like beans, lentils and chia seed puddings.

Aganekwu said she's seeing results from incorporating fiber into her diet, like being satiated after meals and seeing her hormonal acne reduce. And as she's championing fiber, she's seeing the people around her do the same, especially among her generation.

It's become personal for Aganekwu, too, whose father died earlier this year of colon cancer. Some research has shown fiber could prevent colorectal cancer in addition to promoting overall health, according to the National Institutes of Health.

""You don't want to wait until you're 60 or 70 and you're dealing with more diagnoses,"" she said. ""There's a lot that you can do, even just in your everyday choices, down to what you're putting on your plate, that can directly impact your chances or decrease your chances of developing critical diseases.""

Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the level of fiber in Smartfood Fiber Pop.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to new closing highs yesterday as investors dove into old-economy and blue-chip stocks. The Nasdaq Composite sat out of the rally, as an 11% drop in shares of Oracle catalyzed the latest wave of worry about artificial intelligence spending.

Here's what to know:

Another day, another CEO departure: Lululemon announced yesterday that CEO Calvin McDonald will step down at the end of January. He will be replaced in the interim by two executives while the Canadian retailer searches for a permanent successor.

Lululemon reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter, but, as CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge notes, the company has been underperforming for more than a year. Shares of the athleisure retailer are up more than 9% this morning.

Costco also surpassed Wall Street's forecasts for its first quarter, boosted in part by e-commerce growth. The warehouse club said Black Friday was a record-breaking day for its digital business.

Mickey Mouse, meet ChatGPT. Disney announced a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI yesterday. Under the agreement, users on OpenAI's Sora video platform will be able to make content that features the entertainment giant's copyrighted material — including more than 200 characters across the Disney universe.

Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC that the deal gives the company ""a way in"" to AI and will help it further reach younger consumers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said there will be limits on how Disney characters can be used in Sora videos.

Yesterday also marked OpenAI's 10th anniversary. CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos takes you through the company's transformation from a small, nonprofit research lab to the booming business it is today.

After the U.S. seized a tanker off Venezuela's coast, a White House official told CNBC yesterday that Trump is willing to do it again. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also said that the tanker will be taken to a U.S. port where the oil it carried will be seized.

CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco found that the tanker in question, identified as the ""Skipper,"" had hid its location on multiple occasions since last year. Data suggests it has carried sanctioned oil from Iran and Venezuela since 2022.

Mover over, protein. Fiber is increasingly stealing the spotlight as shoppers focus on their gut health.

Data shows 22% of consumers listed high fiber content as a top-three factor when shopping, compared with 17% four years ago. On social media, the kids are calling it ""fibermaxxing.""

As a result, companies such as Coca-Cola and Nestlé are rolling out fiber-focused drinks, CNBC's Laya Neelakandan reports. PepsiCo also told CNBC that it's planning to launch high-fiber versions of Smartfood and SunChips next year.

Here are some stories we'd recommend making time for this weekend:

— CNBC's Sean Conlon, Jordan Novet, Tasmin Lockwood, Jennifer Elias, Kif Leswing, MacKenzie Sigalos, Gabrielle Fonrouge, Melissa Repko, Ashley Capoot, Kevin Breuninger, Spencer Kimball, Lori Ann LaRocco, Justin Papp, Eamon Javers and Laya Neelakandan contributed to this report.

In this article

Nvidia has told Chinese clients it is evaluating adding production capacity for its powerful H200 AI chips after orders exceeded its current output level, according to two sources briefed on the matter.

The move comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the U.S. government would allow Nvidia to export H200 processors, its second-fastest AI chips, to China and collect a 25% fee on such sales.

Demand for the chip from Chinese companies is so strong that Nvidia is leaning toward adding new capacity, one of the sources said. They declined to be named as the discussions are private.

Nvidia did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.

Major Chinese companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have already reached out to Nvidia this week about purchasing the H200 and are keen to place large orders, Reuters reported on Wednesday.

However, uncertainties remain, as the Chinese government has yet to greenlight any purchase of the H200. Chinese officials convened emergency meetings on Wednesday to discuss the matter and will decide whether to allow it to be shipped into China, said one of the two sources and a third source.

Very limited quantities of H200 chips are currently in production, Reuters reported on Wednesday, as the U.S. AI chip leader is focused on producing its most advanced Blackwell and upcoming Rubin lines.

Supply of H200 chips has been a major concern for Chinese clients and they have reached out to Nvidia seeking clarity on this, sources said.

As part of the briefing provided by Nvidia, the company has also given them guidance on current supply levels, said one of the first two people, without providing a specific number.

The H200 went into mass deployment last year and is the fastest AI chip in Nvidia's previous Hopper generation. The chip is manufactured by TSMC using the Taiwanese firm's 4nm manufacturing process technology.

TSMC and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Chinese companies' strong demand for the H200 stems from the fact that it is easily the most powerful chip they can currently access.

It is about six times more powerful than the H20, a downgraded chip from Nvidia tailored for the Chinese market that was released in late 2023.

Trump's decision on the H200 comes at a time when China is pushing to promote its own domestic AI chip industry. As domestic chip companies have yet to produce products that match the H200, there have been concerns that allowing the H200 into China could stymie the industry.

""Its (H200) compute performance is approximately 2-3 times that of the most advanced domestically produced accelerators,"" said Nori Chiou, investment director at White Oak Capital Partners.

""I'm already observing many CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) and enterprise customers aggressively placing large orders and lobbying the government to relax restrictions on a conditional basis,"" he said, adding Chinese AI demand exceeds the capacity of local production.

During the emergency meetings, there was a proposal to require each H200 purchase to be bundled with a certain ratio of domestic chips, one of the first two sources and a third source said.

For Nvidia, adding new capacity is also challenging at a time when it is not only transitioning to Rubin but also competing with companies, including Alphabet's Google, for limited advanced chipmaking capacity from TSMC.

Nearly 100,000 photos obtained by House Democrats from the estate of notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein include images of President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, film director Woody Allen, and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon and others in social settings.

Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as they made the photos public, urged the Department of Justice to release investigative files it has related to Epstein ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to do so to comply with a newly passed law.

One image among a batch of photos released Friday morning shows Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release. Some of the women are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks. 

Trump is shown in another photo standing behind Epstein at what appears to be a social event. A third photo shows Trump sitting next to a woman, whose face is blacked out, on what appears to be a plane.

Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein before the two men had a falling out sometime in the early 2000s. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and has denied knowledge of Epstein's abuse of girls and women while they are friends.

CNBC has requested comment from the White House.

Clinton is shown in one photo standing with Epstein, his now-convicted procurer Ghislaine Maxwell, and another man and woman. The photo has Clinton's signature on it.

Other photos show former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was previously known as Prince Andrew of Britain, and Epstein's one-time lawyer Alan Dershowitz.

The dates, locations and context of the photos were not revealed as part of the release Friday. 

CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos, all of whom have denied wrongdoing. This story will be updated with their responses.

""This latest production contains over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein,"" a statement from Democrats on the Oversight Committee said.

""Images also include thousands of photographs of women and Epstein properties,"" the statement said. ""Committee Democrats are reviewing the full set of photos and will continue to release photos to the public in the days and weeks ahead. Committee Democrats are committed to protecting the identities of the survivors.""

Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee, in a statement said, ""It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.""

""These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW.""

 Trump and top law enforcement officials in his administration for months resisted the idea of releasing investigative files related to Epstein and Maxwell before Congress in November overwhelmingly passed a law mandating their release by the Department of Justice.

Those files, which are separate from the ones released by the Democrats on Friday, have yet to be made publicly available.

Garcia said the committee received the new batch of photos from Epstein's estate on Thursday night.

He said that the committee's Democrats have reviewed ""maybe about 25,000 of [the photos] so far.""

""There's an enormous amount of photos we have not gone through,"" Garcia said. ""It will take days and weeks to ensure that we got those photos and that a redaction is done in the appropriate way.""

""Obviously there are photos of powerful men, and folks that we want to have an opportunity to speak with and ask questions of,"" Garcia said.

He noted that the photos were in the estate's possession, and that Epstein took some of them himself, while others may have been sent to him.

""Some of the other photos that we did not put out today are incredibly disturbing,"" Garcia added.

Republicans on the Oversight Committee, in their own statement, said, ""Once again, Oversight Democrats are chasing headlines by releasing a handful of selectively censored and cherry-picked photos from the Epstein Estate.""

""Democrats' hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. Nothing in the documents we've received shows any wrongdoing,"" the Republicans said. ""Ranking Member Robert Garcia and Oversight Democrats should be ashamed of this disgusting behavior of putting politics above justice for the survivors.""

Epstein died from a jailhouse suicide in August 2019, weeks after he was arrested on child sex trafficking charges filed by the DOJ during Trump's first term in office.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for her 2021 conviction of crimes related to procuring underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.

Angel Urena, a spokesperson for Clinton, had said in a July 2019 statement, ""President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York.""

""In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation. Staff, supporters of the Foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip,"" Urena said. 

""He had one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein's New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail. He's not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein's ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida.""

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced on Thursday, with both hitting fresh closing records. The Russell 2000 index also ended the session at a new high, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's quarter-point cut on Wednesday.

But if investors analyze Thursday's individual stock movements, they will see not all is well with the AI play yet. Oracle shares plunged nearly 11%, a day after it reported weak quarterly revenue, higher capital expenditure and long-term lease commitments. Oracle's slide dragged down AI-related names such as Nvidia and Micron. 

In extended trading, Broadcom shares fell 4.5%. The chipmaker beat Wall Street's expectations for earnings and revenue, but CEO Hock Tan appeared to have failed to address worries that their largest customer, Google, might eventually make more of its chips in-house. Rising memory prices would also pressure margins, while the company's chip deal with OpenAI might not be binding.

That's why the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.26% despite other major U.S. indexes hitting records. Putting the two together, that means investors are rotating out of tech into other parts of the market. The S&P 500 financials sector, for instance, closed at a fresh record, buoyed by jumps in Visa and Mastercard. 

Even though the AI theme seems to be under scrutiny, other sectors are performing well on the back of a resilient U.S. economy — as signaled by Fed officials on Wednesday — and buoyed by interest-rate cut. So long as nothing throws a spanner in the works, looks like we're all set for a happy holiday season.

Trump scared Europe with his national security strategy. That's no bad thing, ex-CIA chief says

White House's new national security strategy gave Europe a scare last week as it warned the region faced ""civilizational erasure"" and questioned whether it could remain a geopolitical partner for America.

The strategy was, ""in a way, going after the Europeans but, frankly, some of the Europeans needed to be gotten after because I watched as four different presidents tried to exhort the Europeans to do more for their own defense and now that's actually happening,"" David Petraeus, former CIA director and four-star U.S. Army general, told CNBC's Dan Murphy in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.

The White House's new national security strategy gave Europe a scare last week as it warned the region faced ""civilizational erasure"" and questioned whether it could remain a geopolitical partner for America. 

The document shocked allies on the continent as it criticized its leaders as ""weak"" and slammed the region's stance on immigration, democracy, freedom of speech, while adding its waning economic and military power was waning.

""It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,"" it said, adding that the region suffered from a lack of self-confidence. The document also called for the U.S. to re-establish ""strategic stability"" with Russia, despite its war against Ukraine.

But David Petraeus, the former CIA Director and four-star US Army general, told CNBC it was no bad thing for European nations to get a wake-up call to look after their defense and security. 

The strategy was, ""in a way, going after the Europeans but, frankly, some of the Europeans needed to be gotten after because I watched as four different presidents tried to exhort the Europeans to do more for their own defence and now that's actually happening,"" he told CNBC's Dan Murphy in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.

Petraeus said President Donald Trump had been ""very, very substantial"" in getting the Europeans to spend more on defense.

""He's gotten them to commit to what they should have done years ago,"" Petraeus said. He pointed to European members of NATO agreeing earlier this year to increase defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, after sustained pressure from the Trump administration.

Petraeus' comments come as diplomatic efforts continue to end the war in Ukraine, with U.S. officials holding talks regarding peace proposals with Russian and Ukrainian counterparts in recent weeks. 

Both Russia and Ukraine, and its European allies, have promoted different peace plans with contradictory demands and ""red lines."" The biggest obstacles to peace remain disagreements over post-war security guarantees for Ukraine and Russian demands that Kyiv cede the eastern region of Donbas.

Washington is reportedly urging both sides to come to an agreement before Christmas, but there is also skepticism that this is possible. Russia, meanwhile, appears to be enjoying the increasing pressure that Europe and Ukraine are coming under from Washington.

Petraeus said he had little faith that Russia could compromise over a peace plan with Putin showing little sign of compromise over war objectives such as territorial control, regime change, and a ""demilitarized"" Ukraine with no prospect of NATO membership.

""I'm encouraged that there is an effort spurred by the United States and backed by President Trump, personally, in many respects, and his direct negotiators to try to bring the war to an end. I'm not encouraged by Moscow's response,"" Petraeus said. 

""Vladimir Putin just continues to reiterate that his goals are the maximalist objectives he's held all along, which essentially denies independence to Ukraine. He wants to get a pro-Russian president to replace President Zelenskyy ... He wants to demilitarize Ukraine [and] ... he wants to be given ground that is in the most fortified area of Ukraine,"" he added.

 Putin ""is not going to budge,"" Petraeus added.

Ukraine's European allies have been looking at ways to continue funding its war against Russia, as well as considering its eventual post-war reconstruction, which is likely to cost over $500 billion, according to the United Nations, and Russian reparations.

The EU is believed to be close to a deal to mobilize a sizable chunk of the estimated 210 billion euros (around $244 billion) worth of Russian sovereign assets currently frozen in European financial institutions. 

There are, however, concerns over the legal ramifications and the potential retaliation from Moscow; Russia's security council chief warned last week that using Russian assets would be tantamount to a justification for war.

Petraeus said if the EU did go ahead with using frozen Russian reserves, it would be a ""game changer.""

""We've heard a lot of game changers before. I've never bought into those. But ... $200 billion or even 100 billion euros of money for Ukraine would be a game changer. It solves their fiscal and economic problems for a couple of years,"" he said.

Thailand's king has approved the dissolution of parliament, deepening political instability in the Southeast Asian nation ahead of an attempt by the U.S. to salvage a fragile ceasefire with Cambodia.

In a royal decree published Friday, King Maha Vajiralongkorn endorsed a request by Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul to dissolve parliament after his minority government failed to reach an agreement with the majority opposition People's Party on proposed constitutional changes. 

Under Thai law, a general election must be held within 45 to 60 days of the decree.  

The opposition had reportedly threatened to file a motion of no confidence after Anutin's government pushed to expand the powers of elected lawmakers under a planned constitution overhaul. 

In a post on Facebook late Thursday, Anutin said he would ""return power to the people."" 

The political turmoil came as the Southeast Asian nation has been locked in a large-scale spat with Cambodia over long-disputed border claims. Tensions escalated this week as fierce clashes broke out at several locations along the border, which have reportedly killed at least 20 people and left dozens of civilians injured. 

 U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to speak with the leaders of the two countries soon, with Anutin saying the call has been scheduled for 9:20 p.m. Thailand time on Friday (8:20 a.m. Eastern). 

Anutin, who assumed office in September after Paetongtarn Shinawatra was dismissed by Thailand's Constitutional Court for an ethics violation related to the Cambodia dispute, has taken a tougher stance in the border clashes, a move that could fuel nationalist support for his conservative Bhumjaithai party ahead of the election. 

Dissolving parliament would not affect Thailand's military operations along the frontier, Anutin told local media outlets Friday.

Southeast Asia's second-largest economy has grappled with tepid growth this year, expanding just 1.2% in the third quarter as the extended political turmoil, tariff uncertainty with the U.S. and border conflicts weighed on confidence.   

Thailand's benchmark SET Index, ranked among the world's worst-performing equity gauges for 2025, has lost around 10% so far this year. The baht has been relatively resilient, strengthening over 7% this year against the greenback amid weakness in the dollar.

The latest tensions followed the collapse of a fragile ceasefire brokered in July by Trump, who threatened to halt trade talks with the two countries unless they ended the fight. 

Thailand's top diplomat, Sihasak Phuangketkeow, told his U.S. counterpart Marco Rubio Friday that the country was committed to finding a peaceful resolution, but sustainable peace must be backed up by actions, according to Reuters.

""We see a risk of the conflict persisting into early 2026 if the Thai government judges that adopting a harder line could bolster its political standing ahead of the likely early-2026 elections,"" said Alexandra Hermann, lead economist at Oxford Economics. 

The renewed tensions increased the downside risks to Oxford Economics' 1.6% GDP growth forecast for Thailand in 2026, Hermann added, citing a potential loss of the Cambodian export market, labor-force shortages from an outflow of Cambodian workers and higher U.S. tariffs if trade talks stall.

Before the conflict, Cambodia was Thailand's 11th-largest export market in 2024, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce, accounting for around 3% of total goods exports. 

Bilateral trade has collapsed this year, with border crossings shut. The total value of Thailand's exports to Cambodia plummeted 67% in October from a year earlier, Ministry of Commerce data showed.

Gareth Leather, senior Asia economist at Capital Economics, however, noted that a third of those exports are petroleum, which could easily find an alternative market, but the key risk would be Trump reintroducing higher tariffs on Thailand for breaking the ceasefire he had helped brokered. 

""The biggest risk is that the breakdown of the ceasefire irritates the Trump administration as the truce had been one of the regional conflicts he claimed credit for helping to stabilize,"" Leather added. 

Meanwhile, a prolonged conflict could risk removing between 500,000 and 1.5 million Cambodian migrant workers from Thailand's domestic labour force of around 40 million, Hermann estimates.

This year, the world's largest fund house, BlackRock, launched multiple mutual fund schemes in India through Jio BlackRock, marking the U.S. firm's reentry after its exit in 2018. The world's fourth largest asset manager, State Street, is reportedly looking to buy a stake in an Indian fund house.

Accelerating financialization of Indian household savings is driving flows: as more retail investors participate in capital markets, the opportunities for asset managers to handle those funds are ballooning.

The U.K. economy unexpectedly contracted 0.1% in the three months to October, according to official figures released Friday. 

Economists had expected 0% growth over the period. It follows a 0.1% expansion over the three months to September. 

The Office for Statistics noted that services output stalled, construction output fell 0.3% and production output fell 0.5% ""largely because of a fall in the manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers in this period.""

The figures come after the U.K.'s Chancellor Rachel Reeves unveiled a range of tax hikes in her hotly anticipated Budget last month, as she looked to plug a ""black hole"" in the country's finances and spur much-needed economic growth.

""October's GDP underscores just how much difficulty the U.K. economy is going through as the government searches for some sort of growth,"" Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter wealth management company, said in a note.

""This figure also misses what were already low expectations and doesn't bode well for next month's figure either.""

Looking ahead to the central bank's rate decision next week, James added that Friday's figures made it ""increasingly likely the Bank of England will have to lower rates next week when it meets, but with inflation remaining persistently high, the pace at which subsequent cuts can be delivered remains questionable.""

The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will meet on Dec. 18 and is widely expected to agree on a quarter-point rate cut to 3.75%, as inflation cools. 

Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said she expected growth to remain weak for the rest of the quarter, ""as activity in November is likely to have been constrained because of continued Budget uncertainty.""

""Overall, we expect the GDP growth to be flat in the final quarter of this year,"" she added.

Broadcom revealed during a September earnings call that it had signed a customer that had placed a $10 billion order for custom chips. 

At the time, Broadcom didn't say who it was, but on Thursday, CEO Hock Tan revealed that the mystery customer was AI lab Anthropic, which placed an order for the latest Google tensor processing units.

""We received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic,"" said Tan, speaking on Broadcom's fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday. He also said Anthropic had placed an additional $11 billion order with Broadcom in the company's latest quarter. 

While Broadcom typically doesn't disclose its large customers, Tan's September remark drew significant investor attention amid the AI infrastructure boom. A Broadcom official told CNBC in October that the mystery customer wasn't OpenAI, which has its own agreement to purchase chips from the chipmaker. 

Broadcom makes custom chips called ASICs, which some experts believe are more efficient for certain artificial intelligence algorithms than the market-dominating chips from Nvidia. Broadcom helps make Google's TPUs, and last month, the search company bragged that it trained its state-of-the-art Gemini 3 model entirely on its TPUs. 

The chipmaker calls its custom AI chips XPUs, and on Thursday, Tan said his company was delivering entire server racks — not just chips — to Anthropic, which is Broadcom's fourth XPU customer. 

Broadcom on Thursday also said that it has secured a fifth customer for its custom chip business. That customer placed a $1 billion order during the fourth quarter, but once again, Broadcom did not reveal the customer. 

""It's a real customer, and it will grow,"" Tan said. 

In late October, Anthropic and Google announced a sweeping cloud partnership that underscored just how quickly the AI infrastructure race is moving. 

The deal is valued in the tens of billions of dollars. The agreement gives Anthropic access to as many 1 million Google TPUs, and is expected to bring well over a gigawatt of new AI compute capacity online in 2026. 

Anthropic employs a multi-cloud, multi-chip strategy. 

The startup spreads workloads across Google's TPUs, Amazon's custom Trainium chips and Nvidia graphics processing units. Anthropic's various models are tuned to run on whichever platform makes the most sense for training, inference or research. 

For Google, Anthropic's bet on TPUs is exactly the kind of validation investors have been rewarding, as Wall Street increasingly ties Alphabet's stock run-up to clear demand for its in-house AI chips. 

Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian previously said Anthropic's decision to dramatically expand its TPU usage reflects ""the strong price-performance and efficiency"" the startup has seen over several years.

After more than a decade of internal development, Google is making TPUs widely available to cloud customers as a service, rather than selling the hardware outright, and has been leaning on its chips as a differentiator as it tries to keep pace with surging demand for AI compute.

Analysts have described TPUs as the most credible alternative to Nvidia's GPUs. Analysts have argued that Google's tightly tailored ASICs and power-efficient designs could become a meaningful driver of the company's cloud business growth as power constraints — not chip supply — emerge as the key bottleneck for AI.

Bitcoin continues to drift toward the lower bound of its recent trading range with any increase in the price seen being met by selling from investors who purchased the largest cryptocurrency near the all-time high reached in early October. 

Crypto analytics firm Glassnode said various metrics point to a “mild bearish phase,” defined by modest capital inflows outweighed by steady selling pressure from larger holders.  With prices stuck in a “weak but bounded range,” the firm noted, time itself becomes a negative force as unrealized losses accumulate. Relative unrealized losses jumped to 4.4%, the highest in nearly two years after spending most of that period below 2%, signaling a transition from euphoria to “elevated stress and uncertainty.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","cryptocurrency"

ByClem Chambers,

Senior Contributor.

I'm on the record as saying the crypto-winter has begun – and that, of course, means a Bitcoin winter, because “there is no crypto, only bitcoin.”

To me, bitcoin's connection to Wall Street is fatal. Wall Street drains value from assets, it doesn't inject money into markets – it farms them. That's not to say it doesn't have its place, but for an emerging asset like crypto or bitcoin, it acts as a predator in a naïve land. I don't think that ends well for the asset.

However, let's keep the words to a minimum and look at the chart:

A bull will see bitcoin at the bottom of an upward trend. The expectation would be to trade sideways along this level and then, at some point, break higher. The target in that scenario would be $140,000+. However, I'm not going to bother drawing that chart, because as I've stated, the crypto winter is here.

This is how a bear like me sees it:

This is a halfway pause. While both bulls and bears can agree that there is an equilibrium level here, to a bear this move is simply the midpoint before the next leg lower.

Here is what a bear would expect to see:

The key point is that we don't have to be a bull or a bear – we can just observe. A W-shaped structure is very bullish, but if the subsequent support level is broken, a sharp decline typically follows:

In my view, bitcoin is in a bear market, and only a miracle will save it. It can happen—but I believe it won't.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Backed Finance is introducing xBridge, a new cross-chain bridge designed to move tokenized stocks across blockchains without losing track of stock splits, dividends or other corporate actions.

Unveiled at Solana Breakpoint and built in partnership with Chainlink, xBridge enables users to transfer tokenized equities, called xStocks, between Ethereum and Solana, according to an emailed announcement on Friday.l

These tokens are 1:1 backed by real-world stocks or ETFs and mimic their behavior onchain, including how they respond to events like a stock split or dividend payout.

xBridge uses Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to ensure that when a token moves from one chain to another, its link to the underlying asset and its behavior remains intact.

“For years, crypto had either permissionless native digital assets or RWAs closed behind walled gardens. said Yotam Katznelson, CTO and COO of Backed. “With xStocks, we brought tokenized equities into DeFi permissionlessly, and now with xBridge, we are completing the loop: tokenized stocks can finally flow as freely as any other crypto asset:”

On Ethereum, balances are scaled with an updatable multiplier. On Solana, they rely on Token2022 and automatic rebasing. But the outcome is the same: token balances update to reflect splits or dividend events, even after crossing chains.

Backed's xStocks are already live across a number of cryptocurrency trading platforms, including major centralized exchanges. One of those exchanges, Kraken, acquired Backed Finance earlier this month.

With the bridge live in pilot mode, Backed plans to add support for Mantle, TRON and other blockchains in the coming weeks.

Anthony Scaramucci showed up to Solana Breakpoint in Abu Dhabi wearing a tie — a small act of rebellion in a sea of hoodies — and then proceeded to make a much bigger one on stage: Solana is going to “flip” Ethereum.

Scaramucci's Solana Prediction

Not in the Twitter-war, zero-sum, “ETH is dead” kind of way. More like: same league, different growth curve, and Solana ends up with the bigger market cap. “I think it will flip Ethereum, but that doesn't mean Ethereum's going down or anything like that. I think there's going to be market share for Ethereum. I think they could both grow, but I think from a market capitalization perspective, I think Solana will end up growing faster,” Scaramucci told CoinDesk Live on Dec. 11.

That's been his line for a while. This time it came with a prop: his new book, Solana Rising, which dropped Dec. 9 and — according to Scaramucci — quickly hit the top of Amazon's “new releases” list for investment management/investment strategy. He framed the book as something for the skeptics, or at least for the friends of the believers.

The pitch is familiar if you've been anywhere near crypto conferences this year, but Scaramucci's version is unusually blunt: Solana is the fastest-growing chain, it's stacked with activity, it's cheap to use, and it's easy to build on. Then you add staking, and you've got what he keeps calling “great tokenomics.”

And yes, he's heavily aligned. “Full disclosure,” he said, “I have a large personal holding in Solana. I have it on the firm's balance sheet.” How large? On SkyBridge's balance sheet, he put it at “probably 60%,” with the firm sitting on “north of a nine figure balance sheet.” His personal portfolio allocation, he estimated, is around “6% 7%.” Big, but not “I sold the house for SOL” big.

Notably, Scaramucci emphasized that he's not “chain monogamous.” He likes Avalanche. He likes Ethereum. He's not doing maximalism. He's doing a portfolio. “In fact, who is chain monogamous?” he joked.

The Skybridge Capital founder added: “It's not an amorous thing. It just has to do with the realities of investing. It's like owning a lot of stocks in your portfolio. But to me, I just think that it is the fastest growing chain. That's the most activity of like the top 50 chains combined. It's got lots of use cases, lots of versatility. It's easy to develop on and it's very low fees to transact on and it's got great tokenomics if you want to stake your Solana like I do.”

He also pointed to the debut of the first spot Solana ETF in the United States — “first staking ETF,” in his words — as another signal that we're still early. Then came the price talk, because of course it did.

Could SOL hit $300–$400 by the end of next year? “Sure,” he said, tying it to a more constructive US regulatory backdrop — specifically his hope that the CLARITY Act gets passed and unlocks “the full utilization of tokenization.” Longer term, he went bigger: “Is Solana go to $1,000 over the next five years? I really do believe that.”

He also revisited Bitcoin. Same vibe: right call, wrong calendar. “I've been right about Bitcoin, but I've been wrong about timing,” Scaramucci said, sticking with a $150,000–$200,000 target, and arguing a friendlier rate environment next year could help.

At press time, SOL traded at $139.14.

                            Sei Giga Could Make Blockchain as Fast as the Internet — Here's How It Works                        

As blockchain technology continues to evolve, speed and scalability remain its biggest challenges. The team behind the Sei Network believes it has found the next major leap forward – Sei Giga, an upgrade that promises to make blockchain as fast and responsive as the internet itself.

To understand what makes Sei Giga different, CCN spoke to Jayendra Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs, who shared insights into how this new version reimagines blockchain performance from the ground up.

🏆 CCN's Top 101 in Crypto and Blockchain 2026 | Submit Your Nomination Before 23rd December

Sei Giga is the next major upgrade  of the Sei blockchain, a layer-1 blockchain built to handle huge numbers of transactions extremely quickly while still being compatible with Ethereum's smart contracts. It's designed to solve the biggest performance limits of traditional blockchains by rethinking how blocks are created, ordered, and executed. 

Next generation blockchains like Sei Giga will create types of MEV that are completely new, and poorly understood.

Today, we share the first ever paper exploring MEV in next-generation blockchains.

— Sei Labs (@Sei_Labs) November 25, 2025 



Traditional blockchains like Ethereum are secure and decentralized, but they struggle with:

Sei Giga tackles all of these by redesigning three main parts of a blockchain:

By upgrading these, Sei Giga aims to match Web2-like performance while keeping decentralization and security intact. 

“Sei Giga fundamentally reimagines the Sei blockchain as it is today,” said Jog. “With +200k TPS, 400-ms finality, and an MEV-resistant architecture, Sei Giga will mark the next quantum leap in how blocks are built,” Jog noted.

This speed boost, he explained, is made possible by a redesigned consensus mechanism and new layers for execution and storage, all working together to deliver “the speed and capacity to provide Web2-like UX, without sacrificing decentralization.”

In other words, Sei Giga isn't just a faster version of Sei, it's a full architectural overhaul aimed at matching the performance of traditional internet applications.

Sei Giga's scalability comes down to two key innovations.

“There are essentially two ways Sei Giga achieves this,” Jog explained. “Multiple validators propose blocks simultaneously, and the computationally burdensome task of transaction execution happens after blocks are ordered.”

This separation between ordering and execution allows Sei to handle vast numbers of transactions in parallel. It's a bit like a restaurant kitchen that takes orders from many customers at once, then organizes and prepares them efficiently without slowing down service.

When asked whether Sei's lightning-fast 400ms finality was already available on the main network, Jog confirmed:

“Yes, Sei finality today is 400ms, approximately +30x faster than Ethereum finality. The breakthrough of Sei Giga will be achieving 5 gigagas throughput without sacrificing the speed needed to provide the performance for Web2-like apps.”

That means transactions confirm almost instantly, a massive advantage for financial apps, games, and trading platforms where every millisecond matters.

Speed often comes at the cost of complexity, but Sei Giga avoids this trade-off.

“The Giga upgrade has been designed to dramatically increase chain performance without increasing hardware requirements for validators,” Jog said.

“Giga will introduce new node types, but will allow existing validators to continue with the same hardware used for the current network.” This ensures the system remains accessible and decentralized, even as it scales up.

One common issue on blockchains is what happens when multiple users interact with the same smart contract at once. Jog explained how Sei Giga addresses this:

“Transactions requiring access to the same storage slots is an edge case that affects every EVM chain, causing slight performance degradation when it occurs,” he said.

“Because the Giga upgrade decouples consensus and execution, Sei's consensus will be unaffected by this edge case, unlike other EVM chains.”

Sei Labs is also developing solutions like access lists and native compilation of hot contracts, which could further improve performance, not just for Sei, but for the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

For developers, Sei Giga is designed to be backward compatible.

“Apps that are live on Sei won't need to migrate to Sei Giga once it's on mainnet,” Jog explained. “The network will upgrade seamlessly while retaining compatibility with apps on the network. Blue chip launch partners will be announced as we get closer to the full launch.”

That means developers and users alike can expect a smooth transition without needing to rewrite or re-deploy their apps.

“Sei is bytecode compatible with Ethereum's EVM up to the recent Fusaka upgrade, excluding EIP-4844 as Sei doesn't use blobs for storing transaction data,” Jog said.

“Bytecode compatibility is important because it means developers don't need to recompile or re-audit their code. With only a few small changes to account for gas limits and gas token references, developers can copy, paste, and deploy.”

This makes Sei Giga an inviting option for Ethereum developers looking for higher performance without giving up EVM familiarity.

Jog also revealed that Sei Labs will be launching a $5 million Global Mobile Innovation Program to encourage development across mobile and consumer devices.

“We work closely with developers to provide them with all the documentation, tooling, and devnet/testnet needed to deploy on Sei for the first time,” he added.

This kind of early ecosystem support is designed to help developers build and test applications that take full advantage of Sei Giga's speed and scalability.

As networks grow, maintaining decentralization becomes harder. Jog explained that Sei Giga's new design keeps this balance intact:

“Sei Giga improves the algorithm used for block proposing and also introduces new node types, ensuring validator nodes only need to maintain a limited history of the chain's state,” he said.

“While hardware requirements for validators are unlikely to change, overall Sei Giga will be as decentralized as it is today.”

For everyday users, Sei Giga promises a lightning-fast, MEV-resistant chain with the capacity and stability needed for real-world applications.

According to Jog, the end result is a network capable of delivering the kind of seamless, near-instant user experience people are used to from traditional apps and websites.

Sei's ambitions extend beyond gaming or DeFi.

“We've designed Sei to support applications across Web3 use cases,” Jog said, “and you'll see applications deployed across DeFi, gaming, AI, and everywhere blockchain technology improves our lives online.”

He summarized Sei Labs' long-term goal clearly:

“Sei was purpose-built to be the infrastructure for the internet of money. Internet native financial institutions need internet native financial infrastructure. With Sei Giga we want to build the first next-generation blockchain: a blockchain that meets Wall Street's need for high throughput and fast finality, on the blockchain.”

Key Takeaways

The Depository Trust Company (DTC) has received approval to pilot a securities tokenization scheme.

The DTC will now establish standards that could define the future of tokenization.

Participants in the tokenization pilot are expected to receive a list of approved blockchains.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted the Depositary Trust and Clearing Company (DTCC) approval to develop a securities tokenization program.

The Depository Trust Company, a DTCC subsidiary, is now tasked with developing standards to record the ownership of stocks, ETFs, and Treasuries on the blockchain.

Some of the first tokenized securities in the U.S. include money market funds like Franklin Templeton's FOBXX and BlackRock's BUIDL.

Although these are real, regulated products, they exist outside of DTCC clearing and settlement.

Up until now, blockchain-powered issuance and settlement have existed as parallel rails that remain subordinate to the core financial infrastructure.

With a no-action letter from the SEC, the DTCC will move forward with a pilot tokenization scheme expected to launch in the second half of 2026.

As the United States' primary central securities depository, pretty much every transfer of U.S. equities, corporate bonds, or notes runs through the DTCC, which processed transactions worth $3 quadrillion in 2023.

When it sets standards, they have implications for capital markets around the world.

In other words, the future of securities tokenization—questions like which blockchains will be approved and what kind of information tokens must be inscribed with—now rests with the DTC.

Rather than prescribing a particular blockchain, the SEC has tasked the DTC with defining objective technology standards that platforms must meet.

In practice, however, the organization will maintain a list of approved blockchains that meet its criteria.

Participants in the tokenization pilot are expected to receive this list in the coming months.

Colle AI (COLLE), the multichain AI-powered NFT creation platform, announced the rollout of its Signature Pattern Generator, an intelligent automation system designed to dramatically speed up high-volume NFT variant production. The new engine enables creators, brands, and studios to generate large sets of stylistically consistent visual variations in seconds, removing the bottlenecks traditionally associated with scaling NFT collections across multiple chains.

The Signature Pattern Generator identifies core stylistic anchors within a creator's initial concept—such as motif structure, color identity, stroke behavior, and texture geometry—and automatically generates coherent variations derived from those foundations. This creates a unified visual language across hundreds or even thousands of outputs while preserving artistic intent. By eliminating repetitive manual adjustments, the system empowers creators to expand ideas rapidly and maintain quality across extensive NFT drops.

Fully integrated with Colle AI's multichain publishing architecture, the generator prepares every variant with chain-aware formatting and metadata optimization for ecosystems including Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, BNB Chain, and the XRP Ledger. As batches scale, the system automatically maintains consistency, structural integrity, and on-chain readiness, ensuring that creators can transition seamlessly from high-speed generation to deployment. “Pattern-based variation is essential for large-scale NFT creation,” said J. King Kasr, Chief Scientist at KaJ Labs. “The Signature Pattern Generator gives creators a powerful engine for producing thematic consistency at scale, without compromising artistic identity or multichain reliability.”

The launch of the Signature Pattern Generator expands Colle AI's growing suite of intelligent creative tools designed to accelerate high-volume, high-fidelity digital production. With this addition, Colle AI continues to push the boundaries of rapid ideation, scalable design, and frictionless multichain publishing—supporting a new generation of creators building at speed across Web3.

Villains: Robot Battle Royale has recently upped the ante with the launch of its Super Villain Championship. This seasonal event, spanning three weeks, exclusively features a new solo play mode that requires players to compete using ‘Super Villains', a special class of characters. These super villains have evolved capabilities and are different from standard characters, which players need to unlock and evolve to compete effectively.

To participate in the championship, characters must be upgraded to the Super Villain status, achievable when a standard villain reaches level 20 and undergoes awakening with either Diamonds or Hell Points. This transformation also converts each character into an NFT, incorporating blockchain elements into the game's mechanics. Available grades for Super Villains include Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Mythic. The competitions are structured on a ladder system with players striving for higher ranks to earn greater rewards. The top 30 players in the championship reap substantial Night Stone rewards, with the ultimate champion pocketing a whopping 28,500 Night Stones. These stones can be used to purchase Power Shots in the in-game shop, crucial for character upgrades.

The gameplay interlinks with an intricate currency system powered by gMBX, a token used in various MARBLEX-backed games. The built-in MBX Swap system supports players in exchanging MBX for gMBX at a fixed 1:1 ratio, enabling further trading or acquisition of Night Stones. Despite the flexibility of this system in enhancing gameplay, there exist caps on the maximum volume and transaction limits per user to maintain balance and security. Notably, while acquiring Night Stones through gMBX is free, reverting the conversion attracts a 15% charge.

Developed by Birdletter Inc. and supported by the MARBLEX platform, Villains: Robot Battle Royale delivers immersive four-minute matches set on Helcatraz, a dystopian prison planet. As player strategies adapt to fast-paced and tactical skirmishes, the game promises more engaging future updates. Planned expansions include new competition modes, potentially branching into duo and squad battles. Although specific dates for these updates remain undefined, the focus remains steadfast on enriching the current championship and fuller integration of the Night Stone economy.

The evolving dynamics of competition and player engagement signal a robust future for Villains: Robot Battle Royale, continuously shaping an exciting landscape for mobile gaming enthusiasts.

Milk Mocha has grown beyond its familiar cartoon identity and is now shaping a community-owned digital ecosystem powered by the $HUGS token. What separates it from many best crypto presales is the role given to its supporters. Token holders are not passive participants. They actively guide the project through on-chain governance.

At the current presale stage, 1 $HUGS is priced at $0.0004023 in Stage 6, with $227k already raised. As interest builds, attention is not only on price movement but on influence. Through the Milk Mocha DAO, decisions about NFTs, treasury use, and charitable action sit with the community. The roadmap is not dictated from the top. It is shaped collectively, which is why this presale continues to attract long-term minded participants.

Many projects focus on selling tokens first and explaining governance later. Milk Mocha takes the opposite route. It invites participants to help build from the start. The HugVotes system allows anyone who stakes $HUGS to submit ideas, discuss proposals, and vote on outcomes. This transforms the presale from a transaction into shared ownership.

Supporters are not buying based on short-term movement. They are securing a voice. Decisions range from approving new utilities to shaping future NFT collections. This shift from observer to contributor is why Milk Mocha often appears in discussions around best crypto presales. Influence is earned through commitment, not noise. When users see their votes matter, trust grows, and that trust turns into continued staking and engagement.

Governance power within Milk Mocha follows a clear rule. Influence is tied to staking. Those who commit tokens for the long term carry more weight in decisions. This encourages alignment between governance and sustainability rather than quick exits. HugVotes allow the community to guide NFT themes, allocate event budgets, and approve partnerships.

Every step is visible and permanent. There is no central override and no hidden process. Voting power scales with staked tokens, which rewards consistency and belief in the project. Instead of relying on promises, Milk Mocha offers direct participation, reinforcing its position among best crypto presales built on accountability.

Milk Mocha extends governance beyond the ecosystem itself. Through the Charity Pool, token holders vote on how funds are donated to real-world causes. These decisions are not made behind closed doors. They are proposed, debated, and approved through HugVotes, with all transactions recorded on-chain.

Whether the cause supports animal welfare, education, or emergency relief, every donation requires community approval. This structure adds transparency rarely seen in digital fundraising. The emotional connection many already have with Milk and Mocha strengthens participation here.



Supporters are not just holding a token. They are directing meaningful action. This blend of financial utility and social impact is another reason Milk Mocha is frequently listed among best crypto presales with substance behind the narrative.

Presale buyers are not joining simply to accumulate tokens. They want influence. Early supporters understand that staking $HUGS now increases their say in future decisions. This desire for involvement is a key driver behind Milk Mocha's presale activity.



This model turns early participation into a strategic advantage. Instead of waiting for outcomes, buyers help shape them. That approach explains why presale engagement remains strong. People are not funding someone else's plan. They are building a system they can influence, protect, and grow.

Milk Mocha shows that digital ownership can extend beyond holding tokens. Through staking, HugVotes, and community-led governance, it delivers real control to its supporters. This is why it continues to rank among meaningful best crypto presales, not just for potential upside, but for shared responsibility.

The DAO plays an active role in decisions that matter, from spending and NFTs to charitable giving. Early participants are more than buyers. They are voters, builders, and contributors. In a space where trust is often requested, Milk Mocha places that trust directly in the hands of its community and allows them to lead.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has fined password manager provider LastPass UK Ltd £1.2 million following a 2022 data breach that compromised the personal information of up to 1.6 million people in the UK.

The data breach occurred in August 2022 and was the result of two isolated incidents that, when combined, enabled a hacker to gain unauthorized access to LastPass' backup database. The stolen information included customer names, email addresses, phone numbers, and stored website URLs.

While the data breach exposed sensitive personal information, the ICO confirmed there is no evidence that hackers were able to decrypt customer passwords. This is due to LastPass' use of a ‘zero knowledge' encryption system, which ensures that master passwords and vaults are stored locally on customer devices and never shared with the company.

The first incident involved a LastPass employee's corporate laptop based in Europe. A hacker gained access to the company's development environment and obtained encrypted company credentials. Although no personal information was taken at this stage, the credentials could have provided access to the backup database if decrypted.

LastPass attempted to mitigate the hacker's activity and believed the encryption keys remained safe, as they were stored outside the compromised environment in the vaults of four senior employees.

The second incident proved more damaging. The hacker targeted one of the senior employees who had access to the decryption keys. Exploiting a known vulnerability in a third‑party streaming service, the attacker gained access to the employee's personal device.

A keylogger was installed, capturing the employee's master password. Multi‑factor authentication was bypassed using a trusted device cookie. This allowed the hacker to access both the employee's personal and business LastPass vaults, which were linked by a single master password.

From there, the hacker obtained the Amazon Web Service (AWS) access key and decryption key stored in the business vault. Combined with information taken the previous day, this enabled the extraction of the backup database containing customer personal information.

The ICO investigation concluded that LastPass failed to implement sufficiently strong technical and security measures, leaving customers exposed. Although the company's zero knowledge encryption protected passwords, the exposure of personal data was deemed a serious failure.

John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, stated: “Password managers are a safe and effective tool for businesses and the public to manage their numerous login details, and we continue to encourage their use. However, as is clear from this incident, businesses offering these services should ensure that system access and use is restricted to reduce risks of attack. LastPass customers had a right to expect their personal information would be kept safe and secure. The company fell short of this expectation, resulting in the proportionate fine announced today.”

The ICO has urged all UK businesses to review their systems and procedures to prevent similar risks. This case underscores the importance of restricting system access, strengthening cybersecurity measures, and ensuring that employees' personal devices do not become weak points in corporate networks.

While password managers remain a recommended tool for managing login details, the incident shows that even trusted providers can fall short if internal safeguards are not sufficiently strong.

The £1.2 million fine against LastPass UK Ltd serves as a clear reminder that companies handling sensitive data must uphold the highest standards of security. Although customer passwords were protected by the company's zero knowledge encryption system, the exposure of personal information has left millions vulnerable.

The ICO's ruling reinforces the need for constant vigilance in the face of growing cyber threats. For both businesses and individuals, the message is straightforward: adopt strong security practices, conduct regular system reviews, and implement robust employee safeguards to reduce the risk of future data breaches.

The UK data protection watchdog has fined a cyber vendor £1.2m after a 2022 data breach that compromised the personal information of about 1.6 million of its UK users. A combination of two isolated incidents enabled hackers to steal personal information, the ICO says.

The regulator found that LastPass failed to make ‘appropriate technical and organisational security measures', which ultimately enabled a hacker to gain unauthorised access to its back-up database. There is no evidence that hackers were able to unencrypt customer passwords as these are stored locally on customer devices and not by LastPass.

 

Business and personal

The vendor was allowing its employees, including senior ones with access to highly confidential corporate credentials, to link their Employee Business and Personal accounts so that they could be accessed using the same master password. That meant that when the hackers installed a key-logger on the Senior Development Operations Engineer's personal device, they were able to capture the engineer's master password and use it, with stolen trusted device cookies, to gain access to both his Employee Business and Personal accounts, with the former containing the AWS Access Key and decryption keys required, to access a backup database.

The incidents occurred in August 2022 when a hacker gained access first to a corporate laptop of an employee based in Europe and then to a US-based employee's personal laptop on which the hacker implanted malware and then was able to capture the employee's master password. The hacker took personal information which included customer names, emails, phone numbers, and stored website URLs.

 

Since incident

The ICO noted that since the incidents, ‘LastPass has sought to address the risks previously posed by allowing employees to access their Employee Business vaults using personal devices. Specifically, LastPass issued corporate devices and mobile phones to all employees'. The vendor's new Acceptable Use Policy prohibits employees from conducting any business activities on their personal devices (and vice versa); and employees are restricted from accessing non-business approved websites and applications on their corporate devices.

The watchdog noted that thanks to LastPass' “zero knowledge” encryption system, the most sensitive personal data stored in the customers' password vaults remained encrypted at all times, even after exfiltration by the threat actor. For more details visit the ICO website.

 

‘Customers had a right'

John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said:  “Password managers are a safe and effective tool for businesses and the public to manage their numerous login details and we continue to encourage their use. However, as is clear from this incident, businesses offering these services should ensure that system access and use is restricted to ensure risks of attack are significantly reduced.

“LastPass customers had a right to expect the personal information they entrusted to the company would be kept safe and secure. However, the company fell short of this expectation, resulting in the proportionate fine being announced today. I call on all UK business to take note of the outcome of this investigation and urgently review their own systems and procedures to make sure, as best as possible, that they are not leaving their customers and themselves exposed to similar risks.”

Comment

Dan Panesar, chief revenue officer at Certes, described the ICO's fine  as a watershed moment for the cybersecurity industry because it confirms what many breaches have already shown: the failure point is no longer passwords, it's what attackers can access once identity is compromised. He said: “This incident didn't hinge on cryptography being broken; it hinged on endpoints being breached and backups being reachable. That's a critical distinction regulators are now making very clearly. The uncomfortable reality for organisations is that identity controls, MFA, and zero trust alone do not stop breaches; they are merely speed bumps for attackers. Once attackers obtain legitimate credentials, the decisive question becomes whether the data they reach is readable, usable, and valuable.

“Regulators are signalling a shift away from ‘did you protect the perimeter?' toward ‘did you make stolen data useless?' That means treating backups, metadata, and internal flows as high-risk assets rather than secondary ones. This fine should be read as a warning shot. If your security model still assumes breaches are preventable rather than inevitable, regulators will increasingly see that as a governance failure, not just bad luck.”

The Bank of Canada has shelved plans for a central bank digital currency, likely under pressure from banking institutions worried about their profit margins.Keito Newman/The Globe and Mail

Claude Lavoie is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. He was director-general of economic studies and policy analysis at the Department of Finance from 2008 to 2023.

Ottawa's new framework for regulating stablecoins has cryptocurrency advocates celebrating. 

The federal legislation will allow companies to issue loonie-backed stablecoins – cryptocurrency pegged to the Canadian dollar. Tetra Digital, a financial services group, plans to launch one early next year. 

The government's move comes after the United States passed the GENIUS Act, raising concerns that Canada might fall behind in the digital currency race.

But Ottawa missed a much better opportunity: introducing a central bank digital currency that would make Canada's banking system more inclusive, stable and efficient. Yet the Bank of Canada has shelved plans for a CBDC, likely under pressure from banking institutions worried about their profit margins.

Given that nearly 90 per cent of transactions already happen electronically through e-transfers, credit cards and debit cards, why bother with stablecoins?

Ottawa's new stablecoin framework a key step toward monetary sovereignty, advocates say

The answer lies in efficiency. Stablecoin transactions don't need to pass through multiple domestic and foreign institutions before settlement, enabling faster processing, lower fees, greater privacy and easier international transfers. By pegging to the Canadian dollar, they avoid the wild volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which has fallen more than 30 per cent in recent months.

Yet significant risks remain. A private stablecoin's value depends on the issuer's trustworthiness and ability to maintain adequate high-quality reserves. “De-pegging” incidents have occurred, where stablecoins meant to equal $1 have dropped to 90 cents or lower.

Users must also find someone willing to accept their stablecoin or convert it to traditional currency, which is particularly complex in cross-border transactions. Unlike credit cards and electronic banking, stablecoins offer no fraud detection or consumer protection. A transaction to the wrong address, a hack or a lost private key means the money is gone.

A central bank digital currency would provide the same settlement benefits and eliminate the risks posed by private alternatives.

As legal tender issued by the Bank of Canada, a CBDC would be accepted anywhere Canadian dollars are currently accepted. It would carry the same backing as the current dollar, with zero de-pegging risk. 

BoC's Macklem lays out high-level vision for stablecoin regulation

International agreements between central banks would facilitate fast, cheap conversion between countries' CBDCs, simplifying transfers to friends and family in Europe, Japan or elsewhere. Controlling illicit activities would be easier than with private digital currencies.

Holding a CBDC would essentially equal holding deposits at the central bank (or at some kind of new national public deposit bank) accessible via card, computer or smartphone. The government could create an account for every Canadian using social insurance numbers, extending electronic payment benefits to the underbanked – the homeless, elderly and people in remote areas. Federal transfers could become faster and more efficient.

With all the advantages of CBDCs, the Bank of Canada abandoned the idea. The decision, of course, ultimately rests with the government. Launching a CBDC would require legislative changes, notably the Bank of Canada Act and Currency Act. So why isn't the government pursuing it? The answer likely lies in the BoC's stakeholder consultation report.

The Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, CIBC, and TD Bank in Toronto's Financial District.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

One key factor emerging from these consultations is financial institutions' concerns about a CBDC's impact on their operations. A CBDC would remove incentives for holding money in banks' deposit accounts. Why keep money in accounts that earn virtually no interest – and charge fees – when you could hold it more securely at the central bank with no fees? Banks would lose a stable source of low-cost funding.

Banks argue that this threatens financial stability. But if Canadians moved from bank deposits into CBDCs, this would simply level the playing field between banks and other non-deposit-taking financial institutions. 

Most financial institutions lack access to bank deposits as funding (e.g. First National, Wealthsimple, Manulife) yet operate successfully. Moreover, the Bank of Canada has tools to address any financial stability problems that emerge.

The real reasons for resistance are simple: a CBDC would hurt large deposit-taking institutions' bottom lines and would eliminate the market – and profits – for privately issued stablecoins.

Other concerns include privacy issues and the complexity of the required regulatory framework. Although it is worrisome that some people trust private cryptocurrency issuers more than their public institutions, these challenges are manageable. A CBDC could also coexist with physical cash. 

With more than 130 countries exploring central bank digital currencies – many in pilot and development phases – shelving this idea may be a missed opportunity that future generations will regret.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","RBI sees privacy risks with CBDC, but it's safer than stablecoins, says deputy governor Sankar","https://www.livemint.com/industry/banking/rbi-privacy-risks-in-programmable-cbdcs-but-safer-than-stablecoins-deputy-governor-t-rabi-sankar-mint-bfsi-conclave-11765538375217.html","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 17:50:46 GMT","

Central bank digital currencies are a far safer option than stablecoins, which pose greater risks than their purported benefits, according to Reserve Bank of India deputy governor T. Rabi Sankar.

“Do stablecoins serve a purpose? It seems to me that they do not; at any rate, they do not serve a purpose that cannot be served better by fiat money,” Sankar said at the Mint Annual BFSI Conclave 2025. Stablecoins fail the fundamental tests that define modern money and pose risks far greater than the benefits their proponents claim, he said.

Central bank digital currency (CBDC) is backed by the fiat currency of a country, issued by regulators. Stablecoins are private tokens that are pegged to a currency or another asset.

Calling stablecoins inherently unstable, Sankar said that India's financial system already has fast, low-cost, and robust digital rails such as Unified Payments Interface (UPI), real-time gross settlement (RTGS) and national electronic funds transfer (NEFT), leaving “little justification” for integrating private digital currencies into the domestic ecosystem.

While stablecoins are often promoted as tools for faster cross-border transfers or vehicles to expand financial inclusion, Sankar countered these claims, saying that in reality, stablecoins continue to be used predominantly within the crypto market as instruments for leverage and speculation, rather than as everyday transactional currency.

“To sum up, many of these benefits are neither unique to stablecoins nor have stablecoins yet established any of the benefits their proponents claim,” he said. “By their very nature, they are in many ways inferior to available forms of money in achieving those benefits.”

On the other hand, the risks they introduce to financial stability and broader macro-financial stability are extremely serious.

He also warned that widespread adoption of stablecoins, whether denominated in domestic or foreign currency, could trigger currency substitution, weaken India's monetary policy transmission, disrupt capital account management, disintermediate banks and increase systemic vulnerabilities.

The risk of losing sovereign seigniorage to private issuers, particularly those operating offshore, is a leakage of public revenue with significant long-term implications.

Sankar encouraged the usage of CBDCs, calling them a technologically advanced yet safe public alternative that preserves monetary sovereignty.

CBDCs, he said, combine the advantages of tokenised digital money, programming capability, atomic settlement, lower cross-border frictions, while still retaining the essential attributes of sovereign currency with fiat backing, trust and singleness.

Encouraging CBDC adoption domestically, he said, would require making digital rupee usage ‘functionally similar to cash,' including offering tiered anonymity for small-value transactions.

On the international front, he also said that bilateral and multilateral CBDC corridors could deliver the same cross-border efficiency stablecoins promise, without destabilizing national financial systems.

This fits alongside India's existing push to interlink fast payment systems such as Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with partner jurisdictions, a move he said reduces any need for private alternatives.

Sankar, however, acknowledged privacy concerns associated with programmable CBDC use cases, particularly those linked to targeted benefits such as subsidies.

A programmable CBDC is a digital form of a country's money with built-in rules, allowing it to be automatically controlled for specific uses, locations, merchants, or expiry dates, enabling smart contracts for targeted subsidies, programs, or automated escrow. For example, government funds could be programmed to only buy specific goods like fertilizer, ensuring they reach the intended purpose efficiently.

According to Sankar, cash-like anonymity is “unavoidable” if the digital rupee is to achieve widespread adoption. However, achieving such anonymity in a digital framework remains challenging.

“...digital transactions always leave a footprint. It is difficult to anonymize transactions. It is possible. There are technologies which make that possible. But more importantly, we would require a legal backing. Even if it is possible to wipe out a transaction technologically, I think, at least most public institutions would not do that unless there is a legal backing to such anonymity,” Sankar said at the fireside chat.

It is one of the main concerns in the US and a few other countries, he said. “We will have to build towards that anonymity to create the unique case for CBDCs for domestic use.”

He called wholesale CBDC transactions helpful, especially in cross-border payments as they simply save the huge amount of capital that banks employ in managing the settlement risk. However, there is a need for other countries to adopt CBDCs as well.

Sankar also linked the global momentum around CBDCs to the rising prominence of stablecoins, which he described as an increasingly influential force over the past year.

“I think it is very important for CBDCs to exist across countries and connected to each other, so that you can actually show a use case which is superior to stablecoins,” he added.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency gave conditional approval for five national trust bank charter applications, including for Circle Internet Group's (CRCL) First National Digital Currency Bank and Ripple National Trust Bank, the agency said Friday.

Five digital asset firms have received conditional approvals Friday to become federally chartered trust banks by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) in a major step to bring U.S. dollar stablecoin issuers under federal regulatory oversight.

Blockchain firm Ripple and Circle's (CRCL) First National Digital Currency Bank are on the list, which also includes BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets and Paxos, each having previously operated under state charters that will be converted to conditional federal status.

The OCC is the only federal agency that charters banks and trusts, and this surge in approvals potentially marks a major turning point in crypto banking. Since the arrival of President Donald Trump's administration, the regulator — run by his appointee, Jonathan Gould — has shifted from a crypto-resistant stance to a friendly approach.

""The OCC will continue to provide a path for both traditional and innovative approaches to financial services to ensure the federal banking system keeps pace with the evolution of finance and supports a modern economy,"" Gould said in a statement. 

If the newly approved trust banks can meet agency expectations, they'll permanently join about 60 regulated institutions with such charters, which allow for fiduciary activities including custody. National trust banks — a category that includes the first chartered crypto bank, Anchorage Digital — have certain limits in their business activities, so they don't offer the same deposit and lending capabilities as the OCC's larger pool of national banks.

Ripple chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse said in an X post that the OCC's move is ""huge news,"" a ""massive step"" for the firm's $1.3 billion RLUSD$0.9999 stablecoin. He also slammed the bank lobby for their ""anti-competitive tactics.""

""You've complained that crypto isn't playing by the same rules, but here's the crypto industry — directly under the OCC's supervision and standards — prioritizing compliance, trust and innovation to the benefit of consumers,"" Garlinghouse said. ""What are you so afraid of?""

Circle, the issuer of the $78 billion stablecoin USDC$0.9998, said in a press release that the national trust bank charter would ""enhance the safety and regulatory oversight of the USDC Reserve, while enabling Circle to offer fiduciary digital asset custody and related services to institutional customers.""

Paxos, the company behind the $3.8 billion PYUSD$0.9998 and the consortium-backed, $1.4 billion Global Dollar token (USDG), said that its federally regulated platform would ""allow businesses to issue, custody, trade and settle digital assets with clarity and confidence."" Notably, Paxos has been operating under a New York Department of Financial Service (NYDFS) charter since 2015, and first applied for federal charter in 2020.

Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo, said that the development ""marks an official end to the war on crypto and the beginning of the next era of innovation in banking,"" adding that ""we've entered the era of regulatory integration, and improvements will continue to happen fast."" BitGo is the issuer behind USD1 (USD1), the digital dollar token of World Liberty Financial, a crypto project with close ties to the Trump family.

The crypto sector has long struggled with banking in the U.S., including a prolonged fight against regulators and large institutions that the industry accused of systemically debanking their companies and executives. The Trump administration has sought to reverse any policies and banking activity that adversely targeted crypto firms. 

The OCC issued a report on Thursday about debanking, arguing that all nine of the largest banks were involved and that those guilty of severing banking ties to legal business customers could face punishment.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency conditionally approved five digital asset firms, including Circle, Ripple and Paxos, for de novo national trust bank charters, the regulator announced Friday.

Circle's First National Digital Currency Bank and Ripple National Trust Bank were conditionally approved for national trust charters, while Paxos Trust Co., BitGo Bank & Trust and Fidelity Digital Assets' state charters will be converted to national ones.

“Paxos is now entering a new phase of regulatory supervision and we're excited to power a platform subject to federal oversight and supervision,” CEO Charles Cascarilla said in a statement Friday. “This will enable customers to innovate, incubate and grow digital asset businesses safely and seamlessly within the US.”

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the charter move “deepens” his firm's “longstanding commitment to the highest standards of trust and compliance.

“This important milestone will give the world's leading institutions greater clarity and confidence to build on Circle's platform as stablecoins and blockchain technology move rapidly into the mainstream,” Allaire said in a statement Friday. “As a public company, we're focused on operating under rigorous regulatory oversight and building the infrastructure that allows digital dollars like USDC to become a core part of global finance.”

The OCC, for its part, said it “applied the same rigorous review and standards it applies to all charter applications.”

“New entrants into the federal banking sector are good for consumers, the banking industry and the economy,” Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould said in a statement. “They provide access to new products, services and sources of credit to consumers, and ensure a dynamic, competitive and diverse banking system.”

In a speech Monday to the Blockchain Association, Gould said the OCC has allowed national trusts to engage in nonfiduciary custody activity for decades, adding that prohibiting them from engaging in such activities would “not only threaten to undermine the dynamic and evolving nature of the federal banking system but would also disrupt well over a trillion dollars in traditional activities of existing national trust banks.”

“Custody and safekeeping services have been happening electronically for decades,” Gould said Monday. “There is simply no justification for considering digital assets differently.”

The five firms will join the ranks of 60 already-established national trust banks. Not every high-profile cryptocurrency-related charter application saw approval, though. Coinbase's application and that of Stripe subsidiary Bridge were not among those approved Friday.

Gould and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Acting Chair Travis Hill have vocally advocated for new bank charters.

Anchorage Digital, previously the only other crypto firm to receive OCC approval for a national trust bank, lauded its new contemporaries.

“Anchorage Digital Bank became the first federally chartered crypto bank in January 2021— and we never wanted to be the last. This is long overdue,” CEO Nathan McCauley said in a release seen by Banking Dive. “With a nearly five-year head start — and immense investment in compliance along the way — Anchorage Digital Bank has pioneered a path for others to follow.”

Not everyone is as enthused over the charter news. Greg Baer, CEO of the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group, said the development “leaves substantial unanswered questions … chiefly, whether the requirements the OCC has outlined for the applicants are appropriately tailored to the activities and risks in which the trust will engage.”

“We hope the OCC will share more details about these applications so the public can better understand the rationale behind today's decision,” Baer said.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse decried “anti-innovation bank lobbyists” in his statement Friday. 

“The conditional approval of our trust bank charter represents a massive step forward –setting the highest standard for stablecoin compliance with both federal and state oversight … ensuring [the firm's token] is the most transparent and responsibly managed stablecoin in the market today,” Garlinghouse said.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

The Bank of Canada has shelved plans for a central bank digital currency, likely under pressure from banking institutions worried about their profit margins.Keito Newman/The Globe and Mail

Claude Lavoie is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. He was director-general of economic studies and policy analysis at the Department of Finance from 2008 to 2023.

Ottawa's new framework for regulating stablecoins has cryptocurrency advocates celebrating. 

The federal legislation will allow companies to issue loonie-backed stablecoins – cryptocurrency pegged to the Canadian dollar. Tetra Digital, a financial services group, plans to launch one early next year. 

The government's move comes after the United States passed the GENIUS Act, raising concerns that Canada might fall behind in the digital currency race.

But Ottawa missed a much better opportunity: introducing a central bank digital currency that would make Canada's banking system more inclusive, stable and efficient. Yet the Bank of Canada has shelved plans for a CBDC, likely under pressure from banking institutions worried about their profit margins.

Given that nearly 90 per cent of transactions already happen electronically through e-transfers, credit cards and debit cards, why bother with stablecoins?

Ottawa's new stablecoin framework a key step toward monetary sovereignty, advocates say

The answer lies in efficiency. Stablecoin transactions don't need to pass through multiple domestic and foreign institutions before settlement, enabling faster processing, lower fees, greater privacy and easier international transfers. By pegging to the Canadian dollar, they avoid the wild volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which has fallen more than 30 per cent in recent months.

Yet significant risks remain. A private stablecoin's value depends on the issuer's trustworthiness and ability to maintain adequate high-quality reserves. “De-pegging” incidents have occurred, where stablecoins meant to equal $1 have dropped to 90 cents or lower.

Users must also find someone willing to accept their stablecoin or convert it to traditional currency, which is particularly complex in cross-border transactions. Unlike credit cards and electronic banking, stablecoins offer no fraud detection or consumer protection. A transaction to the wrong address, a hack or a lost private key means the money is gone.

A central bank digital currency would provide the same settlement benefits and eliminate the risks posed by private alternatives.

As legal tender issued by the Bank of Canada, a CBDC would be accepted anywhere Canadian dollars are currently accepted. It would carry the same backing as the current dollar, with zero de-pegging risk. 

BoC's Macklem lays out high-level vision for stablecoin regulation

International agreements between central banks would facilitate fast, cheap conversion between countries' CBDCs, simplifying transfers to friends and family in Europe, Japan or elsewhere. Controlling illicit activities would be easier than with private digital currencies.

Holding a CBDC would essentially equal holding deposits at the central bank (or at some kind of new national public deposit bank) accessible via card, computer or smartphone. The government could create an account for every Canadian using social insurance numbers, extending electronic payment benefits to the underbanked – the homeless, elderly and people in remote areas. Federal transfers could become faster and more efficient.

With all the advantages of CBDCs, the Bank of Canada abandoned the idea. The decision, of course, ultimately rests with the government. Launching a CBDC would require legislative changes, notably the Bank of Canada Act and Currency Act. So why isn't the government pursuing it? The answer likely lies in the BoC's stakeholder consultation report.

The Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, CIBC, and TD Bank in Toronto's Financial District.Fred Lum/The Globe and Mail

One key factor emerging from these consultations is financial institutions' concerns about a CBDC's impact on their operations. A CBDC would remove incentives for holding money in banks' deposit accounts. Why keep money in accounts that earn virtually no interest – and charge fees – when you could hold it more securely at the central bank with no fees? Banks would lose a stable source of low-cost funding.

Banks argue that this threatens financial stability. But if Canadians moved from bank deposits into CBDCs, this would simply level the playing field between banks and other non-deposit-taking financial institutions. 

Most financial institutions lack access to bank deposits as funding (e.g. First National, Wealthsimple, Manulife) yet operate successfully. Moreover, the Bank of Canada has tools to address any financial stability problems that emerge.

The real reasons for resistance are simple: a CBDC would hurt large deposit-taking institutions' bottom lines and would eliminate the market – and profits – for privately issued stablecoins.

Other concerns include privacy issues and the complexity of the required regulatory framework. Although it is worrisome that some people trust private cryptocurrency issuers more than their public institutions, these challenges are manageable. A CBDC could also coexist with physical cash. 

With more than 130 countries exploring central bank digital currencies – many in pilot and development phases – shelving this idea may be a missed opportunity that future generations will regret.

For years, the biggest bitcoin obstacle was regulators, who had control over how the cryptocurrency was used, taxed and tracked. Now the biggest threat may be physics. The fast rise of quantum computing, which works on a subatomic level using exotic technologies, threatens to upend the cryptography that secures all blockchain-based digital assets. And the clock may already be ticking.…

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) implicitly granted approval for some stocks and other securities to be tokenized and traded on blockchains.

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC), the world's largest securities settlement system, said on Thursday that a subsidiary, the Depository Trust Co. (DTC), received a no-action letter allowing it to offer a tokenization service on approved blockchains for three years.

Tokenization is the process of representing stocks, bonds and other real-world assets (RWAs) as digital tokens that can be bought, sold and traded on blockchains, with the aim of achieving greater efficiency and faster settlement. 

Some of the biggest names in traditional finance (TradFi), including JPMorgan  and BlackRock, have developed projects in this area, demonstrating the potential institutional investment that they can draw to blockchain finance.

The Depository Trust Co.'s authorization applies to the constituents of the Russell 1000 index, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking major indexes and U.S. Treasuries. It plans to begin rolling out the service in the first half of 2026.

A no-action letter is a formal response from the agency to a company stating that the regulator will not take any enforcement action for a proposed activity.

Artificial intelligence-focused stocks are coming under pressure on Friday, dragging tech-related equities and bitcoin BTC$92,441.66 lower during the early U.S. session.

Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), the ninth largest asset by market cap, tumbled 10% despite strong earnings as its outlook disappointed investors' lofty expectations.

The Nasdaq index was down over 1% in the first hour of the session. Adding that to Oracle's 10% slump on Thursday and a further 3% decline on Friday, as investor concerns are mounting that the red-hot AI theme that fueled much of this year's stock market gains might be fizzling out.

Bitcoin, trading around $92,500 overnight, plunged 2% following the U.S. stock market open to $89,800 recently, extending the choppy action through the week. A consistent theme this week has been bitcoin setting intraday lows during U.S. trading hours, a pattern that has led to the filing of the proposed AfterDark Hours ETF. 

Bitcoin miners, some of which have been increasingly leaning into AI for diversification, showed a similar reaction to Broadcom's miss. Hut 8 (HUT) fell more than 5%. Iren (RIEN) and Riot (RIOT) dropped about 4%, while Cipher(CIFR) and Iren (IREN) both were down about 2% over the past day. 

Crypto-related stocks also fell alongside the Nasdaq. Robinhood (HOOD) and Strategy (MSTR) were both down nearly 2%. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) was hit hard and fell more than 5%. Coinbase (COIN) dropped slightly.

Markets had already been under pressure after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's speech on Wednesday, which hinted at a possible rate cut pause in January. As a result, markets now expect only two rate cuts in 2026 instead of three. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who was against a December rate cut, however, said he expects more in 2026 than the current median projection. 

Several other members of the Federal Reserve will also speak over the course of today as the central bank's blackout period following its December meeting on Wednesday has ended. Traders will be looking for any guidance on whether Fed officials agree with Powell on potentially holding rates steady in January.

Hex Trust announced it will issue and custody wrapped XRP (wXRP), a 1:1-backed representation of native XRP designed to expand XRP's DeFi and cross-chain utility beyond the XRP Ledger. 

The wrapped asset will be tradable alongside RLUSD on Ethereum and additional supported chains, including Solana, Optimism, and HyperEVM.

wXRP will launch with more than $100 million in total value locked, providing immediate liquidity and reducing early-stage friction. 

Authorized merchants will be able to mint and redeem wXRP in a regulated, automated environment, with all underlying XRP held in segregated institutional custody. 

That structure allows XRP exposure across DeFi applications such as swaps, liquidity provisioning, and collateral use without reliance on unregulated third-party bridges.

RippleX confirmed the initiative aligns with growing institutional demand to use XRP and RLUSD across the wider crypto ecosystem. 

While structurally bullish for long-term utility, the announcement did not immediately translate into upside momentum, suggesting the market is still digesting broader positioning and macro flows.

Timekeeping on Mars Is a Tall Order. Here's Why

Precisely calibrating clocks on Mars is harder than you'd think, because of some extremely esoteric physics

You know how it goes: You're trying to get some shut-eye in your bunk after a long shift of scraping samples of prebiotic material from red rocks in Utopia Planitia, and before you know it, your alarm bell rings. And then you see it woke you up a full 477 microseconds early!

Life on Mars is tough. Figuring out the exact time isn't much easier.

Even on the larger end of the timescale, Martian chronometry is not exactly simple; the planet takes about 687 Earth days to go around the sun, making calendrical coordination with Earth pretty hairy. It also spins on its axis—completing one Mars day—in 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds (to distinguish this period from an Earth day, we call it a “sol,” referencing the Latin word for the sun). Keeping track of your schedule on Mars would be different than doing so on Earth. But still, at its core, it would just be a matter of conversion.

Building an accurate Martian clock, on the other hand, can be very tricky, depending on how accurate you want it to be. When you start to slice time into smaller and smaller bits, the problem concerns not only engineering but also fundamental physics. That's because the flow of time on milli- and microsecond scales is affected by relativity, gravity and orbital mechanics, which can vary radically from world to world.

The good news is that a pair of physicists did all the associated mathematical heavy lifting for Mars and published their results on December 1 in the Astronomical Journal. With their help, we can fine-tune our Martian timepieces.

It was Albert Einstein who really first got this ball rolling. Among many other things that emerged from his special theory of relativity, he postulated that time does not necessarily flow the same for two independent objects. The most commonly used example of this is how a clock runs more slowly when it is moving relative to an observer. The effect is pretty small until that motion nears the speed of light, whereupon it can get very large.

But there's another twist to relativity: besides relative motion, gravity affects time's flow as well! The stronger the gravity, the slower a clock will tick relative to some observer far away, where the gravitational effects are weaker. Both of these phenomena can affect us on Earth: GPS satellites, for example, orbit far above Earth, where gravity is weaker, so their clocks run faster than those on the surface. But the satellites' rapid orbital motion also slows their clocks. Combined, these effects cause their clocks to tick about 38 microseconds faster than ones on the ground. This profoundly affects their accuracy in mapping, throwing them off by about 10 kilometers per day. Think about how angry you'd be if your smartphone's map app was off by a kilometer or so after only a half hour of use. Happily, GPS takes all this into account, so the positional accuracy it calculates is pretty high. But this situation just shows how important relativity can be.

What does this have to do with the Red Planet? Well, for one thing, while Mars is a rocky world like our own, it's much smaller, about a tenth the mass of Earth. Its surface gravity is some three times less than what we feel at home. So on Mars, I'd only weigh about 65 pounds (29 kilograms)! I bet my knees and back would feel a lot better about that.

But this also means a clock on Mars feels less gravity than one on Earth, so it will run faster. And unfortunately, plugging this into Einstein's equations to calculate that advancement is no easy task.

First, you have to define what the average surface of Mars is. After all, if you're on a mountain, you're farther up from the average elevation than you'd be if you were in a valley, where you'd feel a different amount of gravitational force.

But you can't just average between the highest peaks and lowest valleys to arrive at some clear median. Oh, no. Just as a world can have varying surface elevation, it can also have a varying subsurface composition, with some regions being denser (and thus having greater local gravity) than others. Still, factoring this in alongside things like a global rotation rate and the influence of any massive orbiting moons, it's possible (though difficult) to determine the average surface for any given world.

We did this properly for Earth in the late 20th century—and thanks to our extensive robotic orbital reconnaissance, we've done it more recently for Mars, too. Once calculated, Mars's average surface can be used to gauge gravity's influence on clocks anywhere on the planet.

But that's not all. Mars orbits the sun farther out than Earth does, and this has two effects: The solar gravity the Red Planet feels is reduced, so its clocks will run faster than Earth's. Plus, it orbits the sun more slowly relative to Earth, so its clocks will run faster still.

Even worse, the orbit of Mars is elliptical (think of a slight oval rather than a perfect circle), which means that sometimes the planet is closer to the sun than average (so it orbits more quickly, and the clocks slow) and that sometimes it's farther out (so it orbits more slowly, and the clocks run faster).

The equations covering all this are fierce, to say the least. After some serious numerical plugging and computational chugging, however, scientists found that, on average, a clock on Mars will run about 477.6 microseconds faster per day than a clock on Earth. But that's really on average! The change in orbital distance and motion applies a variation of about plus or minus 113 microseconds over the course of a Martian year, which means clocks there can run ahead of Earth's anywhere between 364 to 590 microseconds per day.

That's not much, in everyday terms. A typical human blink has a duration of about 165 milliseconds, which is more than 300 times longer than the Martian clock offset! So this won't affect your daily sol, but scientists routinely need to measure times much faster than this. Like GPS on Earth, there would be effects taken for granted by any future planetary explorers; for example, synchronizing earthly and Martian Internet connections would require this relativistic correction. And if we ever need to build a robust GPS for Mars, a variation on these calculations will have to be applied as well, lest any users on the ground get lost in the red dust.

At some point—maybe not soon but someday—humans may live on Mars and will need to sync their clocks to those on Earth. By then, that shouldn't be too hard—relatively speaking.

In a First, Photos Show Moths Sipping a Moose's Tears

Moths sometimes drink the tears of other animals, but the behavior has mostly been observed in the tropics. New photographs show only the second observation outside of that area

By Gennaro Tomma edited by Andrea Thompson

Moths hover around the face of a moose, drinking its tears, as seen in trail camera images from the Green Mountain National Forest in Vermont.

When animals cry, moths start licking their chops.

The less glamorous relatives of butterflies have been known to use their long proboscis to sip the tears of everything from birds to reptiles to even domestic animals. But the behavior, known as lachryphagy, has been mostly observed in the tropics.

Now, for the first time, researchers have documented moths drinking the tears of a moose—just the second time the behavior has been documented outside of the tropics. (The other was observed with a horse in Arkansas.)

Laurence Clarfeld, a researcher in the Vermont Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit at the University of Vermont, came across the sighting by chance while scrolling through trail camera images from the Green Mountain National Forest in Vermont for an unrelated project. “It almost looked like the moose had two [additional] eyes,” he says. “At first, I wasn't sure what it was.”

Only after skimming through the sequence of images did he realize he was looking at moths drinking the tears of a bull moose. “I'd looked at a lot of trail camera images. I'd never seen anything like that before,” he says. The findings were published recently in Ecosphere. A colleague recently filmed another instance of moths drinking a moose's tears in Vermont.

Moths—and some other insects, such as bees—are thought to feed on other animals' tears to get minerals and other nutrients.

The rarity of documentation outside of the tropics might simply be because “not a lot of scientists are looking in these places,” says entomologist Akito Kawahara, director of the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity at the Florida Museum of Natural History.

But the reason might be more concerning. “The number of moth species and individual abundance of species is declining pretty significantly in many places,” Kawahara, who was not involved in the new research, says. “So it's also possible that we just don't see many more because there aren't that many anymore.”

The Taş Tepeler region of archaeological sites in Türkiye has yielded more artifacts that were possibly associated with funerary customs.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Echoes of some of the oldest established human settlements remain in what is now the Taş Tepeler region of Türkiye. Literally meaning “Stone Hills,” it has been a trove of ancient artifacts originating from sites such as Göbeklitepe, Karahantepe, Sefertepe and Sayburc. Unearthed in its rocky landscape are figures and carvings that whisper of rituals and beliefs that shaped the lives of Neolithic people who lived 12,000 years ago.

Archaeologists excavating these sites were taken aback by how advanced these people's sense of social organization was. Excavations have been ongoing for five years, and in that time, they have unearthed obelisks, stelae, stone figures, and the remnants of what were once thriving communities in whcih groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers settled permanently as the environment became more fertile. 

Taş Tepeler has recently revealed some particularly intriguing objects. Human sculptures, some with possible funerary associations, offer a glimpse into how an early society viewed (and coped with) death.

Maybe the most striking figure was found at Sayburc—a human bust, carved with what appear to be ribs and a mouth that has been stitched shut (and can be seen here). It is thought that this carving is of a deceased individual, and that the stitched mouth is a visual metaphor for the silence of death. It might be the face of an ancestor, or have had a ritual use that is still unknown. Because this and other figures discovered at Taş Tepeler were made before writing began in the region, identifying who or what the carvings represent is difficult.

The figure is “an impressive example of the aesthetic and expressive sculptural tradition of the Neolithic period,” Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, minister of Culture and Tourism, told Türkiye Today, adding that it opens up “an opportunity to reassess prehistoric concepts of death beyond burials and skull traditions.”

Hardly anything was known about Neolithic funeral customs in Türkiye until the discovery of a skull in Sefertepe last year. Burials were secondary, meaning that the dead were left to decompose until only skeletons were left. Previously discovered bones showed cut marks and burns that suggested a type of ritual practice. When the skull appeared in a stone cavity, lying on its side, it told archeologists that it must have had special significance, and was displayed in an area intended for it before those practices were carried out. (It was already known that skulls were separated and possibly hung outside before the second burial.)

Whether the figure with the stitched lips had any association with a second burial is unknown. Also found at Sefertepe were two human faces carved out of stone, along with a black serpentinite bead with carvings of faces on both sides—all of which are stylistically different from human images at other Taş Tepeler sites. As suggested by slight variations in the structure of the brow and nose and the curvature of the cheek, the people of Sefertepe may have had their own way of depicting the human face. Another human figure found at Göbeklitepe, known more for its sculptures of animals, was embedded in a wall (possibly as an offering).

Early foundations of social stratification and family life are evidenced in Taş Tepeler. Because the fertility of the land after the last Ice Age allowed communities to feed themselves without hunting frequently, the population grew, explaining the expansion of human settlements. When there was surplus of food, people producing it gained wealth. Those who could not produce as much food, or whose harvests were not as plentiful, were seen as having a lower social status. Structures that used to be living spaces also showed that religious and domestic spaces frequently merged.

As artifacts continue to be recovered, Ersoy sees Taş Tepeler as a region that “will be recognized as the Neolithic capital of the world.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Unlimited Energy Is Closer Than Ever, Thanks to This Nuclear Reactor's Breakthrough ‘First Heartbeat'","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a69698313/cold-criticality-unlimited-clean-energy/","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:46:00 GMT","

“America should be thrilled.”  

Scientists just brought us one step closer to the dream of unlimited power. On November 17 at the Nevada National Security Site, a nuclear energy startup called Valar Atomics achieved zero-power criticality, a crucial step in nuclear energy development. 

Also known as cold criticality, the term refers to a self-sustaining chemical reaction of uranium-235, a radioactive uranium isotope. As the name suggests, cold criticality means the fission system doesn't reach full operating temperatures (which are hotter than 1300°F), and therefore doesn't generate power. Instead, cold criticality is the foundational step that precedes operational status. Still, the recent achievement is an opportunity for researchers to understand the behavior of the core, which could mean we're closer than ever to unlocking true unlimited energy. 

“Zero power criticality is a reactor's first heartbeat, proof the physics holds,” Isaiah Taylor, founder and CEO of Valar Atomics, says in a press release. Taylor believes this achievement is ushering in “the dawn of a new era in American engineering”—one that he believes will evolve rapidly. 

🔮 Check Out Our New Video Series, Pop Mech Explains: PrecognitionYou've probably had that eerie feeling before—knowing what's about to happen before it actually does. Flashes of deja vu. A text from someone you were just thinking about. A dream predicting the future. Coincidence? Or something deeper? Across four chapters, we investigate the science and speculation behind those “gut feelings.” Go Down the Rabbit Hole With Us 

The recent tests are a part of Project NOVA (Nuclear Observation of Valar Atomics), a campaign to verify the physics of cold criticality. The startup worked in partnership with the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) National Criticality Experiments Research Center (NCERC), which has its roots in the Manhattan Project, the program that developed nuclear weapons during World War II. Valar Atomics designed the central part of the core, which features a high-temperature gas reactor (HTR) design. Typically, HTR cores rely on helium gas and ceramic material to stabilize the fission, or atom splitting, process.

Valar Atomics' success is also part of a larger national effort in the United States. The DOE's Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program seeks to expedite the nuclear reactor testing process, attempting to reinstate the U.S. as a global leader in nuclear energy. The current goal of the program is for several advanced reactors to reach full criticality—or operational status—by July 4, 2026.  

As exciting as the recent achievement may seem for proponents of nuclear energy, there are still many obstacles for Valar Atomics to clear before its reactors are viable for commercial use. 

“It is much easier to achieve a zero-power criticality than to actually make power in a reactor. There's a huge technical gap between those things,” Taylor confesses in an interview with Inc. “But I certainly wouldn't underestimate the value of the data that we're going to get out of this test.”

According to the press release, zero-power criticality experiments allow the research team to better understand the core's “neutronic behavior,” which is simply the physics of the reactor. The team is also studying variables such as the reactivity control, or the rate of reactions within the core, and burnable poisons, which act as buffers in reactors.  

Next, the Valar Atomics team will test their core at extreme temperatures and progressively higher power levels. The reactor will also have to undergo safety and regulatory processes with the DOE, according to the Valar Atomics communications team. Should the U.S. achieve its goal and see several reactors reach full criticality by this summer, it would allow the country to “to stay competitive in AI, rebuild industrial capacity, keep a stable grid, maintain reasonable prices, and cut emissions at the same time,” the team explains. 

However, two major hurdles remain for clean, commercial nuclear energy: scaling the reactors to industrial sizes and actually harnessing power for the grid. Still, progress must start somewhere, and Valar Atomics' recent experiments are a promising test run.  

Max Ukropina, head of projects Valar Atomics, puts it simply in the release: “America should be thrilled, but wanting more.”

Right down to the Holy Grail ... almost.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The sandstone cliff faces of the ancient city of Petra (one of the New Seven Wonders of the World) have long been in the archaeological limelight. They've even spent time in the Hollywood limelight as the location for several scenes in the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. But in a recent on-screen appearance—and no offense to Harrison Ford's iconic professor—they were the site of a very real discovery.

Discovery Channel's popular show “Expedition Unknown” was on site to document the discovery of 12 human skeletons and artifacts dating back at least 2,000 years, which had all been long hidden beneath the famed Khazneh (or “Treasury”) in Petra. The colossal find was accomplished by a team lead by archaeologist Pearce Paul Creasman.

It's a find that, were he real, Indiana Jones would certainly be proud of. 

“This is a hugely rare discovery,” said Josh Gates, host of the Discovery Channel's program, according to CNN. “In the two centuries that Petra has been investigated by archaeologists, nothing like this has been found before. Even in front of one of the most famous buildings in the world … there are still huge discoveries to be made.” 

Creasman, executive director of the American Center of Research, employed ground-penetrating radar to first see if it was possibile that additional tombs were located at the site. The gathered data matched up to data collected from areas where tombs had been found in the past, and the Jordan government gave the approval for excavation beneath the world-famous site. 

The team was beyond pleased to see an actual tomb materialize, and truly shocked by the fact that it was full of remains and artifacts—many of the tombs at the ancient city have been found empty, picked clean long ago. 

Along with the 12 sets of skeletal remains—several of the bones from which had mold, thanks to the porous sandstone allowing moisture into the space in the flood-prone area—the team found a mix of bronze, iron, and ceramic artifacts. This included one ceramic chalice tucked in the arms of one of the deceased, ironically reminiscent of the “Holy Grail” depicted in The Last Crusade. “It really was this awesome moment,” Gates said, “of history imitating art.” 

The Treasury, located near the main entrance to the city, is believed to be at least 2,000 years old. It is a striking mausoleum carved into the sandstone cliffs that has long attracted tourists aplenty, but dating this iconic monument has proven difficult because of the lack of finds within the tombs. 

“We were hopeful to find anything that might tell us more about the ancient people and place,” Creasman said. For instance, Gates believes that the individuals buried in the newly discovered tomb show must have been of very high status because of the prime real estate used for the burial place.“Human remains,” Creasman continued, “can be a really valuable tool in that regard. The burials in this tomb are articulated, so the bones haven't been rummaged around and moved, so that's exceedingly rare.” 

Delving deeper into the remains and artifacts found in the tomb could open additional information about the Khazneh, Petra, and the lives of the Nabataeans who once inhabited the area. “I think learning who they are,” Gates said, “is really going to help unlock part of the story of the Treasury.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","China Planted 78 Billion New Trees—and Seriously Messed Up Its Water Cycle","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a69638301/china-reforesting-changed-hydrology/","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:30:00 GMT","

China's planted a bunch of new trees since 1981, but that extra foliage is shifting more precipitation to some areas while drying out others.

Here's what you'll learn when reading this story:

It's no secret that China is particularly adept at building things. The world's largest dam? In China. Largest high-speed rail network? That'd be China. Largest wind farm? China. Solar Array? Argentina. Really? Nope, it's also China. Largest ancient landmark? You get the picture.

Alongside all of that building, China has also been growing. Taking inspiration from that last infrastructure accolade, China began growing the Three-North Shelterbelt, or “The Great Green Wall,” in 1978 as an effort to combat soil erosion and decrease desert storms. The project, the country's state-sponsored media announced, was finally complete as of last year. 

According to Reuters, China grew 116,000 square miles of trees, increasing the country's total forest coverage from 10 percent in 1949 to roughly 25 percent in 2024. But a new study published in the journal Earth's Future, shows that all those additional trees (roughly 78 billion since the early 80s, by some estimates) come with some unforeseen consequences for China's water distribution. 

Scientists from Tianjin University, China Agricultural University in Beijing, and Utrecht University in the Netherlands found that between 2001 and 2020, increased vegetation reduced water resources in both the eastern monsoon region and the northwestern arid region. That's a big deal, considering these areas make up roughly 74 percent of China's total land area, according to Live Science.

According to the study, regreening efforts like the Great Green Wall—along with other tree-planting initiatives, such as Grain for Green Program and the Natural Forest Protection Program, with both started in 1999—have increased evapotranspiration, which is a portmanteau of evaporation and transpiration (the process through which plants release water vapor through tiny pores known as stomata). 

“These shifts caused changes in precipitation, directing more moisture to the Tibetan Plateau, which saw an increase in water availability,” the authors wrote. “In contrast, eastern and northwestern China experienced a decrease in water availability, with the northwest losing the most due to substantial moisture moving to the Tibetan Plateau.”

By studying these rapid land use/cover changes (LUCC), the authors also note that certain zone transitions—such as grasslands-to-forests or croplands-to-grasslands—impacted evapotranspiration, precipitation rates, and water availability at varying rates. For example, grasslands transformed into forests increased evapotranspiration and precipitation, but negatively impacted water availability. 

Unfortunately, China's water availability isn't conveniently distributed for its population. According to the study, the country's northern regions contain roughly 46 percent of its population and more than half of the arable land, but only 20 percent of water availability. The authors argue that these altered hydrological cycles need to be taken into account when planning future reforestation efforts. 

“Our findings highlight that land cover changes can redistribute water resources between regions,” the authors wrote. “Understanding these effects is crucial for planning sustainable land and water management in China.”

A natural chemical in dark chocolate may play a role in slowing certain signs of biological aging. Researchers at King's College London have identified theobromine, a plant compound found in cocoa, as a possible contributor to this effect.

The study, published on December 10 in Aging, analyzed how much theobromine was present in participants' blood and compared those levels with biological aging markers measured in blood samples.

What Biological Age Reveals

Biological age reflects how well a person's body is functioning, rather than the number of years they have lived. This measure is based on DNA methylation, a collection of tiny chemical tags on DNA that shift as we grow older.

The research team examined data from two European groups, including 509 people from TwinsUK and 1,160 from KORA. Individuals with higher amounts of theobromine in their bloodstream tended to have a biological age that appeared younger than their chronological age.

Professor Jordana Bell, senior author and Professor in Epigenomics at King's College London, said: ""Our study finds links between a key component of dark chocolate and staying younger for longer. While we're not saying that people should eat more dark chocolate, this research can help us understand how everyday foods may hold clues to healthier, longer lives.""

Theobromine Stands Out Among Cocoa Compounds

The team also investigated whether other cocoa or coffee metabolites showed similar patterns. Their results suggested that theobromine was the only compound with this specific association.

To estimate biological age, the researchers used two approaches. One method examined DNA changes that reflect the pace of aging. The second measured telomere length, which refers to protective structures at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres naturally shorten with age and are linked to age-related health risks.

How Plant Molecules Influence Aging

Many plant compounds in foods can influence how genes operate by turning them on or off. These compounds, known as alkaloids, can interact with cellular systems that regulate gene activity and contribute to long-term health.

Theobromine is one such alkaloid. Although it is widely known for being toxic to dogs, it has been connected to possible benefits in humans, including a reduced risk of heart disease. Despite this, it has received relatively limited scientific attention until now.

Next Questions for Aging Research

Dr. Ramy Saad, lead researcher at King's College London and also affiliated with University College London as a doctor in Clinical Genetics, said: ""This is a very exciting finding, and the next important questions are what is behind this association and how can we explore the interactions between dietary metabolites and our epigenome further? This approach could lead us to important discoveries towards aging, and beyond, in common and rare diseases.""

The team, which includes Professor Ana Rodriguez-Mateos, a Professor of Human Nutrition at King's College London, is now examining whether theobromine's effect occurs on its own or if it works alongside other well-known components of dark chocolate such as polyphenols, which are recognized for their positive effects on health.

Why More Chocolate Is Not a Shortcut

Dr. Ricardo Costeira, a Postdoctoral Research Associate at King's College London, said: ""This study identifies another molecular mechanism through which naturally occurring compounds in cocoa may support health. While more research is needed, the findings from this study highlight the value of population-level analyses in aging and genetics.""

Although the findings are encouraging, the researchers caution that increasing dark chocolate consumption is not automatically beneficial. Chocolate also contains sugar, fat and other ingredients, and more work is needed to fully understand how theobromine interacts with the body and how it may influence aging.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists reveal the real benefits and hidden risks of medical cannabis","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251211100620.htm","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 13:17:02 GMT","

Medical cannabis is widely used for issues such as chronic pain, anxiety and insomnia, but a major analysis led by UCLA Health reports that the scientific support for these uses remains weak.

A study published in JAMA examined more than 2,500 scientific papers released from January 2010 through September 2025, including randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses and clinical guidelines. Over 120 of these studies were given priority based on sample size, recency, relevance and the range of health conditions they addressed. Interest in cannabis and related compounds such as CBD has steadily increased, and a 2018 survey found that 27% of adults in the U.S. and Canada had used them for concerns like pain, anxiety and sleep.

Public Belief Outpaces Current Scientific Evidence

According to first author Dr. Michael Hsu of UCLA Health, many people assume cannabis provides reliable medical benefits, yet recent research does not fully support those assumptions.

""While many people turn to cannabis seeking relief, our review highlights significant gaps between public perception and scientific evidence regarding its effectiveness for most medical conditions"" said Hsu, health sciences clinical assistant professor at the UCLA Health Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences. ""Clear guidance from clinicians is essential to support safe, evidence-based decision-making when discussing medical cannabis with their patients.""

Proven Benefits Remain Narrow

The review found that only specific pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoid products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have demonstrated clear clinical benefits. These medications are limited to certain conditions, including HIV/AIDS-related appetite loss, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and severe pediatric seizure disorders such as Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

For many other health problems, the available evidence remains uncertain or insufficient. Although more than half of medical cannabis users try it for chronic pain, current clinical guidelines do not recommend cannabis-based treatments as the first option for pain management.

Potential Health Risks Identified

The analysis also examined safety concerns. Long-term studies in adolescents showed that high-potency cannabis may be associated with higher rates of psychotic symptoms (12.4% versus 7.1% for low-potency) and generalized anxiety disorder (19.1% versus 11.6%).

Around 29% of medical cannabis users also met the criteria for cannabis use disorder. Daily consumption, especially of inhaled or high-potency products, may contribute to cardiovascular problems, including elevated risks of coronary heart disease, heart attack and stroke when compared with non-daily use.

Guidance for Clinicians

The review recommends that clinicians screen for cardiovascular disease and psychotic disorders, consider possible drug interactions and evaluate whether potential harms outweigh the benefits before recommending THC-containing products.

""Patients deserve honest conversations about what the science does and doesn't tell us about medical cannabis,"" Hsu said.

Study Limitations and the Need for More Research

The authors acknowledged several limitations. The analysis was not a systemic review, and no formal risk of bias assessment was completed. Some of the research included was observational and may have been influenced by confounding factors. Clinical trial findings may also not apply to every patient due to differences in study design, participant characteristics and the cannabis products evaluated.

""Further research is crucial to better understand the potential benefits and risks of medical cannabis. By supporting more rigorous studies, we can provide clearer guidance and improve clinical care for patients,"" said Dr. Hsu.

Researchers from Harvard, UC San Francisco, Washington University School of Medicine, and New York University contributed to the study.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","NAD+ supplement shows early promise for long COVID fatigue and brain fog","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251211100629.htm","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 03:45:56 GMT","

Long COVID continues to disrupt millions of lives, especially through persistent neurological symptoms like fatigue, sleep problems, and brain fog. Researchers tested whether raising NAD+ levels with high-dose nicotinamide riboside could help restore energy metabolism and ease symptoms. While the randomized trial didn't show major differences in cognitive scores between treatment and placebo groups, participants who took NR for at least 10 weeks reported improvements in fatigue, sleep, mood, and some executive function tasks. The results highlight both the complexity of long COVID and a promising direction for future therapies focused on cellular energy and inflammation.

Chao-Yi Wu, PhD, OT, from the Department of Neurology and Edmarie Guzmán-Vélez, PhD, of the Department of Psychiatry at Mass General Brigham, are the lead and senior authors of a paper published in eClinicalMedicine, ""Effects of Nicotinamide Riboside on NAD+ Levels, Cognition, and Symptom Recovery in Long-COVID: A Randomized Controlled Trial.""

Q: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience?

Millions of people worldwide continue to experience lingering symptoms after COVID-19, a condition known as long COVID. These symptoms can affect people of all ages and often include neurological issues such as ""brain fog,"" which makes thinking and memory difficult. Because these problems can significantly disrupt daily life, researchers are working to find effective treatments.

Our clinical trial tested whether raising levels of NAD+ -- a molecule that helps cells produce energy -- through nicotinamide riboside (NR), a form of vitamin B3, could improve health outcomes. Participants took NR supplements for up to 20 weeks, and we tracked changes over time.

Q: What question were you investigating? 

The NAD+ molecule is present in all human cells and is essential for energy production, immune function and inflammation control. Previous research suggests COVID-19 may interfere with NAD+-related biological processes, possibly contributing to neurological symptoms.

In our study, we wanted to know if boosting NAD+ through NR supplementation could improve cognitive function and ease common long COVID symptoms.

Q: What methods or approach did you use?

We ran a 24-week clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital between August 2021 and September 2023. We enrolled 58 people with long COVID and randomly split them into two groups:

To ensure unbiased results, neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was getting the real supplement at first.

We measured NAD+ levels through blood tests and asked participants to complete surveys and cognitive tests about memory, sleep, fatigue and mood at the beginning, at 10 weeks and at 20 weeks.

Q: What did you find?

Of the 58 people who joined the study, 37 started NR right away, and 21 began with the placebo. Only 18 people completed the full 22-week protocol. The others left the study for reasons such as getting COVID again, moving, changing medications or experiencing possible side effects.

When we compared the two groups, we didn't see major differences in thinking or memory scores, which were the main focuses of the study. Other symptoms like fatigue, sleep and mood also didn't show big differences between groups.

However, in exploratory post hoc analyses with a slightly larger sample size of everyone who took NR for at least 10 weeks, we observed improvements in self-reported fatigue, sleep, and depressive symptoms after 10 weeks of NR supplementation compared to baseline. Some also performed better on a task of executive functioning, a set of mental skills that help us, for example, plan, organize, and switch between tasks. This suggests that some people may benefit from the use of NR, even if the overall results didn't show clear differences between groups.

Q: What are the implications?

Long COVID affects an estimated 400 million people worldwide, yet its causes remain unclear. In this study, high-dose NR safely boosted NAD+ levels. While results were mixed, findings suggest that boosting NAD+ may play a role in easing symptoms like fatigue and poor sleep for some people. This points to a promising direction for future treatments.

The most common side effects were mild, such as easy bruising or rash. None were serious, and only a few participants discontinued due to side effects

Q: What are the next steps?

Future studies should include larger and more diverse groups to confirm these findings and identify who benefits most. For example, do men and women respond differently? Are people with lower baseline NAD+ levels or higher inflammation more likely to improve? Because long COVID often involves inflammation, an important question is whether boosting NAD+ can help reduce it.

We also plan to analyze physical activity data collected during the trial, as well as examine whether other supplements taken by participants influenced NR's effects.

In addition to Guzmán-Vélez, Mass General Brigham authors include William Cody Reynolds, Isabel Abril, Alison J. McManus, Charles Brenner, Gabriel González-Irizarry, Leidys Gutiérrez-Martínez, Jonathan Rosand, Rudolph E. Tanzi, and Steven Arnold.

Long COVID (LC) involves a spectrum of chronic symptoms after acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Current hypotheses for the pathogenesis of LC include persistent virus, tissue damage, autoimmunity, endocrine insufficiency, immune dysfunction and complement activation. We performed immunological, virological, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses from a cohort of 142 individuals between 2020 and 2021, including uninfected controls (n = 35), acutely infected individuals (n = 54), convalescent controls (n = 24) and patients with LC (n = 28). The LC group was characterized by persistent immune activation and proinflammatory responses for more than 180 days after initial infection compared with convalescent controls, including upregulation of JAK-STAT, interleukin-6, complement, metabolism and T cell exhaustion pathways. Similar findings were observed in a second cohort enrolled between 2023 and 2024, including convalescent controls (n = 20) and patients with LC (n = 18). These data suggest that LC is characterized by persistent activation of chronic inflammatory pathways, suggesting new therapeutic targets and potential biomarkers of disease.

Long COVID (LC), also known as post-acute sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (PASC) or post-COVID-19 condition (PCC), is characterized by multi-organ symptoms that can persist for months or years after recovery from acute COVID-19 infection1,2,3,4,5. LC prevalence estimates vary widely; some estimates of the percentage of those infected with COVID-19 who develop LC are more than 10% (ref. 2). Risk factors for LC include the severity of the acute infection, age, sex and preexisting health conditions; the most common symptoms are fatigue, brain fog, exercise intolerance and cognitive impairment4,6.

The pathophysiology of LC1,7,8,9,10,11 remains unclear but may involve increased complement activation, metabolomic abnormalities, endocrine insufficiency, inflammatory responses and uncoordinated immune responses3,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Current hypotheses include persistent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or viral remnants20,21, autoimmunity4,7,22,23, cortisol insufficiency12,24, latent herpesvirus reactivation25, metabolic dysfunction19,22,26,27, T cell dysregulation28 and inflammatory tissue damage2,6,9,14,16,29,30,31,32,33. Given the diversity of signs and symptoms of LC, treatment is typically symptomatic and personalized, with an emphasis on rehabilitation. The STOP-PASC trial34 revealed that a 15-day course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir showed no significant improvement in treating LC (PASC) symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog and shortness of breath34, underlining the need for new therapeutic approaches for LC.

In this study, we evaluated the immunological and inflammatory responses in people with LC compared with convalescent controls (CCs) at 90–180 days and more than 180 days after initial COVID-19 infection using immunological assays, virological assays, transcriptomics and proteomics. The first cohort was enrolled in 2020–2021, and the second cohort was enrolled in 2023–2024. Our data show that chronic inflammation, T cell exhaustion, metabolic dysregulation and upregulation of the JAK-STAT and interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling pathways are key features of LC.

We evaluated samples from 142 participants who were enrolled in an observational cohort of the Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness (MassCPR) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston between April 2020 and October 2021 (hereafter the 2020–2021 cohort). This cohort included UCs (uninfected; n = 35), acutely infected individuals less than 30 days after COVID-19 infection (acute; n = 54), CCs (n = 24) and patients with LC (n = 28) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Clinical symptoms in the LC group included primarily shortness of breath, brain fog, fatigue, pain, cough and abnormal smell and taste (Fig. 1a), which is consistent with prior reports9,16,23,30,35,36,37,38,39,40. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected during the acute phase (<30 days) (LC: n = 6; CC: n = 5), 90–180 days (LC: n = 26; CC: n = 21) and more than 180 days (LC: n = 21; CC: n = 5) after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma samples were also collected during the acute phase (LC: n = 8; CC: n = 4), 90–180 days (LC: n = 22; CC: n = 8) and more than 180 days (LC: n = 19; CC: n = 6) after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed immunological and virological assays, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and plasma proteomics.

Samples from several time points were assessed for participants with LC. c, Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomic (N, E) and subgenomic (N single-guide RNA (sgRNA), E sgRNA) RNA in CCs (n = 9) and LCs (n = 41). Medians (red bars) are shown for each group. Samples from several time points were assessed for participants with LC. d, K-mean clustering across acute COVID-19 (n = 54), LCs (n = 28), CCs (n = 24) and uninfected (NC) (n = 35) individuals. All available samples were included in the k-mean analysis for the LC and CC groups. e, Heatmap of top significant (Padj < 0.05) proinflammatory genes upregulated (red) or downregulated (blue) in LCs compared to CCs or NCs at day 90–180 after SARS-CoV-2 infection. f, Transformed log2 fold change expression of the top upregulated (pink) and downregulated (dark) genes in LCs compared to CCs and NCs (Padj < 0.05).

Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses using luciferase (LUC)-based pseudovirus neutralization assays and T cell responses using pooled peptide interferon-γ (IFNγ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays against SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Delta and Omicron BA.1 in the CC and the LC groups did not detect differences in SARS-CoV-2 nAb titers and identified a trend toward higher Spike-specific IFNγ ELISpot responses in the LC compared with the CC group (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). We did not detect plasma SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in any CCs or individuals with LC using PCR with reverse transcription genomic or subgenomic viral load assays (Fig. 1c).

Bulk RNA-seq in PBMCs from individuals with LC (n = 26) and CCs (n = 21) at day 90–180 and in uninfected (n = 35) and acute (n = 54) individuals identified reads that mapped to the human genome and multiple common viruses (SARS-CoV-2, varicella zoster virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Epstein–Barr virus, human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, influenza virus, rotavirus). We did not detect significant differences in viral read counts for these common viruses in the LC compared with the CC group (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Unsupervised clustering of bulk RNA-seq transcriptomic data revealed a distinct stratification between the LC group and the other cohorts, whereas the CC group clustered with the UCs (Fig. 1d). Differential bulk RNA-seq gene expression analysis in PBMCs across these groups showed upregulation of multiple proinflammatory markers in the LC compared with the CC group and uninfected individuals, including chemokines and cytokines (CXCL2, CXCL3, CCL3, IL10, IFNG, IL6, TNF, IL1B, IL1A, NFKBIZ), the NLRP3 inflammasome and the complement and coagulation genes C5, F3 and THBS1 (Fig. 1e,f). In contrast, downregulation of activating (for example, KLRC2) and inhibitory (for example, KLRC1, KIR3DL2) natural killer (NK) cell receptors and T cell activation markers in the LC compared to the CC group was observed (Fig. 1f).

Analysis of differentially expressed genes in the LC group compared with the CC group at day 90–180 after infection identified an increase of multiple proinflammatory markers, such as IL6, NLRP3, TNF, JAK2, CSF2, IL1B and IL10, in the LC compared with the CC group (Fig. 2a). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of signatures associated with signaling by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ and IFNγ, JAK-STAT pathways, complement and coagulation cascade, metabolic pathways and immune cell signatures of monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells (Fig. 2b), while RNA processing and nitrogen metabolism, oxidative stress and amino acid transport, were decreased in the LC compared with the CC group (Fig. 2b). Additionally, transcriptomic signatures of T cell activation and differentiation (CD28, ICOS, TCF7) were downregulated in the LC compared with the CC group at day 90–180 after infection (Fig. 2b), while CD8+ T cell exhaustion signatures and programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD1) signaling-associated genes (IFI44, PRDM1, NR4A3, NFKBIA, MAFF) were significantly increased in the LC group (Fig. 2c), suggesting a potential role of T cell dysregulation in the pathogenesis of LC. Moreover, JAK1, JAK-STAT and IL-6 signaling pathways correlated inversely with T cell activation and positively with CD8+ T cell exhaustion and PD-1 signaling (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Signatures of T cell activation and differentiation were positively correlated with IFNγ ELISpot responses, whereas proinflammatory signaling and immune exhaustion signatures were negatively correlated with IFNγ ELISpot responses (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We observed a significant correlation between IL-6 and JAK-STAT signaling pathways with complement and coagulation pathways, metabolic signatures and PD-1 signaling in the LC group (Fig. 2d), suggesting a potentially coordinated role of these pathways in the pathogenesis of LC, while the IL-6 and JAK-STAT signaling pathways correlated negatively with the metabolism of amino acids and oxidative stress in the LC group (Fig. 2d). IFNγ, IL-6, JAK-STAT and T cell exhaustion pathways correlated with clinical symptoms in the group with LC, including fatigue, shortness of breath and cognitive complaints (Fig. 2e).

The red and blue lines indicate linear regression. The gray shading represents the 95% confidence interval (CI). P values are indicated. e, Heatmap of Spearman correlations between clinical symptoms and pathway activity levels in the LC group at day 90–180 after infection.

To investigate the timing of the chronic inflammatory pathways in the LC group in finer detail, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using blood samples collected at less than 30 days (LC, n = 6; CC, n = 5), day 30–100 (LC, n = 7; CC, n = 4), day 100–200 (LC, n = 22; CC, n = 5) and day 200–300 (LC, n = 22; CC, n = 6) after infection from individuals with LC and CCs. We observed upregulation of proinflammatory pathways associated with IL-1, IL-6, JAK-STAT, IFN signaling, cell cycle, metabolic pathways, complement activation and T cell exhaustion pathways in the LC group by day 30, with increased and sustained effects for over 200 days (Extended Data Fig. 3). Pathways associated with IL-6, JAK-STAT and JAK1 signaling were upregulated at both day 90–180 (Fig. 3a) and more than 180 days (Fig. 3b) in the LC group compared to the CC group, as highlighted by the persistent increase of several leading genes in the pathways, including IL6R, IL6, IL1R, CD14, CSF1, CSF3RLEPR, IL4R, STAT1, STAT3 and JAK2 (Fig. 3a,b). Weighted gene correlation network analysis revealed that individual markers of the JAK-STAT and IL-6 signaling pathways, including IL6R, AKT1, JAK2, IL1B, IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 and CD14 were highly correlated and positively associated with the subsequent development of LC (Fig. 3c).

We also performed proteomics analysis on plasma from the LC (n = 22) and CC (n = 8) groups at day 90–180 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 2). We observed increased levels of plasma cytokine signaling, including JAK-STAT (STAT5, STAT1, IL6ST, SOS1, RELB), IL-6, NF-κB signaling, complement and coagulation cascades (TMPRSS6, F8, C9, C1S, F9, C6, C1R, FN1), metabolic pathways (PTPN11, LEPR, PTEN, EIF4E) and corticotropin-releasing hormone and leptin signaling (TCF4, PRKCA, PRKCB, PLCG1) in the LC group compared to the CC group at day 90–180 after infection (Fig. 4a), while DNA damage repair (RAD51C, RAD51D, HUS1, MSH2, RPA2, PARP1, YY1, CETN2), cytotoxic T cell (DFFA, BCL2, FADD, B2M, CD3G, HLA-E, CD247, HLA-G, BID), telomere maintenance (PCNA, PRIM1, TEN1, RUVBL1, RPA2) and amino acid metabolism (GNMT, PDHB, DLD, AMT, PDHA2, BHMT2, GOT1, MRI1, GOT2, MTAP, CTH) were decreased in the LC group compared to the CC group at day 90–180 after infection (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the plasma JAK-STAT signaling pathways by proteomics correlated positively with plasma proinflammatory signatures such as the NF-κB signaling pathway, complement activation, leptin signaling and corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling, and correlated negatively with plasma DNA damage repair, cytotoxic T cell and granzyme B signaling in the LC group (Fig. 4b,c). These data indicated that LC is associated with chronic inflammation, as well as immunological and metabolic dysregulation.

To evaluate whether activation of proinflammatory pathways during acute COVID-19 infection correlated with the subsequent development of LC, we performed an exploratory analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic changes in the subset of participants in this cohort (LC: n = 8; CC: n = 5) who had PBMC and plasma samples both during acute COVID-19 (< 30 days) and at day 90–180 after infection. Transcriptomic profiling of PBMCs indicated that acutely infected participants who subsequently developed LC had higher levels of proinflammatory pathways such as IFNβ and IFNγ, JAK-STAT and IL-6 signaling, as well as innate immune cell signatures of monocytes neutrophils and complement and coagulation cascades (CCL3, CCL20, CD160, F13A1, F3, IL6, NR4A1, NLRP3, THBS1) during acute infection compared with acutely infected patients who fully recovered (CCs) (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Plasma proteomics profiling validated the significant increase of proinflammatory pathways (IL-6 signaling, complement cascade, leptin signaling pathway) during acute infection in participants who subsequently developed LC compared to those who recovered (CC) (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d).

To explore further the potential association between early activation of proinflammatory pathways during acute infection and the subsequent development of LC, we used a supervised random forest (RF) algorithm to identify key blood and plasma features during acute infection that predict the development of LC. This model revealed that gene expression and protein levels of complement activation, proinflammatory response, JAK-STAT, IL-6, IL-6-JAK-STAT3, IFNβ and IFNγ signaling pathways during acute infection were among the top predictors for the development of LC (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). A feature importance analysis revealed upregulation of the IL-6 and JAK-STAT signaling, corticotropin-releasing hormone, IL-10 and TNF signaling pathways during the acute phase were among the top predictors for the development of LC. Together, these observations suggested that early activation of proinflammatory pathways strongly predicted LC development based on gene and protein profiling.

To confirm our findings in an independent cohort with LC, we performed transcriptomics profiling of peripheral blood samples collected on days 15–700 after infection from individuals with LC (n = 18) and CCs (n = 20) who were enrolled at the BIDMC clinical site of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) RECOVER prospective clinical trial between October 2022 and December 2024 (hereafter the 2023–2024 cohort) (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3). All study participants had standardized clinical meta-data and responded to structured symptom questionnaires41 (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Table 3). Pain, neurological symptoms, brain fog, fatigue and cough were the primary symptoms that were more frequent in the LC compared with the CC groups (Fig. 5a). Transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood in the LC (n = 10) and CC (n = 12) groups at day 90–180 after infection indicated upregulation of pathways linked to proinflammatory cytokine signaling (IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 signaling), complement activation, proinflammatory immune cell signaling, signatures of T cell exhaustion and certain metabolic and immune regulation pathways in the LC compared with the CC group (Fig. 5b). In contrast, pathways associated with mitochondrial function, amino acid metabolism and signatures of NK cells, T cells and B cells were downregulated in the LC compared with the CC group (Fig. 5b). In line with observations from the 2020–2021 cohort, the IL-6, JAK-STAT and JAK1 signaling pathways remained persistently upregulated in the LC group both at day 90–180 and more than 180 days compared to the CC group (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d).

Dots represent participants; the red horizontal bars indicate the group medians. A two-sided Kruskal–Wallis tests with post hoc pairwise comparisons using Dunn's test with Bonferroni correction was used. Padj values are shown.

We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assays to evaluate the plasma levels of selected proinflammatory markers at day 90–180 (LC, n = 19; CC, n = 13), more than 180 days (LC, n = 19; CC, n = 13) and UCs (n = 13) in the 2023–2024 cohort (Fig. 5c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6). Plasma levels of IL-6R were significantly elevated in the LC group compared to the CC and UC groups at day 90–180 and more than 180 days using ELISA (Fig. 5c) and MSD (Fig. 5d), suggesting a link between chronic inflammation and LC8,12,16,33.

We next combined data from the 2020–2021 and 2023–2024 cohorts and performed an RF analysis using the gene expression profiles at day 90–180 and day 180–365 after infection to define the pathways that correlated most robustly with LC compared with CC. For each time point, RF models were trained using gene sets corresponding to individual pathway modules, and performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) metrics. Pathways related to IL-6, JAK-STAT, IFNγ, proinflammatory response, antigen presentation and activation, and complement cascade were the top pathways associated with LC status at day 90–180 (Fig. 6a) and day 180–365 (Extended Data Fig. 7). Individual markers within the IL-6 and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, including JAK1, PIK3, CXCL8, BCL2L1, OSM, MAP3K8 and STAT3 were the top genes associated with LC (Fig. 6b).

a, ROC curves showing the AUC from the RF analysis of individual biological pathways at day 90–180 after infection. b, Bar plot showing the top key genes identified using the RF analysis. The genes are ranked in descending order of importance for each pathway with respect to the accuracy of the model.

Finally, in an exploratory sex-stratified analysis at day 90–180 after infection, using transcriptomic profiling in peripheral blood in the combined cohort, females with LC (n = 29) showed stronger enrichment of inflammatory pathways than females who recovered (CC, n = 14), including monocyte signatures, proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, IL-6, JAK1, JAK-STAT signaling, and T cell exhaustion (Extended Data Fig. 8a). In the LC group, these pathways were generally higher in females than males (Extended Data Fig. 8b), whereas no significant sex differences were detected within the CC group (Extended Data Fig. 8c). These data demonstrate persistent activation of proinflammatory pathways in a validation LC cohort, with possibly greater inflammation in females compared with males, although these observations require confirmation in larger studies.

In this study, we found that individuals with LC were characterized by persistent activation of chronic inflammatory pathways compared with CCs. These pathways included proinflammatory cytokine signaling, complement activation, metabolic dysregulation and immune exhaustion and persisted for more than 180 days. These findings suggest that chronic inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of LC and define potential new therapeutic targets.

We observed that participants with LC exhibited reduced granzyme B and cytotoxic T cell signaling and increased immune exhaustion, suggesting dysregulated cross-talk between the innate and adaptive immune responses15,28,42. Our findings are consistent with prior reports that the IL-6 and JAK-STAT signaling pathways were upregulated in individuals with LC28,43,44, particularly in those with cardiorespiratory or multisystem symptoms. We also found that chronic upregulation of IFNγ signaling was associated with LC and correlated with signatures of reduced T cell activation and increased T cell exhaustion, suggesting that chronic immune stimulation may lead to functional impairment of T cells. These findings are consistent with prior observations5,28 and suggest the potential role of T cell dysregulation and exhaustion in LC pathogenesis.

Our study also confirms and extends prior reports of metabolic dysregulation in LC1,8,10,12,19,22,26,30,33. We observed a decrease in amino acid metabolism and an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling, leptin signaling, fatty acid metabolism, bile acid and beta-alanine metabolism in LC. Moreover, these metabolic pathways correlated with proinflammatory pathways in the LC group, suggesting a link between metabolic dysregulation and chronic inflammation. We also observed decreased activity of the telomere maintenance and DNA damage recognition and repair pathways, chromatin regulation and DNA methylation in the LC group. Impaired telomere maintenance could be associated with premature cellular senescence or apoptosis that may impede tissue repair processes45,46.

Our study is limited by relatively small cohorts of individuals with LC who were predominantly female and with symptom clusters that primarily involved fatigue, brain fog and pain. Larger studies from more diverse populations will be required to assess the generalizability of our findings. Nevertheless, we observed good concordance between the 2020–2021 initial cohort and the 2023–2024 validation cohort. Another limitation is the use of bulk RNA-seq, which limits more detailed resolution of pathways at the cellular level. Therefore, future studies should use single-cell transcriptomic and T cell profiling technologies to provide higher-resolution data. Nevertheless, our observations suggest potential therapeutic targets for LC that could be explored in clinical trials. Because the IL-6 and JAK-STAT pathways were among the top upregulated pathways in participants with LC in both the 2020–2021 and the 2023–2024 cohorts, we have initiated a clinical trial to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the JAK1 inhibitor abrocitinib for LC (NCT06597396).

In conclusion, our data demonstrate that LC is characterized by chronic inflammation, immune exhaustion and metabolic dysregulation. Current therapeutic efforts are largely focused on antiviral agents to address potential residual viral replication. However, the lack of efficacy of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in treating LC highlights the need to explore alternative therapeutic strategies34. Our data suggests that the JAK-STAT and IL-6 pathways, and the IFN and metabolic pathways, are potential therapeutic targets that could be evaluated for LC.

The 2020–2021 cohort samples were collected between April 2020 and October 2021 as part of the MassCPR COVID-19 biorepository. This discovery cohort of 142 individuals included UCs (n = 35, 51% female and 49% male), acutely infected individuals (n = 54, 50% female and 50% male), CCs (n = 24, 60% female and 40% male) and patients with LC (n = 28, 86% female and 14% male). Samples were collected during the acute phase (< 30 days after infection) and during the chronic phase between 30 and 300 days after infection.

The 2023–2024 validation cohort samples were collected between October 2022 and December 2024 as part of the BIDMC biorepository jointly with the BIDMC clinical site of the NIH RECOVER study with the complete clinical meta-data and structured symptom questionnaires. This validation cohort of 38 individuals included CCs (n = 20, 55% female and 45% male) and patients with LC (n = 18, 78% female and 22% male). Samples were collected during the acute phase (< 30 days after infection) and during the chronic phase between 30 and 700 days after infection.

Symptoms in the 2020–2021 cohort were self-reported, whereas symptoms in the 2023–2024 cohort were collected with the RECOVER standardized symptom questionnaire. All samples were collected as part of the MassCPR, RECOVER and BIDMC biorepository studies with institutional review board approval and participant informed written consent. De-identified and cryopreserved samples were used in this study.

The nAb titers against the SARS-CoV-2 variants were determined using pseudotyped viruses expressing a LUC reporter gene. In brief, a LUC reporter plasmid pLenti-CMV Puro-Luc (Addgene), the packaging construct psPAX2 (AIDS Resource and Reagent Program) and Spike protein expressing pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV-2 SΔCT were cotransfected into human HEK 293T cells (CRL-3216, ATCC) with lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Pseudotyped viruses of the SARS-CoV-2 variants were generated using the Spike protein from WA1/2020 (Wuhan/WIV04/2019, GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_402124), B.1.617.2 (Delta, GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_2020950) and Omicron BA.1 (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_7358094.2). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the supernatants containing the pseudotyped viruses were collected and purified using filtration with 0.45-μm filter. To determine nAb titers in human sera, HEK-293T-hACE2 cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well overnight. Three-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum samples were prepared and mixed with 60 μl of pseudovirus and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before adding to the HEK-293T-hACE2 cells. Forty-eight hours later, cells were lysed in Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega Corporation) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers were defined as the sample dilution at which a 50% reduction (NT50) in relative light units was observed relative to the average of the virus control wells. Titers greater than 1:20 were considered positive.

Cellular immune responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 were assessed using IFNγ ELISpot assays using pools of overlapping 15-amino-acid peptides for the Wisconsin delta and omicron variants (21st Century Biochemicals). Ninety-six-well multiscreen plates (Merck Millipore) were coated with 1 µg per well of mouse antihuman IFNγ (MabTech) overnight in endotoxin-free Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with DPBS three times and blocked using Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 media containing 10% FCS for 2–4 h at 37 °C. Peptides pools were prepared at a concentration of 2 µg per well, and 200,000 cells per well were added. Peptides and cells were incubated for 15–20 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed with DPBS-Tween seven times and then incubated with 1 µg ml−1 per well of biotinylated antihuman IFNγ (MabTech) for 2–4 h at room temperature, followed by four washes with DPBS-Tween and 1.33 µg ml−1 per well of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-biotin (Rockland) for 2–3 h at room temperature. Plates were developed with nitroblue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate chromogen (Pierce), stopped by washing with tap water, and read using an ELISpot reader (KS ELISPOT Reader, Carl Zeiss). The number of spot-forming cells per 106 cells were calculated, subtracted over background (PBMCs incubated with medium and dimethylsulfoxide without peptide).

PBMCs were lysed in 700 μl of TRIzol and then extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) with on-column DNase digestion. RNA quality was assessed using a TapeStation 4200 (Agilent Technologies) and then 10 ng of total RNA was used as input for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis using the Clontech SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplified cDNA was fragmented and appended with dual-indexed barcodes using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). Libraries were validated using capillary electrophoresis on a TapeStation 4200, pooled at equimolar concentrations and sequenced with PE100 reads on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000, yielding ~30 million reads per sample on average. Alignment was performed using STAR v.2.7.3a47; transcripts were annotated using a composite genome reference that included the GRCh38 Ensembl release 100 and SARS-CoV-2 (GCF_009858895.2, ASM985889v3, MN985325.1). Transcript abundance estimates were calculated internal to the STAR aligner using the htseq-count algorithm. Transcript abundance estimates were calculated internal to the STAR aligner using the htseq-count algorithm. DESeq2 (ref. 48) was used for normalization, producing a normalized read count.

To assess for viral transcription, sample reads were aligned to a reference of 59 complete viral genome sequences using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (v.0.7.17)49 to produce a sorted alignment (.bam) file. SAMtools (v.1.3.1) was used to summarize the number of reads aligned to each genome. The complete FASTA file is provided along with the bulk RNA-seq raw data.

A total of 55 ml serum or plasma from all participants, five pooled plasma controls and one buffer control were analyzed using the SomaScan Assay Kit for human plasma V4.1 (cat. no. 900-00020), measuring the expression of 6,596 unique human protein targets using 7,596 slow off-rate modified aptamer reagents (SOMAmer), single-stranded DNA aptamers, according to the manufacturer's standard protocol (SomaLogic). The modified aptamer binding reagents, SomaScan assay, and its performance characteristics and specificity to human targets, have been described previously. The assay used standard controls, including 12 hybridization normalization control sequences used to control for variability in the Agilent microarray readout process, and five human calibrator control pooled plasma replicates and three quality control (QC) pooled replicates used to mitigate batch effects and verify the quality of the assay run using standard acceptance criteria. The readout was performed using the Agilent microarray hybridization, scan and feature extraction technology.

Twelve hybridization control SOMAmers were added alongside SOMAmers to be measured from the serum samples and controls of each well during the SOMAmer elution step to control for readout variability. The control samples were run repeatedly during assay qualification and robust point estimates were generated and stored as references for each SOMAmer result for the Calibrator and QC samples. The results are used as references for the SomaScan v.4.1 Assay. Plate calibration was performed by calculating the ratio of the calibrator reference relative fluorescence unit (RFU) value to the plate-specific calibrator replicate median RFU value for each SOMAmer. The resulting ratio distribution was decomposed into a plate scale factor defined by the median of the distribution and a vector of SOMAmer-specific calibration scale factors. Normalization of QC replicates and samples was performed using adaptive normalization by maximum likelihood with point and variance estimates from a normal US population. Post-calibration accuracy was estimated using the ratio of the QC reference RFU value to the plate-specific QC replicate median RFU value for each SOMAmer. The resulting QC ratio distribution provides a robust estimate of accuracy for each SOMAmer on every plate. SomaScan RFU values and clinical information were obfuscated to protect personally identifiable information while preserving biologically relevant biomarkers. These reference datasets were provided by SomaLogic. We used the limma R package to identify differentially expressed proteins in the LC and CC groups. The method involves fitting a linear model to the data and then performing a t-test to identify proteins that are differentially expressed between two or more groups. P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. The R packages ggplot2 and ComplexHeatmap were used to generated the figures. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using GSEA (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). Genes were preranked according to the fold change from the highest to the lowest; GSEA was used to assess the enrichment of selected gene sets. Cytokine signaling, immune cell signatures and molecular pathways were compiled from the MSigDB Hallmark, C2, C7 and C3 gene sets (www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp) and the blood transcriptional modules. The GSEA Java desktop program was downloaded from the Broad Institute (www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) and used with GSEA preranked module parameters (number of permutations: 1,000; enrichment statistic: weighted; 10 ≤ gene set size ≤ 5,000)50. Sample-level enrichment analysis50 was used to investigate the enrichment of pathways in each animal. Briefly, the expression of all genes in a specific pathway was averaged across samples and compared to the average expression of 1,000 randomly generated gene sets of the same size. The resulting z-score was then used to reflect the overall perturbation of each pathway in each sample.

We estimated pathway activity per sample using ssGSEA51. Leading-edge gene lists were parsed from the prior GSEA output and used as the gene sets for each pathway. For every sample, genes were ranked according to normalized expression and an enrichment score was computed as the difference between the empirical cumulative distributions of ranks for leading-edge genes versus all other genes; higher scores indicate greater pathway activation. Scores were normalized (per sample and then z-scored across samples) to enable comparisons, yielding a samples × pathways ssGSEA matrix for the downstream analyses.

To explore associations between symptom presence and gene expression signatures, we merged the one-hot symptom mapping with the original cohort data containing pathway-level gene expression profiles. For each of the 18 symptom categories, we then identified all patients who had that symptom and averaged their gene expression values across all measured pathways. In other words, for each symptom like fatigue or brain fog, we looked at all the patients who had that symptom and calculated the average expression level of each gene pathway in that subgroup. This produced an 18 × n matrix (where n is the number of gene pathways), with each cell representing the average expression in patients with that symptom. The resulting correlation matrix was visualized using a heatmap with color mapping reflecting average expression levels. This can be formally represented as:

Where Cj,k is the average expression of gene pathway (k) for symptom (j), Sj is the set of patients with symptom (j) and Gi,k is the expression value of gene pathway (k) for patient (i).

Cytokines were assessed using ELISA. An antihuman cytokine coating antibody was adsorbed onto 96-microwell plates. Microwells were washed with wash buffer; human serum samples and human cytokine standards were prediluted in assay buffer and added to each plate. Plates were then incubated for 1 h before adding antihuman cytokine horseradish peroxidase (HRP). After an additional 1-h incubation, plates were again washed with wash buffer. SeraCare KPL TMB SureBlue Start solution was added to each well; plate development was halted by adding SeraCare KPL TMB Stop solution to each well. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded with a VersaMax Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). The standard curve was prepared from human cytokine standard dilutions and the human cytokine concentration was determined. For each sample, the cytokine concentration was calculated using a four-parameter logistic curve fit; cytokine concentrations of the unknown samples were interpolated from the linear portion of the standard curve generated from the human cytokine standards of known concentration.

Serum levels of human IL-6R were tested using the R-PLEX Human IL-6R Kits from Meso Scale Discovery (cat. no. K1510GR-2) by the Metabolism and Mitochondrial Research Core (BIDM) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the plate was coated using the provided biotinylated capture antibody (1:100 dilution). The highest Calibrator standard is 2,000 pg ml−1. Then a fourfold serial dilution was done to generate seven calibrator curve using a four-parameter logistic model. The detection limit is 0.4 pg ml−1. Samples were thawed on ice and diluted at a 1:200 ratio using the Diluent 7 provided by the kit. The assay plate was read by a MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 instrument and data were analyzed using the Discovery workbench 4.0 software.

We applied ssGSEA, which transforms gene expression profiles into enrichment scores for predefined gene sets (for example, pathways), thereby producing a matrix in which each row corresponds to a sample and each column represents a pathway activity score. To assess the contribution of individual pathways, we trained an RF classifier using the ssGSEA scores as input features. The dataset was randomly split into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%) using stratified sampling to preserve the class distribution. The RF model was trained with 500 trees using the randomForest R package, where the outcome variable was CLASS (LC or CC) and the predictors were the ssGSEA-derived pathway scores. Model performance was evaluated using the held-out test set, with classification accuracy and a confusion matrix computed to assess prediction quality. To determine the relative importance of each pathway in predicting the LC outcome, we extracted the mean decrease in Gini impurity (MDG) from the trained RF model. The MDG quantifies how much each feature (pathway/gene) contributes to reducing classification uncertainty. A scatter plot was created to display the relationship between prediction accuracy and MDG for each pathway using transcriptomic and proteomic pathways. We added bar plots to visualize the top pathways/genes ranked according to importance generated by the RF model. Each bar represents a pathway; its length reflects its importance in the RF model. This plot highlights the most influential pathways in distinguishing LC from CC based on ssGSEA scores. All figures were generated using R v.4.4.2, using standard visualization packages for statistical and transcriptomic data analysis.

The data from the RNA-seq and proteomics were analyzed with RStudio (v.4.4.0) in PRISM 9.0 (GraphPad Software). Pathways enrichment analysis was performed using the GSEA software. Sample-level ssGSEA was performed using the GSVA (v.1.40) R package. The ssGSEA analysis delineates a comparative exploration of the groups' median values, visually represented through the data distribution and median lines. Statistical significance, denoted by the calculated P value, is highlighted above the comparison line, where a P < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. The two-sided Mann–Whitney U-test was used to identify significant differences between groups. For more than one group comparison, we used a Kruskal–Wallis test to compare all three groups; when significant, we performed post hoc pairwise comparisons with the Dunn's test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. nAb titers and IFNγ ELISpot counts were analyzed after log10 transformation; to avoid undefined values, measurements <1 were set to 1 before transformation. For each viral variant (WH/2020, Delta, BA.1), CC and LC groups were compared using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann–Whitney U-test) test on the log10 values. Multiple testing across variants within each assay (nAb and ELISpot analyzed separately) was controlled using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure; adjusted qvalues are reported in the subpanel titles; nominal P values are shown above the parentheses. A nonparametric test was selected a priori because immune readouts are typically right-skewed with potential outliers and unequal variances, and the groups are independent. Individual data and group medians are displayed in the plots. Analyses were performed in R using the base wilcox.test with Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment. Because of the limited sample availability, no statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes and we used all the samples that were made available to us. Where applicable, data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested.

Age tech is a rapidly growing category focused on remote caregiving, improving quality of life, and enabling older folks to stay in their own homes for longer. The US Census Bureau says around 16 million elders (over 65) live alone. While the majority are healthy, with family and friends nearby, many lack support and may be battling physical and mental decline.

Whether you're getting older or trying to help an aging loved one, there's an increasingly diverse range of gadgetry to choose from, but as a nascent category, it's tricky to know what will help. I've been testing age tech for a few years now, both myself and with aging relatives, and there are definitely useful devices for folks in certain situations. But, most of the age tech I tested is very expensive and comes with a hefty subscription (I'll lay out the costs and options for each pick).

What to Consider When Assessing Age Tech

There's a lot to think about before you invest in age tech. I spoke with Ed Baig from the AARP (formerly American Association of Retired Persons) about what you should consider.

Do They Want It?

A crucial first question to ask is: How receptive is the older person to having this technology in the home? Before you think about buying, you must have a conversation with your elder and everyone else who lives in the home, and ensure that they are on board with the idea. While many of these technologies are intended to help older folks and maybe enable them to stay in their own homes for longer, none of them are a replacement for human contact or human caregivers.

Installation

The complexity of installation varies from device to device. Plenty of older folks are tech-savvy and will have no trouble setting these gadgets up, while others will need help. It's also important that they understand how to use the device and how to get technical support should they run into issues. It's a good idea to take time to help with the installation and run through the user guide. Some services also offer step-by-step guides or even live setup sessions with support staff.

Costs

Most age tech is very expensive and involves an upfront fee and an ongoing subscription. If you discontinue the subscription, you will often be required to return the hardware (always check the conditions). While the monthly costs tend to be very high, there are often discounted rates if you pay for a longer period upfront. It's also worth watching out for sales events. Some devices and services may be available at no cost to you or subsidized through health-care schemes or insurance. Most devices require Wi-Fi in the home.

Privacy

Privacy is a serious concern with age technology in a few different ways. Any device in the home with cameras and microphones that can be remotely accessed is a threat to privacy. It's important that the user is OK with this, and you should be careful about placement. Devices generally have a light or some indicator that the camera is on, and some have a privacy shield.

Another concern is what data the service provider or manufacturer is collecting and what they might use it for. Check the privacy policies. Some processing of data that may include audio and video will likely be necessary for the device to offer its full range of features. It's also worth considering what potentially happens to that data if the company goes out of business or is acquired by another company.

Other Considerations

While age tech can help improve the quality of life for the elderly and reduce the burden on caregivers, it is important to avoid overreliance. One concern is that it may discourage in-person visits and check-ins, rather than facilitate them. From a practical point of view, it will also be rendered useless if it is unplugged or there's a power or Wi-Fi outage.

Try to talk through the pros and cons of any device or service before you buy. It can be a big investment. Make sure that you understand what your obligations are and how you can terminate the service or return a device. Many offer a short trial period, so you can test in situ before deciding if it will work for your family.

GrandPad

The GrandPad Tablet is a tablet for seniors. It comes with a wireless charging cradle, optional cell service, and a limited range of apps and functions designed specifically with the elderly in mind. It makes video calls easy, acts as a digital photo frame where families can share photos, and offers music streaming. It also hosts a range of games, like bingo and chess, and can be used to browse the web safely. The GrandPad can be configured remotely by a family member or caregiver.

While the GrandPad is a modified, locked-down Android tablet, and the hardware is nothing special, it is a convenient way to set up your elder with a simple, portable device that will help them stay in touch. You could cobble something together and maybe save a little money, but the GrandPad is very convenient, with 24/7 technical support when required. This tablet has worked very well for our family, where a smartphone did not, and we've been using it for a number of years now, so it's easy to recommend.

Cost: $349 for hardware, subscription required, starting from $25 per month (Wi-Fi), $45 per month (3-GB data plan), $65 per month (10-GB data plan)

JubileeTV

Amazon

JubileeTV

The JubileeTV Set-Top Box is a smart remote caregiving device that pairs with your elder's main TV. While it offers many of the same features as the GrandPad, for some folks, focusing on the TV makes more sense. You have a large screen for video calls, it's a screen they are already used to and likely using every day, and it enables you to remotely control the TV to help them find the content they love or sort out technical issues. You can change channels, streaming services, or even increase the volume from afar. You can also set medication reminders and other appointments to pop up onscreen, check on activity without calling, and share photos or video.

While you can plug multiple input devices into the JubileeTV, it does require careful setup. It needs a Wi-Fi connection and at least one streaming device to be plugged in, and you'll want to program the remote control to get the most from it (it can serve as a universal remote). There's also an optional simplified six-button remote. Some folks will have concerns about privacy because family members and other caregivers with permission can drop in with auto-answered video calls, watch or listen remotely, and review their elder's on-device activity. It is pricey but worked very reliably during my tests, and could be a real lifeline for the right people.

Cost: $199 for hardware, subscription required, starting from $29 per month or $289 per year, or subscription including hardware from $39 per month or $389 per year, but there is also an “all-in” option at $789 with no recurring fees

Intuition Robotics

ElliQ

The ElliQ AI Companion is a robot and tablet combo designed to sit on a desk or table. Reminiscent of the Pixar lamp, this incredibly cute animated robot with a light-up face can engage your senior in conversation. It answers basic queries, can provide weather reports and appointment reminders, and takes music requests. But ElliQ is also proactive, so it starts conversations throughout the day. It promotes healthy and social behavior and aims to alleviate stress, with a range of activities. The tablet can also be used for video calls and photo sharing.

There's no doubt that ElliQ is cute and easy to get to grips with, but some folks will likely find it patronizing, and there's something dystopian about relying on AI for companionship. It sometimes takes a while to respond and struggles with voice commands or queries. However, for folks living alone, ElliQ could make a real difference, reducing feelings of loneliness, alleviating worries, and encouraging people to be more social. It also works very well as a remote caregiving device that families can configure and use for video calls.

Cost: $249 enrollment fee, subscription required, starting from $59 per month (discounts for annual or 24-month contracts)

Science Lab 3

Memory Air

Everyone is familiar with that feeling of a specific smell evoking a strong memory, but Michael Leon, a neurobiology expert and Memory Air cofounder, believes olfactory enrichment can enhance cognitive ability in older adults. His study of adults aged 60 to 85 with moderate dementia showed a 226-percent improvement in memory tests after 15 days compared with the control group. While we don't fully understand the link between smell and memory, olfactory loss has been linked to numerous medical conditions and often precedes neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

The Memory Air device sits on your nightstand and uses cartridges and a fan to expose you to 40 scents twice a night, with the aim of improving your memory. It's easy to use: load the odor cartridge belt, press a button to set your bedtime, and it works automatically after that. The smells are pleasant—I've noticed eucalyptus, orange, and maybe gingerbread, so far. Monthly refills are delivered as part of your subscription. While this is a relatively new area of scientific study, some research suggests the positive effects are more pronounced for folks suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's.

Memory Air is very expensive, though the makers hope to bring the cost down as they scale. Considering the lack of alternative treatments and the potential side effects of medications, something natural and safe like this could be an attractive option.

Cost: $799 for hardware, subscription required, starting from $39 per month or $397 for a year

Age tech is taking off in a big way. Here are some other devices and services I tested and liked, and a few others that caught my eye but I haven't tested yet.

OnScreen JoyTV Set-Top Box and Camera ($180): This is similar to JubileeTV, but it's a simpler device with a single input and pared-back remote. It enables video calls on the TV and supports auto-answering, has a built-in AI companion called Joy that offers activities like trivia and health check-ins, and offers live events and social hangouts. If your focus is on easy video calls and your elder only uses one device for their TV, this could be a cheaper way to set them up. It currently costs $150 for the hardware and requires a $30-per-month subscription.

Cerret Bracelet ($280): Many older folks wear an alarm button of some kind that they can press to alert caregivers if they fall. But these chunky plastic devices tend to be ugly and stand out like a sore thumb. The Cerret Bracelet is a 24-karat gold-plated double chain with a black or blue enamel button, and it won't look out of place at a restaurant or social gathering. You press twice to send an alert to your loved ones that includes your live location. Install the app on your smartphone, and the bracelet connects via Bluetooth.

There are several devices and services that I haven't been able to test yet, but that caught my eye for one reason or another.

Nomo Smart Care is a wearable monitoring system that uses AI to learn one's routine. It can track vitals, sleep, meals, and medications to enable remote monitoring without intrusive cameras or calls. Any deviations from the norm are flagged in the Nomo app.

StoriedLife is billed as an AI biographer to help your loved one create an interactive memoir. Since many folks will never sit down and write a memoir, this could be a great way to preserve memories.

Techpals is a nonprofit that seeks to educate seniors about technology and improve their digital literacy. It relies on student volunteers, and seniors can watch tutorials or get help online from their own homes.

The long history of underground drug use abounds with secret societies—colorful cliques of like-minded individuals surreptitiously experimenting with newfangled compounds in an effort to understand their mysteries.

Mid-19th-century France saw artists and intellectuals like Baudelaire and Dumas gathered at the Club of the Hash Eaters to partake of the powerful sticky cannabis concentrate. In the latter half of the 20th century, Dow chemist Alexander Shulgin, famous for popularizing MDMA and a range of other potent psychedelic analogues, held gatherings at his home, sampling his latest creations with a group of like-minded fellow travelers. And earlier this year, when 48-year-old Jake Terry wanted to test the effects of retatrutide, a new but not-yet-approved compound developed by the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, he bought some online and took it to his friends.

Unlike Shulgin or Baudelaire's experiments, retatrutide is not psychoactive. It's a weight-loss injectable, like semaglutide (marketed as Wegovy) or tirzepatide (marketed as Zepbound). But the key difference with this weight-loss drug, besides the pesky matter of its legality, is that it appears to be much, much more powerful than those approved so far. On the back of phase II trials, it's already being hailed as a game-changer.

Retatrutide works by the same means as its predecessors, by interacting with receptors that are central to the body's metabolism, ultimately lowering people's appetite and slowing digestion. But where semaglutide acts on one receptor (the glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, receptor), and tirzepatide on two (GLP-1 and the gastric inhibitory polypeptide, or GIP, receptors), retatrutide has been nicknamed “Triple G” for its ability to work on three hormone receptors (those for GLP-1 and GIP, as well as the glucagon, or GCG, receptor).

“These are three chemically related but distinct receptors that have their own distinct biology,” says Richard DiMarchi, professor of chemistry and chair in biomolecular sciences at Indiana University. “With the three together … you can actually make a single molecule, like a master key, that opens multiple doors as effectively as [individual] keys, and achieve superior outcomes.” DiMarchi knows these drugs well, having conducted pioneering research on this class of chemicals as far back as the late 1990s while employed at Eli Lilly as group vice president of research and development. (He left the company in 2003, in part because he felt the company didn't then prioritize obesity treatments or see the benefit of an injectable weight-loss drug.)

Following a once-weekly subcutaneous injection of retatrutide, participants in clinical trials exhibited “a significant reduction in body weight and improvement of metabolic markers.” Data collected in a phase II trial showed that obese participants lost a mean average of 24.2 percent of their body weight over a 48-week period. Compare this to 18–20 percent over 72 weeks for tirzepatide, or 14.9 percent over 68 weeks with semaglutide (both in phase III trials). “It's such a huge drug,” says Terry. “It's a miracle.”

Terry first became interested in these compounds back in 2023. His daughter was diagnosed with a prolactinoma: a benign tumor of the pituitary gland that, left unchecked, can interfere with metabolism, leading to weight gain. To regulate her weight, a doctor prescribed semaglutide. But the $500-a-month bill made the drug unaffordable. Terry did some research online, and came across a website selling “research chemicals.”

Such vendors—sometimes called “grey market pharmacies”—typically trade in alternative forms of commonly used psychoactive drugs, as well human-growth hormone, anabolic steroids, and other “gear” prized among the power-lifting and body-hacking sets. Such marketplaces are also used by trans and nonbinary people to source gender-affirming hormones. These websites typically carry disclaimers clarifying that the “intended use” of these compounds is for “research purposes,” allowing their sale to wiggle through a legal loophole. “If you're selling to a lab or academic institution that is doing research, you can do that totally lawfully,” says Jesse C. Dresser, a partner at the New Jersey-based law firm Frier Levitt, which specializes in pharmaceutical practices. “That sale would be lawful, even if theoretically, the person that purchased it used it for personal consumption.” (Dresser also notes that there is “very limited enforcement” of the rules governing this space.)

The popularity of modern weight-loss treatments, combined with their high costs and shortages of supplies, have made unofficial forms of them popular in such underground online drug bazaars. It was on such a site that Terry found some tirzepatide, and procured it for his daughter. “It works,” he recalls. “She loses the weight. She looked good at her wedding. And everything's under control.”

His interest piqued, Terry started contacting suppliers in China, who mass-produce various active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, for pharma companies, regulated and otherwise. Scanning their inventories, he noticed a listing for retatrutide. He ordered 10 vials of the drug in powder form, amounting to some 200 mg. It arrived shortly after via the post, in an unbranded bubble mailer. He prepared it and injected it, following dosing protocols from Lilly's initial clinical trials. Within two months, he'd gone from 186 to 166 pounds.

Amazed, he wanted to share the miracle with his friends. “Hey, anybody wanna try this?” he asked some buddies during a meetup, producing several vials of retatrutide. He told them about his daughter—and his own weight loss. They were keen to try it. A month later, one of them had dropped 12 pounds. One lost 16. One even shed 28 pounds. Terry was so impressed that he moved into the grey-market pharmaceutical biz himself, ordering APIs from Chinese manufacturers, and selling them—clearly marked as “research chemicals”—through his website, Compound Sciences, based out of Utah.

Another of Terry's friends—who is also his Compound Sciences business partner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity—claims to have dropped 30 pounds on underground retatrutide. “I was 53 with the dad-bod gut,” he explains. “This is the first time in my life I've actually seen my abs. And I've changed nothing, other than retatrutide. I don't exercise more. I don't do anything other than take the shot once a week.”

Terry holds fast to the line that the peptides he sells are for research purposes only. He also says he tests his imported APIs for purity through third-party labs like Finnrick and Janoshik Analytical, and provides Certificates of Analysis to verify the results. (Raphaël Mazoyer, Finnrick's COO, cautions that customers should always verify Certificates of Analysis with the companies that issued them and check they include a batch identifier.) Compound Sciences sells 20 mg of retatrutide (branded as GLP3 RT-20) for $79.99. To use the drug themselves, purchasers would have to reconstitute the powder by combining it with bacteriostatic water and injecting with a syringe, processes that are all explained in detail across multiple social media platforms, like TikTok and YouTube. In fact, like with psychedelics and steroids, whole communities have risen up devoted to experimentation with GLP-1-type drugs.

“There was a YouTube video in my feed,” says a 23-year-old retatrutide user who asks to be identified as Diana. “It was one of those fitness podcasters. He was talking about metabolism, which is something I've had trouble with. And he mentioned retatrutide. I thought he was just making up a word.” Upon further investigation, Diana learned that retatrutide is very much real, and easily accessible. A new mother, Diana had developed gestational diabetes and worried that, postpartum, her appetite was out of control. She suspected her insulin function was off, as she watched her blood sugar test scores rise to prediabetic levels. But more than anything, she just wanted to see what would happen. She found a retailer online, and paid for the drug using a bank transfer.

“I'm an experimental-type person,” Diana explains. “Maybe a little impulsive. I'm also not overweight. I thought, ‘Hey, if I can do this now, why not?”

Retatrutide is prized by users like Diana not only for its considerable weight-loss potential. Users of similar drugs often struggle to maintain muscle mass, because their appetites are so reduced that taking in enough calories (and protein) becomes a challenge or tedious chore. Because of its “Triple G” action, users have reported that retatrutide is able to burn fat without the extreme appetite suppression associated with without semaglutide or tirzepatide. As DiMarchi explains, glucagon, one of the hormones that reta mimics, is thermogenic, meaning that it “stimulates energy utilization.” Because users are both eating less, and burning more, the effects are greater. This has made the drug buzzy not just among people looking to lose a few (or few dozen) pounds, but with athletes, weightlifters, and body composition obsessives.

Adrian Crook, a 50-year-old fitness YouTuber based in British Columbia, Canada, first caught wind of reta from a friend in Bangkok who hyped up the “Triple G” effect to him. Crook didn't need to drop any weight. “I just like trying things,” he says. “I have an unhealthy obsession with pharmaceutical interventions.”

Crook also has a history of gastrointestinal problems, including a Crohn's disease diagnosis. He didn't really care for food. “I just have a negative association with eating,” he tells WIRED. “The pitch for reta is it just puts that stuff on autopilot … it makes your cutting, your weight-maintenance effortless. You don't have to deal with cravings, or the feeling of desperation you get from always being hungry.”

In seven weeks, Crook lost 25 pounds. However, he eventually stopped taking retatrutide after a negative experience that he attributes to the drug's interaction with a protein pump inhibitor he was taking to manage acid reflux—itself the result of some anabolic steroids he had taken a year earlier. “It felt like how I used to feel when I had stomach obstructions from my Crohn's disease,” he recalls. “Nothing was moving. After a couple hours I just started throwing everything up, because nothing was going the other way. That was it. If it persisted, I'd have to go to the hospital. It was bad.”

Forty-year-old “Craig” (who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity, because he works in the medical field) found his way to retatrutide more officially: by enlisting in a clinical trial. He had actually been writing a master's thesis on GLP-1 drugs. Despite his commitment to diet and exercise, he had found himself unable to drop weight. He was diagnosed as obese, with high cholesterol, and mild asthma. “I've got a kid now,” he says. “I've got to get healthy. I'm trying to do the best for me.”

Craig was tipped-off to a trial in his area, in which he worked up to a 12 mg dose of retatrutide, once a week, the highest dose offered in Lilly's Phase II clinical trials. He lost 31 percent of his body weight, amounting to 75–80 pounds. A dedicated runner, he was able to shave about 90 seconds off his per-mile pace. And as an avid foodie, Craig also found that his reduced appetite allowed him to actually enjoy eating more. “Because I can't eat as much, I have a better relationship with food,” he says. “I have more mental space to do other things instead of just thinking about, like, when I'm going to eat again.”

Such endorsements abound online. Other reta boosters also flag its alleged ability to reduce cravings for drugs and alcohol. (Some clinical literature has suggested the potential of GLP-1-type drugs in the treatment of addiction, attributable to their ability to rewire dopamine signaling in the brain.) Less desirable side effects reported, in trials and anecdotally, include low energy, dizziness, cutaneous hyperesthesia (a form of extreme sensitivity to touch), and decreased libido.

Eli Lilly, the drug's aboveboard manufacturer, is currently completing Phase III trials. If all goes according to plan, FDA approval should follow, and marketability by late 2026 or early 2027 could be possible, based on the timelines of other drugs in the category. In a statement to WIRED, a Lilly spokesperson Niki Biro noted that, given its effectiveness, retatrutide is currently being targeted to “those with high BMI or with obesity-related complications that require a high degree of weight loss, where the clinical need may be greater.”

Biro also cautions that “retatrutide is an investigational molecule that is legally available only to participants in Lilly's clinical trials. Anyone purporting to sell retatrutide for human use is breaking the law, and no one should consider taking anything claiming to be retatrutide outside of a Lilly-sponsored clinical trial.” When WIRED put this to Terry, he reiterated that the products are not intended for human consumption. “It's for research purposes only,” he says. “It's all over the website.”

Suffice to say, online retailers potentially risk infringing on patents protected by pharmaceutical companies. Indeed, Dresser says producers of such chemicals can glean the drug's molecular structure by referring to patent literature submitted by pharmaceutical sponsors to regulatory agencies like the FDA.

When reached for comment, the FDA pointed to past warnings issued against companies selling retatrutide. “These products have been sold directly to consumers for human use with dosing instructions,” the FDA's statement to WIRED read. “The agency urges consumers not to purchase these products, which are of unknown quality and may be harmful to their health.”

Until FDA approval, the drug is likely to find a thriving market online, investigated by users looking to kick-start weight loss or speed up their cuts, and purveyed by middle-man retailers like Jake Terry. “The only reason I've done this is to make it more accessible,” Terry says. “If I can help people become more healthy, that's my goal.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Trump Signs Executive Order That Threatens to Punish States for Passing AI Laws","https://www.wired.com/story/trump-signs-executive-order-ai-state-laws/","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 00:54:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump signed a highly anticipated executive order on Thursday that sets in motion a plan to establish a national regulatory framework for artificial intelligence while undercutting states' abilities to enact their own rules.

The order, titled “Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence,” creates an AI litigation task force within the Justice Department to directly challenge state AI laws the administration finds to conflict with federal policy. It also directs the Department of Commerce to craft guidelines that could make states ineligible for future broadband funding if they pass “onerous” AI laws.

The push for sweeping federal preemption of state AI laws has largely been fueled by AI investors, conservative policy shops, and tech industry trade groups. These groups have argued that a patchwork approach to AI regulation could stunt Silicon Valley's AI boom and reduce America's competitiveness on the global stage. White House AI and crypto adviser David Sacks has been one of the most vocal proponents of a light-touch approach to AI regulation.

“The EO gives your administration tools to push back on the most onerous and excessive state regulations,” Sacks told Trump during Thursday's signing ceremony. “We're not going to push back on all of them. For example, kids safety we're going to protect.”

The order is similar in many respects to an earlier draft obtained by WIRED but with a few key differences. The executive order instructs Sacks and Michael Kratsios, the assistant to the president for science and technology, to prepare a legislative recommendation establishing a federal policy framework for AI. One of the new additions is a carve-out within this legislative recommendation asking Congress not to preempt state AI laws that aim to protect children, promote data center infrastructure, and encourage state governments to procure AI tools.

“We want one central source of approval, and we have great Republican support. I think we probably have Democrat support too, because it's common sense,” Trump said during Thursday's signing ceremony. “Every time you make a change, and it could be a very reasonable change, you still won't get it approved if you have to go to 50 states. This centralizes it.”

In the absence of federal regulations, officials from states across the country have pushed through their own investigations and legislation to govern the use and development of AI. Trump's executive order specifically calls out certain state AI laws—such as Colorado's SB24-205, which aims to limit “algorithmic discrimination” in AI models—as an attempt to “embed ideological bias.”

Several other state AI laws may also fall in the crosshairs of this executive order. California governor Gavin Newsom signed a law in September requiring large tech companies to publish safety frameworks around their AI models. In June, New York's legislature passed a bill that would empower the state's attorney general to bring civil penalties of up to $30 million against AI developers that fail to meet safety standards. That bill is currently sitting on New York governor Kathy Hochul's desk, awaiting her signature or veto—though she's reportedly considering amendments that could weaken the bill significantly.

Shortly before the order was signed on Thursday, several state attorneys general were quick to criticize the Trump administration's attempt to curb state power.

“Now is not the time to let this new technology progress unchecked. AI development and deployment are happening quickly, and state attorneys general are the most agile regulators we have historically,” New York attorney general Letitia James said in a briefing with reporters on Thursday. “It has always been collaboration, not conflict, between state legislatures and Congress that yielded some of the most critical federal legislation in our country's history.”

While the order may set a national tone for AI regulation, Trump does not have the authority to bar states from continuing to pass their own laws. Civil rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have called the order “unconstitutional,” and it's likely to be challenged in court.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","You're Thinking About AI and Water All Wrong","https://www.wired.com/story/karen-hao-empire-of-ai-water-use-statistics/","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Last month, journalist Karen Hao posted a Twitter thread in which she acknowledged that there was a substantial error in her blockbuster book Empire of AI. Hao had written that a proposed Google data center in a town near Santiago, Chile, could require “more than one thousand times the amount of water consumed by the entire population”—a figure which, thanks to a unit misunderstanding, appears to have been off by a magnitude of 1,000.

In the thread, Hao thanked Andy Masley, the head of an effective altruism organization in Washington, DC, for bringing the correction to her attention. Masley has spent the past several months questioning some of the numbers and rhetoric common in popular media about water use and AI on his Substack. Masley's main post, titled “The AI Water Issue Is Fake,” has been linked in recent months by other writers with large followings, including Matt Yglesias and Noah Smith. (Hao said in her Twitter thread that she would be working with her publisher to fix the errors; her publicist told me she was taking time off and was unavailable to chat with me for this story.)

When I called him to talk more about AI and water, Masley emphasized that he's not an expert, but “just some guy” interested in how the media was handling this topic—and how it was shaping the opinions of people around him.

“I would sometimes bring up that I used ChatGPT at parties, and people would be, like, ‘Oh, that uses so much energy and water. How can you use that?'” he says. “I was a little bit surprised when people would be talking so grimly about just a little bit of water.”

As local and national opposition to data centers has grown, so, too, have concerns about their environmental impacts. Earlier this week, more than 230 green groups sent a letter to Congress, warning that AI and data centers are “threatening Americans' economic, environmental, climate and water security.”

The AI industry has started fighting back. In November, the cochairs of the AI Infrastructure Coalition, a new industry group, authored an op-ed for Fox News that touched on environmental worries. “Water usage? Minimal and often recycled—less than America's golf courses,” they wrote. One of the authors of the op-ed, former Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema, is currently advocating in favor of a data center project in the state that has prompted local pushback, including because of concerns about water use. The coalition also approvingly retweeted a post from Masley on the impact of AI on energy prices. (Masley maintains an exhaustive disclaimer on his Substack refuting allegations that he's being paid by industry to share his opinions.)

It's true that much of the discussion around water use and data centers lacks nuance. While carbon emissions are a zero-sum game—we need to cut greenhouse gases as much as possible, period, and climate change's impacts will touch us all, regardless of where emissions come from—water use is much more complex, and geographically varied. A project that can wreak havoc on one region's water supply may be a great match for an area with healthier reservoirs or fewer thirsty industries.

Experts I spoke to agreed that people often have a muddled understanding of how data centers use water, and that their overall consumption, in many places, is less of a risk than the public may think. But as the number of data centers continues to grow across the country—and as the Trump administration rolls back environmental protections to encourage more development—it's worth understanding what, exactly, data centers are using water for, and how popular estimates are produced. And it's worth having a bigger conversation about how and why we're choosing to use water to cool data centers in the first place.

You may have seen estimates of how much water a ChatGPT prompt uses, including the statistic that writing an email with AI consumes an entire bottle of water. But calculating such a figure is more complex than simply slapping a metric on an “average” query, experts say.

Onsite at a data center, water is mostly used for cooling. Processors in data centers run hot, and circulating water through them is one way to keep them at the right temperature; the water that absorbs the heat is then transferred to a cooling tower, where some of it evaporates. Salty and brackish water can corrode machinery, so many companies use potable water, drawing directly from municipal supplies. (Some big companies, like Amazon, Meta, and Apple, are increasingly using municipal wastewater that has been treated.)

The amount used depends heavily on the individual data center. Using more water means that data centers can avoid running electric cooling systems. Using more electricity, by contrast, lessens the water footprint, but ups the power bill—and causes more greenhouse gas emissions. (There are technologies that use special kinds of cooling liquids to cut down on both electricity and water use, but they have the potential to introduce forever chemicals into the mix. That's made some Big Tech companies skittish of investing too heavily in them.) Cooling needs intensify in the summer when the weather is hotter, so data centers may use more water—or power—then.

“Every location and every state is different,” says Fengqi You, a professor in energy systems engineering at Cornell and an author of a recent analysis on the most sustainable places to put data centers. “How much water you will need for the same amount of AI depends on the climate, depends on the technology used, depends on the [energy] mix.”

Complicating things even further, some calculations around AI and water also include indirect water use—mainly from the massive power generation needed for data centers—to estimate their total water footprint. These numbers are generally much bigger than onsite use, but the calculations themselves are region-dependent.

This type of calculation is standard when talking about indirect greenhouse gas emissions—it's known as Scope 2 emissions accounting—but it's relatively rare to use the same calculations for water, says computing researcher Jonathan Koomey, coauthor of a recent paper from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory that crunched numbers around AI and water. Koomey says he is increasingly convinced that offsite water use from energy shouldn't factor into data-center water footprints, simply because we don't tend to count this use when we talk about other industries.

Finding out details about water use in a specific data center isn't always easy: A lot of companies use nondisclosure agreements to hide even basic information about projects from the public. A city in Oregon dragged state newspaper The Oregonian through a monthslong legal battle in 2022 to avoid disclosing how much water a Google data center used, arguing that it was a “trade secret.” (Following the lawsuit, Google started disclosing how much water its data centers use in its annual sustainability report.)

If the complexity makes measuring the water use of a given data center difficult and contingent, isolating the effects at the level of a single user or prompt is nearly impossible. Understanding the environmental impacts of specific LLMs is almost entirely dependent on sustainability disclosures from Big Tech, and while some have gotten more transparent, a lot of questions still remain. When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman mentioned in a personal blog post this summer that an “average” ChatGPT query used “roughly one fifteenth of a teaspoon” of water, he gave some parameters for understanding the company's water and energy use—but also didn't clarify key details, like the definition of an “average” query and whether or not the figure includes the energy and water cost of training an AI model.

We Use a Lot of Water Without Thinking

One of Masley's main arguments in his popular Substack post is that there are industries that currently use much more water than AI, and that context needs to be part of the conversation. This is undoubtedly true. A single burger takes more than 400 gallons of water to produce; a humble cotton T-shirt takes more than 700. The United States' 16,000 golf courses, meanwhile, each have the potential to use on average between 100,000 to 2 million gallons of water per day. (For comparison, Google says its thirstiest data center in Iowa consumed about 2.7 million gallons per day in 2024; most of the company's data centers used substantially less.)

Arizona, one of the areas in the US where data center growth is exploding, has more than 370 golf courses. I can understand some of Masley's points when I think about all the water that has, for decades, been going to help people play golf in the middle of the desert, with seemingly no one making a fuss.

But experts caution against dismissing concerns about water outright. “In the near term, it's not a concern and it's not a nationwide crisis,” says Cornell professor You. “But it depends on location. In locations that have existing water stress, building these AI data centers is gonna be a big problem.”

Koomey made a similar point. While he notes that people have a tendency to exaggerate the environmental impacts of computers, data centers' water use is “ not something where you can just hand-wave it away,” he says. “Each situation has to be evaluated in the context of the specific design of the facility that's being proposed. You just can't say a priori that it's always not an issue.”

It's obviously crucial for journalists to get their numbers right. But it's also clear that data centers do not have a negligible impact on an area's water supply when water is scarce. While Hao's numbers on the data center in Chile were likely substantially off, a single facility requesting more than 100 percent of the water consumed by a city's residents is still nothing to sneeze at. (Google paused and then halted the project Hao cited last year after a court ordered the company to reconsider the potential impacts of climate change on the aquifer. More than a dozen other data centers have been constructed or are planned in the Santiago region.) Chile is nearing its 15th straight year of an unprecedented drought, and water supplies near Santiago have reportedly been endangered by other industries, including lithium mining.

Why Water Use and Data Centers Is a Big Deal to Some People

These considerations are running up against an inconvenient truth: The American public needs to seriously reconsider how it thinks about water as a resource. Droughts across the American West, juiced up by climate change, are showing in real time that the way the US economy has oriented itself around a seemingly unending water supply is pretty quickly becoming unsustainable. A 2023 New York Times investigation found that groundwater reservoirs across the country—not just in areas experiencing drought—are being overpumped, threatening both drinking water supplies and economic activity.

Koomey says that the concern about AI and water reflects an age-old tension over how we appropriately price public resources for private use, especially when the scarcity of that resource has changed over time. “Part of what we're seeing with water is that the rules and the norms and the prices are set based on a previous reality,” he says. “It does all come back to this question, of what is the value of the service being delivered?”

This seems like a pretty accurate analysis of what's driving a lot of the reaction to water and AI. People who don't think twice about eating a burger or buying a new T-shirt are angry about LLMs and water because they are rejecting the entire premise that AI is worth the price of its water use. A societal mass value judgement on AI is, fairly or unfairly, playing out in real time in the uproar around data centers. Part of the visceral environmental shame that folks like Masley—and maybe some readers of this newsletter—feel from others about their AI use is probably less about the specific water footprint of a ChatGPT search than about the acceptance of a culture where AI is woven into everyday life, regardless of its environmental impact.

And I don't think it's entirely unjustified to differentiate the conversation around AI and water from other thirsty industries, merely because of how much importance is being placed on the breakneck growth of AI right now—and how big the promises being made about this technology already are. After all, people who run golf courses aren't dining with the Trump administration, gaining massive policy concessions and economic gifts in order to reshape society solely for their putting greens, which they say will simultaneously solve all of our problems while also putting most of us out of work. Big Golf isn't making headlines about how it's upending entire industries, or causing mass psychosis, or keeping coal plants open—or how we could all be facing an economic catastrophe if the market for golf bottoms out.

It is correct to question the environmental trade-offs of a technology that is being presented as inevitable. And it's essential to demand more environmental transparency from companies that are reshaping the economy to achieve their goals. It's also just as important to double-check the statistics along the way.

Follow any beauty biohacker on social media right now and you'll hear them raving about the benefits of red-light therapy. There's so much hype about the technology that it's fair to ask, “Does red-light therapy even work?”

As an increasingly popular longevity tool, red-light therapy is said to help improve skin and hair health, enhance cellular vitality, and reverse the signs of aging. While there is evidence to support the claims of red-light therapy, studies are limited. To discover best practice when it comes to red-light therapy and how to make it work into our everyday lives, we asked the experts to share insight into its effectiveness.

Red-light therapy has long been used by athletes and wellness professionals to boost recovery and reduce oxidative stress. These days, it's fast becoming the norm at the local gym and wellness spa too. You'll probably be able to find red-light therapy rooms or “red light stations” there, which make up part of a hot and cold contrast therapy circuit alongside cold plunges and saunas.

Being able to easily access red-light therapy doesn't stop there. Online, you'll find numerous brands selling red-light therapy beauty tools designed for home use. Options for red-light therapy include face masks, massage guns, blankets and panels, and even red-light therapy helmets that claims to stimulate hair growth.

For example, the Theragun Pro Plus offers five therapies combined into one with this full-body heated massager that features near-infrared LED light and vibration to give you 15 minutes of massage in just two minutes.

Prices and effectiveness vary depending on brand name, design, and quality. Cheaper masks might not work to reduce fine lines and wrinkles as well as you'd like, but at least you'll look like you're prepping for a trip on Bezos' New Shepard.

In an age of Botox needles and plastic surgeon's knives, red-light therapy is noninvasive. It uses specific wavelengths of visible red and near-infrared light to stimulate cellular activity and help them heal more efficiently. “Red-light therapy is an umbrella term encompassing all red light frequencies on the spectrum, from the most basic visible LED to invisible near-infrared laser light,” says Graeme Glass, the aesthetic director at Lyma.

“These specific wavelengths of light—particularly visible red and near-infrared—can stimulate cellular activity and support the body's natural repair processes. Mitochondria (the battery packs of human cells) are particularly good at absorbing the energy of near infrared light and using it to make chemical energy that the cell uses for growth and repair … In short, cells behave more like they did when they were younger.”

RLT has been shown to rejuvenate skin to improve the texture and tone, reduce wrinkles, and help with recovery, for example. It has been shown to help after exercise to give muscles more energy to repair and function, relieving joint stiffness, increasing circulation and boosting energy levels. There is also evidence that red light frequencies can help regulate circadian rhythms, to calm the mind and induce sleep. But remember, these are controlled studies used with lab-grade equipment, so at-home devices can give you different results.

So how long should you spend under red light to get the benefits? There are many ways to get the benefits of red-light therapy, but duration ultimately depends on the device you're using, how powerful it is, the angle of the beam, and the number of lights inside. The less powerful it is, the longer it will take to see results.

Red light device manufacturer Bon Charge co-founder, Katie Mant, notes that the most relevant factor is irradiance, which is the dose of light delivered per square centimeter. “A more powerful device delivers the right wavelengths at a high enough intensity,” Mant says. ""The most studied [wavelengths] are in the 630–660nm and 810–850nm range. If a device uses weak LEDs, the wrong wavelengths, or spreads the light too widely, you simply won't get the same effect.""

Gary Brecka, founder of The Ultimate Human, notes that sessions of 10 to 20 minutes, three to five times per week, are typically recommended. “Red-light therapy can be delivered through different types of devices, and while some invest in creating a dedicated red-light therapy room, it's not strictly necessary,” he says. “Provided competing sources of light are turned off, you can experience the benefits.” You might want to also avoid using your red light right before bed, as evening exposure can interfere with sleep.

Patience is key when using red-light therapy across the face and body, and results are often gradual. If you're using a targeted beauty device, you'll need consistent use to maintain and notice any visible difference–it took eight weeks of testing the Shark CryoGlow for WIRED editor Verity Burns to notice smoother, plumper, and brighter looking skin.

“The main advantages of red-light therapy are that it's noninvasive, drug-free, and evidence-based for skin and recovery,” says Brecka. “Downsides include the variable quality of consumer devices, the potential cost, and the fact that long-term evidence is still emerging. Excitingly, research is expanding into neurological uses, such as traumatic brain injury and cognitive decline, where early findings are promising.”

When used as directed, red-light therapy is also considered low risk. “The main drawbacks are usually mild and temporary, such as warmth or slight skin redness if a session is too long or the device is held too close,” says Katie Mant, cofounder of the red-light therapy device company Bon Charge. “Red-light therapy is evolving rapidly, moving from large clinical devices to sleeker, more powerful home solutions, and devices now combine red and near-infrared light with other innovations like microcurrents, heat, or vibration for enhanced results.”

8/10

Buying budget-friendly wireless headphones will always involve compromises. But thanks to a big increase in competition among lesser-known Chinese brands, these compromises are rapidly shrinking. Baseus' Inspire XH1 ($150 from Baseus, $100 on Amazon) are a great example.

These noise-canceling headphones deliver a level of sound quality and isolation that comes impressively close to what you'll find in a much more expensive pair. They look good, they feel good, and their battery life is up to four times longer than many other options. They even come with a protective travel case that is just as good as the ones that ship with pricier models.

The Inspire family of Baseus products, which includes the XH1, the true-wireless noise-canceling XP1, and the open-ear XC1, all feature “Sound by Bose,” which means that Bose had a hand in tuning the audio. Baseus' design language is also Bose-inspired: the two main color options (Cosmic Black and Starlight Off-White) are similar to Bose's primary hues, and the XH1's blending of metal and plastic components mirrors Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Headphones.

The XH1's hinges fold up and fold flat, something the headphone market is leaning into after a period of only offering the fold-flat option. In the case of the XH1, it doesn't quite deliver the space savings achieved by other cans with a similar articulation. I'm a bit uneasy about the hinge itself. It's made of metal, which bodes well for durability, but it's also extremely loose, letting the ear cup yokes spin and swivel with no resistance at all. I have no evidence that this will be a problem; for now, it's more of a signal, like closing a car door and hearing a cheap-sounding clank instead of a confidence-inspiring thunk.

Baseus has also taken styling cues from Bose's flagship cans for the XH1's ear cushions, which can be replaced when worn out, headband, and sliders. They're very comfortable, though I had to be careful with the ear cup placement. Baseus uses large internal mics for its hybrid ANC, which are placed on top of the driver cavity. They take up room in the front/bottom portion of the ear cup, and on the left ear cup, I noticed that the mic bumped into my ear's antitragus, causing pressure after an hour. I could avoid this by shifting the ear cup slightly forward.

Some compromises have been made (there are no free lunches), and yet none feel like deal-breakers. There are no wear sensors to auto-pause your tunes when you remove the headphones. Switching between ANC and transparency mode requires you to pass through normal mode (unless you use the Baseus app). And you can't use transparency mode while on a call.

They may not be a great choice for gym-goers or runners. The clamping force is relatively gentle, which is perfect for long listening sessions, but less adept at keeping the cans from shifting around during active workouts. Could you use them at the gym? Absolutely. They even have an IP66 rating, far more water and dust protection than you'd normally find on wireless headphones, which rarely offer any official level of ingress protection.

The controls are easy to use—all are well placed and don't rely on touch sensitivity, though I'm still scratching my head over Baseus' track-skipping scheme. Normally, when a volume button doubles as a track skipper (usually via a long-press), the volume-up button skips forward and the volume-down skips back. On the XH1, it's reversed, which I find unintuitive. Still, you get used to it.

The Inspire XH1's sound signature has clear signs of Bose DNA. Out of the box, the cans are set to the Sound By Bose EQ preset, a robust mix that injects extra energy into the upper-mids and highs. In this mode, the cans deliver strong midrange detail, with neutral levels of bass. It's snappy, with good resonance; if you want more kick, an available Powerful Bass preset will oblige, providing a much stronger bass response. Should that still not scratch your bass itch, you can layer an optional Bass Boost mode on top of any EQ mix. If Powerful Bass + Bass Boost doesn't loosen your fillings, you may not have teeth. Should the seven available EQ presets stop short of what you're looking for, you can roll your own via an eight-band equalizer.

The caveat here is that the XH1's ANC mode acts as its own form of digital signal processing. Transparency mode imparts very little resonance; Normal mode brings bass forward a wee bit, and Noise Canceling turns everything up to 11.

I'm delighted that you can use the analog input when the power is off, but with no internal amplification or digital processing, the XH1 sound thin and a bit tinny. Best to think of that as an emergency option only. Still, with noise canceling engaged, these cans are a great listen. “Birds,” by Dominique Fils-Aimé, is a great test track for vocals, bass, and soundstage, and I found the XH1 comparable in all three to Sennheiser's Accentum Plus ($250).

For even more detail and nuance, turn on the optional LDAC codec in the Baseus app; you'll likely hear the more relaxed sound that comes from reducing Bluetooth compression. Baseus' Sound Personalization listening test is worth trying. It accurately assessed my slight high-frequency hearing loss, and I enjoyed the personalized EQ the test generated.

The XH1 also has two optional Dolby Audio modes, Music and Cinema. They're intended as immersive, spatial experiences that take any source and make it sound more like Dolby Atmos. They're both terrible. Music sounds like you're trapped in a public bathroom, while Cinema puts you in a cave. Baseus should ditch this feature and license Bose's Immersive Audio technology, one of the best spatializers I've heard so far.

Noise cancellation is far better than I would have expected at this price. The Inspire XH1 are almost as effective at dealing with unwanted sounds as the Sennheiser Accentum Plus and Sony's ULT Wear (both $250). They let in a tiny bit more than these pricier models, but unless you tested them side by side (as I have), I doubt you'd hear the difference. For busy streets, crowded cafés, and your daily transit commute, they do a great job.

I think I'm even more impressed with their transparency mode. This is the side of noise cancellation that budget headphones often fail to master. The XH1 not only made the outside world audible, they also let me hear myself clearly while talking.

Baseus Inspire XH1

Rating: 8/10

Transparency is so good, I'm really bummed that it doesn't work when on a call. If it did, these cans would be great for long calls and meetings. The mics are remarkably adept at keeping background noise invisible to callers. When those noises were particularly loud, my voice faded somewhat, but only the high-pitched wail of a siren managed to pierce through. When my environment was quieter, the XH1 kept my voice more stable and clear than the Soundcore Space One Pro ($200).

I'm not sure there's any consensus on how much battery life is “enough” for a set of wireless headphones, but I'm willing to bet no one has ever said, “My headphones last too long between charges.” So I'm going to go way out on a limb and say most folks will be thrilled with Baseus' claim of up to 100 hours for the Inspire XH1.

To get that level of stamina, you'll need to keep volume no higher than 50 percent, turn off both ANC and transparency, avoid using Dolby Audio, and only connect via AAC (as opposed to LDAC). Still, even with ANC on, the company says you'll get up to 65 hours—more than any flagship wireless headphones from Bose, Sony, Apple, or Sennheiser. Should a few weeks go by and you forget to charge them, a fast-charge of 10 minutes provides an additional 12 hours of play time.

It's tempting to bring up the Inspire XH1's lack of USB Audio and Bluetooth Auracast support as negatives, but at some point, you have to be realistic: These headphones may not be perfect, but when you consider what they get right (and what Baseus charges for them), they're undoubtedly an exceptional value. If you're after a pair of headphones that deliver great sound, good noise canceling, and top-tier transparency on a budget, every Baseus model deserves a look.

Every fall, something predictable happens across tech companies of every size. Teams who can architect systems, debug impossible bugs, and ship product under pressure suddenly hit a surprising moment of hesitation:

Open Enrollment.

It's the time of year when even the most capable engineers, founders, and operators pause in front of a benefits grid trying to make sense of deductibles, copays, networks, and plan names that seem to shift just enough each year to make the familiar unfamiliar again.

And in a workplace where decisions are constant — from product roadmaps to sprint planning — the mental load of choosing health benefits hits differently. It's personal. It's financial. It's high stakes. And it shows up right when the year is at its most demanding.

What most people don't say out loud is this:Open Enrollment doesn't feel hard because the information is complex.It feels hard because the decision matters.

Tech is a magnet for problem-solvers. But benefits aren't a problem to solve; they're a system to navigate — and one with moving parts. Plans change. Rates change. Networks shift. What made sense last year might not be the smartest choice this year.

Take the 2026 updates, for example. Medical plans saw adjustments, including a clearer design for the TechStarter 7000 plan where the deductible and out-of-pocket maximum now align. Dental plans added richer preventive coverage through the new Max Wellness 2500 option. Vision plans expanded LightCare benefits for screen-heavy work. Life insurance maximums increased to meet the needs of growing families. And mental health support transitioned fully to SupportLinc, bringing modernized EAP services with only a minor rate impact.

These updates are meaningful — but for the average employee, they're also one more layer to interpret.

Tech professionals often ask themselves the same questions:What if I pick the wrong plan? How do I know which option is truly right for my family? Is this benefit worth the cost?

It's decision fatigue, but with higher emotional stakes.

Founders and HR leaders often tell us the same thing:

“We don't need more options — we need clarity.”

Benefits shouldn't feel like a scavenger hunt or a crash course in insurance terminology. They should feel like a system built to reduce friction, not add to it.

That's where ALLtech was built differently.

Instead of asking employers to assemble benefits from scratch, ALLtech brings structure to the complexity. It's a trust designed specifically for Washington tech companies, combining high-quality carriers with a curated experience that removes guesswork and makes decisions easier for both employer and employee.

The goal isn't to overwhelm people with choices; it's to give them better ones, delivered in a way that makes sense for how tech teams work.

Ask any engineer what makes a system great, and you'll hear the same themes:

ALLtech approaches benefits with that same philosophy.

Through partnerships with Regence BlueShield, Delta Dental of Washington, VSP Vision Care, The Standard, and SupportLinc, ALLtech offers tech employers a cohesive benefits experience instead of a fragmented one. The structure is intentional — a platform that evolves alongside the companies it serves.

For 2026, that evolution includes:

These aren't small updates. They're part of a long-term strategy to make benefits feel easier — not because they are simpler, but because they are better structured.

Open Enrollment is often treated like a compliance moment: check the box, confirm your choices, move on.

But for employees, it's something more personal — a reflection of how supported they feel at work.

When benefits are confusing, employees feel it.When benefits are clear, employees feel that too.

For 2026, ALLtech's updates are designed to help Washington tech teams enter Open Enrollment with confidence instead of hesitation. Employees can evaluate plans more simply. Employers can communicate changes more clearly. And everyone can make decisions with a little less weight on their shoulders.

In a year where every company is thinking carefully about retention, culture, and long-term sustainability, that clarity matters.

Your team won't remember every line item in the benefits guide. But they will remember how supported they felt while making the decision.

Benefits are more than a cost.They're a signal — about culture, about care, about the type of company you're building.

When you choose a system built for innovators, creators, and high-performance teams, you send a message:

“We thought about you. We designed this with you in mind.”

And that message lands every time an employee books a doctor's visit, fills a prescription, gets new glasses, or seeks support in a stressful moment.

Open Enrollment may come once a year.But the impact lasts all year long.

“All this started with a really hot summer day in '21,” said Chris Muench, sitting in a small conference room at Hyviva, his startup based in Redmond, Wash.

The Pacific Northwest was being scorched in a heat dome and Muench's power went out at his home in nearby Duvall. The experience led him to purchase solar panels, but he also wanted to capture the excess power that was generated when the sun was shining its brightest, socking it away for when it wasn't. 

That led Muench and his wife, Sanja, to launch Hyviva in 2023 to build modular, hydrogen-powered energy storage units that essentially produce electricity from water. This month, the business is shipping its first devices to customers. 

Hyviva is initially targeting residential solar installations, a potentially ripe market as long-standing policies allowing homeowners to sell unused solar power back to utilities are being phased out in many places. That excess power can total 20% or more of a household's daily energy generation, according to a solar trade group. 

“That's the catalyst for storage,” said Paul Owen, chief marketing officer. “You've got this opportunity that's going to waste right now.”

Stored solar power can also reduce a home's reliance on utility-provided electricity — which is getting more expensive — and keep the lights on and fridge running during power outages.

Hyviva's device is a little narrower than a standard refrigerator, built from stacked units with a shiny black casing. Here's how it works:

“Every module can be plugged into another module without the need of a hydrogen expert,” Chris Muench said. “Just ‘Lego brick' them together, and then you decide how much power draw do you want, how much storage do you want, how much hydrogen you want to generate.”

The five-person company is promoting its technology online and was at the CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas last January. Hyviva's initial customers are in Europe and the first units are being built in Germany. The startup can also do manufacturing in Redmond for U.S. customers.

Hyviva's biggest U.S. rival is the Tesla Powerwall system that uses conventional lithium-ion batteries to hold power. The company reported $7.4 billion in revenue last year from energy generation, and that number has continued to climb.

Hyviva touts its product's competitive features across performance, safety and longevity. The startup's basic system holds more power — 33.6 kilowatt hours to Tesla's 13.5 kWh. While blazes are uncommon, lithium ion batteries pose a fire risk that's greater than the hydrogen present in a Hyviva device for short periods. And conventional batteries lose capacity over time, while the metal hydride retains its hydrogen storage capabilities for decades.

The startup, however, faces big hurdles when it comes to costs.

Tesla's Powerwall 3 costs roughly $15,000, including the system and installation costs, while a Hyviva unit is priced at about $40,000. 

But when it comes to scaling the storage capacity, the cost advantage flips as it's cheaper and easier to add hydrogen storage to the Hyviva system. So a 90-kilowatt hour setup is about $50,000 for the startup, while the company estimates a comparable Tesla system would cost $82,000 installed.

To put the capacity in perspective, a U.S. single-family household consumes around 80 kilowatt hours of power per day on average. 

As power demand keeps expanding globally, experts estimate that $1.2 trillion worth of battery energy storage will be needed through 2034. That escalating need is reflected in pockets of growth in the sector, including a Texas startup called Base Power that leases batteries to homeowners and recently announced $1 billion in new funding. And energy storage is being paired with data centers to reduce their power grid impacts, including at an Oregon campus that's installing 31 megawatts of batteries.

At the same time, Hyviva and others face political headwinds at the federal level as the current administration pushes policies and budgets that hobble renewable energy companies and deployments.

But the startup is attracting interest, said Chief Operations Officer John Traynor. It has funding from an angel investor and reports having dozens of potential customers, with commercial sites and utilities reaching out as well.

“That's given us the confidence that we're on the right track,” Traynor said.

In a move worthy of a post on the Not Like The Other Girls subreddit, Reddit, one of the world's largest social platforms, is arguing that it isn't like other, actual social media sites, as the company seeks to overturn Australia's law banning children under 16 years of age from social media.

In a lawsuit filed with Australia's top court, Reddit argues the law, which came into force on December 10, limits free political discourse by preventing children from airing their views online, and should be overturned.

And if the legislation isn't overturned, the company says it should be exempted from the law because it doesn't meet the legislation's definition of a “social media platform.”

Reddit is essentially asking the Australian High Court to address some of the questions raised about the legislation, which requires 10 major services to deactivate under-16s' accounts and prevent them from using the app. Critics argue that the law infringes on children's rights, and companies have sought to raise questions about what “social media” even defines.

Indeed, calling itself a “collection of public fora arranged by subject,” Reddit brought up definitions of the word “social” in its filing to make the case that “it is not the sole or a significant purpose of Reddit to enable persons to interact ‘in a social manner'.”

“Reddit enables online interactions about the content that users post on the site. It facilitates knowledge sharing from one user to other users. It is not a significant purpose of the site to enable interactions engaged in because of a particular user's relationship with or interest in another user as a person […] Reddit is significantly different from other sites that allow for users to become ‘friends' with one another, or to post photos about themselves, or to organise events,” the filing reads.

In a post accompanying the filing, Reddit admin LastBluejay said the law carries “some serious privacy and political expression issues for everyone on the internet.”

“While we agree with the importance of protecting people under 16, this law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't,” the post reads.

Reddit also points out that a significant portion of content on social media platforms is accessible without an account, and kids under 16 years old would be more easily protected if they were allowed to have accounts that could then be restricted.

Google is rolling out a beta experience that lets you hear real-time translations in your headphones, the company announced on Friday. The tech giant is also bringing advanced Gemini capabilities to Google Translate and expanding its language-learning tools in the Translate app.

The new real-time headphone translations experience keeps each speaker's tone, emphasis, and cadence intact, so it's easier to follow the conversation and tell who's saying what, Google says. The new capability essentially turns any pair of headphones into a real-time, one-way translation device. 

“Whether you're trying to have a conversation in a different language, listen to a speech or lecture while abroad, or watch a TV show or film in another language, you can now put in your headphones, open the Translate app, tap ‘Live translate' and hear a real-time translation in your preferred language,” said Rose Yao, Google VP Product Management, Search Verticals, in the blog post.

The beta is rolling out now in the Translate app on Android in the U.S., Mexico, and India. The feature works with any pair of headphones and supports more than 70 languages.

The company plans to bring the capability to iOS and more countries in 2026. 

As for the advanced Gemini capabilities coming to Translate, Google says they will enable smarter, more natural, and accurate text translations. They'll also enable improved translations of phrases with more nuanced meanings, like slang, idioms, or local expressions.

For example, if you're trying to translate an English idiom like “stealing my thunder,” you'll now get a more accurate translation instead of a literal word-for-word translation, as Gemini will parse the context to capture what the idiom really means.  

This update is rolling out now in the U.S. and India, translating between English and nearly 20 languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and German. The update is available in the Translate app on Android, iOS, and on the web.

Google is also expanding its language learning tools to almost 20 new countries, including Germany, India, Sweden, and Taiwan. English speakers can now practice German, while Bengali, Mandarin Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, German, Hindi, Italian, Romanian, and Swedish speakers can practice English. 

The tech giant is also adding improved feedback so you can get helpful tips based on your speaking practice. 

Additionally, Google is adding a feature that tracks how many days in a row you've been learning, making it easier to see your progress and stay consistent. While the tools were already designed to take on Duolingo, this new feature brings the experience even closer to the popular language-learning app.

World, the biometric ID verification project co-founded by Sam Altman, released the newest version of its app today, debuting several new features, including an encrypted chat integration and an expanded, Venmo-like capability for sending and requesting crypto. 

World was created by the startup Tools for Humanity in 2019, and originally launched its app in 2023. The company says that, in a world roiled by AI-generated digital fakery, it hopes to create digital “proof of human” tools that can help separate the humans from the bots. 

During a small gathering at World's headquarters in San Francisco on Thursday, Altman and World's co-founder and CEO, Alex Blania, briefly introduced the new version of the app (which developers have termed a “super app”) before the product team took over to explain the new features. During his remarks, Altman said that the concept for World grew out of conversations he and Blania had had about the need to create a new kind of economic model. That model, based around web3 principles, is what World has been trying to accomplish through its verification network. “It's really hard to both identify unique people and do that in a privacy-preserving way,” said Altman.

World Chat, the app's new messenger, seems designed to do just that. It uses end-to-end encryption to keep users' conversations safe (this encryption is described as being equivalent to Signal, the privacy-focused messenger), and also leverages color-coded speech bubbles to alert users to whether the person they're talking to has been verified by World's system or not, the company said. The idea is to incentivize verification, giving people the power to know whether the person they're talking to is who they say they are. Chat was originally launched in beta in March.

The other big feature reveal on Thursday was an expanded digital payment system that allows app users to send and receive cryptocurrency. World app has functioned as a digital wallet for some time, but the newest version of the app includes broader capabilities. Using virtual bank accounts, users can also receive paychecks directly into World App and make deposits from their bank accounts, both of which can then be converted into crypto. You don't have be verified by World's authentication system to use these features.

Tiago Sada, World's chief product officer, told TechCrunch that part of the reason chat was added was to create a more interactive experience for users. “What we kept hearing from people is that they wanted a more social World app,” Sada said. World Chat is designed to fill that need, creating what Sada says is a secure way to communicate. “It took a lot of work to make this feature-rich messenger that is similar to a WhatsApp or a Telegram, but with encryption and security of something that is a lot closer to Signal,” Sada said.

World (which was originally called Worldcoin) deploys a unique authentication process: Interested humans get their eyes scanned at one of the company's offices, where the Orb — a large verification device — converts the person's iris into a unique and encrypted digital code. That code, the verified World ID, can then be used by the person to interact with World's ecosystem of services, which are available through its app.

The addition of more social-friendly features is clearly meant to drive broader adoption of the app, which makes sense since scaling verification is the company's main challenge. Altman has said that he would like the project to scan a billion people's eyes, but Tools for Humanity claims to have scanned less than 20 million people.  

Since standing in long lines at a corporate office to have your eyeballs scanned by a giant metallic ball may seem slightly less than enticing to some users, the company has already sought to make its verification process less cumbersome. In April, Tools for Humanity announced its Orb Minis — hand-held, phone-like devices — that allow users to scan their own eyes from the comfort of their homes. Blania previously told TechCrunch that, eventually, the company would like to turn the Orb Minis into a mobile point-of-sale device or sell its ID sensor tech to device manufacturers. If the company takes such steps, it would drop the barrier to verification significantly, potentially inspiring much more widespread adoption.

Theo Baker is truly an outlier. 

While journalism as a major has seen shrinking enrollment for years and is even being dropped by some schools entirely, Baker, a senior at Stanford University, has doubled down on old-school investigative reporting, and it is paying off spectacularly.

Baker first made headlines as a college freshman when his reporting for The Stanford Daily led to the resignation of Stanford president Marc Tessier-Lavigne. After uncovering allegations of research misconduct spanning two decades, Baker — just one month into college — found himself “receiving anonymous letters, conducting stakeouts, and tracking down confidential sources,” according to his publisher. Meanwhile, high-powered lawyers tried to discredit his work. By year's end, Tessier-Lavigne had resigned, and Baker became the youngest-ever recipient of the George Polk Award, one of journalism's most prestigious honors.

Shortly after, Warner Bros. and famed producer Amy Pascal won a competitive auction for the film rights to his story.

But if that scandal put Baker on the map, his upcoming book may cement his reputation as the rare young journalist willing to challenge Silicon Valley's startup machine. 

“How to Rule the World,” out May 19 — three weeks before he graduates — promises an explosive look at how venture capitalists treat Stanford students as “a commodity,” wooing favored undergrads with slush funds, shell companies, yacht parties, and funding offers before they even have business ideas in their hunt for the next trillion-dollar founder.

“I watched in real time as my peers were taught to cut corners and plied with enormous wealth by people who wanted to exploit their talent,” Baker, who turns 21 next month, tells Axios. Drawing on more than 250 interviews with students, CEOs, VCs, Nobel laureates, and three Stanford presidents, the book aims to expose what Baker describes to Axios as a “weird, money-soaked subculture that has so much influence over the rest of the world.”

It's perhaps an unsurprising move from someone who grew up around top journalists. His father is New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker, and his mother is The New Yorker's Susan Glasser. While his peers chase venture capital funding and six-figure startup salaries, Baker spent his sophomore year reporting and took his junior year off to write, including two months at the Yaddo writers' retreat.

That choice becomes even more striking against the backdrop of journalism's current struggles. While traditional journalism programs fail to fill classes and media outfits face seemingly relentless layoffs, Baker represents something both exciting and increasingly uncommon: a star student betting his career on accountability journalism. Whether he's a harbinger of renewed interest in investigative reporting remains to be seen, but we'd guess his book will capture the attention of plenty of college students — and it will almost certainly make waves in Silicon Valley while doing it.

A company that makes photo booths is exposing pictures and videos of its customers online thanks to a simple flaw in its website where the files are stored, according to a security researcher.  

The researcher, who goes by Zeacer, alerted TechCrunch to the security issue in late November after reporting the vulnerability in October to Hama Film, the photo booth maker that has franchise presence in Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States, but did not hear back.

Zeacer shared with TechCrunch a sample of pictures taken from Hama Film's servers, which showed groups of clearly young people posing in photo booths. Hama Film's booths not only print out the photos like a typical photo booth, but booths also upload the customers' photos to the company's servers.

Vibecast, which owns Hama Film, has yet to respond to his messages alerting the company of the issues. Vibecast also hasn't responded to several requests for comment from TechCrunch, nor did Vibecast's co-founder Joel Park respond to a message we sent via LinkedIn.

As of Friday, the researcher said the company has still not fully resolved the security flaw and continues to expose customers' data. As such, TechCrunch is withholding specific details of the vulnerability from publication.

When Zeacer first found this flaw, he noted that it appeared that photos were deleted from the photo booth maker's servers every two to three weeks. 

Now, he said, the pictures stored on the servers appear to get deleted after 24 hours, which limits the number of pictures exposed at any given time. But a hacker could still exploit the vulnerability he discovered each day and download the contents of every photo and video on the server. 

Before this week, Zeacer said at one point he saw more than 1,000 pictures online for the Hama Film booths in Melbourne. 

This incident is the latest example of a company that, at least for a time, was not implementing certain basic and widely accepted security practices, such as rate-limiting. Last month, TechCrunch reported that government contractor giant Tyler Technologies was not rate-limiting its websites used for allowing courts to manage their jurors' personal information. This meant anyone could break into any juror's profile by running a computer script capable of mass-guessing their date of birth and their easy-to-guess numerical identifier.

I'm bringing this up because it's the perfect litmus test to show whether you really care about age verification, or if you want personal trackability for all internet behavior.I'd be okay with this for certain situations (e.g. a forum that doesn't want to foreign agitators to pretend they are US voters), but the whole porn thing is a ridiculous farce because there are still going to always be millions of non-us porn sites that don't enforce US laws.

As a not super tech savvy parent I find it impossible to keep my son off screens. He always finds a workaround. So I'm a fan of age verification especially after reading The Anxious Generation, despite all the hate it gets from hacker news.

reply

But it sounds like your wish is to keep people of screens in general, which I don't think age verification would accomplish.

You meant logical criticism?

reply

This coloring problem is NP complete and somehow the thing the prover is proving is encoded in the graph structure.  At the end of the day, the only thing the verifier is sure of is that the prover can make the three colored graph, 1 bit that corresponds to the thing the verifier wants to know (eg - does the prover have a token that can show they are over 18).

My bigger concern would be who gets to issue these tokens. If it's limited to a particular government, then that doesn't work very well on a global internet. And making the internet not global (blocking adults from accessing foreign websites that don't adhere to your scheme) is kinda authoritarian IMO.If we're going to do age verification and blocking of adult sites, it needs to be local to the user's device (and thus under the control of parents, not governments).E.g. Instead of mandating sites verify users, we mandate internet-capable devices sold to kids have certain content restrictions, the same way we mandate you can't sell  alcohol to kids. To make this more effective than existing content filtering, implement some kind of legally-enforced content-labeling standards websites have to follow to be whitelisted on these devices. This way the rights, freedoms, and privacy of adults using adult devices is unaffected.

E.g. Instead of mandating sites verify users, we mandate internet-capable devices sold to kids have certain content restrictions, the same way we mandate you can't sell  alcohol to kids.

Instead how about we simply continue to make reasonable laws regarding behaviour and holding individual people and companies responsible when they violate the law.Whilst we are at it we can keep content filtering for pre teens and imposed by parents and accept that teens are going to figure out how to get to the real internet at some point.

And yes, you are arguing against ""making it easier for parents"" - my original post literally advocated for legislating tech companies to make controls available, effective, and easy to use.

Ad hominem attacks - great way to find common ground. I actually did try to find common ground, which is that we need to legislate. My argument is that the real entities that need legislation are the ones who can most afford to do so - in both time, resources, and ownership of the platforms that we are all beholden to. I will not advocate for even more punitive restrictions on parents (who already are subject to enough societal punitive pressures as it is - TBH your post is a great example. Instead of empathy, you reply with scorn and derision - as if I'm not good enough to parent my kids).> I believe that it would be good for Parental Controls on devices to have a toggle to say that the phone is being used by someone in under 13, or someone 14-18 (whatever bands you want).So you're admitting that parental controls are ineffective?> Laws can be passed that tell remote connections how they must act when receiving this flag.And those laws are enforced through what mechanism?

So we talk about it and try to get them to manage it themselves. They're not unwilling, but the addiction of continuous scrolling is really hard to break. It's not even that the content is terrible, it's more just the mindless zombies -- like sitting all day on the couch watching TV. And they don't even have an IG or TT account (and won't be getting one for a long time) -- this is YouTube (which now has endless scrolling like TT) which I don't want to block altogether because there's other helpful resources on there.I've always been an early adopter, and was on BBS and IRC and all that back in the day, love the fact that the Internet is a place you can easily set up your own blog and all that, but recently I've honestly come to f*ing hate the internet in general and social media in particular.

My daughter is still a baby, so the problem is still a few years away. But I don't know how to best handle it.In some ways, I see social media as more poisonous to the brain than alcohol or tobacco. So, forbidding - or heavily limiting - internet access sounds like a plan.On the other hand, part of me being a parent is teaching her how to navigate the world. And part of that, wether I like or not, is using the internet. Having contact with the communication tools that exist.The world is full of sons of bitches. If I don't teach her how to deal with that, I would be raising an idiot.Still, a problem for the future me to ponder over.

Now you have ubiquitous WiFi and cellular connectivity across dozens of devices in a typical household. Even refrigerators have built in web browsers now.

Oh, and the school system provides your kids with a Chromebook with Internet access starting in elementary school.It's victim blaming at its finest IMO. Yeah, we can all point fingers at the parents who sit their kids down with an iPad. But there's many of us who struggle to limit screen time, working against the profit motive of trillions of dollars of corporations. It's a losing battle.Edit: crazy.

Given that solution is unlikely to be legislated into action I would suggest people are just going to share adult content on Usenet, Tor, P2P, within G/PG rated video games by plonking down a virtual theater and streaming from a throw-away VM and fully automating syncing with LFTP+mirror+SFTP, sharing USB NVME drives, mobile ephemeral websites over WiFi and other methods when people get tired of this Top/Bottom relationship lobbyists want us to participate in.

My understanding, at least several years ago, that Netflix was paying as much to Apple in subscription fees, as they did for their AWS hosting.I also noticed when upgrading my Spotify account, I couldn't do that through the iphone app itself - I assumed this was because it would break TOS, or they didn't want to pay a massive chunck of the monthly subscription cost to Apple.

I would think making sure outside payment links aren't scams will be more expensive than that because checking that once isn't sufficient. Scammers will update the target of such links, so you can't just check this at app submission time. You also will have to check from around the world, from different IP address ranges, outside California business hours, etc, because scammer are smart enough to use such info to decide whether to show their scammy page.Also, even if it becomes ‘only' hundreds of dollars, I guess only large companies will be able to afford providing an option for outside payments.

There has been craploads of litigation about “Fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory” licensing over the last two decades, and fees that are percentages of revenue with no cap have survived and there is no reason to believe any of these legal standards will change.In fact, I think it's likely that Apple and Google will team up to create a standards body that defines the method for distributing/installing smartphone apps (because this is now in their best interest, not that I want them to).

This is the fundamental problem, and not something this court ruling does anything to fix. Apple has full control over what software its competitors are allowed to sell. The court's solution? Tell Apple to be more fair when dictating rules to its competitors. Yeah... I'm sure that'll work great.

- Apple shouldn't be able to charge for external payments, come on.- Force prominent disclosure of refund policies. Epic Games doesn't allow them for IAP. Apple does. Epic knows exactly how predatory that is, betting some kids will find ways to spend thousands and the parents will be helpless. Ideally you'd have a law mandating refunds, but without that, there should be mandatory disclosure on the IAP screen, at least for microtransaction games. You can't have fair ""competition"" when you have an information asymmetry, and if these rulings don't mandate that, you'll open the floodgate for these gaming companies to screw over parents.

Apple has no official App Store refund policy, either for IAP or for upfront paid apps. I've already looked for one. There's of course a form to request a refund, but refunds are entirely at Apple's discretion, for any reason or no reason, and Apple often exercises its discretion to refuse refunds.

                Reading time 2 minutes
      

Tonight at the Game Awards, we finally got a first look at Capcom and Paramount Pictures' upcoming Street Fighter film, which wasted no time getting down to all the action.

While there may have been some reservations about whether a live-action Street Fighter movie would have the juice to look the part without coming off as too goofy to be legitimately hype, we have to admit, it certainly shut us up a little bit. The trailer was a mile a minute, referencing while showing off its illustrious list of actors and wrestlers in full costumes, and dare we say they looked pretty decent for Hollywood cosplay of video game characters. The trailer itself was mostly a hodgepodge of action with very little hinting toward what its actual story might be, but it's really there for that at the moment. Let's watch Chun Li kick fools, Guile do his flash kick, and folks and cars alike get air-juggled.

As far as the last Street Fighter film endeavors go, those being the Jean-Claude Van Damme one and that other one about Chun Li you likely forgot about, this film definitely leaned more heavily into embracing the camp of the games' nonstop action. Aesthetically, though, the game seems to be taking more pointers from its newest game, Street Fighter VI‘s more neon-drenched urban look. All the better to make Cody Rhode's Guile hair look just that much more pronounced.

In case the rapid-fire role call of video game characters was too fast for you, here's the who's who of Street Fighter and the actors bringing them to life:

Time will tell whether the film will have a story mode as raucous as its trailer's unbridled arcade action. But from this first look, director Kitao Sakurai definitely left a good first impression of what's to come when the movie hits theaters in 2026.

Star Wars has a beloved and peculiar history with racing games, from the iconic Racer and its sequel to the bizarre Super Bombad Racing. That legacy is growing next year with the release of a brand-new racing game, Galactic Racer.

If you thought Fate of the Old Republic was going to be the only shocker from the galaxy far, far away at the Game Awards tonight, Lucasfilm and Fuse Games announced Star Wars: Galactic Racer, a new racing game set after the events of the original Star Wars trilogy.

Described as a “runs-based” racing game, Galactic Racer will see players cast as Shade, a racer who joins the Galactic League, an underground racing circuit bankrolled by the criminal syndicates of the Outer Rim. There, Shade finds a rival in Kestar, who wishes to use the criminal pull of the League to further his own power. Also, Sebulba's here! Somehow, everyone returned.

As well as a single-player story campaign, Galactic Racer will also feature a PVP mode where players build their own repulsorcraft and reputation alike against other players.

“From the beginning, Star Wars has drawn inspiration from racing culture, from podracing to high-speed chases across the galaxy,” said Douglas Reilly, Lucasfilm Games VP said in a statement. “With Star Wars: Galactic Racer, the team at Fuse Games has captured that spirit and elevated it into a wholly new form of racing adventure. We can't wait for fans to experience it.”

Galactic Racer releases for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and PC sometime in 2026.

Turns out, three mutants are better than two: after Rogue, Marvel Rivals is adding another X-Man in the form of Deadpool.

NetEase and Marvel shared the news during the Game Awards, which saw the Merc With a Mouth show up to loudly and proudly declare himself as the next hero to join the fray. The trailer also seemingly confirmed that renowned Marvel Comics monster hunter, Elsa Bloodstone, will be the second hero of the season alongside him. From the animated trailer, we can see Deadpool's got his guns and swords on hand, ditto his regeneration and chatty personality. How NetEase translates the character to actual Marve Rivals gameplay, we'll have to wait and find out in the coming weeks.

Deadpool will join Marvel Rivals as part of its sixth season on January 16, 2026, followed by Elsa at a later date.

You don't own the e-books you buy on Amazon's Kindle store. You simply own a license to view the content at your leisure, and Amazon can revoke the license for whatever reason it chooses. However, there's a small spot of hope for people who want to own the things they buy. Amazon will allow users to download some books starting in 2026, though only if a publisher offers its own approval.

You can read more about Kindle's policy change on its DRM (digital rights management) support page. Starting on Jan. 20 next year, “verified purchasers can download the EPUB or PDF files of your confirmed DRM-free books.” That acronym is a catch-all term for any software limitation that restricts users from reselling or otherwise manipulating copyrighted works. Good e-Reader (via Android Police) first spotted the change in policy.

Back in February, Amazon closed a loophole that allowed users to download Kindle books and send them to other e-readers. This “Download & transfer via USB” feature in tandem with older e-book formats allowed some users to then hack the files, changing their format to make them accessible on other devices. Sure, the tool was certainly used for book piracy, though other users simply wanted to access books they already—ostensibly—owned on their choice of device.

Now, Amazon is putting the onus on book publishers to decide whether users should be able to own their e-books, at least in the traditional sense of the word “own.” Starting early next year, users can download either EPUB or PDF via the Manage Your Content and Devices page on Amazon's website. This won't work if you're reading these e-books via a Kindle Unlimited subscription. The new DRM rules state that if you download an e-book and the publisher changes its mind, you'll still maintain control of that copy even if you can't download it anymore.

This will be a positive change for any lingering Kindle readers with big libraries. Amazon's latest devices, like the $280 Kindle Colorsoft and the $630 Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, are more expensive than some other e-reader alternatives, so this is a win for smaller e-reader brands as well. Now, the only lingering question is which publishers will be willing to offer PDF access to their books.

If you consider how fast the publishing industry went after the Internet Archive for daring to create a public online repository of books and journals, there may be few authors and publishers willing to enable free digital downloads. The Association of American Publishers (AAP), a trade group representing the big five major publishing houses, successfully sued the Internet Archive for copyright infringement. At least, in the words of founder Brewster Kahle, the Internet Archive “survived” the lawsuit, even if the library didn't.

AAP wrote after the case settled late last year, “The public interest… is served best when authors and their publisher licensees can decide the terms on which they make their works available.” Gizmodo reached out to several of the major publishing houses for comment on plans for book downloads, and we'll update this post if we hear back.

Even if Amazon is pushing responsibility onto the publishers, at least it may mean we can finally feel some small, incremental sense of ownership.

For years, fans have been begging and hoping for remakes of two of the most beloved Star Wars video games ever made: Knights of the Old Republic, and its sequel, The Sith Lords. They're not getting those, at least not yet. Because they're getting a new game instead.

In a shock announcement at the Game Awards tonight, Lucasfilm and Arcanaut Studios revealed Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, a brand new single-player action RPG inspired by the world and player-choice-driven storytelling of the Knights of the Old Republic games.

In a new interview on the official Star Wars website with Fate‘s lead director and head of Arcanaut, ex-Bioware developer Casey Hudson (director of Knights of the Old Republic as well as the Mass Effect games during his time at the studio), Fate of the Old Republic is described as a “contemporary vision of a definitive Star Wars experience” and an all-new story inspired by the beloved Old Republic setting. Fate is not a direct sequel or continuation of the Knights of the Old Republic games, but instead follows a new player character, a Force user “on a journey through a galaxy on the edge of rebirth.”

It is currently unclear if Fate is set in the original “Old Republic” era of the former Expanded Universe continuity—now dubbed Star Wars Legends—or if the game will be one of the first original canonical explorations of the period made since the reboot of Star Wars continuity in 2014. The trailer teases several iconic pieces of design from the original KOTOR, including the wreckage of what looks like the Leviathan, a prominent flagship of the Sith Fleet seen throughout the game that is ultimately destroyed during the climactic battle for Rakata Prime.

“Star Wars‘ past is a vast open canvas for creators to explore without having to navigate storytelling touchstones from other media,” Lucasfilm Games VP Douglas Reilly said of the game's setting. “Being set in the past gives us an immense amount of open space to tell new original Star Wars stories, while staying true to the spirit of the galaxy we all love. There are, quite literally, infinite stories to tell. While we will always honor and celebrate the core saga, it's crucial to explore new territory, meet new characters, and see new parts of the galaxy.”

Have you seen that news about plans for Dracula Land, an enormous development in Bucharest, Romania, that's supposed to include not just a vampire-themed amusement park but a tech hub, a luxury shopping outlet, and a sports arena? Oh, and a water park, a hotel, and a race track. Also, a metaverse with NFTs and its own cryptocurrency called DraculaCoin. Did you catch all that?

“Dracula Land is a hybrid ecosystem — a physical destination, a digital universe, and a scalable intellectual property,” the official website explains.

UK news outlet The Sun put the words “Transylvanian Disneyland” in the headline, and it does indeed seem like something that would be on par with Disney's most ambitious theme park ideas. The question, of course, is whether they can actually build it. And given the timeline and heavy use of AI for concept art, we're not going to hold our breath that we'll get to visit Dracula Land anytime soon.

The website for Dracula Land features at least 47 videos, by our count, and every single one appears to be AI-generated. The amusement park videos include a costumed character made to look like a gigantic bat walking around in an environment with an aesthetic similar to Harry Potter.

The concepts seem like they would appeal to a substantially large audience (who wouldn't love a vampire-themed park?), but the fact that everything about it appears AI-generated will give anyone pause. The site has that disturbing vibe we've all become creeped out by in the 2020s.

Just take a look at the video for Dracula Land's “Transylvania” section, and you'll see what we mean.

Yes, all of the tell-tale signs of AI are there. And we get that Dracula is supposed to be creepy. But this is creepy in a very unfun way.

And if you can explain what's happening in the screenshot below, we'd love to hear it.

Dracula Land claims the park will be over 780,000 square meters and feature six “immersive themed areas and over 40 major attractions.” The fashion and home shopping facility is supposed to be 9,000 square meters of retail space, featuring 70 brands. And there will also be three hotels with a combined 1,200 rooms, according to the website.

The water park and spa clocks in at 50,000 square meters with 30 water attractions and “one of the largest wave pools in Europe.” The race track is 4.5 km, and the tech hub is another 15,000 square meters.

That's all very… ambitious to say the least. And we haven't even gotten to the timeline.

The selling points for Dracula Land seem to make some logical sense. Central and Eastern Europe lacks a “global-scaled brand destination,” and it's a growth market for cultural tourism. “The Dracula myth is one of the world's most recognized cultural symbols — yet commercially underdeveloped,” the website reads.

And that might all be true. But the thing that jumps out most is the aggressive timeline presented. The website says “phase 1” was started in 2024 and runs through 2025, and includes “master planning” and “early creative development.” Phase 2 is listed as the construction phase from 2025-2026, when physical construction will begin, and the digital platform will be launched in beta. We assume that's the metaverse and crypto part. Phase 3 is described as the launch period, from 2026-2027, with the grand opening.

The website for Dracula Land lists its founder as real estate investor Dragos Dobrescu and includes testimonials from people like Florin Citu, the former Prime Minister of Romania, who's quoted as saying Dracula Land is “a platform capable of reshaping how Romania is perceived at the European and global level.”

We reached out to the people behind Dracula Land with several questions, but we didn't get any answers. We were most interested in that incredibly quick timeline. And that cryptocurrency, which is called DraculaCoin. A representative named Madalina Ivan directed Gizmodo to the press release on the Dracula Land website and wrote that, “Future milestones will be featured in our News section.” A follow-up email asking about the questions we'd posed went unanswered.

Gizmodo also reached out to two of the design firms listed on the website, Piurach and Creative Studio Berlin, which haven't responded. The website of Creative Studio Berlin includes mock-ups for a Dracula Land where the client is listed as undisclosed, and the scope includes “Blue sky and concept developer.” The timeline reads “2023 (not yet opened),” though it's not clear how long this Dracula Land has been in development. Those mock-ups don't appear AI-generated, though none of them seem to be on the Dracula Land website.

If you just pitched this idea on paper, it seems potentially fun, provided you ignore all the AI slop. Again, it seems like it would be cool to inhabit a world of cartoonish vampires if they actually built the place. But given the fact that we've only seen largely AI renderings, we're not packing our bags just yet. There's a big difference between standing up a website and actually building an enormous theme park.

But delays the completion of its construction?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


TSMC is mulling upgrading the capabilities of its yet-to-be-built Fab 23 phase 2 in Japan in a bid to make chips on its N4 process technology (4nm-class) there, according to Nikkei. Advancing fab capabilities is hardly something unexpected for foundries like TSMC, as they tend to follow demand with their offerings. What is perhaps more surprising is that TSMC has removed heavy machinery equipment from the site and has notified suppliers that it would not need new fab tools in Japan throughout the whole 2026.

TSMC's Fab 23 phase 2 (aka JASM phase 2) near Kumamoto, Japan, was projected to make chips on N6 (6nm-class) and N7 (7nm-class) fabrication technologies, which would complement the capabilities of the company's Fab 23 phase 1 that processes wafers using 40nm, 28nm, 22nm, 16nm, and 12nm-class manufacturing processors. If the information from Nikkei is correct, then Fab 21 phase 2 will also add N4 and N5 capabilities to its list to make more advanced chips for Japanese customers.

Truth to be told, although N5/N4 and N7/N6 families of manufacturing technologies have completely different design rules and the former are substantially more advanced than the latter as they use up to 14 EUV layers, the equipment that they use is generally similar. As a result, TSMC's N5/N4 fabs reuse as much as 90% of the tools used by N7/N6 production lines, enabling relatively easy fab upgrades. That said, upgrading Fab 23 phase 2 to N4 and N5 should not be a big challenge for TSMC, but might require some redesigns as the N4 production line requires more EUV lithography tools, and these are physically larger than DUV tools. In fact, back in 2023, the company already mulled enabling N4 production in Kumamoto, so everything might be ready for the installation of more EUV scanners.

One interesting thing to note about TSMC's Fab 23 phase 2 is that while it entered the early phase of physical build-out in late October (according to Nikkei), photos taken at the site in November showed cranes, excavators, and piledrivers on site. However, images captured in early December reveal that nearly all heavy equipment has since been removed. Also, suppliers were notified that work would pause, although no reasons were provided. Furthermore, TSMC reportedly notified its tool suppliers that it would not need new equipment in Japan throughout 2026, which implies that it will not start equipping JASM phase 2 next year due to construction delay, which is barely news given all the information surrounding the facility.TSMC declined to comment on the report. However, it did note that TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei announced the construction start of Fab 21 phase 2 during the company's most recent earnings call.“Next, in Japan, thanks to the strong support from the Japan Central, prefectural, and local governments, our first specialty fab in Kumamoto has already started volume production in late 2024 with very good yield,” said Wei. “The construction of our second fab has begun, and the ramp schedule will be based on our customers' needs and market conditions.”

Learn the basics and improve your PowerShell skills


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In this guide we will take a look at some simple command prompt commands and then delve into PowerShell and learn how it handles the same tasks, providing you a guide to the top ten powershell commands you need to know to get started.

In the 1990s I had a 486 PC with just enough RAM to run Star Wars X-Wing or Windows 3.1. I learnt the MS-DOS prompt and I was soon navigating the filesystem and tweaking config files like a sys admin with a deadline. These days I spend more time in the Linux terminal than Windows Command Prompt, but it did have me wondering how the command prompt and its “successor” PowerShell behaved in 2025. And so, here we are!

Microsoft's PowerShell is a command line shell and scripting language that is more powerful than the command prompt, and offers automation and system administration tools for the Windows sys admin who wants to automate parts of their role. The scripting side of things has advanced logic such as loops, variables, functions etc and that makes it ideal for boring jobs like user creation, system configuration and software deployment.

PowerShell uses cmdlets (command-lets) that are small, single-function commands and has a get and set syntax to get the information that we need, and then we can set the configuration to how we want things to work.

Those of us with a little grey in our hair will probably be familiar with MSDOS commands, and most of these commands still work with PowerShell. Let's take a quick look at a few of the old commands.

Command

Description

Example

dir

Lists the contents of a directory, this can be the current working directory, or another location passed as an argument.

dir



Another location

dir C:\Users\

cd

Changes the current directory.

cd Music

copy

Copy file(s) from one location to another.

copy truck.png c:\Users\lespo\Documents\

del

Delete a file

del truck.png

move

Moves a file from one location to another.

move truck.png c:\Users\lespo\Documents\

mkdir

Creates a new directory in the current working directory, or in another location if passed as an argument.

mkdir Images



Another location

mkdir D:\Images

rmdir

Delete a directory in the current working directory, or in another location is passed as an argument.

rmdir Images



Another location

rmdir D:\Images

ipconfig

Shows information on the currently active network connections.

ipconfig

ping

Checks a network connection by “pinging” a target IP address or URL.

ping 8.8.8.8

tasklist

Lists all of the running processes by name or PID.

tasklist

Lets now take a look at how PowerShell does things with these ten commands.

1. Get-Help

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

 




The Get-Help command is your key to unlocking the built-in help files that PowerShell has hidden away. It can display information on cmdlets and their syntax.

The help files can be updated by running this command.

2. Get-Command



Not sure what commands you can run in PowerShell? This command lists all of the available commands and functions at your disposal.

3. List and Control Services



In the background on our Windows machines, services run to perform tasks and await user input. These services can range from DHCP for our network to Google Chrome updates to print services like Bonjour. We can list all running and stopped services with this command.

We can then stop a running service by running this command and passing the name of the service. For example, here I am stopping the Bonjour print service.

If I need to restart a service, I just use this command and pass the name of the service.

4. List all the running processes



Much like services, these commands can list the running processes on your PC. They could be the multiple Chrome processes that prevent all of your windows and tabs from disappearing when a crash occurs. Once we know which processes are running, we can stop a process that is consuming too much of our resources.

To list the processes.

To stop a process.

5. List files and directories

 




There are a few ways to list the contents of a directory. We can use dir or ls to list the contents of the current directory, or another location by passing the location as an argument. We can also use get-childitem to perform the same task.

6. Copy-Item

 




Essentially, this is the same command as copy but in PowerShell. Of course, you can still use copy in PowerShell, it acts like an alias for this command. Here I am copying a file IMG_20251105_111626.jpg into the same directory, but I am changing the destination files name to testpic.jpg.

7. Move-Item

 




The move-item command works just like move, changing a file's location to a new directory. Here I am moving the testpic.jpg to a new directory inside the current working directory. I use dir, passing the directory as an argument.

8. Remove-Item

 




This is basically the same as using the del command to delete a file. Here I change directory to extras, and then I use Get-ChildItem to list the contents of the directory. Then I use Remove-Item to delete testpic.jpg before I then list the contents of the extras directory to show that the deletion has occurred.

9. Get, set and append content

 




Have you ever needed to take a peek inside a text file, but don't need to open a text editor? I've done this many times on Linux (less / more / cat) and there came a time where I needed to in Windows PowerShell, so I used this. Here I am reading the contents of textfile.txt which I created in Notepad++. The output of the file is dumped to the PowerShell terminal, just like Linux would send output to the terminal.

 




If you need or want to create a file in PowerShell, you can use this command to create a new file. Note that the command will interactively ask for input [value0[, [value1] etc. When you have entered all your text, press Enter on a blank line to signal to the command that you are done. This command will overwrite the contents of the file, so only use it on new files or if you are really sure.

 




If you want to append to a file, you'll need to use this command. It has the same [value0], [value1] workflow as Set-Content.

10. Test-Connection

 




This is effectively the same command as ping. It contacts a remote host and checks that your machine, and the remote machine can communicate with each other. This is often used to check that your PC can get online, especially when trying to determine network connectivity issues. The command takes an IP address or URL as an argument, here I am using the IP address for Google's main DNS server.

 




Here is the same command, using google.com as the target.

So there we go, we've taken our first steps into PowerShell commands, comparing them to command prompt commands and explaining how to use them. Some are useful, others are quirky, and their “DOS” aliases make much more sense for daily use, but there will come a time when we need to know these commands, say for a script or configuration file, so keep them in mind.

Theobromine is found in cocoa and, to a lesser extent, coffee. It is chemically similar to caffeine but does not have such a pronounced stimulant effect.

A new study, published in the journal Aging, measured levels of this compound in people's blood. 

They found that those with the highest levels had epigenetic markers associated with slower biological aging.

Theobromine is a bioactive phytochemical, meaning that it comes from a plant, and it can influence human physiology. 

The primary sources of theobromine in the human diet are chocolate and, to a lesser extent, coffee. 

This compound is a major component of cocoa beans, comprising around 3.3% by weight. It is molecularly similar to caffeine and shares some of its effects. 

However, experts consider theobromine to be a more “gentle” central nervous system stimulant, partly because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily as caffeine.

Theobromine is toxic to humans in high doses, but not at the levels normally consumed, which is why chocolate is safe for humans, thankfully. For cats and dogs, though, it is a different story. Because they metabolize the compound more slowly, it can build up and become toxic more easily.

Chronological age is the number of birthdays you have had since you were born. Biological age, on the other hand, is not bound by time. Rather, it is the physiological condition of your cells, tissues, and organs.

Some people, for instance, may be 80 in chronological years but, if they avoided serious disease, ate a healthy diet, and exercised regularly throughout their lives, their biological age might be 60.

This can run in the other direction, too. Someone who has not lived a healthy life might have a biological age of 80 even if they have only traveled around the sun 60 times.

Although there is not a single way to measure biological age, scientists have designed a number of methods that can provide insights. In this study, they used a number of measures, including epigenetics and telomere length.

Our genetics are set in stone. The genes we have as a fetus are the same ones we carry to the grave. However, these genes can be turned “on” or “off” by so-called epigenetic changes.

Medical News Today reached out to Fady Hannah-Shmouni, MD, who was not involved in the study. He is an endocrinologist and geneticist at the University of British Columbia and medical director at Eli Health. To help us understand epigenetics, he explained:

“You can think of your DNA as the hardware of your body, the basic blueprint you're born with. Epigenetics is like the software settings that tell your cells how to use that blueprint.” 

Importantly, the authors of the current study write that “Epigenetic deregulation is a key hallmark of aging.” 

They also explain how research shows that alkaloids, like theobromine, can influence epigenetics. Therefore, they decided to investigate whether the health benefits of cocoa and coffee might be attributable to epigenetic changes.

One common epigenetic mechanism is methylation. “DNA methylation is one of the key epigenetic switches,” Hannah-Shmouni told MNT. “Small chemical tags called methyl groups (tiny carbon-and-hydrogen clusters) get attached to DNA.”

“When a gene gets a lot of methyl tags,” he continued, “it often becomes harder to read; the gene is ‘turned down' or sometimes ‘turned off.'”

In the current study, the scientists used a methodology called GrimAge. According to Hannah-Shmouni, “GrimAge is one of the most advanced and researched epigenetic aging clocks. It predicts biological age, but also something deeper.” He explained how it can also predict:

Another biomarker of aging is telomere length. 

Telomeres are like the protective caps on the ends of shoelaces. They sit at the end of chromosomes and ensure that their complex 3-D structure does not become unraveled.

As we age, our telomeres grow shorter, and scientists can use this as a marker of biological aging.

For their study, the researchers recruited 1,669 participants, 509 of whom were twins. They analyzed their blood samples for theobromine and other compounds found in coffee and chocolate.

They found that those with the highest levels of theobromine in their blood had signs of slower epigenetic aging than those with the lowest levels. They saw the same pattern in telomere length, although the relationship was weaker.

This difference, the authors explain, may be because these two measures “capture separate aspects of the aging process that do not necessarily overlap.”

When they investigated links between other chocolate and coffee bioactives in the blood, they did not find the same association with biological aging. This suggests that theobromine is responsible for the effect.

Although previous studies have shown that theobromine and related compounds can extend the life span of worms, this is the first study in humans to reach a similar conclusion.

This study is fascinating, not only because it hints that chocolate might slow aging, but also because this widely-consumed compound is relatively safe (for humans).

However, this is not an open-and-shut case; there are many questions left. Although the scientists did assess blood levels of a few compounds, there are many more that they did not measure.

For instance, as the authors explain, coffee contains other health-promoting compounds, like the polyphenol flavan-3-ol. 

In this study, they did not measure this compound, but because it is found in chocolate, if someone has high theobromine levels, they may also have high levels of flavan-3-ol. 

As the authors explain, “the cardiometabolic and healthy aging benefits of flavan-3-ols are well established.” So, this study could be a red herring. Maybe the slowed biological aging is simply due to higher levels of another compound in chocolate.

Hannah-Shmouni also mentioned that reverse causation might explain the results. “People with slower biological aging may metabolize theobromine differently,” he explained.

However, overall, Hannah-Shmouni thinks that “The findings are intriguing and justify future intervention studies.” Suggesting future directions, he recommends randomized controlled trials with controlled doses of theorbomine, longitudinal studies, and studies that include the measurement of other polyphenols.

This is not a yes-or-no question. Many chocolate products are highly processed and contain a raft of additives, including large amounts of simple sugars.

However, chocolate can still be part of a healthy diet. MNT contacted Federica Amati, PhD, MPH, MSc, a medical scientist, registered public health nutritionist, and honorary research fellow at Imperial College London.

“Chocolate has had a bad rap over the years,” she explained. “This is because the majority of chocolate-based products contain a raft of unnecessary ingredients, including emulsifiers and buckets of added sugars.”

“dark chocolate that's at least 70% cocoa and only contains a handful of ingredients can actually support good health. Cocoa contains a range of healthy, bioactive plant compounds, like polyphenols, which are antioxidants and support a healthy gut microbiome.”— Federica Amati, PhD

“Aside from phytochemicals, chocolate is also rich in iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and many other micronutrients,” she added.

So, the bottom line is this: Theobromine might support slower biological aging, but if it does not, you can still enjoy chocolate if you choose the right product.

Centralized approaches to surgical referrals are an ethical way to reduce wait times in Canada for common procedures like hip and knee replacements, while also helping to improve the quality of care, according to a recent commentary.

Instead of relying heavily on primary care clinicians to refer their patients to surgeons, provinces and territories could develop more single-entry referral systems, wrote David R. Urbach, MD, head of surgery at Women's College Hospital, Toronto, and coauthors. This pooled approach to wait times increases the likelihood that patients receive care from surgeons with the skill and knowledge to manage their needs, while relieving primary care clinicians of a significant burden, they wrote.

“Existing referral markets, in contrast, do not protect patients from being referred to inappropriate providers,” they wrote. “Creation of coordinated surgical groups as the receivers of referrals would reduce the risk of patients being treated by unsuitable surgeons, freeing patients and their referring physicians from the obligation of navigating a complex and often confusing referral marketplace on their own.”

The commentary was published on December 8 in CMAJ.

Waiting times for surgeries have been a persistent concern in Canada despite many efforts to address these delays. The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) reported a 26% increase in the annual number of hip replacement surgeries performed in the nation between 2019 and 2024. Yet 32% of patients in need of hip replacement surgery still waited more than 6 months for the procedure last year, CIHI said.

Urbach has led efforts to expand the use of single-entry referral systems for surgery. In addition to publishing analyses of surgical wait times in journals such as PLoS One and CMAJ, Urbach seeks to convey the benefits of this pool approach in simpler terms. In a 2024 interview with the Canadian Journal of Surgery's Cold Steel podcast, Urbach pointed out that people already are familiar with the premise of single-entry models.

“If you go to most Tim Hortons or banks or whatever, you just join a single line in the beginning, and then at the very end, you just get assigned to the next available person who can provide you a service,” he said.

More public education about the benefits of single-entry referral systems is needed, Urbach told Medscape News Canada. One of the objectives of the CMAJ commentary was to address concerns about the single-entry approach, such as the perceived loss of autonomy for referring physicians and patients.

Few reliable data are available to guide primary care clinicians' choices of surgeons, Urbach said. A single-entry system would better ensure that patients are treated by surgeons who are more skilled in the relevant procedures than does the current approach of individual referrals, said Urbach.

“These variations in quality of care are not a feature of a system. They're a bug of the system. And what our job ought to be, to the extent that you can, is to minimize those variations,” he added.

In the CMAJ commentary, the authors proposed greater engagement of specialist groups in directing surgical referrals. The surgeons thus could decide among themselves who would handle which cases, knowing the strengths and weaknesses of their teams. This approach already is used for people with access to meaningful advice in picking surgeons, Urbach noted.

For example, executives at hospitals tend to turn to surgical department heads like Urbach and ask for opinions when their acquaintances need procedures. The leaders of surgery departments then ask their colleagues for advice.

A single-entry approach would make this kind of concierge service more broadly available to the public and ease worries about loss of autonomy, Urbach said. “You can address a lot of these concerns by just changing the way the specialists are organized. They're not accepting referrals for new consultations independently, but as a group providing the input.”

Interest in single-entry approaches appears to be growing in Canada. Urbach is advising Ontario Health on this issue as part of its Patients Before Paperwork initiative, which includes efforts to expand centralized wait lists for surgical and diagnostic services. One aim is to take “the guesswork out of the referral process” and provide faster access to care for patients.

In 2021, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health published a review of four examples of centralized approaches in different parts of the country: the Winnipeg Central Intake System, the British Columbia Surgical Strategy, the Nova Scotia Hip and Knee Action Plan, and the Saskatchewan Surgical Initiative.

Preserving patient autonomy is necessary for building a successful central intake system, Fiona Clement, PhD, head of community health sciences at the Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, told Medscape News Canada. Clement has not worked directly with Urbach on this issue.

But she and her coauthors did include Urbach's research in their systematic review of published papers on central intake systems for managing surgical waiting times. BMJ Open published their review in September.

“It seems like the issues with implementing central triage or single-entry models are really addressable,” said Clement. “Just build in a valve. If we go through a single-entry model, but someone feels very strongly about this patient or not that surgeon, they could go a different way.”

Urbach reported receiving a project grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research in support of the present manuscript. Clement reported having no relevant financial relationships.

A physician-led medical cannabis clinic established within a geriatric primary care practice supported diverse older adults with complex medical needs over 30 months. This integration helped assess risks, manage drug interactions, and improve communication with other healthcare providers, enhancing safety. The clinic model showed that combining medical cannabis with primary care for seniors is a viable approach.

“The CAHM [Center for Advanced Health Management] MC [medical cannabis] Clinic demonstrates a feasible, scalable model for integrating structured MC care into geriatrics in primary care,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Ryan Weaver of the Department of Pharmacotherapy & Outcomes Science at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Pharmacy in Richmond, Virginia. It was published online on December 5, 2025, in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.

The clinic faced issues such as long wait times and limited availability. The separation between certification and obtaining medical cannabis due to state regulations also posed challenges. Data collection was retrospective and limited to electronic health records, which may have affected the evaluation of patient symptoms and quality of life.

No relevant conflicts of interest were reported by the authors.

In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a response to the first advanced therapy lasting 12 months or more was associated with a reduced risk for hospitalisation due to surgery or rescue treatment; responders experienced a significantly longer time to hospitalisation than non-responders.

""Special attention should be given to the choice of the first advanced treatment, a consideration that raises the issue that the most effective therapy should be used first rather than later in a more rescue fashion,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Kaung Yan, MSc, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, England. It was published online on December 02, 2025, in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.

This study was non-randomised, and treatment selection was influenced by physician judgement. Data on disease activity and severity, newer biologics, and oral small molecules were lacking. Effects of dose adjustments of biologics and concomitant immunomodulators were not assessed.

This work was supported by Janssen Global Services. Several authors reported receiving research support/funding, education grants, and/or speaker or consulting fees and serving as consultants on advisory boards for various pharmaceutical companies.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has turned down a conditional marketing authorization application for Blarcamesine Anavex (blarcamesine, Anavex Germany GmbH), a novel oral medication intended as an add-on treatment for early Alzheimer's disease. In recommending refusal of the authorization, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) said that current evidence from the main study submitted by the manufacturer failed to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of blarcamesine in patients without mutations in the SIGMAR1 gene.

Blarcamesine works by activating the sigma-1 receptor protein encoded by the SIGMAR1 gene, which was intended to restore cellular homeostasis, including via autophagy enhancement. This aimed to improve neuronal function and protect against inflammatory damage, thereby slowing loss of cognitive function. 

The company presented results from a phase 2B/3 placebo-controlled trial involving 462 adults aged 60-85 years with early Alzheimer's disease. It also presented results from a subgroup analysis of participants without a mutation in the SIGMAR1 gene.

Trial results, published in the Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease in January, showed that the drug significantly slowed clinical progression by 36.3% at 48 weeks, with no associated neuroimaging adverse events. However, the CHMP said that the study had failed to meet its main objective, which was to show an improvement in both main measures of effectiveness: a reduction in cognitive decline measured using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13) and an improvement in the ability to perform daily activities measured using the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL).

In addition, it said that the analysis had ""methodological issues"" that ""raised concerns about the validity of the results. "" During the EMA's evaluation, the company had proposed to restrict the indication to adults with mild cognitive impairment due to early Alzheimer's disease, or early-stage mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, in people without a mutation in the SIGMAR1 gene. 

However, given the failure of the main study and the methodological issues, and based on the analysis of the data for the subgroup of patients without SIGMAR1 mutations, it was not possible to reach a positive conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the medicine, the CHMP said. 

In addition, limitations of the safety database and the way safety data were collected did not allow sufficient characterization of blarcamesine's safety profile. A high proportion of patients had stopped treatment during the main study, mainly due to central nervous system side effects, which raised concerns about how well the medicine is tolerated, the committee said. Also, based on the information provided on medicine quality, it was not possible to rule out the formation of potentially cancer-causing nitrosamine impurities.

The company had applied for a conditional marketing authorization. The CHMP acknowledged the unmet medical need for Alzheimer's disease treatments and had taken into consideration the views of patients and healthcare professionals. However, it said that blarcamesine did not meet the criteria for granting conditional marketing authorization and therefore the agency recommended refusal.

The manufacturer has informed the agency that there are no consequences for patients receiving blarcamesine in clinical trials or in compassionate-use programs.

The company may ask for reexamination of the opinion within 15 days of receiving it.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

The European Medicines Agency (EMA)'s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recommended granting marketing authorization for Myqorzo (aficamten, Cytokinetics) for treating adults with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM). 

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common form of genetic cardiovascular disease and the most common cause of sudden death in young people. It is caused by mutations in genes encoding the cardiac sarcomere protein. oHCM happens 

when thickened heart muscle and abnormal motion of the mitral valve block blood flow from the left ventricle.

A recent analysis of six European countries found that 0.027%-0.069% of the population have oHCM, with men generally more affected than women. 

The active substance in Myqorzo is aficamten, a reversible cardiac myosin inhibitor that binds to cardiac myosin's motor domain to prevent it from entering the force-producing state. This reduces cardiac contractility, which in turn lessens left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. 

The CHMP's recommendation comes after results from a phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 282 patients with symptomatic oHCM. They were given either aficamten or placebo daily for 24 weeks. 

After 24 weeks, 68% of patients treated with aficamten exhibited a complete hemodynamic response compared with 7% of those taking the placebo. Those taking aficamten were also more likely to experience improvement in limiting symptoms and enhanced exercise capacity than those taking the placebo. 

Furthermore, 88% of participants treated with aficamten compared with 52% of those taking the placebo were no longer eligible for septal reduction therapy after 24 weeks of treatment. 

The most common side effects from Myqorzo include dizziness, hypertension, palpitations, and systolic dysfunction defined as left ventricular ejection fraction below 50%. 

Myqorzo will be available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg film-coated tablets. Treatment should be initiated by physicians with experience in managing patients with cardiomyopathy. 

Detailed recommendations for use of Myqorzo will be available in the summary of product characteristics, to be published on the EMA's website after marketing authorization is granted by the European Commission.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA)'s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recommended granting a conditional marketing authorization in the EU for Anktiva to treat adults with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) that is at high risk of growing and spreading. 

Anktiva (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept, ImmunityBio) is used in combination with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) when the cancer does not respond to treatment with BCG alone.

Nogapendekin alfa inbakicept is an immunotherapy that binds to interleukin-15 receptor, activating an immune response that targets and destroys cancer cells. 

Anktiva is administered as a solution directly into the bladder — together with BCG — once a week for 6 weeks, and then as maintenance therapy.

EMA's recommendation is based on the results of a single-arm clinical trial in 100 adults with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC who received Anktiva in combination with BCG over 6 weeks. Signs of cancer disappeared in 71% of patients, which lasted on average for about 27 months. 

Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in Europe, affecting more than 200,000 people each year in the EU, with most cases being NMIBC. Moreover, bladder cancer has one of the highest lifetime costs of any cancer because of its high prevalence and costs of diagnostic tools and treatments. The annual financial burden imposed by bladder cancer in the EU is estimated at €4.9 billion. Projections show a significant rise by 2030, driven primarily by smoking and ageing populations. 

Current recommendations for treating patients with high-risk NMIBC consist of surgical removal of the cancer, followed by treatment with BCG. However, in many patients, the cancer does not respond or comes back. There are currently no authorized treatments for NMIBC when it does not respond to BCG, with the main treatment option being surgery to remove the bladder. As such, Anktiva addresses an unmet need.

The most common side effects with Anktiva are dysuria, hematuria, pollakiuria, urinary tract infection, micturition urgency, tiredness, chills, musculoskeletal pain, and fever. 

The CHMP's opinion will now be sent to the European Commission for the adoption of a decision on an EU-wide marketing authorization.

Amid the current resident doctor strikes and broader tension between healthcare professionals and the government, it is worth looking at a frequently cited argument that crops up regularly in online discussions. It goes as follows:The responsibility for the nation's economic failings lies with the government and Chancellor Rachel Reeves, not with doctors. A doctor's duty is to their patients, not to the Treasury.

Although this position has intuitive appeal, it rests on the assumption that, if adopted universally, it would create a society few of us would wish to inhabit. To entirely detach oneself from the political and economic implications of one's actions is to reject the notion of collective responsibility, whether to an institution, such as the NHS, or to the nation more broadly.

A doctor who asserts, “The wider impact is irrelevant; I simply want what I believe I am owed,” is claiming independence and neutrality within a system that depends on mutual interdependence. The NHS is not a private clinic or a profit-driven service. It is financed through taxation and aims to bring about a public good that is universal and equitable. Individual clinicians may not be responsible for designing fiscal policy, but the behaviour of the medical workforce inevitably shapes how those fiscal pressures unfold, and indifference to those pressures undermines the idea of healthcare as a public good.

Healthcare does not occur in isolation. Every decision made by clinicians affects not only patient care but also the operation of the NHS and, in turn, the wider economy. To insist that these connections are someone else's concern is morally shortsighted. If we claim to care about the long-term health of the NHS, we must also acknowledge the importance of the state that sustains it. The two are inseparable.

Some doctors claim economic indifference and state that their duty lies only with individual patients. They may believe they have taken the moral high ground with this approach, but the argument seems to ignore that structural inefficiencies and financial strain harm collective health outcomes on the system and society at a much larger scale. The argument becomes more pertinent when you consider that overburdened and underfunded health systems tend to disproportionately affect disadvantaged and vulnerable groups in society. 

Of course, not all doctors view a publicly funded, free-at-the-point-of-use system as an intrinsic social good. For those individuals, appeals to collective responsibility may resonate differently. But for the many clinicians who continue to see the NHS as both a profession and a public mission, recognising financial constraints is realism. 

Perhaps this raises a more illuminating question: How many UK doctors genuinely believe that it is still possible to reconcile the realities of NHS demand and financial pressures, pay expectations in a society with rising living costs, and the commitments of a publicly funded health system? We urgently need data on how the profession and UK doctors see this trade-off to understand how doctors view the NHS.

Ultimately, the debate extends beyond remuneration. It raises questions about identity and belonging: Do we see ourselves as contributors to a national project? Do we care about the future of the healthcare system our children and grandchildren will inherit? Do we still believe in shared investment in the public realm, or have we concluded that safeguarding the nation's future is someone else's burden? If the latter is true, the loss is not solely political but societal.

Ironically, one can answer yes to these questions and still argue, on principled grounds, that industrial action is justified, whether to preserve a sustainable workforce or for other reasons. What one cannot reasonably claim is that the wider fiscal context is irrelevant.

Some readers may view this argument through the lens that the writer is anti-strike action. 

This is not an argument against industrial action; there are legitimate reasons why doctors may choose to strike. But the position described here, which could be termed “the indifference argument”, is not among them.

This is not the narrative doctors should want to project to the public. We should pride ourselves on the belief that doctors are eager to engage seriously with the ethical, economic, political, and philosophical dimensions of medical practice. That commitment means confronting complexity, even when it is uncomfortable. Indifference to the consequences of our actions should never be the default for UK doctors.

New analysis from a WHO global expert committee on vaccine safety has found that, based on available evidence, no causal link exists between vaccines and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The conclusion reaffirms WHO's position that childhood vaccines do not cause autism.

The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), established in 1999, brings together international experts to provide independent and authoritative scientific advice to WHO on global vaccine safety related priorities.

The latest analysis, discussed by the Committee on 27 November 2025, focused first on the relationship between thiomersal-containing vaccines and ASD, and the association between vaccines in general and ASD. Evidence based on 31 primary research studies, published between January 2010 and August 2025, including data from multiple countries, strongly supports the positive safety profile of vaccines used during childhood and pregnancy, and confirms the absence of a causal link with ASD.

The Committee also assessed the review of potential health risks associated with vaccines with aluminum adjuvants, drawing on studies conducted from 1999 through March 2023. In addition, it reviewed a recent large cohort study analyzing nationwide registry data of children born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018. In summary, the available high-quality evidence shows no association between the trace amounts of aluminum used in some vaccines and ASD, supporting the ongoing use of vaccines with aluminum adjuvants.

Following its review, GACVS reaffirms its previous conclusions from 2002, 2004 and 2012: vaccines, including those with thiomersal and/or aluminum, do not cause autism.

WHO advises all national authorities to rely on the latest science and ensure vaccine policies are grounded in the strongest available evidence. Global childhood immunization efforts represent one of the greatest achievements in improving lives, livelihoods and the prosperity of societies. During the past 50 years, childhood immunization has saved at least 154 million lives.

Julie Rovner KFF Health News  @jrovner  @julierovner.bsky.social

Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent and host of KFF Health News' weekly health policy news podcast, ""What the Health?"" A noted expert on health policy issues, Julie is the author of the critically praised reference book ""Health Care Politics and Policy A to Z,"" now in its third edition.

Congress is running out of time to avert a huge increase in health care premium payments for millions of Americans who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Dec. 15 is the deadline to sign up for coverage that begins Jan. 1, and some consumers are waiting to see whether the credits will be extended, enabling them to afford coverage next year.

Meanwhile, a federal vaccine advisory panel handpicked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. voted last week to end the universal recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine dose at birth. It's just the start of what are expected to be major changes in childhood vaccine recommendations overall.

This week's panelists are Julie Rovner of KFF Health News, Anna Edney of Bloomberg News, Maya Goldman of Axios, and Sheryl Gay Stolberg of The New York Times.

Among the takeaways from this week's episode:

Also this week, Rovner interviews Georgetown University professor Linda Blumberg about what the GOP's health plans have in common.

Plus, for ""extra credit"" the panelists suggest health policy stories they read (or wrote) this week that they think you should read, too: 

Julie Rovner: The Washington Post's ""Rural America Relies on Foreign Doctors. Trump's Visa Fee Shuts Them Out,"" by David Ovalle.

New evidence reveals how everyday processed foods may disrupt gut barriers and amplify inflammation, while targeted dietary strategies offer promising ways to improve outcomes in Crohn's disease.



Conceptual framework linking ultra-processed foods (UPFs) to mechanistic pathways, inflammatory cascade, clinical outcomes, and dietary interventions in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, a group of researchers synthesized evidence linking ultra-processed foods (UPFs) to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk, activity, mechanisms, and therapeutic dietary strategies.

More than half of calories in many nations now come from UPFs, paralleling rising IBD, which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), disorders that disrupt school, work, and family life.

The NOVA classification defines UPFs as industrial formulations rich in refined substrates and additives. Large cohorts link higher UPF intake with CD more than UC. Additives such as emulsifiers, carrageenan (CGN), and maltodextrin (MDX) can impair the intestinal barrier and microbiome, and many rely on packaged meals, hence guidance matters.

Further research is needed to standardize exposure, test mechanisms, and personalize nutrition, while also recognizing that prospective cohorts remain vulnerable to unmeasured confounding and early disease-driven dietary change.

This narrative review was conducted with a structured approach to summarize epidemiological, mechanistic, and therapeutic evidence. Investigators searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus from January 2010 through March 2025 using combinations of terms for UPF, the NOVA, IBD, CD, and UC, and for specific additives such as emulsifiers (such as CMC), CGN, and MDX.

Additional mechanistic evidence on non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS), titanium dioxide (E171), and high salt derived from supplementary targeted searches rather than the core predefined strategy.

Reference lists of key studies and reviews were hand-searched. Human studies were eligible if they defined exposure by NOVA or additive doses and reported incident IBD, disease activity, relapse, or surgery.

Mechanistic models in animals or intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were included when doses approximated dietary exposure, although many experiments still used concentrations higher than typical human intake.

Extraction captured exposure assessments (for example, food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)), outcome measures, and effect estimates including hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR), and relative risk (RR).

Study quality, potential confounding by socioeconomic status (SES), and risks of reverse causation were qualitatively considered. Given heterogeneity across designs, populations, and outcomes, quantitative pooling was not attempted. Instead, evidence was synthesized narratively across three domains: epidemiology, mechanisms, and therapeutic implications, emphasizing recency, biological plausibility, and clinical relevance.

Outcomes were cross-checked for consistency in cohorts, while noting that NOVA classification inconsistency contributes to exposure misclassification.

Across multinational cohorts, higher UPF intake was consistently associated with greater CD risk, with weaker or null findings for UC. In the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology cohort, five or more daily UPF servings were linked to incident IBD versus fewer than one (HR approximately 1.8).

Three large United States cohorts showed a dose-response association with CD, not UC. The NutriNet-Santé cohort reported no significant association, likely limited by few events and short follow-up. In the UK Biobank, the highest UPF intake predicted about a twofold higher CD risk (HR approximately 2.0) and a greater likelihood of IBD-related surgery. 

Among patients, higher UPF intake correlated with active disease (OR approximately 3.8), and a remission cohort had more relapses over one year with the highest intake (HR approximately 3.9). Meta-analyses supported these signals, with a pooled RR of approximately 1.7 for CD and approximately 1.3 for overall IBD. However, the authors emphasize that these associations do not establish causality and require cautious interpretation, particularly because UPF consumption may correlate with broader lifestyle patterns that are difficult to fully adjust for.

Mechanistic data provide plausibility. Emulsifiers such as CMC and P80 thin mucus, promote bacterial encroachment, reduce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and shift the microbiota toward proinflammatory profiles, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), CMC altered the microbiota, lowered fecal SCFAs, and increased abdominal discomfort. CGN activates toll-like receptor (TLR), Bcl10, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in IECs and accelerates relapse in UC in a double-blind RCT. MDX enhances adherence and biofilm formation by adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), impairs antimicrobial defenses, and worsens colitis in interleukin-10, deficient mice. 

NNS can impair human glucose tolerance via microbiome-dependent mechanisms. In models, E171 interacts with mucus and immune pathways; the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) no longer considers E171 safe as a food additive. High-salt diets, common with UPFs, reduce Lactobacillus species, deplete SCFAs, and promote T helper 17 cell (Th17) inflammation.

The review notes that many mechanistic studies use high, continuous exposures that may not reflect typical human diets, and that translating these findings to clinical risk requires careful dose-response evaluation.

Therapeutic evidence converges on reducing UPFs and selected additives. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) remains first-line induction for pediatric CD and likely works partly by removing habitual exposures.

Partial enteral nutrition (PEN) is more acceptable but requires careful food selection. The Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED) plus PEN was non-inferior to EEN for induction and improved maintenance. Minimally processed patterns such as a Mediterranean-style diet or the Specific Carbohydrate Diet improve symptoms for some patients, though adherence and adult data vary.

Additive-focused approaches suggest benefits from CGN avoidance in UC and from low-microparticle diets targeting E171. The review emphasizes that evidence is strongest for pediatric CD, with adult and UC evidence still limited and heterogeneous, and that dietary strategies remain adjunctive rather than stand-alone therapy.

Evidence from cohorts, mechanistic models, and trials indicates that UPF consumption is associated with higher CD risk and may worsen outcomes across IBD, with weaker signals for UC.

Additives, including CMC, P80, CGN, MDX, E171, and high salt, plausibly erode barrier function, shift the microbiome, diminish SCFAs, and activate TLR and NF-κB pathways and Th17 cell responses. Clinically, EEN, the CDED, and minimally processed patterns offer benefit.

Patients and families can prioritize meals while clinicians personalize plans, standardize tools, and support trials, but the authors note that professional guidelines currently prioritize whole-food dietary patterns rather than categorical UPF elimination because causal evidence is still emerging.

New evidence reveals how frequent takeaway meals elevate dietary inflammation and quietly reshape key metabolic risk factors, underscoring why reducing high-frequency takeaway habits could meaningfully improve long-term heart and metabolic health.



Study: Takeaway Food Consumption, Dietary Inflammatory Index, and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in US Adults: Findings From NHANES (2009–2018). Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock

A recent study published in Food Science & Nutrition explores the relationship between dietary inflammation, cardiometabolic risk, and takeaway food intake.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major worldwide killer and cause of disability. Its prevalence has been rising over the last few decades. Deaths from CVD are higher than those from cancer or chronic lower respiratory disease in many parts of the world.

In the US, the burden of CVD deaths and disability has risen steeply over the last decade. Even more important is the demographic shift in cardiometabolic risk factors towards younger people. This stems from the interaction of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Preventive strategies should focus on lifestyle factors, which are modifiable, offering a cost-effective and scalable approach.

Among these factors is the rising global consumption of takeaway food among young and middle-aged adults, in particular. This phenomenon, observed more commonly over the last decade, is explained by the extreme palatability, convenience, intensive marketing, and time or skill constraints operating at the consumer level, which preclude home cooking. Thus, takeaway food shapes the ethos of family, economics, and urban living.

High takeaway food consumption is linked to increasing cardiometabolic risk in younger adults. It drives obesity, hypertension, and high cholesterol levels because of its calorie-rich, nutrient-poor properties, added to the lack of fruit and vegetable content.

Chronic low-level inflammation, reflecting repeated immune activation, is central to CVD pathology. The typical Western diet is rich in fat and drives inflammatory biomarkers upward, in contrast to the Mediterranean diet and similar patterns that are enriched in fish and vegetables.

Dietary inflammation is a chief cause of CVD, driving systemic inflammation and promoting the formation of arteriosclerotic plaques and thrombosis. This led to the development of the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), which quantifies the odds of inflammation related to the intake of specific dietary components.

Interestingly, the CVD deaths and disability burden in the US rose markedly around 2010, the year when apps for food delivery began to dominate the global scene. While this does not mean that these events are causally related, it indicates the need for further investigation.

There is little evidence to support an association between takeaway food and dietary inflammation, however. Such evidence is essential to recommend dietary modifications for young and middle-aged people, promoting lifelong cardiovascular health.

The current study, therefore, examined takeout food consumption as a modifiable eating pattern and provides supporting evidence to inform public health policy. The aim was to assess associations between the frequency of takeout food consumption and overall DII, while adjusting for energy content across diets. It also studied how takeout food consumption correlated with key cardiometabolic risk factors and tested for an intermediary role of DII in this association. The analysis also examined two additional metabolic mediators, the cardiac metabolic index (CMI) and visceral adiposity index (VAI).

Additionally, the scientists explored associations with mortality using the dietary inflammatory index and takeaway food consumption, not ultraprocessed food intake.

The study used data from 8,556 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009–2018, documenting their consumption of takeaway food, the dietary inflammation index, and cardiometabolic risk, and examined associations among them. About 61% of males vs 39% of females had the highest frequency of takeout food consumption.

Those with the highest consumption rates generally had poorer health markers, lower good high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, similar total cholesterol, higher fasting blood sugar levels, and were less likely to be smokers. Conversely, they were more likely to have higher income, greater weight and height, higher insulin levels, and insulin resistance.

Interestingly, the DII was higher with lower takeaway food consumption, and vice versa. However, this reflected unadjusted baseline patterns; in the fully adjusted models, higher intake of takeaway food was associated with a higher energy-adjusted DII. The group with higher takeaway food intake had higher levels of multiple dietary components, especially polyunsaturated and saturated fats, with alcohol, vitamins B6 and E, and some trace elements decreasing.

Weighted logistic or linear regression analyses showed that consuming takeaway food six times a week or more was associated with a higher energy-adjusted dietary inflammation index (DII) than once a week or less. There was a significant increase (β = 0.226). The increase was especially marked in those aged 60–80 years.

Prior research has indicated an 8% increase in CVD and mortality for a one-point increase in the DII.

A higher takeaway food consumption was linked to adverse cardiometabolic risk. HDL levels were lower, while triglycerides went up. Fasting glucose, serum insulin, and insulin resistance all showed an upward trend. The increase was more marked in females, suggesting that female metabolism responds more powerfully to takeaway food.

Despite a positive trend, mortality rates did not increase significantly with higher takeaway food consumption. Conversely, higher DII was associated with higher all-cause mortality, with a positive trend for death from heart disease. The effect was modest, however.

The study indicates the potential long-term adverse effects of takeaway food consumption. This is a cross-sectional observational study, hence causality remains to be established by future work. This should include longitudinal dietary recall and carefully reviewed vascular outcomes as well.

Measures to counter this growing risk could include:

More frequent takeaway food consumption is linked to higher energy-adjusted dietary inflammation and adverse cardiometabolic risk. “Reducing high-frequency TFC and lowering dietary inflammatory potential may improve cardiometabolic health at a population level.”

In this interview, industry expert Dr. Raj Singh discusses the PathoVerse, a pioneering global digital ecosystem designed to transform pathology through connectivity, AI integration, and collaborative innovation across research and clinical practice. 

As a practicing pathologist, I saw how fragmented our field had become. Different vendors, systems, and formats made true collaboration almost impossible. With PathPresenter, our goal was to simplify one of the biggest challenges in pathology: managing images at scale. We built a platform that pathologists could use daily without worrying about interoperability.

Over time, as our community grew to more than 70,000 users across 180 countries, we realized we had the foundation to create something even larger: a vendor-agnostic global ecosystem where clinicians, researchers, and technology partners could unite. That vision became the PathoVerse.

We built three interconnected modules. The first is the clinical and consultation platform, which supports enterprise-level case management and includes an FDA-approved viewer that handles all image types – pathology, radiology, cytology, and gross images.

The second is the education platform, which powers digital classrooms in more than 30 institutions. The third is the biobanking and research platform, which enables HIPAA-compliant data sharing with researchers, pharma, and AI developers.

Together, these modules cover everything a pathologist does on a day-to-day basis.

Our biggest differentiators are deep domain knowledge and absolute interoperability. PathPresenter is compatible with any scanner, LIS, AI module, or storage architecture. Because it was created by practicing pathologists, it reflects real-world workflows and needs.

It is not a static product but a living, evolving platform shaped by constant feedback from thousands of users worldwide. It is used in over 60 institutions, including major names like MSKCC, Cincinnati Children's, and Dr. Lal PathLabs.

AI is valuable only when it is connected to the wider ecosystem. A standalone model has little impact. We integrate AI directly into PathPresenter, allowing it to be used by pathologists, oncologists, researchers, and even patients to interpret results. By embedding validated AI tools into a secure, scalable infrastructure, we ensure that breakthroughs from leading AI companies reach real-world clinical practice.

The PathoVerse is a collaborative digital ecosystem that connects pathology data, technology, AI, and human expertise to enable real-world innovation. Pathology is evolving rapidly with advances in 3D imaging, virtual staining, digital twins, and AI diagnostics, yet many of these tools exist in isolation.

The PathoVerse bridges these silos, offering a unified infrastructure where technologies, datasets, and workflows can come together seamlessly, enabling shared progress across research, diagnostics, and education. It is all about turning silos into integrated systems.

ConsultConnect is the fastest and easiest way for organizations to implement digital pathology, as it removes the logistical bottlenecks that make consultations slow and expensive. When we talk about consultations, there is often friction at every step. Cases may come from sister hospitals or external labs, yet most systems still cannot communicate with each other. In some places, even departments within the same hospital remain disconnected.

Traditionally, a consultation can take between five and 14 days, but the problem has never been a lack of expertise; pathologists are more than ready to provide their insights. The real barrier has always been logistics. It is almost unbelievable that in an age where we can stream data from Mars, we still ship glass slides in boxes. Slides can break or get lost, and patient information is often re-entered manually, adding even more delays.

ConsultConnect removes all these barriers. Through AWS, we can set up secure web portals for institutions in a matter of days. Hospitals can upload digital slides and case data, and our HL7 middleware transfers the information directly into the recipient's LIS or dashboard. The pathologist reviews the case, adds any stains or notes, and sends the report back through the same portal.

With partners like Grundium, we also provide pathways to easier scanner accessibility at referring sites. Institutions using ConsultConnect pay only per consultation once the service starts. This approach enables hospitals to launch a digital consultation network rapidly, demonstrate revenue potential, and prove that digital pathology can serve as a growth engine rather than an expense.

For patients, ConsultConnect means faster access to expert opinions and better continuity of care. It transforms a once slow and fragmented process into a connected, efficient workflow that embodies the true purpose of the PathoVerse: collaboration without barriers.

For institutions, the PathoVerse creates new revenue streams, enables global consultation networks, and simplifies the deployment of digital pathology. For patients, it provides faster, more accurate access to specialized diagnostics regardless of location. Ultimately, it accelerates how ideas move from concept to real-world clinical solutions.

Digital pathology should no longer be seen as a cost. When implemented strategically, it becomes a growth engine. Departments can offer consults or even AI analysis as a service, generating revenue while improving diagnostic efficiency. Institutions that adopt this model are already seeing measurable operational and financial benefits.

We are just at the beginning. Our goal is to connect hospitals, researchers, and technology companies across every region of the world. The PathoVerse will continue expanding throughout the Middle East, Asia, and South America, building a federated network that supports seamless access, consultation, and data sharing. By working together, we can truly transform how pathology contributes to precision medicine and global healthcare.

The PathoVerse is evolving into a global collaboration engine for pathology. Institutions are moving beyond the question of why to go digital and are now asking how to expand it across diagnosis, education, and AI research. Future growth will include AI-as-a-service offerings, broader consult networks, and deeper integration with partners such as AWS, Grundium, Imagenomix, and MSKCC.

Our mission remains clear: to connect every pathologist, laboratory, and data system worldwide, making pathology a connected, insight-driven cornerstone of precision medicine.

Cell line creation is a major success factor in biologics manufacturing. It establishes the basis for product yield, quality, and long-term process stability. However, despite significant breakthroughs in host engineering, vector systems, and culture conditions, early-stage clone selection is still one of the least analytically supported stages of development.1

Therapeutic proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, enzymes, and fusion proteins, are becoming increasingly essential components of current treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and genetic disorders.

Each of these modalities requires a well-characterized and scalable manufacturing cell line. This makes cell line development a technical requirement and strategic imperative for biopharmaceutical companies.

Do your kids play a lot of computer games? Some may end up gaming a little too obsessively. Researchers have identified the most important warning signs.

Is there a lot of playing Fortnite, Roblox and Minecraft in your home too? You're not alone. Many children and adolescents play a lot, and often with both known and unknown online players. This can be a great way to socialize with friends and acquaintances. But it can get completely out of hand for some.

When gaming over a long period of time affects the young person's ability to relate to the outside world, it may be due to computer game addiction, or 'Internet gaming disorder'."" 

 Lars Wichstrøm, professor at NTNU's Department of Psychology

An international research group investigated how symptoms of computer game addiction develop, and how stable these symptoms are from childhood to late adolescence. Some of the numbers can be troubling.

Two factors were repeated across age and gender among those who were diagnosed with IGD: Strong involvement (a lot of gaming) and negative consequences (harmful consequences).

""Around one in ten boys met the diagnostic criteria for computer game addiction called 'Internet gaming disorder (IGD)' at least once between the ages of 10 and 18,"" says Wichstrøm.

Boys are most easily hooked on gaming. Just 1 to 2 per cent of girls develop this kind of problem. An average incidence overall of between 5 and 6 per cent thus hides large gender differences.

Boys are simply more competitive, Wichstrøm says.

""We don't really know why more boys become addicted, but boys have always been more interested in gaming than girls, whether it's computer games, Ludo or chess,"" he said.

When boys and men do things together, it is often centred around an activity, such as football, carpentry or playing. Girls don't need this type of structure as much.

The fact that boys are simply gaming much more than girls also makes them more vulnerable to becoming addicted.

""The brain releases dopamine in the its reward center when we do activities we enjoy, like gaming. This release increases when we expect a positive experience and when the expectation is actually met,"" says Beate W. Hygen, a senior researcher at NTNU Social Research AS.

Hygen has extensive experience in studying the conditions surrounding computer games.

""Research has shown that dopamine is released during gaming, mostly when you are doing well and especially in competition with others. Boys play competitive games more often, which can result in more frequent dopamine releases. Perhaps this is also part of the explanation for why boys are more often hooked on gaming,"" says Hygen.

The research group has obtained the figures from a group of young people in Trondheim. The Trondheim Early Secure Study is a long-term birth cohort study. Eight hundred and twelve participants from the 2003/2004 cohorts were followed up five times from 10 to 18 years of age, with participants roughly equal divided between genders.

The measurements were largely comparable across ages.

""We see that the proportion who are heavily involved in gaming increases from the age of 10 to the age of 16. But then this clearly falls when they are 18 years old,"" says Wichstrøm.

Despite the fact that gaming decreased for the 18-year-olds, the negative consequences remained stable. This may indicate that many people are quitting or reducing their gaming. But a smaller group continues to game, with negative consequences for some.

Parents who wonder if their child can become addicted to computer games are wise to address this early.

Researchers from NTNU Social Research AS, Nottingham Trent University and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology were also involved in the research.

A new article published in the Journal of Dental Research explores the development an integrated data-cleaning and subtype discovery pipeline using unsupervised machine learning for comprehensive analysis and visualization of data patterns in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database.

Authored by Alena Orlenko, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA, et al., ""Uncovering Dental Caries Heterogeneity in NHANES Using Machine Learning"" addresses the limitations of the NHANES, one of the largest curated repositories of nationally representative population-level health-related indicators, by establishing a data-cleaning pipeline with a novel outlier detection algorithm and unsupervised machine learning to identify phenotype subtypes within NHANES dental caries data.

By bringing the power of machine learning to a large national data set, the authors identify key clusters of factors linked to caries in children or seniors. The next challenge is to build on this information and find more effective methods to prevent caries in different groups of people.""

Nick Jakubovics, Editor-in-Chief of Journal of Dental Research

The study demonstrates a robust data-cleaning–subtype discovery pipeline that could be applied to investigate other health conditions using NHANES and similar databases for machine learning predictive modeling. Applying a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline to NHANES data successfully identified substantial age-driven heterogeneity in dental caries, suggesting stratification is crucial for future predictive modeling. 

This integrative approach systematically addresses data quality issues and facilitates exploratory analysis to reveal data patterns associated with subtypes and variables associated with the clinical heterogeneity of caries. It uncovered novel associations between caries status, lead/pollutant exposure, specific laboratory markers and food types, as well as sleep patterns, reflecting additional disease markers in susceptible populations. This demonstrates the value of integrating data science techniques with large-scale observational data to gain deeper insights into complex, multifactorial diseases.

A new randomized trial reveals how simple food choices before and after fasted HIIT can shift the body's oxidative stress and recovery patterns, offering practical guidance for tailoring nutrient timing to support training goals.



Study: Acute Impact of Polyphenol-Rich vs. Carbohydrate-Rich Foods and Beverages on Exercise-Induced ROS and FRAP in Healthy Sedentary Female Adults - A Randomized Controlled Trial. Image Credit: Improvisor / Shutterstock

University of Vienna researchers recently conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of polyphenol-rich foods and carbohydrate-rich foods in mitigating oxidative stress during exercise. The findings, published in the journal Antioxidants, highlighted the benefits of carbohydrates during exercise and of polyphenols during recovery under fasted, high-intensity conditions, and in a sedentary female population.

Exercise-induced oxidative stress is a well-established condition in sports. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during exercise have both beneficial and detrimental effects, depending on their concentration and timing.

Excessive ROS production is associated with impaired muscle contraction, poor recovery, and muscle soreness. Chronic exposure to ROS increases the risk of various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and age-related pathologies.

Physiological levels of ROS, on the other hand, play vital roles in strengthening muscle and improving antioxidant defense mechanisms. This dual role of ROS highlights the existence of an optimal physiological state in which moderate levels of oxidative stress and inflammation optimize exercise performance and recovery.

Diet plays an essential role in modulating exercise-induced oxidative stress. Carbohydrates may attenuate oxidative stress by reducing physiological stress and inflammatory responses rather than directly scavenging ROS in vivo, although glucose and sucrose have shown radical-scavenging properties in vitro.

Polyphenols, a diverse group of plant-derived compounds, have gained significant attention in medical science due to their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Polyphenol-enriched whole foods have shown significantly greater physiological relevance in mitigating oxidative stress than conventional high-dose vitamin supplements, as vitamins at higher concentrations have been found to suppress the body's internal antioxidant defense system.

To provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of dietary interventions on exercise-induced oxidative stress, researchers at the University of Vienna designed a randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of carbohydrate- and polyphenol-rich foods in mitigating oxidative stress during resistance-circuit high-intensity interval training.

This randomized controlled trial initially randomized 45 women, of whom 30 completed the full protocol, comprising healthy, sedentary females aged 19 to 33 years. Four types of foods were analyzed in the study, including two polyphenol-rich foods (pomegranate juice and blueberries) and two carbohydrate-rich foods (whole-grain bread and bread roll).

The participants were randomly assigned to two study arms: one included blueberries, whole-grain bread, and bread rolls, and the other included pomegranate juice. Within each study arm, participants randomly consumed each of the included foods after a 12-hour fast, with a washout period of at least seven days between intervention days. In both study arms, water intake served as a control condition.

On each intervention day, participants performed the resistance training, and blood samples were collected at baseline, immediately before training, immediately after training, and 15 minutes after training. The samples were analyzed to measure ROS (electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy) and total antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing ability of plasma assay, FRAP).

The analysis of control group participants (water intake) revealed a clear induction in ROS levels and total antioxidant capacity following the training session. However, the magnitude of these changes was modest and subject to inter-individual variability, indicating a considerable physiological stress response.

The analysis of intervention group participants revealed that intake of carbohydrate-rich foods significantly attenuated the training-induced elevation in total antioxidant capacity and showed a non-significant trend toward attenuating the training-induced elevation in ROS levels, compared with intake of polyphenol-rich foods or water. These observations highlight a protective role of carbohydrates against oxidative stress, primarily through effects on FRAP rather than consistent significant effects on ROS.

Regarding the intake of polyphenol-rich foods, the study found significant efficacy in enhancing recovery after training. Compared with carbohydrate intake, polyphenol intake significantly reduced ROS levels during the post-exercise recovery period, although no significant differences relative to water were observed.

Regarding total antioxidant capacity, a continuous increase was observed during the recovery period, reflecting the impact of high-intensity training sessions, with no significant differences between the intervention foods during recovery and with changes reflecting redox-system kinetics rather than enhanced antioxidant capacity.

The study highlights the protective efficacy of carbohydrates against exercise-induced oxidative stress and the efficacy of polyphenols in accelerating post-exercise normalization of ROS levels.

The observed benefit of polyphenol intake is particularly significant, as chronic exposure to oxidative stress is associated with impaired recovery, reduced muscle function, and increased risk of tissue damage.

The observed benefit of carbohydrate intake may reflect the fact that sufficient carbohydrate availability reduces exercise-induced oxidative stress by lowering reliance on fat oxidation and minimizing mitochondrial ROS production.

These effects are particularly relevant during endurance exercise, where carbohydrates mitigate cumulative oxidative stress responses from repeated sessions and sustain performance. However, over-suppression of ROS production may impair training adaptations such as muscle strengthening, highlighting the importance of dosage in carbohydrate strategies.

Overall, this study provides valuable information for both athletes and coaches to optimize their performance and training adaptations through nutrition, although the findings should be interpreted cautiously, given that the study population consisted of sedentary young women, the intervention assessed acute, single-session effects, and the fasted-state high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocol does not fully reflect typical training environments.

Given the findings, researchers suggest integrating polyphenol-rich foods in meals consumed before and after training sessions. Regarding carbohydrate-rich foods, they emphasize personalized approaches based on training intensity, duration, and energy demands, while acknowledging that performance impacts were not directly measured in this trial.

The University of Manchester's Centre of Excellence in Biopharmaceuticals (COEBP) has developed a biopharmaceutical manufacturing platform that allows rapid isolation of high-producing CHO cell populations.

The researchers needed to evaluate the antibody titer in hundreds of study samples. Due to the substantial manual processing necessary for ELISA, cell cultures were frozen to regulate throughput. Data was obtained retrospectively, delaying decisions and resulting in lengthy, unproductive periods.

The lab introduced antibody titer measurement using the Amperia™ system, streamlining measurement from crude samples and enabling same-day results.

Freezing and thawing cell cultures can delay reintroduction into productive workflows. Reducing the need for sample freezing helped limit extended periods of unproductive time.

Amperia™ reduces the need to batch and store samples prior to analysis, helping avoid delays of up to three weeks.

A single-dose oral medication called zoliflodacin shows promise as a new treatment for antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea, according to a phase 3 clinical trial published in The Lancet. The study found that one dose of zoliflodacin was as effective as the current standard treatment, which combines two antibiotics: an injection of ceftriaxone followed by an oral dose of azithromycin.Gonorrhoea is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections, affecting over 82 million people globally each year. However, it is increasingly difficult to treat as the bacteria that cause infection develop resistance to current antibiotics. This new medication has the potential to help slow the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and make gonorrhoea treatment more accessible worldwide.The international trial involved more than 900 people from five countries (USA, South Africa, Thailand, Belgium, and the Netherlands). Participants received either the new pill or the standard treatment. Results showed that zoliflodacin cured over 90% of infections at genital sites. The medication was well tolerated, with side effects similar to those seen with current treatments, and no serious safety issues were reported.Zoliflodacin is currently awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If approved, the authors say it could greatly improve global efforts to control drug-resistant gonorrhea infections, support community-led care, and protect reproductive health for millions of people.

Using menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in women with inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, according to the results of a matched prospective analysis presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), held December 9-12, 2025.

Women who inherit a pathogenic mutation in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are advised to follow the recommended guidance to have their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed (a procedure known as bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) at relatively early ages to safeguard against their elevated risk of ovarian and/or fallopian tube cancer, said study presenter Joanne Kotsopoulos, PhD, a scientist at the Women's College Hospital Research and Innovation Institute and a professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto in Canada.

Removing the ovaries can induce early menopause. Although MHT can treat the symptoms of menopause, many patients might not want to take MHT if they perceive MHT to be unsafe and instead suffer unnecessarily with the symptoms, Kotsopoulos explained. ""We cannot simply recommend a drastic surgery like oophorectomy for young women without offering a way for them to manage the well-established short- and long-term outcomes of surgical menopause,"" she said. ""I believe we should educate patients and their health care providers on how we can safely balance the risks and benefits of MHT use to ensure longevity and improve quality of life. 

Unfortunately, there has been a lot of reluctance and misinformation regarding MHT, which is mostly attributable to findings from studies conducted in the general population (those without BRCA mutations) showing an association between MHT use and an increased risk of breast cancer. To help manage the side effects of oophorectomy safely in women with BRCA mutations, we need data from well-designed observational studies of MHT use in this specific population who, due to their genetics, face elevated risks of breast cancer.""

Joanne Kotsopoulos, PhD, scientist at the Women's College Hospital Research and Innovation Institute and professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto

Kotsopoulos and colleagues conducted a matched prospective analysis-a type of observational study-in which they tried to recreate the conditions of a clinical trial by analyzing data from women with menopause (mostly induced by surgery) and whether they used MHT. Patients with a history of cancer, patients who had received a bilateral mastectomy, and non-menopausal patients were excluded.

The researchers created 676 matched pairs of women who did and did not use MHT after menopause, with pair-matching based on whether they carried BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, birth year, and age at menopause. Participants ranged in age from 22 to 76, with an average age of 43.8.

Participants who used MHT took one of several different formulations: estrogen alone, progesterone alone, estrogen and progesterone, tibolone, or conjugated estrogen and bazedoxifene.

After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years-which used the date of first MHT use in the MHT-exposed group as the starting point-the researchers found that incident breast cancer cases were significantly less in the women who used MHT, with 87 cases in the MHT-exposed group versus 128 cases in the MHT-naïve group.

When the investigators analyzed the data by which MHT formulation was used, most of the different MHTs were not associated with the risk of breast cancer (neither an increase nor a decrease in risk). However, two formulations were associated with decreased risk of breast cancer. Women who received estrogen-only MHT were 63% less likely to develop breast cancer than their MHT-naïve counterparts. And of the 43 women who received conjugated estrogen and bazedoxifene, none of them developed subsequent breast cancer. ""Although based on smaller numbers, this is definitely an exciting and interesting area for future research,"" Kotsopoulos said. ""Hypothetically, conjugated estrogen and bazedoxifene could be used to mitigate breast cancer risk by avoiding progesterone, which is thought to be the breast cancer risk-associated component of MHT. Future trials will be necessary to test this hypothesis.""

There were no significant differences in the results whether patients carried a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant, an indication that underscores MHT's safety for carriers of BRCA mutations, according to Kotsopoulos.

""Our findings suggest that clinicians should take a personalized approach to menopause management for women with BRCA mutations who are suffering from the impact of surgical (or natural) menopause, if there are no contraindications for them,"" said Kotsopoulos.

Limitations of the study were noted and included a follow-up time of 5.6 years and small patient numbers in certain subgroups, such as the number of women enrolled carrying a BRCA2 mutation.

The study was funded by Breast Cancer Canada and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","U.S. cities unwilling to sign FIFA's Women's World Cup hosting terms without negotiation","https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/12/12/us-cities-unwilling-to-sign-fifas-womens-world-cup-hosting-terms-without-negotiation/","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 15:55:10 GMT","

More than two dozen American cities are eager to host matches as part of U.S. Soccer's joint bid with Mexico, Jamaica and Costa Rica for the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup. Those cities, however, declined to sign long-form agreements that FIFA expected ahead of last month's bid deadline.

Leaders of the cities included in the joint bid are seeking the opportunity to negotiate more favorable terms with FIFA before agreeing to anything binding. So far, they have only been willing to sign non-binding, one-page memorandums of understanding provided by U.S. Soccer.

These fall well short of the commitments required to make the bid compliant with FIFA's rules, which state that host city and stadium agreement templates must be submitted “signed and in unaltered form.”

FIFA plans to formally award hosting rights to the four Concacaf member nations at its annual congress on April 30, 2026, in Vancouver. Whether it will do so without more concrete commitments from American host cities remains to be seen.

The financial incentive for FIFA to move ahead with the four-nation bid, which would see most matches held in the U.S., is obvious. Just as the 2026 Men's World Cup in the U.S., Mexico and Canada is expected to shatter revenue records, a Women's World Cup staged largely in the U.S. projects to be the most lucrative women's sporting event ever. U.S. Soccer's bid forecasts the competition generating more than $4 billion in revenue, about seven times the previous record generated by the 2023 edition in Australia and New Zealand, and four times the target for the 2027 tournament in Brazil.

The cities' hesitation to put pen to paper traces back to the experience of the 11 U.S. municipalities preparing to host matches in the 2026 World Cup. Under the agreements they signed in 2017, those cities have taken on most of the costs of hosting matches and FIFA fan fests — a burden local leaders have pegged at $100 million to $200 million per city — while having limited ability to generate offsetting revenue.

FIFA introduced a local sponsorship program meant to be a core fundraising mechanism for cities, but many have found the available assets too limited to appeal to brands. Each city is allowed to sell up to 10 supporter packages (apart from New York/New Jersey, which can sell 20), but the 16 host cities across the U.S., Mexico and Canada have thus far combined to announce only 35 supporters, or 2.2 per city, with six months remaining before the tournament.

FIFA has softened some of its most onerous demands on 2026 host cities, eliminating a requirement that cities provide free public transportation to matches and offering them more flexibility to determine the scope of their fan fests. Still, the prevailing sentiment remains that the terms for 2026 have been too demanding, given that FIFA is the primary financial beneficiary of the event.

“There's had to be this growth and evolution between when the [2026] bid was first sent out to all of us and where we are today,” Zaileen Janmohamed, president and CEO of the Bay Area Host Committee, said at a public event in June. “There has been some progress in that, and I think that progress will continue for the Women's World Cup. I think this will be an evolving model that both sides will just have to continue to iterate on until we try to find something that really sticks and is tight.”

Several representatives for prospective host cities spoke with Sports Business Journal on the condition of anonymity to ensure FIFA doesn't hold their participation against their market in the selection process. They all stressed that they want to host the competition, but need certainty the terms will be more favorable than in 2026.

U.S. Soccer issued a statement, saying in part, “We look forward to continued collaboration with local partners and FIFA as we prepare to deliver a tournament of unprecedented success and drive the women's game forward.”

FIFA declined to comment on its discussions with the cities and the national federation. 

In December 2023, U.S. Soccer and the Mexican Football Federation delivered a joint bid to host the 2027 Women's World Cup. Prior to submission, U.S. Soccer told host cities for the 2026 Men's World Cup that it planned to inform FIFA that the U.S. “will only want to host the Women's World Cup if host city partners are set up for success.” The federations withdrew that bid in April 2024, and FIFA ultimately awarded the 2027 event to Brazil.

In April 2025, U.S. Soccer formally confirmed its interest in teaming with other Concacaf member nations to bid for the 2031 Women's World Cup. The U.S. and its then-unidentified co-bidders were the only countries announced by FIFA as having expressed interest in 2031, but the participating federations would still have to go through a formal bid process. 

U.S. Soccer subsequently began soliciting interest in May from U.S. cities about inclusion in the bid. At an information session for leaders from interested cities in July, U.S. Soccer assured the cities that FIFA's terms would be more practical and take their concerns into account, but the national federation could not yet provide details. 

It wasn't until early November — weeks before the bid submission deadline — that the cities got their first look at FIFA's proposed terms. Multiple sources said the main host city agreement was virtually identical to the contract for the 2026 World Cup, not even reflecting concessions FIFA made in the lead-up to next summer's competition.

FIFA did, however, include a series of “side letters” promising to negotiate later on a handful of issues. With the cities themselves, those included public transit and fan fest requirements. With stadium owners, FIFA would be willing to discuss the financial model for stadium use and whether the venues could keep naming rights in effect during the competition.

Even with those assurances, though, host city leaders were uncomfortable signing the underlying agreement. For starters, the cities are seeking to negotiate new terms on a much wider range of issues than were carved out in the side letters, including potential revenue sharing. FIFA also didn't provide any timeline for the deferred issues to be resolved, prompting concern that the governing body could keep the cities in limbo for years.

Furthermore, several city leaders felt it was unreasonable to be given mere weeks to commit to terms for an event more than five years away, particularly with some in the throes of preparation for the 2026 men's event.

“Some of these things have to go in front of city councils and get approvals, and that just doesn't happen overnight,” one host city leader said.

Multiple sources said leaders from nearly all of the prospective U.S. host cities signed a draft letter to FIFA informing the governing body of their decision to decline to sign the agreements and requesting broader negotiations. U.S. Soccer asked the cities not to send the letter, however, and instead sign one-page MOUs that could accompany the bid. The cities agreed and are now awaiting guidance from either FIFA or U.S. Soccer on next steps.

One of the main questions host cities have is what role U.S. Soccer will have in negotiations with FIFA about the terms for the 2031 Women's World Cup and the organization of the competition. U.S. Soccer has largely been marginalized in the lead-up to the 2026 World Cup, and each of the 16 host cities has had to deal directly with FIFA on hosting issues.

Despite U.S. Soccer's previous insistence that it only wants to host the event if it benefits host cities, several host city leaders said they are unsure whether U.S. Soccer will advocate for them in negotiations with FIFA or prioritize getting FIFA what it needs to secure the bid.

A source with knowledge of U.S. Soccer's thinking said the organization is aiming to get firmer commitments than the MOUs from host cities ahead of the FIFA Congress in April, but there is an understanding that some key issues won't be resolved until after the 2026 World Cup. Those issues could be agreed upon during FIFA's 2031 host city selection process, which would likely take place in 2027. In that case, cities that are most amenable to FIFA's terms would likely have a leg up in the selection process.

If there's one thing FIFA, U.S. Soccer and the host cities can agree on, it is a shared desire for the U.S. to play a major role in hosting the Women's World Cup. There's a widely held sentiment that the issues at stake are reconcilable. How the parties navigate them will shape both the bid and the next era of major event hosting in the U.S.","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

The forward's blocked contract and a growing talent drain to Europe have nudged the NWSL into crisis mode. Here's what's happening and why it matters

The Trinity Rodman contract saga has exposed a fundamental tension at the heart of the National Women's Soccer League: a salary-cap model built for stability and measured growth coming in collision with a global market that has accelerated far beyond it.

Rodman is one of the most important young players in US soccer, arguably its most marketable female star and a centerpiece of the NWSL's future. Yet European giants have offered her salaries that America's top women's domestic league cannot legally match, prompting the NWSL to veto a record-breaking Washington Spirit deal (and the players' union to file a grievance in response).

At the same time, a wave of top talent has already crossed east across the Atlantic, raising questions about whether the NWSL can still compete. Here's what's happening and why it matters …

Because she is exactly the kind of star the NWSL cannot afford to lose. At 23, Rodman is one of the most explosive young players in the world: already a USWNT cornerstone (and one-third of the Triple Espresso front line), an Olympic champion, a marketing draw and a foundational star for the Spirit. Her contract expires at the end of December and European clubs have offered her salaries far beyond what any NWSL team can pay under the league's salary cap.

The Spirit attempted a record deal averaging over $1m per year only for the NWSL to block it, saying it violated league rules. The NWSL Players Association (NWSLPA) has now filed a grievance accusing the league of breaching the collective bargaining agreement and effectively imposing an unnegotiated maximum salary.

Rodman's future is a litmus test: if the NWSL cannot retain a player of her caliber, executives fear the league may be structurally incapable of keeping or attracting world-class talent.

Yes, and it already has. Salary growth in Europe's major leagues has surged and transfers for top players have accelerated. Alyssa Thompson's shock move from Angel City FC to Chelsea underscored how vulnerable the NWSL has become. Several other players have departed in recent windows, including national team members Naomi Girma, Crystal Dunn and Emily Fox, often for salaries that the NWSL's cap cannot approach. Clubs say they cannot compete financially: even players willing to take pay cuts discover the NWSL cap requires reductions so steep that the move becomes unfeasible.

European teams routinely offer seven-figure salaries. NWSL teams operate under a 2025 cap of $3.5m total. It doesn't take a CPA to suss out what's behind the migration.

Many general managers privately told ESPN they fear the league will be unable to retain top players – or recruit global stars – unless the NWSL modernizes its pay structures. The Rodman standoff has simply made a long-simmering problem impossible to ignore.

Because this is happening at a moment when the USWNT's long-standing global dominance is under real threat. For decades the US had advantages that Europe lacked: youth infrastructure, college pathways through scholarships, professionalism and visibility. But that gap has closed rapidly.

European clubs like Barcelona, Chelsea, Lyon, Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain now operate with world-class facilities, elite coaches, sophisticated analytics programs and, critically, rising wages. The transfer market and Champions League have turned Europe into the epicenter of the women's game. Several European national teams have equaled or surpassed the USWNT tactically and technically, as seen at the 2023 World Cup.

If the NWSL cannot keep its brightest stars – including generational talents like Rodman – the center of gravity in the women's game will continue shifting toward Europe.

The NWSL's Board of Governors has reportedly approved a new roster mechanism on Thursday that would allow teams to pay salaries beyond the cap, effectively an NWSL version of Major League Soccer's designated player rule. According to an ESPN report, it has been dubbed the High Impact Player program.

The rule will let teams spend up to $1m in additional funds on eligible players while only incurring a portion of that salary as a cap hit. To qualify as a High Impact Player, individuals must meet a mix of sporting or commercial metrics, such as recent USWNT minutes, Ballon d'Or recognition, NWSL Best XI honors or broader marketability benchmarks.

The proposal, now approved by the board, would:

give each club a set pool of supplemental money beyond the salary cap

restrict that pool to players who meet elite criteria

allow teams to split funds among one or multiple stars

introduce a minimum threshold so the mechanism is used only for top talent

maintain parity by preventing unlimited spending

In the short term, the rule gives the Spirit a means to keep Rodman, though they must still agree to terms with her. The mechanism also requires formal consultation with the NWSLPA under the CBA.

The new system would effectively replace “allocation money”, previously used to top up salaries, which the NWSL is phasing out.

Rodman and the Spirit agreed to a backloaded four-year deal with escalators taking her average pay above $1m, far beyond what the current cap structure can absorb. The league rejected the deal, arguing it violated the collective bargaining agreement and posed “structural risk” to a system that depends on tight cost controls. Commissioner Jessica Berman has repeatedly said the league is “not a charity”.

The NWSLPA counters that nothing in the CBA creates a maximum salary, and by blocking the deal the league effectively imposed one without negotiation.

The grievance process is underway:

the league has 14 days to respond in writing

if unresolved, a grievance committee of league and union reps reviews it

if still unresolved, it moves to arbitration

The outcome could reshape how salaries are handled across the league.

Because European wages have exploded. Clubs such as Chelsea, Barcelona and Lyon can offer salaries exceeding $1m a year – and they do so without the constraints of a hard cap. They benefit from Champions League revenue, massive global brands and fanbases, and ownership groups willing to invest heavily in the women's game.

By contrast, even in 2029 – the final year of Rodman's proposed deal – the NWSL base cap will still be under $5m. Without supplemental mechanisms, signing even a single million-dollar player destabilizes an entire roster.

Simply, Europe's financial model has shifted the global market. The NWSL's current model has not kept pace.

Symbolically enormous and strategically dangerous.

Rodman is a face of the league, a marketing anchor and one of the few players capable of bringing non-hardcore sports fans into the tent. Losing her at 23, at a moment when European salaries are surging and club environments are improving rapidly, would feed the narrative that NWSL is no longer the top destination for elite players.

Executives fear a pattern: young standouts go abroad for money and Champions League football, while top internationals stay away because the league can't afford them.

As ESPN's Jeff Kassouf wrote: “Attracting casual fans is the only way for the NWSL to truly grow at scale, and while gimmicks like creating artificial fan sections from a new league sponsor are obligatory attempts at commercial growth, they mean nothing without the players that keep fans watching. Rodman is the type of player – not the only one, no, but she's right at the front of the line – that people pay to come watch. She is the type of player who creates fans.”

Both leagues face pressure to retain stars, but they are at very different moments. WNBA players are pushing for higher pay and improved conditions, yet they are negotiating from a position strength, with unprecedented fan interest, rising valuations and CBA leverage. The WNBA is expanding, financially and competitively.

The NWSL, by contrast, is improvising solutions from a position of vulnerability. Its stars are being priced out, its cap is rigid and its competitive environment cannot match Europe's. While WNBA players fight for a bigger slice of a growing pie, NWSL clubs are trying to prevent the pie from disappearing overseas.

A few things:

The Board of Governors consults with the NWSLPA on Thursday's vote

The NWSL has until mid-December to respond in writing to the NWSLPA grievance

If unresolved, the issue moves to a grievance committee and potentially arbitration

Rodman can officially negotiate with any club once her contract expires on 31 December

European clubs remain prepared with multi-million-dollar offers

The league insists it will “do everything we can to keep Trinity Rodman here”. The coming weeks will determine whether that promise represents meaningful structural change or simply a defensive slogan in a changing global market.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew react to USMNT's 2026 FIFA World Cup group draw. (3:17)

The U.S. men's national team, it seems, is back to a good place.

The Nations League and Gold Cup eliminations for the U.S. have faded into the past. There's no more feuding between the team's best players and the manager. The Americans are undefeated in five matches, all against World Cup-qualified opposition. They've outscored those opponents 12-4, and there finally seems to be a plan: either a clear back three or a back four that morphs into a back three because one of the fullbacks is more of a center back. It's similar to what Mauricio Pochettino did in his one year at Chelsea, and it has coincided in an uptick in both performances and results for the World Cup co-hosts.

But what about the broader player pool? Pochettino has done a fantastic job of expanding it -- there's a much bigger collection of players who seem capable of contributing than there was a year ago. But a national team manager can only have a minor impact on the true quality of the players at his disposal. We learn a lot more about them when they're at their day jobs: playing for club teams.

So with the European season fast approaching its midway point and the MLS just recently wrapped, it's time for one last edition of the USMNT Player Performance Index before the end of 2025.

For the unfamiliar or forgetful, this is our way of trying to rank the performance of every American professional soccer player in the world. I use the word ""trying"" because it's not perfect -- ranking soccer players, especially across multiple competitive contexts, is impossible -- but it's useful.

To come up with the rankings, we use a combination of talent, playing time, team quality and ... that's it. Simple, but effective.

For talent: The metric is Transfermarkt's estimated market value for every player. This isn't a one-to-one match for talent, but it's close enough, and having it as part of the input ensures that the rankings don't stray too far from what the world thinks of a given player.

For playing time: We simply take the percentage of available minutes each player has played for his team in their domestic league.

For team quality: We use Opta's power rankings, which rate every professional club team in the world. These ratings aren't perfect either -- MLS teams are ranked a little too highly, for one -- but they offer a uniform way of assessing the quality of the teams every American plays for.

And so, the rankings work off a simple premise: if you're playing a lot of minutes and your team has a high rating, then you're likely contributing valuable performance to your team.

For the current edition, the market value makes up 15% of the rating, minutes played makes up 20%, and team quality makes up the remaining 65%. I've also added a 10%-of-minutes threshold, and that means Cole Campbell (1.8% of minutes for Borussia Dortmund) and Antonee Robinson (4.5% of minutes for Fulham) both miss out.

Some other notable absences: Norwich City's Josh Sargent, Orlando City's Alex Freeman, and Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna didn't make the top 50. Were I doing this more subjectively, Luna still wouldn't be in the top 50, I don't think -- he's been way better for the USMNT than in MLS over the past year. Freeman, however, would easily be top 50 because he was probably the best fullback in MLS. And Sargent also would be somewhere on the list. But none of their club teams were good enough for them to make the cut in this edition of the USMNT PPI.

Now, to the list ...

- O'Hanlon: Why Christian Pulisic is having his best season ever
- Predicting the USMNT's starting lineup at the World Cup
- How Roldan went from USMNT afterthought to Pochettino fave

Ten years ago, Richards would've been playing for a Champions League team in Italy, Spain or Germany. Instead, he's playing 99.5% of the minutes for, well, the fourth-place team in England.

Even if you don't think Crystal Palace will be there come season's end, the team is currently rated as the 12th best in the world by Opta. Such is the financial might of the Premier League that Palace, according to these ratings, would be the second-best team in France, Italy, and Germany, while they'd be behind only Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain.

More simply, Palace is the best team any American is currently playing for, and Richards is playing every minute of every game.

After a nightmare start that got Erik ten Hag fired as manager before the transfer window had even closed, Leverkusen has stabilized. After Bayern Munich, Leverkusen is battling it out with RB Leipzig and Borussia Dortmund to be the second-best team in Germany. And outside of his injuries, Tillman has been close to an automatic first-choice starter under both of his managers.

There's not really much in the way of notable statistical production on the ball -- he's making a lot of defensive plays, playing a lot of passes, completing a lot of passes, and not doing much else. But he moved for a major transfer fee over the summer, and he's starting for a Champions League-quality side. That's enough to get him to No. 2.

Unfortunately, Pulisic no longer qualifies for FBref's leaderboards after dipping slightly below the one-third-of-the-minutes threshold. But after his two goals earlier this week, he's now averaging 1.82 non-penalty goals+assists per 90 minutes. That's almost half a goal/assist more than Harry Kane, who leads Europe's Big Five top leagues (among qualified players) with 1.36 per 90.

He's sort of the ""is the dress blue or gold?"" of U.S. fandom.

If I told you that Adams had played nearly 90% of the minutes for a good Premier League team so far this season, you probably would have one of two reactions: (1) Wow, that's such good news for the World Cup! Or (2) Oh my god, no, he's going to get hurt before the World Cup.

He's first in progressive passes and second in progressive carries for a team that has beaten the defending English and Italian champs by a combined 10-3. Given Antonee Robinson's injury problems and Weston McKennie's inconsistent call-ups, it seems as if there's now a core four of close-to-irreplaceable players for the USMNT ahead of next summer: Richards, Pulisic, Adams and Dest.

It started off well -- kind of. He played a lot for Atletico at the beginning of the season, but Atletico was bad to start the season. Then he stopped playing, and now Atletico is pretty much as good as it always is, again.

Since the end of August, Cardoso has played only 71 minutes for Atletico across all competitions. If you thought this move seemed like too big of a jump for a player with a solid season and a half in Spain, then nothing about the first few months of this season will have convinced you otherwise.

It happened again. McKennie wasn't playing for Juventus to start the season and everyone freaked out. And then his new manager eventually realized his team is better when McKennie is on the field. Despite the slow start, McKennie has played nearly two-thirds of the Serie A minutes for Igor Tudor. And as always, he's just doing a little bit of everything, everywhere:

Juventus is in seventh in Serie A -- that's why he's not higher here -- but the team's expected-goal differential is second-best in Italy after Inter Milan. I'd expect Juventus to gradually rise up the table over the next few months, and the same thing should happen to McKennie the next time we do these rankings.

What Weah is getting on loan at Marseille: more minutes than he got at Juventus.

What Weah is not getting on loan at Marseille: any minutes at his preferred position of wing.

Marseille could give Paris Saint-Germain a genuine title challenge this season -- its expected-goal differential is not far behind the European champs -- and that's happening mostly with a lineup in which Weah plays either as a fullback or a wingback. But that might not be as big of a problem for the U.S. as it once seemed.

No one in Europe thinks Weah is a top-class winger even though he mostly has been one of the starting wingers for the U.S. over the past half-decade. But with this new system, Pochettino has leaned more toward inside-forward types rather than pure wingers as the two players next to his striker. That doesn't suit Weah at all, so his path to a starting spot with the U.S. might be as a wingback after all.

He's no longer putting up Messi-like per-minute numbers for PSV anymore -- and that's a good thing. Why? Because it means he's no longer just coming in during garbage time and pummeling Eredivisie clubs that are way worse than PSV.

Pepi still isn't first choice at PSV, but he already has 515 minutes in the league this season. Last season, he finished just south of 700.

I don't think Tessmann is a future star or anything -- he's already 24 -- but he is a solid starting midfielder for a fringe Champions League team in France. Here's how he fares compared to his peers in Ligue 1, per the various grades from Gradient Sports:

With that level of play, he should be in the mix for the starting spot in the midfield next to Adams next summer.

It has been a terrible season for the two young American midfielders on Champions League clubs and Pochettino doesn't seem to like them. Musah even made this list only because he'd played 90 minutes in a match for Milan before moving to Atalanta. With his new club, he has played 60 total minutes and hasn't appeared in a league match since before Halloween.

Jeff Carlisle recaps Folarin Balogun's big night for Monaco in the Champions League.

I like how such a simple rating system can discover the same thing Pochettino has found out over the past couple of months: Roldan is very good at soccer.

Delgado, a midfielder, and Haak, a midfielder-turned-defender, haven't been called up by Pochettino and probably won't be any time soon, but they've both played a ton of minutes for two of the better teams in MLS. In the past, they'd probably be in the mix for one of the final few roster spots, but now this pool has guys who play for Champions League clubs such as Atletico Madrid and Atalanta and probably won't even make next summer's roster, either.

It's funny that perhaps one of the best MLS teams of all time that relied heavily on Americans is also the one that plays its home games in Canada. White, Sabbi, Berhalter and Blackmon combined to play all but one minute of the 3-1 MLS Cup loss to Inter Miami.

I don't want to alarm anyone, but Banks was 18 at the beginning of the season, and he's now just a full-time starter for a team in the Bundesliga at a position that peaks later than average and typically favors older players. The main problem is that Augsburg isn't very good. In fact, the team is very bad: a minus-9.2 expected goal differential, worst in the Bundesliga. But Augsburg has been a lot better -- a roughly average side -- in the minutes when Banks has played.

It's all really promising, and if you were going to pick one out-of-nowhere player to not only make the World Cup roster, but start next summer, then Banks would be your guy. As long as he keeps playing, I'd be very surprised if he doesn't get a call-up to the next full camp.

It feels as if he moved to Manchester City just last year, but he's somehow already 28 years old.

Palmer-Brown never lived up to the hype after he debuted for Sporting Kansas City as a teen, starred at the 2017 under-20 World Cup, and signed with the best club team in the world. But now he's quietly just a starter for one of the biggest clubs in Greece, where he's managed by ... (cleans off glasses in a theatrical fashion that suggests I am familiar with the meme of Tobey Maguire in ""Spider-Man"") ... Rafa Benitez.

A quick shoutout to Sands, who recovered from a gruesome ankle break earlier in February to become one of St. Pauli's most reliable ball-winners this season.

Though he hasn't played particularly well, at least he's playing -- sometimes. Reyna has zero goals or assists through 255 league minutes for Gladbach, but he's already fewer than 100 minutes shy of his entire minutes haul with Dortmund last season.

The question for the rest of this season: Can he start playing more often? And a not-unrelated question to that: Can he start having more of an impact when he gets out there?","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is quickly approaching for the U.S. men's national team and each week becomes ever pertinent in the race for manager Mauricio Pochettino's final roster. 

While Pochettino and his staff know a core of key players, several spots are up for grabs after 71 players were named to national team camps through 2025. With just a few weeks left in the calendar, players will want to enter the World Cup year in the best possible form.

It's all about Europe now, too. There are no more MLS games, leaving the likes of Vancouver Whitecaps FC's Sebastian Berhalter and Orlando City SC's Alex Freeman and several others on the sidelines. 

Here, Sports Illustrated  highlights the five USMNT players to watch in this weekend's action.

Fixture: Man Utd vs. BournemouthDate and Time: Monday, Dec. 15 - 3:00 p.m. ET / 12:00 p.m. PTChannel: USA Network, Telemundo Deportes, NBC Sports AppBournemouth's rise in the Premier League has been enjoyable to watch and Tyler Adams has established himself as a key cog in Andoni Iraola's well-oiled machine. Not only is he playing to a consistently high level, he was also honored with the Premier League Goal of the Month award for November—the first time an American has ever scooped the award.Adams missed last week's scoreless draw against Chelsea due to suspension, but draws back into Bournemouth's squad for the trip to Manchester United. The Cherries were in razor sharp form at the start of the season but are now winless in six—the 26-year-old will be tasked with turning the tide at Old Trafford.

Fixture: Celtic vs. St Mirren—Scottish League Cup finalDate and Time: Saturday, Dec. 13 - 10:30 a.m. ET/ 7:30 a.m. PTChannel: CBS Sports Network, Paramount+, fuboTVAuston Trusty is on the fringe of Pochettino's plans. Still, the center back remains a vital player for Celtic, which is looking for its first win under former Columbus Crew manager Wilfried Nancy, who recently left his MLS role for Glasgow. While they have had troubles in the Scottish Premiership this season, currently sitting second to Hearts, they have a chance at silverware in the Scottish League Cup final against St. Mirren this weekend. It's a match that Celtic would usually be confident in and playing at Hampden Park in Glasgow effectively feels like home at this point, but without a win on Nancy's record, it's not quite that simple. They should have enough firepower though—this is their 30th cup final of the millenium—and Celtic and Trusty are used to winning.

Fixture: Bologna vs. JuventusDate and Time: Sunday, Dec. 14 - 2:45 p.m. ET / 11:45 a.m. PTChannel: CBS Sports Network, Paramount+, fuboTV, DAZN USAWeston McKennnie thrives when he has the faith of his manager, and that's the situation he finds himself in with Juventus under Luciano Spalletti.The 27-year-old has found his goalscoring touch in the Champions League, scoring in the last two matches against Bodø/Glimt two weeks ago and Pafos earlier this week. While he only has an assist and no goals in Serie A, this weekend could be a good time to find the scoresheet. Juventus, who have have chalked up three straight wins in Serie A and sit seventh on 23 points, take on fifth-place Bologna, with a victory giving them the chance to overtake their rivals and crack into the top five.

Fixture: Bayer Leverkusen vs. FC KölnDate and Time: Saturday, Dec. 13 - 12:30 p.m. E.T / 9:30 a.m. PTChannel: ESPN Select, fuboTV  Bayer Leverkusen had a nightmare start to the season, which cost Erik ten Hag his job, but have since found solid form and navigated their way back into the upper echelons of the Bundesliga. USMNT midfielder Malik Tillman, who joined the club in the summer after a standout Concacaf Gold Cup, has been a consistent starter and is a key part to how they approach games, especially when they are out of possession and looking to force a turnover.While he has three goals and no assists through nine games, and the statistical output may be less than desired so far, Tillman's importance to the team has allowed him to carve out a role that should see him among the USMNT starters in the summer. Sitting fourth on 23 points, Leverkusen will look to bounce back from last week's 2–0 loss to Augsburg and hold onto the Champions League spots, taking on an FC Köln side sitting on 16 points and in eighth place.

Fixture: AC Milan vs. SassuoloDate and Time: Sunday, Dec. 14 - 6:30 a.m. ET / 3:30 a.m. PTChannel: Paramount+, fuboTV, DAZN USA, FOX Deportes, Fox Sports Few players in global soccer are enjoying seasons as good as Christian Pulisic's 2025-26 campaign. The 27-year-old USMNT star leads the Serie A Golden Boot race with seven goals and has helped Milan to the top of the table alongside Napoli.Last week, he scored a brace off the bench against Torino in a 3–2 comeback win, bringing him to 13 league goals in a single calendar year for the first time in his career. Averaging a goal every 64 minutes this season, Pulisic has rekindled his form after a muscle injury left him out of the squad for several weeks. This weekend, Milan take on eighth-place Sassuolo, where Pulisic will look to help the Rossoneri establish themselves as the outright leaders in Serie A. As a bonus, he'll look to do it against Concacaf foe, Canada's Ismaël Koné, who has also found form in Serie A.

World Cup

2026 World

Cup Prep

For U.S. men's national team fans, the 2026 World Cup draw was “a dream draw.” It was, according to most Americans, something close to a “best-case scenario.” A matchup with Australia was a “layup for the U.S.,” CBS Sports analyst Mike Grella said. Fox Sports pundit Alexi Lalas called it a “great group” for the USMNT, one “that you should expect this United States team to win.”

And for the Aussies?

“This is a good result for the Socceroos,” wrote the Sydney Morning Herald.

And for Paraguay, the USMNT's first opponent?

“I think it's a very evenly matched group,” Paraguay coach Gustavo Alfaro said.

Their reactions underscored a reality that all the dreamy Stateside optimism seemed to ignore. Sure, Paraguay-Australia-European playoff winner is absolutely a winnable group for the USMNT. But, especially if that playoff winner is Turkey, it's also a losable group. Of all 12 drawn last week, it is, potentially, the group with the most “parity,” as Alfaro said. It raises the USMNT's ceiling but also lowers the floor — for the Americans, and for every other contestant.

“I think we feel, like everyone else in the group, that it's a group that you can get out of,” Australia coach Tony Popovic told Australian media. “I'm sure every nation looks at the teams and says, ‘OK, we've a chance.'”

And if the U.S. sees a “layup”?

“Anyone that underestimates us, I think, will get a rude shock when it comes to those group games,” Popovic said.

There is, to be clear, no suggestion that U.S. players and coaches are underestimating anyone. “There's no easy game at a World Cup,” midfielder Tyler Adams said. Overconfidence is not necessarily the concern.

The concern is simply that the group is tricky; not stacked or murderous, but potentially trickier than it first appeared. If Turkey wins the European playoff — one that also features Kosovo, Romania and Slovakia — all four teams would be in the FIFA top 39 and the Elo top 34. If you were to average each team's FIFA rank and its Elo rank, they'd all be within 10 places of one another, between Turkey (20) and Paraguay (30).

No other 2026 World Cup group will be able to say any of that.

Mexico, by contrast, got South Africa (Elo: 77th). Canada got Qatar (96th). Most groups, in this first 48-team World Cup, have a minnow — a Haiti or Curaçao, a New Zealand or Cape Verde, Jordan or a playoff winner that could be Jamaica, the Democratic Republic of Congo or New Caledonia.

The U.S. didn't get one.

Its group looked “easy” because there is no giant. Seeded in Pot 1, as a co-host, the U.S. avoided FIFA's entire top 10, and then also evaded Colombia, Morocco, Croatia, etc. For the first time in modern program history, the USMNT will be the highest-ranked team in its World Cup group, per FIFA's rankings. That's why the group is full of possibilities.

But there is also a possibility for “disaster,” as Lalas called it. The scenario where the Americans fail to beat Australia, Paraguay and Turkey is entirely realistic — more realistic than it would be in most other 2026 World Cup groups. Group D, in that sense, is a double-edged sword.

It is not a difficult group, per se, but the bars for “difficult” and “easy” have shifted in the 48-team era — in part because 12 relatively weak teams have been added to the field, in part because eight of 12 third-place teams now progress to the knockout stages.

Previously, when the top two of four advanced, the bottom and top of a group held equal weight. Now, if round-of-32 qualification is the primary goal, a group's weak link is arguably more consequential. A pushover, such as Qatar or Curaçao (the two lowest-ranked teams in the field, per Elo), makes the path to the bottom of the group difficult to fathom. It makes at least one win likely. And in this new format, three points and a decent goal differential might be sufficient.

A pushover is what the USMNT doesn't (yet) have in Group D.

So, it is not an easy group, not a best-case scenario, not a “layup.”

It is, for better and worse, wide open.

The legend of the bald USMNT keeper is born

The 2002 World Cup stands as the most successful run that the USMNT has made in that tournament in the post-1990 era. In the eight times since then that the USA has qualified, it is the only time the team has won two games in a World Cup. That record is in no small part thanks to the stellar play of goalkeeper Brad Friedel.

Fans on the East Coast would have been up at 4am to catch the opener where the USA faced Portugal. In that match, the Stars and Stripes shocked a team talented enough to win the World Cup. The Americans came away with a 3-2 win, however it was in the next match that Friedel began notching his name in the history books.

The USA went ahead 1-0 against South Korea thanks to Clint Mathis scoring in the 24th minute. That lead would be in jeopardy when Jeff Agoos committed a foul in the box on a free kick. Friedel saved the ensuing penalty but South Korea drew even in the 78th minute and the game would end 1-1. This video really captures the moment and is only helped by the music selection.

This moment would be critical because the Americans got beaten soundly 3-1 by Poland in the final group match. Had the penalty against South Korea gone in, the USA would have dropped the point they ended up needing to advance. While the final game in the group was a wash, it would be when Friedel stepped up and made another penalty save.

That save saw him become just the second keeper in World Cup history to save two penalties given in regular play in the same tournament. He joined, fittingly enough, Polish keeper Jan Tomaszewski who set the mark in 1974. Friedel's performance in the 2002 World Cup was one of the best, if not the best, showings for a keeper in the entire tournament. It would add to his legend as he would continue his terrific career abroad and earned him being nicknamed “The Human Wall” in the tournament.

As the U.S. and Canada prepared for the 2026 soccer World Cup tournament, rumors abounded about the rapport between U.S. President Donald Trump and the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the international self-regulatory body for association soccer.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has been criticized for violating ethics rules when he created a FIFA Peace Prize for Trump, including by former FIFA President Sepp Blatter. Infantino is no stranger to controversy, having been implicated in the Panama Papers scandal in 2016, targeted in a FIFA ethics committee investigation for alleged malpractice in 2017, and investigated for criminal conduct in Switzerland in 2020. 

The recent relationship between Trump and FIFA under Infantino's leadership has raised many questions and fueled several rumors, true and false, eight of which Snopes investigated. 

Here they are:

Horrific World Cup hotel prices you can just about forgive. Business is business, and in no respect would the hospitality industry be classed as an intrinsic product of football.

World Cup tickets are, though, and at the risk of sounding like The Simpsons ‘old man yells at cloud' headline, I can't avoid the conclusion that FIFA is taking the proverbial. The latest ballot for seats at next summer's finals opened yesterday. FIFA's dynamic pricing model is every bit as bad as you'd imagine.

I know TAFC is labouring the point about how expensive the 2026 World Cup will be to attend, but frankly, the point can't be made often enough. Fans group Football Supporters Europe (FSE) called the ticket structure a “betrayal”, and who can argue? Take a look at the following figures and judge for yourself:

You can appreciate now what FIFA president Gianni Infantino meant when he said the World Cup was the equivalent of 104 Super Bowls. Super Bowl seats might be ultra expensive, but it is, quite evidently, a one-off event. FIFA, in its wisdom, expects punters to pay $2,355 for top-grade tickets for Mexico versus South Africa. And it's probably right in calculating that when push comes to shove, enough of them will.



Henry Bushnell has published the entire list of who is being asked to pay what for which match. It's not that every game is out of reach financially, but the levels of accessibility are dreadful. To quote Seb Stafford-Bloor this morning, World Cups should be open to as many ordinary people as possible. This one feels depressingly exclusive.

A certain amount of money-making was to be expected, but when FIFA's estimated revenue from the 2026 finals is set at more than $10bn, some of the commercialism resembles corporate greed. FIFA explained in a statement to The Athletic that “the pricing model … reflects the existing market practice for major entertainment and sporting events within our hosts on a daily basis, soccer included.” Oh well then.

FSE has urged the governing body to take stock, consult with supporter organisations, and rethink its pricing model. I hope the group don't hold their breath waiting for a reply.

Erling Haaland's haul of 55 goals from 54 Champions League appearances sounds like a wind-up. He's only slightly less prolific domestically, and the time is right to start the debate about whether he is — or might prove to be — the finest finisher to grace the English scene.

He's just passed the 100 mark in the Premier League and his individual droughts are much like the droughts they experience on the west coast of Scotland. But despite how ruthless Haaland can be, he's up against phenomenal competition.

The feted Everton striker, Dixie Dean, for example, maintained an average of 0.86 goals per game in the 1920s and '30s. Haaland's current average is slightly better (0.89, or 145 from 167 matches for Manchester City), but Dean kept it up for more than a decade. He also holds the record for the most strikes in a single top-flight season — 60 (if you can believe that) in 1927-28.

It's inconceivable that Haaland will ever take that particular crown from Dean. The Premier League is too competitive for any modern-day centre-forward to hit 60. But Alan Shearer's Premier League record of 260 goals, and Jimmy Greaves' all-time top-flight high of 357? For as long as Haaland is on the rampage in Manchester, don't regard either tally as safe.

Football club nicknames are great fun, and the odder the better. Scottish teams have a real talent for this. Cowdenbeath are the Blue Brazil (for reasons of irony). Arbroath are the Red Lichties (something to do with a lighthouse). Clyde are the Bully Wee (your guess is as good as mine).

If you've ever wondered why Everton are the Toffees, Paddy Boyland has an answer for you. Back in the 19th century, a shop selling a certain brand of toffee or medicinal sweet started trading in that area of Liverpool. After Everton were founded in 1878, the nickname stuck to them naturally.

In time, the club established a ‘Toffee Lady', whose job it was to pass out sweets to the crowd at games. The tradition might have been lost when Everton left Goodison Park at the end of last season, but Jazz Barnes, above, is keeping it alive at their new stadium, and Paddy went to meet her.

You'll laugh at this: the sweets used to be thrown into the stands. In line with health and safety regulations, they now have to be handed out in a basket. Modern life, eh?

Emmanuel Sabbi hitting both posts with one shot in the MLS Cup final was, on the face of it, as unlucky as unlucky gets. But along came Romain Esse with Crystal Palace in the Conference League last night, doing exactly the same but seeing the second rebound trickle back along the goal line for good measure. Try not to chuckle at him shaping to celebrate twice, only for the penny to drop.

The new-look FIFA Intercontinental Cup sees the six reigning champions of every major continental club competition battle it out for a chance of silverware to end the year. 

The winners of the UEFA Champions League, Copa Libertadores, Concacaf Champions Cup and all other current holders of the premier continental tournaments in FIFA's six confederations have a shot at the title. 

The new version of the competition started in 2024, with Real Madrid lifting the trophy with a comfortable 3–0 victory over Pachuca in the final. With Los Blancos vacating their Champions League crown back in May, they won't participate in the 2025 Intercontinental Cup, opening the door for a new champion to be crowned.

The FIFA Intercontinental Cup is the tournament that succeeded the old version of the FIFA Club World Cup. The inaugural 32-team Club World Cup took centre stage in the summer of 2025 and will be played every four years, whereas the Intercontinental Cup will continue to be an annual event that takes place to close out the calendar year.

Every single match in the FIFA Intercontinental Cup is a straight elimination bout. The tournament begins with the FIFA African-Asian-Pacific Cup, with the three champions from Africa, Asia and Oceania's confederations battling it out for a place in the tournament's semifinal.

The FIFA Derby of the Americas pits the Concacaf Champions Cup winner against the Copa Libertadores winner, and they go on to meet the winner of the above in the FIFA Challenger Cup. The victor in that clash then goes on to contest the Intercontintal Cup with the reigning Champions League holders.

The FIFA Intercontinental Cup final will take place on Wednesday, Dec. 17. The game will be played at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan, Qatar, a venue that hosted seven matches during the 2022 World Cup. 

Paris Saint-Germain await the winner of the FIFA Challenger Cup in the final, aiming to conquer the tournament for the first time.

Paris Saint-Germain, the 2024–25 Champions League winners, are immediately placed into the Intercontinental Cup final because of the competitiveness and historical ranking of European football's primary club competition.

It means Luis Enrique's side only need to overcome one hurdle to pick up another trophy—victory in the final would add to the Ligue 1, Coupe de France, French Super Cup and UEFA Super Cup crowns they have won this calendar year.

Some sort of annual FIFA Intercontinental club competition has been around since 1960, with various changes to the format occuring over that time.

In 2005, the tournament merged with the Club World Cup, but things have reverted back to how they were after FIFA's decision to expand the latter into a four-yearly 32-team format.

Real Madrid are the only official winners of the current Intercontinental Cup iteration, and historically have won the most titles with four. AC Milan, Boca Juniors and two Uruguayan rivals, Peñarol and Nacional, won three under the old banner but only Madrid's current reign is recognised in the current lineage.

The Club World Cup entered a new era in 2025, with the first ever 32-team edition of the tournament taking place on U.S. soil.

Unlike the five-game Intercontinental Cup, the new version of the Club World Cup follows the previous Champions League and World Cup formats. Eight groups of four teams where the top two advance to the knockout rounds that begin with the round of 16.

Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain in the 2025 Club World Cup final to become the first ever champions of the new version of the competition.

The Club World Cup will be held every four years, presumably as a warm up for the World Cup the following year. Meanwhile, as mentioned previously, the Intercontinental Cup will be held every year.

As continental champions, all six teams that participate in the Intercontinental Cup every year are also granted direct qualification intp the next edition of the Club World Cup. As a result, Auckland City FC, Al Ahli, Pyramids FC, Cruz Azul, Flamengo and PSG will participate in the 2029 Club World Cup.

In World Cup parlance, Qatar was Fifa president Gianni Infantino's qualifier. Now it's the big time for Trump's dictator-curious protege

I used to think Fifa's recent practice of holding the World Cup in autocracies was because it made it easier for world football's governing body to do the things it loved: spend untold billions of other people's money and siphon the profits without having to worry about boring little things like human rights or public opinion. Which, let's face it, really piss around with your bottom line.

But for a while now, that view has seemed ridiculously naive, a bit like assuming Recep Erdoğan followed Vladimir Putin's election-hollowing gameplan just because hey, he's an interested guy who likes to read around a lot of subjects. So no: Fifa president Gianni Infantino hasn't spent recent tournaments cosying up to authoritarians because it made his life easier. He's done it to learn from the best. And his latest decree this week simply confirms Fifa is now a fully operational autocracy in the classic populace-rinsing style. Do just absorb yesterday's news that the cheapest ticket for next year's World Cup final in the US will cost £3,120 – seven times more than the cheapest ticket for the last World Cup final in Qatar. (Admittedly, still marginally cheaper than an off-peak single from London to Manchester.)

Like all dictator-curious populists, Fifa loathes its people – the fans. Thinking back, I've even been at tournaments where the governing body has sponsored show trials. In South Africa in 2010, we had something called the Fifa World Cup Courts – 56 courts where Fifa indicated it had finally outgrown fast food tie-ins and slapped its branding on justice itself. Or rather, on summary justice – which became an official tournament partner as cases were rushed through to appease the governing body. A group of Dutch women who'd worn orange minidresses to a game as stunt-marketing for Bavaria beer were arrested. Fifa filed criminal charges against the company.

Again, in retrospect that all seems rather small beer (sorry). Orange-coated faux fans are positively encouraged these days, but only if they come in the sole form of US president Donald Trump, whose bromance with Infantino has been one of the more mesmerisingly weird developments of his presidency.

But then, just as power-playing moguls place themselves on each other's company boards, so autocrats love other autocrats. Back in January, many of us were still vaguely startled to see Gianni given a great seat at Trump's inauguration, barely two rows behind the tech oligarchs, where he was able to laugh uproariously at the bit of the speech where Trump announced he'd be renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. (Just a little niggle between Fifa co-hosts.) But now that we've seen Infantino pop up everywhere from Gaza peace conferences to regular turns in the Oval Office, it almost feels strange when he isn't part of Trump's malarial travelling court – the Dontourage, if you will.

Whether Infantino will at some point end up in the woodchipper, just like everyone does with Trump, is unclear. For now, the president is enjoying having his tummies tickled. A week ago, at the World Cup draw, Trump obligingly suggested the NFL give up the rights to calling its sport football in the United States. “But when you think about it, shouldn't it really be called … this is football,” Trump waffled. “There's no question about it. We have to come up with another name for the NFL. It really doesn't make sense when you think about it.” This is what happens when the president gets booed at the Super Bowl, instead of being given an inaugural award like he was at Infantino's fever dream of a draw. Yes, even though you couldn't believe the shamelessness until you actually saw it with your own eyes, it was incredibly credible that Infantino would indeed confect some nutty “Fifa peace prize” and award it to Trump.

In recent history, both the Olympics and the World Cup have shown they are always able to covertly or overtly override local laws of the host country for the duration of their sporting event. Fortunately, though, this is unnecessary in the US, where being ripped off for sports tickets is effectively the 28th amendment. Furthermore, this World Cup is already shaping up to be the sort of reciprocally abusive arrangement we've seen when the tournament previously tipped up in non-democracies. Trump can use it to threaten Democrat mayors with loss of city hosting rights, while Infantino can charge genuinely crazy money and have Fifa run the entire secondary ticketing/scalping market without interference. Everyone's a winner, as long as they hold all the cards.

And the peasants – the fans – just have to suck it up. Fifa elections have effectively been hollowed out by the strong-arm practice of buying off the votes of smaller nations via disproportionately large grants. The dictator makes sure countries know what's good for them. The gravy train rolls on. So if you fancy getting rid of Gianni and everything he represents, I'd love to know the mechanism you have in mind. Maybe one day football will have some kind of revolution, in which hordes of endlessly oppressed people who actually like the sport will storm Infantino's Zurich palace, and loot all the valuable gifts of obscure provenance. But it won't be soon, unless one or more of the big football markets gets it together and pulls out.

Until then, we'll just have to accept that there is simply no one who cares less than Infantino, and simply no sport that hates its fans quite as much as football. In fact, if only those fans could afford the tickets, they'd have the receipts to prove it.

Soccer fans have accused FIFA of a “monumental betrayal” after latest prices for World Cup tickets began to circulate on Thursday. 

The governing body allocates 8% of tickets to national associations for games involving their team to sell to the most loyal fans.

And a list published by the German soccer federation revealed prices ranged from $180-$700 for varying group stage games. The lowest price for the final was $4,185 and the highest was $8,680.

Those group-stage prices are very different from FIFA's claims of $60 tickets being available, while the target from United States soccer officials when bidding for the tournament seven years ago was to offer hundreds of thousands of $21 seats across the opening phase of games. 

Fan organization Football Supporters Europe (FSE) described the current prices as “extortionate.”

“This is a monumental betrayal of the tradition of the World Cup, ignoring the contribution of supporters to the spectacle it is,” it said in a statement. 

The English Football Association shared pricing information with the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) on Thursday evening, which showed that if a fan bought a ticket for every game through to the final it would cost just over $7,000.

FIFA said in September that tickets released through its website would initially range from $60 for group-stage matches to $6,730 for the final. But those prices are subject to change as it adopts dynamic pricing for the first time at the World Cup. 




FIFA tickets are available in four categories, with the best seats in Category 1.

In the price list published by the German federation, there were only three categories. 

The lowest priced ticket was $180 for Germany's opening group game against Curacao in Houston. The lowest price for the semifinal was $920 rising to $1,125.

The FSE called on FIFA to immediately halt ticket sales via national associations “until a solution that respects the tradition, universality, and cultural significance of the World Cup is found.”

The Associated Press approached FIFA for comment.

FIFA launched its third phase of widespread ticket sales Thursday, with fans now able to apply for specific matches for the first time through its “Random Selection Draw.”

Following last week's draw for the 2026 tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, an updated schedule has been published.

That means fans know when and where the likes of Lionel Messi and Argentina will play. Previous ticket ballots were blind as the qualification period had not even been completed and the draw was yet to take place. 

Now participating nations have been placed in groups, with their paths through the tournament determined. For instance, Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo could go on to meet in the quarterfinals in Kansas City if both Argentina and Portugal top their respective groups. 

Not that fans are guaranteed to get tickets to the games they apply for. 

The draw opened Dec. 11 at 11 a.m. ET (1600 GMT) and closes Jan. 13, 2026. 

FIFA says ticket applications can be made at any point during this window and the timing of entry will not impact the chances of success. Fans can apply via FIFA's website for a maximum of four tickets per household per match and a maximum of 40 tickets throughout the tournament. 

Fans will need a FIFA ID to apply for tickets and can pick which matches and which pricing category they want to apply for.

Successful applicants will be notified by email in February and charged automatically.

The last time the U.S. hosted the World Cup in 1994 prices ranged from $25 to $475. In Qatar in 2022 prices ranged from around $70 to $1,600 when ticket details were announced.

Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium on July 19 are already going for in excess of $11,000 on secondary resale sites.

For this tournament FIFA has also set up its own resale platform where it charges a 15% fee based on the total resale price. 

FIFA said that closer to the tournament any remaining tickets will go on general sale on a first-come, first-served basis.

It did not reveal a time frame for the release of those remaining tickets.

The third phase of ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup opened Thursday, and the prices immediately sparked outrage among fans.

“What FIFA is doing is inconceivable,” said Erik Vales, a Fort Worth resident who has attended the World Cups in Brazil (2014), Russia (2018), and Qatar (2022).

Vales was stunned by the soaring costs in this latest sales window, which offered fans another chance to secure seats for the tournament set to take place next summer in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

AT&T Stadium in Arlington will host more matches than any other venue, with nine games scheduled, including a semifinal.

Last weekend's announcement of the groups, schedules and venues for all 104 matches only pushed ticket prices higher.

FIFA has divided tickets into three categories:

Category 1: lower bowl seating

Category 2: middle tier

Category 3: upper level

For the first time, FIFA has introduced dynamic pricing, meaning ticket costs fluctuate based on demand for marquee matchups.

At AT&T Stadium, where reigning world champion Argentina, led by Lionel Messi, will take the field. FIFA has also set ticket prices for the marquee clash between England, ranked fourth in FIFA's standings, and Croatia, ranked 10th.

Tickets for Argentina vs. Austria (June 22), Argentina vs. Jordan (June 27), and England vs. Croatia are priced at $700 in Category 1, $500 in Category 2, and $265 in Category 3.

The most expensive group-stage ticket currently listed is for the United States vs. Paraguay opener on June 12 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, priced at $2,735 in Category 1. 

The opening match of the tournament, Mexico vs. South Africa on June 11 at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, is listed at $2,355 for Category 1 seats.

“Today's prices are insane,” said Vales, who displayed a Category 1 ticket for which he paid $175 to attend the group-stage match between Mexico and Croatia at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

At the World Cup in Russia, he paid $210 for a Category 1 ticket, and at the Qatar World Cup, he paid $220 for a ticket in the same category.

To attend the 2026 World Cup, fans can purchase individual tickets through FIFA's site if selected in a lottery. Otherwise, they must turn to hospitality packages, which cost thousands of dollars.

On the secondary market, prices have skyrocketed even further.

Resale tickets listed Thursday for Argentina vs. Austria at AT&T Stadium ranged from $1,697 in Category 1, $1,606 in Category 2, and $1,124 in Category 3. Some lower-bowl seats were listed for as much as $10,588.

“The dynamic pricing model is a game-changer. Before, you could buy tickets knowing the price wouldn't change regardless of which teams played. What FIFA is doing now, in my opinion, is price gouging, which is illegal in the United States,” Vales said.

Fan organization Football Supporters Europe (FSE) echoed those concerns, calling the current prices “extortionate.”

“This is a monumental betrayal of the tradition of the World Cup, ignoring the contribution of supporters to the spectacle it is,” FSE said in a statement.

The group-stage prices stand in stark contrast to FIFA's claims that $60 tickets would be available. U.S. soccer officials, when bidding for the tournament seven years ago, promised thousands of $21 seats during the opening phase of the tournament.

The prices announced by FIFA on Thursday will remain fixed through Jan. 13, the deadline for fans to apply for tickets. 

After that, FIFA will randomly select applicants, charge them the listed prices, and distribute tickets in February. Those not chosen will receive rejection notices.

Before Thursday's announcement, and even before the official World Cup draw, FIFA had already sold nearly 2 million tickets across two early lottery phases. 

In October, the organization set prices based on round and venue. By November, it had raised some of those prices in response to surging demand.

Vales, a veteran fan who has traveled across three continents to watch World Cup matches, now wonders if he'll be able to attend the tournament being staged in his own backyard.

“We're not asking for free tickets,” he said. “The only thing we're asking FIFA for is fair prices.”

The road to the 2026 FIFA World Cup is long and treacherous, with 206 countries competing through various pathways across six confederations for a spot at the sport's biggest event.

With co-hosts USA, Mexico and Canada automatically qualifying, 45 nations join them at the 48-team tournament.

A lot to sort through? Let's take a closer look at how each team qualified for the biggest World Cup yet.

Qualified teams:

Forty-six teams began World Cup qualifying in Asia, with 28 eliminated after the second round. In the third round, 18 teams were split into three groups of six.

The top two teams from each of these groups (Iran, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan, Japan, Australia) qualified directly for the World Cup. The third-place and fourth-place teams advanced to the fourth round, where Saudi Arabia and Qatar emerged as qualifiers.

Iraq can earn an additional AFC berth through the intercontinental playoff, a six-team mini-tournament in March 2026 that will determine the final two World Cup participants.

AFC: 8 direct spots + 1 intercontinental playoff spot

Qualified teams:

Africa's 53 national teams were divided into nine groups, with each team playing every other team at home and away. After all group stage games were completed, the nine group winners automatically qualified for the World Cup.

Meanwhile, DR Congo could also qualify through the intercontinental playoff.

CAF: 9 direct spots + 1 intercontinental playoff spot

Qualified teams:

The US, Mexico and Canada automatically qualified as tournament co-hosts, leaving three direct spots up for grabs during qualifiers between Concacaf's remaining 32 teams.

Panama, Haiti and Curaçao – the latter earning their first World Cup berth – secured their places via the third round of Concacaf qualifiers.

Suriname and Jamaica still have hope; they'll both compete at the intercontinental playoff in March 2026.

Concacaf: 6 direct spots + 1 intercontinental playoff spot

Qualified teams:

Conmebol's 10 nations played home and away, with the top six automatically qualifying based on their place in the overall table.

Defending World Cup champions Argentina – with Inter Miami CF's superstar duo of Lionel Messi and Rodrigo De Paul in tow – topped the standings by nearly double digits with 38 points.

Fellow heavyweights Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay are also among the region's six representatives. Bolivia can make it seven if they advance out of the intercontinental playoff in March 2026.

Conmebol: 6 direct spots + 1 intercontinental playoff spot

Qualified team:

Only 11 nations competed in World Cup qualifying in Oceania; that was whittled down to a four-team playoff by the third and final round.

New Zealand and New Caledonia both reached the final, with the Kiwis prevailing to lock up the lone direct qualification spot. New Caledonia moved on to the intercontinental playoff.

OFC: 1 direct spot + 1 intercontinental playoff spot

Qualified teams:

European qualifying featured 54 teams divided into 12 groups. Each group winner automatically advanced, while the remaining four spots are secured via a playoff system.

The qualified nations include eight teams in the top 10 of the FIFA World Rankings: Spain, France, England, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Croatia.

The runners-up in each group, as well as the four highest-ranked remaining Nations League teams (who did not finish in a top-two spot in their group), will settle the remaining four qualification spots via a 16-team playoff.

Random selection is on now","https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2025/12/12/random-selection-for-fifa-world-cup-tickets-is-on-now-how-to-enter-atlanta-mercedes-benz/87730968007/","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 15:11:00 GMT","

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will bring soccer fans from around the world to the streets of Atlanta as eight matches are set for Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

Officials for the tournament, which runs from June 11 to July 19, announced the group stage match-ups last week, allowing fans to purchase tickets knowing which teams are playing.

If you're still hoping for a chance to see your favorite team play in Atlanta, the random selection phase of ticketing is on now and will continue until Jan. 13. Here's how to enter the draw.

The Random Selection Draw period, the third round of ticketing, opened Dec. 11 and will remain open until Jan. 13 at 11 a.m. ET.

When you enter the drawing during that time will not impact your chances of winning a chance to purchase tickets, officials said.

To enter the drawing, you can go to FIFA.com/tickets and create a FIFA account. You will then be asked to choose what team you root for, where you'd like to see a match and your contact information.

It's important to look at the ticket pricing before registering for the draw. If chosen, you will be automatically charged for the tickets you have been awarded.

""Fans will be able to select which match(es), respective ticket category(ies), and number of tickets per match they'd like to purchase, subject to household restrictions,"" FIFA officials said. ""All successful and partially successful ticket applicants will receive communications via email and subsequently will be automatically charged for their tickets in February. A partially successful application indicates that a fan will receive the number of tickets requested to a match, but not all matches requested.""

If you don't want to leave your World Cup dreams to chance, there are a few other options for purchasing tickets.

First, if you would only like to attend a game for a specific team, you may be eligible for a Participating Member Association. Each association has their own process of designating tickets, but members may be able to purchase tickets from a section of tickets pre-determined for supports of their team. Information about PMAs is available on the FIFA ticketing site.

Some fans can also purchase ""premium, elevated matchday"" ticket experiences through hospitality packages, found at FIFA.com/hospitality, or from On Location, the group curating the experiences for the World Cup.

Qatar Airways is also offering travel packages for out-of-town fans. The packages include match tickets in category 1 or 2, transport in the city and to and from the airport, hotel stays and domestic and international flights.

The FIFA Resale/Exchange Marketplace will be the last official outlet to buy match tickets. The marketplace will open on the FIFA ticketing site on Dec. 15.

Resale tickets may be available through other, unofficial outlets after that period.

Manchester United are reportedly eyeing Sunderland midfielder Noah Sadiki following his sensational Premier League start, with Chelsea also keeping a tab on the £15 million ($20m) star. Ruben Amorim has urged the board to sign at least one midfielder in the summer of 2026 after missing out on Brighton's Carlos Baleba. They are also monitoring the likes of Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson.

According to Sky Sports' Sacha Tavolieri, United are now ""all in"" for Sunderland's breakout midfielder Sadiki, with the Red Devils positioning the 20-year-old as a major summer 2026 target. They have made him their preferred option should attempts to sign Brighton's Baleba collapse for a second consecutive window. He arrived at the Stadium of Light only a few months ago for £15m ($20m) from Union Saint-Gilloise, and has been one of the Premier League's surprise stars. He has started all 15 of Sunderland's fixtures this season, anchoring their midfield with composure well beyond his years. Meanwhile, Chelsea are said to have sent delegates directly to Sunderland after the clubs met on October 25, enquiring about a potential price tag. The Blues' interest is genuine, but they may struggle to offer Sadiki immediate minutes. At Chelsea, the youngster would find himself fighting Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez for a starting place. United, however, offer a far clearer pathway, with uncertainty surrounding Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro.

United's long-running pursuit of Baleba, a saga stretching back to the summer, remains unresolved. The club agreed personal terms with the Brighton midfielder, but had to withdraw their interest due to the Seagulls' steep asking price. United planned to revisit the deal in 2026, when Brighton expect to cash in, but the Seagulls' valuation continues to be a major stumbling block. Moreover, his inconsistent form this season has added further hesitation, with senior figures reluctant to sanction what could become a record-breaking fee. 

Casemiro, meanwhile, is entering the final months of his contract. United want the Brazil icon to remain, but only on reduced wages. There is no guarantee he will agree, and clubs in Saudi Arabia remain on standby. Ugarte has struggled for rhythm, and Mainoo, who was once the club's crown jewel in midfield, is increasingly unsettled after a run of high-profile omissions from Amorim's starting XI. United expect Napoli to table a formal enquiry for Mainoo as early as January, which will provide the midfielder an exit route from Amorim's exile. He is desperate for minutes to impress England manager Thomas Tuchel ahead of the March international break, which will be the final time The Three Lions will convene for an international break before the summer World Cup.

Sunderland paid a modest sum for Sadiki in July, but his value has surged rapidly thanks to his assured Premier League performances. With an intelligent reading of play, tidy distribution and an exceptional work rate, he has become indispensable for a Black Cats side who have taken the top flight by surprise. United are determined to build a squad for the future with young generational talents at its core. They have recently signed 13-year-old defender Socrates from The Elite London Academy, another unpolished diamond unearthed by their scouting network. 

Following the signing, The London Academy wrote: ""From the moment he joined Elite London Academy, you could see he had something special: technically gifted, intelligent on the ball, brave in duels, and always hungry to learn. Along his journey, we organised trials for him at Arsenal, Tottenham and Crystal Palace. He completed full trials at these clubs but these did not result in registration. Arguably, missed opportunities for the clubs.

""But what makes Socrates different is how he responded. He didn't sulk. He didn't lose confidence. He showed resilience, maturity and a mindset far beyond his age. Instead, he pushed harder. Soon exciting opportunities have followed. Socrates was offered registration at a top Cat 1 club in the North in August after a successful trial.""

While the recruitment team accelerate long-term planning ahead of a potentially transformative and chaotic summer window, Amorim remains focussed on his job at hand. The Red Devils return to the Premier League stage on Monday against Bournemouth, and after a convincing 4-1 victory over Wolves, the Portuguese manager will look to beat the Cherries at home.

Marc Guehi set for fresh talks after agent meets with club chief Max Eberl","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/bayern-munich-marc-guehi-set-for-fresh-talks-agent-meets-with-club-chief-max-eberl/blt71cbca1629c73fdd","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 09:47:04 GMT","

Marc Guehi is reportedly set for a fresh round of talks with Bayern Munich after his agent met with club chief Max Eberl. The Crystal Palace centre-back will run down his contract until the summer of 2026. Guehi has already informed Palace that he will not sign an extension, effectively guaranteeing a summer exit and triggering a battle among Europe's elite.

Liverpool came close to signing Guehi last summer, only for Palace to pull the plug on deadline day when they failed to secure a replacement. The collapse of the £35 million ($46.6m) move dramatically changed the 25-year-old's future, and with his deal winding down, clubs know he could walk for free in 2026. With the window for pre-contract agreements with foreign clubs opening on January 1, Bayern intend to open talks. According to Sky Sports, Eberl plans to meet Guehi as soon as he becomes eligible to negotiate freely.

Earlier in the campaign, when asked about Bayern's discussion with Guehi's representatives, Eberl told DAZN: ""It's absolutely clear that we as Bayern Munich are exploring the market. Our clear goal is to extend Upa's [Dayot Upamecano] contract. That's our ultimate goal. If that doesn't work out, we have to be prepared. We would be foolish not to. That's the reason. I've not confirmed anything, but we are active in the market.""

Palace boss Oliver Glasner has already revealed that the Eagles will have to reluctantly part ways with the defender next summer: ""I think Marc has already told us that he doesn't sign a new contract, so he will leave next year. The club wanted [him to stay]. They offered Marc a new contract. But he said, 'no, I want to make something different'. And that's normal. And for us, it's how we can deal with this situation? [What] is the best way to get this next step done? And that's all about how we are talking together.""

According to an earlier report in The Times, Liverpool still view Guehi as a potential heir to Virgil van Dijk, who will be 35 next season. The urgency has increased with Ibrahima Konate's contract expiring in 2026 and other clubs showing interest in the Frenchman. However, the failed move to Anfield appears not to have dented Guehi's admiration for the club. He recently revealed he has taken the disappointment in his stride, leaning on his faith and the support of team-mate Maxence Lacroix.

He told Sky Sports: ""I think everyone has this perception that it was difficult. Actually, it wasn't difficult. It wasn't difficult at all. Because when you're focused on what's the most important thing, it becomes easy. I know that God has a plan for me, and whatever that plan will be, will come into fruition at some point. But, the goal and the focus has always been playing football and trying to do the best I can. And fortunately for me, I get to do it with people like Max.""

Pep Guardiola is said to have been impressed by Guehi's professionalism after seeing how he responded to the breakdown of the Liverpool transfer. Despite City's deep pool of centre-backs, uncertainty surrounds the futures of several key figures. John Stones, now 31, remains injury-prone, while Ruben Dias has shown signs of a physical decline. City have already begun preparing for the next phase of Guardiola's defensive rebuild, and Guehi is seen as a player capable of competing for a starting role immediately.

Real Madrid are also in the market for defensive reinforcements, but with president Florentino Perez reluctant to sanction another nine-figure signing, Los Blancos are studying the free-agent landscape. Guehi's name sits prominently alongside Upamecano and Konate on their list of potential arrivals. Madrid are preparing to lose both Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba when their contracts expire in June. Last summer's signing of Bournemouth defender Dean Huijsen was the first step in what will be a sweeping reshaping of the back line. Guehi, available without a transfer fee in 2026 and with relatively modest wages compared with elite continental defenders, fits the club's model.

Liverpool star at centre of controversy pictured meeting former team-mate Jordan Henderson in 'secret London summit'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/mohamed-salah-showdown-talks-liverpool-controversy-jordan-henderson-london/bltcd2b44f43433c04c","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 07:44:41 GMT","

Liverpool superstar Mohamed Salah has been spotted holding a ""secret London summit"" with former Anfield team-mate Jordan Henderson. The Egyptian superstar, who will soon be heading off on Africa Cup of Nations duty, is seeing questions asked of his future on Merseyside following an explosive outburst. He is being linked with Saudi Pro League teams, with Henderson having previously spent time in that division.

There have been suggestions that Salah may have taken in his last appearance for Liverpool, having reached 420 on that front. The two-time Premier League champion and four-time Golden Boot winner has registered 250 goals for the Reds.

He has been named among the substitutes by Arne Slot across three successive matches, with no game time seen in a dramatic 3-3 draw with Leeds. That snub led to Salah speaking out, as he accused Liverpool of throwing him under the bus and admitted to seeing a working relationship with his Dutch coach break down. He said: ""I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager, and all of a sudden we don't have any relationship. I don't know why but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn't want me in the club. It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame. It is not acceptable to me, to be fair. I don't get it. It's like I'm being thrown more under the bus. I don't think I'm the problem.""

That outburst led to Salah being dropped for Liverpool's 1-0 Champions League over Inter at San Siro, as he was left behind in England. The 33-year-old forward has taken a trip to London for a ""secret rendezvous"" with Henderson - as caught on camera by The Sun.

England international Henderson is now on the books at Brentford. He spent five months with Saudi outfit Al-Ettifaq, working under Reds legend Steven Gerrard, before returning to Europe at Ajax and eventually heading back to Britain.

Salah is now seeing a switch to the Middle East speculated on, with teams in that region holding long-standing interest in his services. The Saudi Pro League is considered to have been one topic of conversation when Salah met up with ex-Liverpool captain Henderson.

A source told The Sun: ""They both came in wearing covid-style masks and had hats covering their faces. They tried to stay under the radar. Our mouths dropped when we saw it was Mo and Jordan. The immediate thought was, ‘Salah's off to Saudi'.""

Another onlooker said, having seen Salah and Henderson spend 90 minutes chatting away: ""Mo looked happy as he listened and took it all in. He kept asking Jordan questions, and lent in eagerly to hear what was being said. I couldn't believe what I was witnessing. It was obvious Jordan was explaining things to Mo, who listened so intently and was clearly mulling over what he was being told.""

Chief executive of the Saudi Pro League, Omar Mugharbel, told the World Football Summit in Riyadh on Wednesday when asked about a potential deal for one of the most recognisable players on the planet: ""Mohamed Salah is welcome in the Saudi League, but it is the clubs that are responsible for negotiating with players. For sure Salah is one of them.""

According to The Sun, Al-Hilal, Al-Qadsiah and Neom have all expressed interest in Salah, who saw Liverpool reject a £150 million ($201m) transfer bid from Al-Ittihad in 2023. He signed a two-year contract extension with Liverpool in April that is due to run until the summer of 2027.

It is claimed that Liverpool remain confident that any issues between Salah and Slot can be resolved, allowing a modern day Reds legend to remain in his current surroundings. Saudi teams are, however, of the opinion that the Premier League giants are trying to ""protect their star player's transfer value and are keeping a keen eye on developments"" ahead of the January window.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ruben Amorim's tenure as Man United boss has been marked by his insistence on a three-at-the-back system, which has enraged club legend Paul Scholes. Amorim is respected for his success with a 3-4-3 formation at Sporting, but Scholes has blasted the Portuguese for his refusal to play in a style more suited to the ‘Man United way.'  

Amorim's system uses three central defenders and high-pushing wing-backs, which is a departure from the traditional four-man defence ingrained in the club's history. And Scholes has been particularly vocal in his unhappiness, arguing that the tactical approach does not fit the ""risk and entertainment"" philosophy the club is famous for. Scholes claimed that the club's hierarchy, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, ""don't have a clue"" about the club's identity if they thought Amorim's system would fit. He has criticised the team's perceived lack of creativity and the manager's handling of players like Kobbie Mainoo.Despite leading United to their first win at Anfield since 2016 in November and receiving a Manager of the Month award in October, Scholes and others believe the manager's stubbornness with his system is the primary issue.  

Speaking to The Good, The Bad, The Football podcast, Scholes said: ""I don't think the manager gets the club, full stop. I just don't think he's the right man. Man United is about risk and entertainment, more than anything. Having fans on the edge of their seats f***ing ready to go. Wingers who beat people. Shots on goal. Bits of skill. There's nothing there. That's from the club. We talk about this is a different club – they've got Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox who are probably brilliant at their job, brilliant at what they do. They're not Man United. They don't have a clue what it's like to buy a Manchester United player, to bring a Manchester United manager in. If you go to Sporting Lisbon and watch, they played three at the back. Right away, that's a no. Man United never do that. They can't do that. They just can't, it's been proven over years and years and years. And I'm talking about even before Sir Alex Ferguson, it was always 4-4-1-1 or 4-4-2. Entertaining people. He hasn't got that in him. 

Scholes added: ""He brought four defenders on against West Ham. If we go 1-0 up, the manager always said ‘two, three, four.' I remember once, I think we were playing Chelsea. We went 1-0 up and we sat back a little bit. Now, Chelsea were a good team. The manager went absolutely nuts after the game. That doesn't happen here. When you score one, you score two. You go for the throat every single time. I just don't think he gets it."" 

Once the midfield maestro who covered every blade of Old Trafford grass to an adoring crowd, and his major honours include an English record 11 Premier League titles, two UEFA Champions League trophies, three FA Cups, and two League Cups. But Scholes has revealed he's been relegated to buying tickets off touts just to get into the ground. Scholes said: ""I have four season tickets so we use them... my son uses them every single week. You get people asking [for tickets]. I've had a Salford lad who wants to go to the game this week - a couple of tickets. So I've had to ring a tout? Am I allowed to say that? Honestly, I know a tout.""

United coasted past Wolves to land a much-needed 4-1 win and are expected to ease past Bournemouth on Monday evening. But, a word of caution, the Cherries have won their last two Premier League away games against Old Trafford, beating them 3-0 both times.

Manchester City have announced that head coach Pep Guardiola will skip pre-match press duties ahead of a Premier League clash with Crystal Palace due to a ""personal matter"". Guardiola was due to face the assembled media on Friday, but his place in that hot seat will be filled by assistant manager Kolo Toure - with the Blues' talismanic boss set to be back in the dugout at Selhurst Park.

City are confident that the issue will not impact plans for a trip to South London. Guardiola is expected to take his place on the bench as usual after naming a team that he hopes can pick up three more points in an ongoing title bid.

A morale-boosting 2-1 victory over Real Madrid in midweek Champions League competition has helped to raise spirits in the City camp. They are now just two points adrift of table-topping Arsenal - who play host to rock bottom Wolves on Saturday evening.

Any slip up from the Gunners would leave the door open for City to climb to the summit, as they prepare to tackle high-flying Palace on Sunday. Guardiola heads into that game aware that his record against Eagles boss Oliver Glasner is not the best - with an FA Cup final defeat suffered against the Austrian tactician last season.

Guardiola will, however, have City ready for another tough test in the English capital. That is despite being forced to miss a press conference due to issues in his private life. He has left matters in the capable hands of Toure.

Pep Lijnders, who once worked alongside Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool, boasts more experience in the coaching department - and is accustomed to facing the media - but was also unavailable on Friday due to a scheduled day off.



Toure is speaking as the public face of City for the first time since being promoted to a first-team role over the summer. The 44-year-old represented the Blues and Arsenal - winning Premier League titles with both - in his playing days.

He began his coaching career as an assistant to ex-Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers at Celtic, before following him to Leicester. An unsuccessful spell was taken in as manager of Wigan Athletic during the 2022-23 campaign, with that stint lasting just nine games as no wins were picked up.

Former Ivory Coast international Toure - who played alongside his brother Yaya at City - returned to the Etihad Stadium as an assistant to U18s manager Oli Reiss in 2024. He was then allowed to bridge the gap between youth and first-team ranks in July 2025.

City's academy director Thomas Krucken told the Manchester Evening News of that decision, as Guardiola freshened up his backroom staff: ""Before the season starts, we sat together with Txiki [Begiristain], Hugo [Viana], the head of coaching, Kolo - he is a very important part now because he knows the players really well - and there are a core of four players training. The EDS train every day next to the first team so it's easy for us and the players Pep needs, he gets.

""The door to the first team is always open. I think we have a fantastic interface. Kolo is an important part but also Pep Lijnders has huge experience over a period of his seasons at Liverpool and before. He is an expert in working with young players. We have a regular meeting with Hugo, Pep Lijnders and Kolo, the head of coaching Jose [Luis Rueda] who is our head of Individual Player Development.""

Former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola has been in charge of City since 2016. He has taken in 556 games at the game and boasts a win ratio of 70.5 per cent. The Catalan passed 1,000 matches as a manager this season.

He has overseen six Premier League title triumphs, with one of those - in 2022-23 - forming part of a historic Treble. In total, he has won 18 trophies with City and is tied to a contract through to the summer of 2027.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Karim Benzema has reignited one of the most compelling storylines of his extraordinary career by revealing he remains fully open to representing France at the 2026 World Cup, despite a turbulent international history that has long suggested his time with Les Bleus is over. Didier Deschamps' men will be looking to regain the global crown in North America spearheaded by the likes of Kylian Mbappe, and Benzema is willing to lend a helping hand to the cause. 

Benzema has only featured at one World Cup, the 2014 edition in Brazil. He was ignored by Raymond Domenech in 2010 and remained in exile during France's triumphant 2018 campaign as the fallout from the Mathieu Valbuena sex tape scandal left him out in the cold. When he was finally recalled in 2021 under Deschamps, the return was short-lived. He travelled to Qatar in 2022 but suffered an injury during his very first training session. Subsequently, he left the camp in circumstances that raised eyebrows. Despite never announcing an official retirement, his absence from the national team since then has led many to assume the door had quietly shut.

Yet, speaking to L'Equipe, Benzema made it clear that the notion of him turning down France is simply not true and insisted that football decisions should be governed by purpose rather than politics.

""I'm a football player. So, I play football. When they call me, I come, I play,"" he said. ""I have goals in my head. I love football and I love winning. I like trophies. That's what matters most to me. There, I am in my club. If I am called to the national team, I come to play football. And it stops there.""

Despite everything that has happened, the idea of refusing a World Cup return holds no truth for him.

""It's not a story of no longer wanting to come back to the French team,"" he said. ""But we have to ask ourselves the question: what am I coming to do with the French team? We are talking about a World Cup. Obviously, these are not things where you have to say: 'No, I don't want to.' Because it's a lie to say: 'No, I don't want to play in a World Cup'.""

While Benzema's national-team fate is uncertain, his club future also hangs in the balance. The Frenchman swapped Madrid for Jeddah in the summer of 2023, embarking on an ambitious three-year project with Al-Ittihad. His impact has been immediate. Last season, he spearheaded the club to a domestic double of the Saudi Pro League title and the King's Cup, scoring 25 goals across all competitions and establishing himself as one of the defining figures of the Saudi Pro League's global evolution. His numbers remain largely in line with the output of his final years at the Bernabeu, a testament to his form and fitness. Yet his contract enters its final six months, and speculation over his next move has intensified.

""I'm really focused on what I'm doing, whether it's for these last six months or for after if I extend my contract,"" Benzema said. ""Some people are better placed to talk about all that. Right now, I have six months left on my contract, so I'm completely focused on football.""

Earlier, Benzema had revealed that he still watches Real Madrid regularly, and the Champions League continues to stir a sense of wonder in him. That feeling makes it impossible to rule out any scenario, including a return to Europe. He even revealed that several European clubs have expressed interest. For him, what matters most is choosing a place where he can continue competing at the highest level and feel valued. 

""The best thing for me is to continue here, but also not just stay for the sake of staying for a year or two,"" he told AS. ""I can't do that. I think the level of football in the Saudi league is getting better and better. I've been here for three years now, and it keeps getting better and better. It's true that I have offers from Europe. I have to look at everything, choose wisely, and see where I feel comfortable, without forgetting that I feel good here and receive affection from everyone. But we'll see. They ask me for things, and I give them things. Everything's fifty-fifty, but there are things happening. I'm not going to quit football and stop competing in six months.""

Aurelio De Laurentiis has launched a passionate defence of Jose Mourinho following Napoli's Champions League defeat to Benfica. The Napoli president slammed critics who believe the Portuguese tactician is 'finished', claiming that European football culture seeks to 'bury' winners out of envy, whereas they would be celebrated as icons in the United States.

Napoli's hopes of securing automatic qualification for the knockout stages of the Champions League suffered a significant blow this week as they fell to a 2-0 defeat against Benfica. The result has complicated the Italian side's path to the last 16, forcing them into a precarious position heading into the final matchdays of the league phase. However, rather than criticising his own players or manager Conte, De Laurentiis chose to heap praise on the architect of his team's downfall.

Speaking at the Gazzetta dello Sport Awards, the Napoli president insisted that losing to a team managed by Mourinho should not be seen as a disaster. De Laurentiis has long been an admirer of the former Chelsea and Real Madrid boss, and he used the platform to fire back at pundits and fans who argue that the 62-year-old's powers are waning.

""We can't expect to win every game, also because Mourinho isn't simple to beat,"" De Laurentiis stated. ""Who thinks he is finished says the usual nastiness that is poured against winners.""

De Laurentiis went further, offering a cultural critique of how European football treats its aging legends compared to American sports. The film mogul, who spends significant time in the United States, believes there is a toxic culture of ""envy"" in Europe that seeks to tear down successful figures once they show signs of vulnerability.

He contrasted the treatment of Mourinho—who has faced intense scrutiny regarding his tactical approach and sideline antics in recent years - with the reverence shown to veteran coaches and athletes across the Atlantic.

""In America, the greats are held in the palm of a hand,"" De Laurentiis argued. ""In Europe, they are buried by envy.""

After Benfica's Champions League win against the Italian club in midweek, a spiky exchange unfolded when Conte blamed his side's sluggish performance on a congested schedule, noting Benfica had played on Friday while Napoli played Sunday.

""Saying Benfica were fresher physically feels like an excuse,"" Mourinho responded bluntly. ""We interpreted the game well, I decided to play [Franjo] Ivanovic rather than [Vangelis] Pavlidis upfront and that changed the way we attack.""

While De Laurentiis was gracious in defeat, the reality on the pitch is stark for Napoli. The loss to Benfica means Conte's side have little margin for error in their remaining European fixtures. The Partenopei have underwhelmed in the competition this season, registering just two wins from six matches. That record leaves them 23rd in the table and in danger of falling out of the competition if they stumble in their final two matches against Copenhagen and Chelsea in January. Having seen their winning run come to an end at five games this week, Napoli must now regroup quickly as they return to Serie A duties with an away game against Udinese on Sunday. They are second in the table, sitting level on points with AC Milan, who have a slightly superior goal difference. Meanwhile, Inter sit just a point behind while Roma have dropped to four behind after losing two games in a row.

Benfica, meanwhile, are in an even more difficult position. A point worse off than Napoli, they sit just outside of the play-off places in the Champions League after a hopeless start in which they lost their first four matches. They cannot afford to slip up when they head to Italy to face Juventus in January before rounding off the round with a home game against Real Madrid. Their domestic situation could be better, too, as they trail Liga Portugal leaders Porto by eight points after 13 games.

Wayne Rooney has revealed the lengths that he went to as a youngster in order to express his ""love"" for Everton idol Duncan Ferguson, with the ex-England captain admitting that he ""used to write to him in jail"". Rooney grew up as a passionate Toffees supporter, with no-nonsense Scottish striker Ferguson becoming a cult hero at Goodison Park across two spells.

Ferguson first linked up with the Toffees, initially on loan from Glasgow-based giants Rangers, in 1994. He played over 100 times for the club, scoring 42 goals, before moving to Newcastle. The enigmatic frontman returned to Merseyside in 2000 and found the target on 30 occasions through 140 matches before hanging up his boots in 2006.

Rooney had broken through by then, with his senior bow being taken in at the age of 16 in 2002. He got the chance to play alongside Ferguson before becoming the most expensive teenager in world football when Manchester United came calling in 2004 - with the Merseyside native, who won Premier League and Champions League titles at Old Trafford, going on to become the Red Devils' all-time leading scorer.

Rooney was always a passionate performer on the pitch, with inspiration being taken from Ferguson - who spent time behind bars in 1994 after headbutting an opponent during his spell at Rangers.

Young Rooney overlooked that misdemeanour, telling BBC Sport when asked about his boyhood heroes: ""There was a guy who played for Everton and he actually went to jail. And I was a young boy who supports Everton, so I used to write to him in jail and then he'd write back. And then, four years later, I played alongside him. So for me that was the biggest thing. It was just me telling him how much I love him."" Rooney added on the other stars that he looked up to: ""There's so many and like Ronaldo, R9, for me as well. Just watching him play was incredible. He was like my favourite player, really.""

Ferguson has previously addressed his surprising communication with Rooney, with the future all-time great an unknown youngster when contact was first made.

In ‘Big Dunc: The Upfront Autobiography by Duncan Ferguson, with Henry Winter', the Toffees icon said: “What got me through the long, lonely nights in Barlinnie was that I must have received 10,000 letters. Incredible. I killed time reading them all. Fans wishing me well and, yes, some expressing rather different sentiments.

""A young boy called Wayne Rooney wrote. He must have been only nine or 10. I wrote him back, without a clue who this passionate football fan would turn out to become. (Apparently, Wayne still has the letter today.)

""Some people sent me books – books about pigeons, books about football, books about breaking out of prison. They sent me a blow-up sex doll, which got confiscated! But the letters I treasured most were from Evertonians like Wayne.

""Looking back now, I still can't believe the top brass of Everton – my manager Joe Royle, Club Chairman Peter Johnson and Director Clifford Finch – came to see me. It was really nice of them, brave as well. They came into the waiting room at Barlinnie, and it's like Beirut in there. A total war zone – people bringing drugs, and misery and menace in the air. Having that support from the high-ups at Everton and the fans meant the world.""

Rooney made his own return to Everton in 2017 following a glittering 13-year stint with Manchester United. He spent just one season at Goodison - scoring 11 goals, including one memorable effort from the halfway line against West Ham.

Rooney spent time in management after hanging up his boots, but struggled across spells with Derby, D.C. United, Birmingham and Plymouth. He is now back on punditry duty and preparing to star in a Disney+ documentary series alongside wife Coleen and their four sons - with eldest, Kai, looking to forge his own career as a professional footballer after catching the eye in United's fabled academy system.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Five ATP Challenger tournaments have been honoured as Tournament of the Year in their respective categories. The winner at Challenger 175 level — the biggest category on that circuit — is the BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux.


Challenger 175 Tournament of the Year - BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France
A clay-court tournament held during the second week of the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome, the Bordeaux Challenger naturally draws a standout entry list. This year, all eight seeded players were inside the Top 80 of the PIF ATP Rankings, including eventual champion Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. 


Held at the historic Villa Primrose Bordeaux in southwest France, the Challenger 175 tournament's recognition goes beyond its stacked draw. The BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux is celebrated for its first-class hospitality to players and fans alike.


“We are truly honoured to receive this trophy, which recognises all the hard work put in over the years to grow the BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux tournament,” said tournament director Jean-Baptiste Perlant. “We would like to sincerely thank the ATP, as well as the players who have supported our event.


“I would like to share this with all the staff, volunteers, Villa Primrose's members and partners for their precious help.”

“We are proud and honoured to receive the 2025 ATP Challenger Award,” said tournament director Mohammed Al Sayed. “We see this award as an important milestone in our journey of developing the sport of tennis in the Kingdom of Bahrain.

Challenger 100 - Cranbrook Tennis Classic, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan
The Cranbrook Tennis Classic is the first American tournament to win an ATP Challenger Tournament of the Year award. Won this season by Estonian Mark Lajal, the Bloomfield Hills featured record crowds and firmly established itself as a summer hot spot on the ATP Challenger calendar.


“This award is a testament to the fans, sponsors, and volunteers who make the Cranbrook Tennis Classic so special,” said tournament director David DeMuth. “We are grateful to the players for acknowledging their passion and commitment to making world class tennis accessible to our community. This only motivates us to keep building on the success.”

 For the first time, members of the exclusive ATP No. 1 Club – current and former World No. 1 players – voted to decide two award categories: the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award and Breakthrough of the Year, a new award introduced this year to recognise milestone wins, significant jumps in the PIF ATP Rankings and first ATP Tour titles. 



 2025 ATP Awards Winners 

 ATP No. 1 presented by PIF 

Determined by PIF ATP Rankings 

Carlos Alcaraz 
At 22 years old, Alcaraz has now held the World No. 1 spot for 49 weeks – more than 15 members of the ATP No. 1 Club. He reclaimed the position from Sinner after winning the US Open and has held it for all but one week since. Alcaraz showed great consistency across the season, emerging victorious at two majors (Roland Garros and the US Open), three ATP Masters 1000s (Monte-Carlo, Rome and Cincinnati) and three ATP 500s (Rotterdam, Queen's Club and Tokyo). 

 ATP Doubles No. 1 presented by PIF  

Determined by PIF ATP Rankings 

Julian Cash/Lloyd Glasspool 
In their first full season together, Cash and Glasspool made history as the first all-British team to finish as Year-End ATP Doubles No. 1 presented by PIF. They claimed a tour-leading seven titles in 2025, including five consecutive trophies between June and August in a run of 22 matches unbeaten. 

 Fans' Favourite (Singles) 

Voted by fans 

Jannik Sinner 
Fans' Favourite for a third consecutive year, the Italian opened the year by successfully defending his Australian Open title. Of the 12 tour-level events he competed in, Sinner reached the final in all but two (Halle, Shanghai). He closed the season on a 15-match winning streak with titles in Vienna, Paris, and at the Nitto ATP Finals, finishing as World No. 2 with a 58-6 season record. 

 Fans' Favourite (Doubles)

 Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award 

Voted by ATP No. 1 Club 

Carlos Alcaraz 
The Spaniard claimed the honour for the second time. One of his standout sportsmanship moments came at Roland Garros this year, where he called a foul on himself in his fourth-round clash against Ben Shelton. From 2004-21, only Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal received the award, with Federer winning 13 times and Nadal five. 

 Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award

Andrey Rublev 
After launching the Andrey Rublev Foundation in 2024 to support children facing critical illness, Rublev expanded his efforts throughout the 2025 season. Earlier this year, the foundation announced a partnership with Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital in Rome. Rublev visited the hospital ahead of the ATP Masters 1000 tournament to spend time with medical staff and patients. He has also spoken candidly about mental health and the importance of seeking help, featuring in an ATP Originals documentary, ‘Breaking Back', to discuss his personal struggles. 

 Past winners of the award include Roger Federer, John McEnroe, Andre Agassi, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. 

 Coach of the Year

Rafael Nadal announced Friday that he recently underwent hand surgery.

“Looks like I won't be able to play the @AustralianOpen 2026 😂,” Nadal wrote. “I had to undergo hand surgery because of an issue I'd been dealing with for a long time, but I hope to be fine soon 🤗”

The F1 Rookies' Season Review

A chaotic Cooldown Room end of season quiz

Both Ferrari drivers reached the points in Abu Dhabi, with Fred Vasseur hoping that momentum will carry into the winter break.

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur believes the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was ""not a bad weekend"" as both Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton reached the points in the final race of the season.

Leclerc managed to finish just off the podium in P4 having challenged champion-elect Lando Norris throughout, while Hamilton climbed from a disappointing P16 on the grid to P8 by the chequered flag at the Yas Marina Circuit.

""Overall this weekend is not a bad weekend,"" said Vasseur reflecting on events at the season finale.

""We had a very tough start on Friday, good recovery, good work from the team and the factory to recover and have better pace on Saturday.

""Good pace in the race, we are matching with Norris but it's not today we miss something, it's this weekend on Friday.""

It brings to a close a difficult season for Ferrari, one where the Italian team failed to win a single Grand Prix and finished only P4 in the Teams' Championship, 435 points behind champions McLaren.

This is in stark contrast to 12 months ago, when the team entered the final race in Abu Dhabi with the chance to win the Constructors' title before just losing out to McLaren.

A huge regulation overhaul next season brings the prospect of a different pecking order, with Vasseur stressing the importance of finishing strongly in 2025 ahead of the winter break.

""I think it's good to finish on the positive note but, at the end of the day, we know also that next year we are all completely blind [on who is the favourite],"" he said.

""We know what we are doing but we don't know what the others are doing and at the end it's just a matter of comparison.

""Let's refocus on ourselves, let's push until the last day and the last day will be the beginning of the season.

""It will be another challenge but we have to refocus on ourselves once again. This is important.""

The F1 Rookies' Season Review

A chaotic Cooldown Room end of season quiz

With the 2025 Formula 1 season now in the past, we're asking you to choose your favourite race of the year. Get voting below!

A title race that went down to the wire, a brand new champion and gripping twists along the way – the 2025 Formula 1 season gave us everything we hoped for and more.

As we embarked on our latest trip across the globe, F1 fans have been treated to one of the closest seasons ever over 24 thrilling rounds. Who can forget the dramatic wet opener in Melbourne, or Max Verstappen's remarkable overtake on his way to victory in Imola, or Nico Hulkenberg's long-awaited first F1 podium on his 239th start?

To top it all off we've had an exhilarating title battle to follow across the year. Oscar Piastri looked to have the early advantage, before Lando Norris roared back to assume the lead, while Verstappen's late-season momentum almost saw the Red Bull driver complete the comeback of all comebacks. In the end Norris became F1's 35th World Champion in Abu Dhabi by just two points.

As we reflect on the 2025 season we're asking you to choose your favourite race from the past year. Is it that chaotic Australian opener, or could it be another eventful Sao Paulo Grand Prix as Norris won while Verstappen made it onto the podium from the pit lane? There's so much to look back on.

Get voting in the poll below and let us know!

“If we want the public to trust what they see, we must have guardrails on digital replicas and synthetic creations,” said SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.

Business Writer


	New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed two bills Thursday to boost AI transparency in the film industry. 


	The first requires entities who produce or create an advertisement to disclose whether the ad includes AI-generated synthetic performers, while the second requires consent from heirs or executors if a company wishes to use the name, image, or likeness of an individual for commercial purposes after their death. Gov. Kathy Hochul described these as “first in the nation” policies and committed to continuing protecting performers.

	“We will have responsible AI policies in the state of New York,” Hochul said at a press conference at the SAG-AFTRA offices in New York City Thursday. 




			Related Video		







	“It's a time where we do want to embrace innovation,” she continued. “But not to the detriment of people. That has to be the dividing line right there.” She went on to call the use of AI actors in advertisements “fake entertainment.” 


	The Governor hosted a signing at the SAG-AFTRA offices in New York, surrounded by union executives as well as former president Fran Drescher, national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Linda Powell, executive vice president of SAG-AFTRA. 


	The bill signing came the same day Disney announced a partnership with OpenAI in which users of its AI video creation platform Sora will be able to create clips using iconic characters from Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars franchises. Disney CEO Bob Iger said Thursday that the Sora deal will not include voices, potentially delaying a fight over using actor's voices. The news loomed large in the room, with Chief Labor Policy Officer Rebecca Damon pointing to the announcement and saying the union is thinking about AI every day. 

	











	Crabtree-Ireland, chief negotiator in the most recent SAG-AFTRA negotiations, where AI was a major sticking point, did not speak directly to the Disney deal, but pointed to the union's wider policy in relation to the New York bills. 


	“If we want the public to trust what they see, we must have guardrails on digital replicas and synthetic creations,” Crabtree-Ireland said, adding that the union refers to them as “synthethic figures” rather than “synthetic performers.”  


	The union later issued a statement saying it will “closely monitor the deal” to “ensure compliance with our contracts and with applicable laws protecting image, voice and likeness.”


	“We acknowledge Disney's and OpenAI's independent outreaches to us on this matter and their assurances that they will meet their contractual and legal obligations to performers and continue to implement systems to ensure ethical and responsible use of this technology,” the union said in statement. 


	“This comes after months of frank discussions between SAG-AFTRA and OpenAI about the protection of performers. The ongoing dialogue reflects a significant commitment to taking SAG-AFTRA members' concerns into account in the protective measures applied to image, likeness, voice, performance, and intellectual property rights generally,” the statement continues. 


	SAG-AFTRA had previously established guardrails against the use of OpenAI's Sora 2 in October, after the invite-only release used actor Bryan Cranston's voice and likeness in some of the outputs, without his consent or any compensation. OpenAI then said it was strengthening its guardrails around the replication of voice and likeness, and already requires an opt-in policy. 

	











	“I'm glad that OpenAI has committed to using an opt-in protocol, where all artists have the ability to choose whether they wish to participate in the exploitation of their voice and likeness using A.I. This policy must be durable and I thank all of the stakeholders, including OpenAI for working together to have the appropriate protections enshrined in law. Simply put, opt-in protocols are the only way to do business and the NO FAKES Act will make us safer,” SAG-AFTRA President Sean Astin said at the time. 


Dec. 11, 7:30 p.m. Updated to include SAG-AFTRA's statement on Disney.

The six-episode limited series releases on the streamer Jan. 8, 2026. 


							By 

	Lexi Carson


Associate Editor


Jon Bernthal and Tessa Thompson try to uncover the truth in the new trailer for Netflix‘s psychological thriller, His & Hers.


	Released on Thursday, the upcoming six-episode limited series sees Detective Jack Harper (Bernthal) and Anna (Thompson) investigate a murder — but also accuse each other of murder. Additional castmembers include Pablo Schreiber, Crystal Fox, Sunita Mani, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Marin Ireland and Poppy Liu. 




	“I didn't hurt her, Anna. Do you know who did it?” Jack asks. Anna responds, “I didn't do it, if that's what you're asking.”

	Anna later says, “There are two sides to every story. Ours and theirs. Yours and mine. His and hers. Which means someone is always lying.”


	Here is the official synopsis: “Set in the sweltering heat of Atlanta, Anna lives in haunting reclusivity, fading away from her friends and career as a news anchor. But when she overhears about a murder in Dahlonega — the sleepy town where she grew up — Anna is snapped back to life, pouncing on the case and searching for answers. Detective Jack Harper is strangely suspicious of her involvement, chasing her into the crosshairs of his own investigation.”


	The series, from Fifth Season, is an adaptation of the 2020 Alice Feeney novel of the same name. William Oldroyd and Dee Johnson serve as co-showrunners.

	











	Executive producers include Thompson, Oldroyd, Johnson, Kristen Campo for Campout Productions; Jessica Chastain and Kelly Carmichael for Freckle Films; and Kishori Rajan for Viva Maude.


His & Hers drops on the streamer Jan. 8, 2026.

	Billboard cover star ROSÉ looks back at her journey from growing up in Australia and wanting to sing like Beyoncé to making history with her Grammy nominations for her Bruno Mars collaboration “APT.” Plus, she dives into the creation of her solo project ‘Rosie' and what it was like jumping back into BLACKPINK following her solo success.


	ROSÉ:


	Never in a million years would I have thought that this would happen, to be nominated for a Grammy. It means a lot that “APT.” is the one that is being celebrated so much. I'm really, really grateful, and with it like shook don't even know what to say. We were radio people. My dad would have the radio on all the time. And because Australia, like LA, everything's far away — like, everything's 30 minutes away. So we'd always have the radio on. And so I grew up listening to all of that. Britney Spears was on the radio all the time. Madonna was on the radio. I think I was definitely influenced by a lot of pop, I love pop music. When I grew up, YouTube was where I started to listen and watch all these musicians, and naturally, the very beginning of me like starting to sing and play instruments was after I watched ‘Dreamgirls.' I remember watching Beyoncé sing “Listen” and being like, “Oh my God, I really want to be able to sing that.” I am. Yes, and I like printed it on, like, the chords on paper, and I would play it and sing at the top of my lungs. Simultaneously, my sister, because we are Korean, she was very interested in our culture. She had been consuming a lot of Korean music and musicians, and and that's when K-pop was around as well. That's how I got to absorb that thing. It all just was a mixture of things as I am and as I have always been.

'Damascus' features the talents of Syrian artist Omar Souleyman and New York rapper and singer Yasiin Bey.

	Lars Brandle



Gorillaz swing into our lives once again with “Damascus,” another new track from their forthcoming album, The Mountain.


	Dropping at the stroke of midnight, “Damascus” is a proper international adventure. 


	The exotic cut was recorded in Damascus, London, Devon, Mumbai and New York, and features the talents of Syrian artist Omar Souleyman and NYC rapper and singer Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def), both of whom are credited as songwriters, alongside Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn.


	Fans got the jump on “Damascus” when it received its live debut at Gorillaz's surprise performance of The Mountain at London's Copper Box Arena in September, ahead of spots at Madrid's Gaia Festival and Together For Palestine at Wembley Arena, when the beloved “cartoon band” was joined on stage by the London Arab Orchestra.

	The collection is described by reps as “an expansive sonic landscape of instruments and sounds, richly layered with voices, melodies and addictive beats,” and boasts an impressive lineup of collaborators and several voices “of friends” that have passed, including Bobby Womack, Dennis Hopper and Mark E Smith.


	“Damascus” is one of 15 songs on The Mountain, which collects previously-released songs “The God of Lying” (feat. IDLES), “The Manifesto” (feat. Trueno and Proof) and “The Happy Dictator” (feat. Sparks).




	Gorillaz will support the release with The Mountain Tour, which gets underway with two warm-up shows in Bradford, England on March 13 and 14 before opening night, March 20 in Manchester. The tour will visit arenas across the U.K. and Ireland, plus a one-off headline show at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday, June 20, for the band's biggest show in their homeland to-date, with support from Sparks and Trueno. European festival slots will follow next summer.


	Gorillaz last released a new album in 2023 with Cracker Island, which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, their fifth top 10 appearance. Cracker Island was nominated for best alternative music album at the 2024 Grammy Awards.

The podcaster noted that her husband Jason's silence during Trav's comments said it all.

	Every couple fights. That's just a fact. Well, every couple except Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, apparently. A week after the Kansas City Chiefs tight end claimed on his New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce that he and Swift have “never once” fought in their two and a half years together, Jason's wife, Kylie, has weighed in.

	During Thursday's (Dec. 11) episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, Kylie responded to fan questions about how she feels about her soon to be sister-in-law's apparently argument-free relationship. “Notice how my husband was oddly quiet during this segment,” Kylie said. “He did ask a couple of clarifying questions. But for the most part, his ass knew that he could not say that after almost eight years married… We absolutely argue.”

	After spilling the truth, Kylie — who shares four daughters with the retired NFL great — clarified that the couple don't argue that often, “but we've definitely argued, for sure.” She then tried to parse whether Travis and that episode's guest, George Clooney, were talking argument or, like, argument argument. 


	“To be fair, I'm not a yelling arguer. So the arguments in our house, they're not a yelling situation,” Kylie said. “I just think that if you're married, you live together, specifically if you have children, you're potentially having some sleepless nights. You might have varying degrees of patience with certain situations with your kids.” 

	











	Travis' comments came after Clooney said he'd never clashed with his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, in the 10 years they've been a couple. When the two-time Oscar winner and Jay Kelly star then asked if Travis and Swift ever quarreled, the three-time Super Bowl winner replied, “Well, it's only been two and a half years, and you're right. I haven't gotten into an argument. Never once.”


	Bottom line: Kylie isn't buying it. Not from Clooney and not from Travis. “You're telling me you don't bicker or argue? Or maybe you do bicker, but you don't argue? I'm very confused about this,” she said, adding, “to George Clooney's credit, I would not argue with Amal either. Absolutely not. I would be right behind her like, ‘Yeah. Get them, what she said. I'm with her.' Whatever she says, we ride at dawn.”

EXCLUSIVE: Television's steamiest Heated Rivalry is just getting started.


	We can reveal Canadian streamer Crave has greenlighted a second season of LGBTQ+ ice hockey drama, with HBO Max again boarding for rights in the U.S. and Australia and now striking deals with program distributor Sphere Abacus for more territories.


	The Warner Bros Discovery-owned streamer has tapped series for Season 1 and Season 2 rights for Europe (excluding the UK, Ireland, Spain and Turkey), Asia and Latin America, and Neon/Sky New Zealand is also returning for Season 2. The HBO Max agreement is Asia spans Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, Macau, Sri Lanka and Nepal.

			Watch on Deadline		







Heated Rivalry, about a pair of top professional hockey players who secretly develop a romantic relationship that lasts over the years, quickly established itself as a flagship show for Crave and has been hailed by several reviewers as among the most significant LGBTQ+ shows on television. We've been tracking it closely since it was announced at the Crave Upfront this year and named it a show to watch at MIPCOM Cannes in October, where Sphere Abacus introduced the show to international buyers.


	The steamy drama is now Crave's biggest original series on record, growing its viewership by nearly 400% in initial seven-day streams following its debut two weeks ago on Friday, November 28, per mParticle and Amazon Channels internal data.

	It has emerging as a cultural lightning rod in Canada and has been a social media sensation across North America and Europe, with fan edits, reaction threads and behind-the-scenes clips flooding feeds across platforms. The buzz began early, with Heated Rivalry a top three trending topic on X in hockey-mad Canada during its premiere weekend. The final episode is due to drop on Friday, December 26.


	More international deals are expected soon, as buzz continues even in territories where the show isn't yet available. We understand several buyers in the UK have been chasing Heated Rivalry, with a deal looking imminent.


	Created by Canadian writer-director-producer Jacob Tierney (Letterkenny, Shoresy) and based on Rachel Reid best-selling book series Game Changers, the six-episode, one-hour romantic drama tells the story of rival hockey players Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie).

	They are two of the biggest stars in Major League Hockey, tied together by their ambition, rivalry and a magnetic pull neither of them understands. They begin a secret fling as rookies that morphs into a long journey of love, denial and self-discovery over the next eight years. They're forced to decide if there is room for love in their fiercely competitive world. 


	Earlier this week, my colleague Glenn Garner spoke with leads Williams and Storrie about the newest episode on Season 1, titled “Rose.” The pair leads an ensemble cast that includes François Arnaud as Scott Hunter, Robbie G.K. as Kip Grady, Christina Chang and Dylan Walsh as Yuna and David Hollander, Sophie Nélisse as Rose Landry, and Ksenia Daniela Kharlamova as Svetlana.


	“Heated Rivalry represents the very best of what Canadian creators can deliver: rich characters, compelling drama and a world audiences want to live in,” said Justin Stockman, VP Content and Programming at Crave parent Bell Media. “The response has been extraordinary, and seeing the series now travelling internationally is an incredible milestone.”


	In a statement, show creator Tierney and executive producer Brendan Brady added: “Watching our show become an international phenomenon has been extraordinary. We're profoundly grateful to everyone that has been on this journey with us. Being renewed for a second season so early is a true honor, and we can't wait to bring you even more of what you love.”


Heated Rivalry comes from Tierney and Brady's Accent Aigu Entertainment in association with Crave, with the participation of the Canada Media Fund and the Bell Fund. Tierney is writer, director, producer and executive producer, with Brady the producer and executive producer. Lori Fischburg is producer and book writer Reid is consulting producer.


	For Bell Media, Alison Korogyi is Senior Production Executive, Original Programming; Sarah Fowlie is Head of Production, Original Programming; Adam Feigen is Development Executive, Scripted Original Programming Rachel Goldstein-Couto is Head of Development, Original Programming; Brian Blazik is Head of Bell Media Sales, Sphere Abacus; Carlyn Klebuc is General Manager, Original Programming; and Stockman is Vice President, Content Development & Programming.


	The series is distributed internationally by Sphere Abacus, which is owned by Canadian producer Sphere Media and the primary distributor of programming from Bell, which is also a stakeholder in the UK-based company.

	











	Accent Aigu Entertainment is repped by CAA & 3 Arts. Their attorney is Jayme Alter of Dentons Canada LLP.

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


HBO Max has teased what audiences have to look forward to in 2026 with a promo that debuts never-before-seen footage from some of its most highly anticipated new and returning series including Euphoria Season 3, House of the Dragon Season 3, and Lanterns.


	“A few years after high school, I don't know if life was exactly what I wished,” Zendaya's Rue Bennett says as glimpses of each of the lead characters — Lexi Howard (Maude Apatow), Maddy Perez (Alexa Demie), Nate Jacobs (Jacob Elordi), Cassie Howard (Sydney Sweeney), Jules Vaughn (Hunter Schafer) and, of course, Rue — flash across the screen.

	The music stops as Rue walks into a club and a man (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), sitting in a booth surrounded by women, says to her, “You walk up into my house and you don't even introduce yourself.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Deadline previously reported that Akinnuoye-Agbaje is a new series regular who is “a ruthless kingpin.”


	As for House of the Dragon, Alicent (Olivia Cooke) declares: “Rhaenyra will do what she has to do. And what she has to do will be dire.”


	The Lanterns footage also gives the true first look at Kyle Chandler and Aaron Pierre as Hal Jordan and John Stewart in the DC series, from Ozark's Chris Mundy, Watchmen‘s Damon Lindelof, and comic book writer Tom King.


	“I trained my entire life for this,” Pierre's John pleads from the passenger seat as Hal (Chandler) drives down a dirt road. Hal responds: “You're not ready to get up in front of the class until the ring says you are,” before setting the Power Ring on the dashboard and rolling out of the car as it goes flying off a cliff.

	











	In addition to those titles, the promo features glimpses at the latest seasons of Dune: Prophecy and The Comeback. Other new series that were teased include DTF St. Louis, Rooster, Untitled Larry David Project, Half Man, Stuart Fails to Save the Universe, and War. Plus, there's a few clips from the two-part documentary Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!


	There are also plenty of other titles featured in the trailer, though those clips have already shown up elsewhere. Additional titles to come in 2026 are returners Industry, The Pitt, Hacks and The Gilded Age as well as the latest Game of Thrones spinoff A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

					By Nancy Tartaglione 

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


Walt Disney Animation Studios‘ Zootopia 2 will hop past the $1B mark worldwide with today's business included. The global box office total through Thursday is $986.1M. Of that, $232.7M is from domestic and $753.4M is from the international box office. The Jared Bush/Byron Howard-directed sequel will be the second studio movie to $1B in 2025 (following Disney's Lilo & Stitch), and becomes the fastest ever to $1B among all Hollywood animated films as well as all PG-rated titles — getting there in just 17 days.


	Crossing the threshold also marks the first back-to-back billion-dollar releases for Walt Disney Animation Studios, following last year's Moana 2. The studio now counts five billion-dollar titles since 2013: Frozen, Frozen 2, Moana 2, Zootopia and Zootopia 2.

	











	“Everyone at Disney Animation put their heart, soul and passion into this film to tell a story full of joy, imagination and incredible thoughtfulness,” said Bush, Chief Creative Officer, Walt Disney Animation Studios. “This milestone means the world to us, because more than anything, it means audiences are coming to theaters for a shared experience of watching this movie on the big screen, everyone together, from all walks of life around the world – and that is a Zootopia dream come true.”

	Buzz is building for Paramount Pictures and Legendary's Street Fighter. 


	A teaser of the video game adaptation starring Noah Centineo, Andrew Koji, 50 Cent, Jason Momoa and wrestlers Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes, has dropped at the Game Awards, and a helluva lot of action is on display.


	Set in 1993 and helmed by director Kitao Sakurai, the movie version of the hit game sees estranged Street Fighters Ryu (Koji) and Ken Masters (Centineo) thrown back into combat when the mysterious Chun-Li (Callina Liang) recruits them for the next World Warrior Tournament: a brutal clash of fists, fate, and fury. But behind this battle royale lies a deadly conspiracy that forces them to face off against each other and the demons of their past. And if they don't, it will be game over.

	











	The splashy adaptation's teaser was on display at the Game Awards, which took place last night at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. Star presenters included Centino, Momoa, Orville Peck, David Dastmalchian and Liang, who debuted the teaser along with handing out the award for Best Ongoing Game to No Man's Sky.

Sydney Sweeney denied rumors that she has undergone breast augmentation surgery while taking a lie detector test with her “Housemaid” co-star Amanda Seyfried.

“There's been a question on everybody's minds recently, and I just have to ask, are your boobs real?” Seyfried asked during a segment with Vanity Fair published Thursday.

“Yes,” Sweeney said while laughing. “I've never gotten any work done anywhere.”

The outlet's lie detector proctor confirmed that the “Euphoria” star, 28, was being “truthful.”

“Can I touch 'em?” Seyfried, 40, joked.

“Sure,” Sweeney playfully responded.

The “White Lotus” star responded to plastic surgery rumblings for the second time this week after being questioned during an interview with Allure.

“Let's debunk them all,” she said. “I mean, I have never gotten work done … I am so scared of needles, you have no idea.”

While chatting with Variety in October, Sweeney also shared her plans to “age gracefully.”

When discussing the speculation about her looks, the actress shared that it wasn't fair to be compared to a photo of herself when she was 12 years old.

“Of course I'm going to look different. I have makeup on now and I'm 15 years older,” she said.

Sweeney also confirmed that she didn't have any tattoos.

Elsewhere in the interview, the “Anyone But You” star addressed how fans think they know her based on the diverse characters she plays on screen.

“So when people think, ‘Ah, she's a sex symbol,' or ‘She's leaning into that,' I'm like, ‘No, I just feel good and I'm doing it for myself and I feel strong,'” she explained.

Sweeney shared that her goal is to “inspire other women to be confident and just flaunt what they got.”

Taylor Swift teared up in her new “End of an Era” docuseries while reflecting on the darker moments from her record-breaking tour.

In episode one, an emotional Swift addressed the thwarted terrorist plot that led her to cancel her three scheduled Eras stops in Vienna in August 2024.

“I thought this would be a tour I would be proud of. It's like a force to be reckoned with in global culture. So, never in my life did I think we would have a terrorist plot,” Swift said during a sit-down interview in London, where she would be resuming the tour mere days after the threat.

Noting that this isn't her first concert, she tearfully admitted, “But this was the first one I feel like – I don't know – I'm skating on thin ice or something. We've had a series of violent, scary things happen to the tour. Like, we dodged a massacre situation and so I've just been kind of all over the place.”

“We dodged a massacre situation,” she reflected.

Adding even more weight to the UK shows was the horrific July 2024 stabbing at a Swift-themed dance party in Southport, during which three young girls were killed and 10 people were injured.

Following the tragic attack, the singer reached out to the victims' families to express her condolences and invite them to her London shows.

In the doc, the singer had to take a break as she burst out into tears because she was having “a hard time explaining” the stabbings.

Advertisement

After noting that she would not cry while meeting the families, she promised, “I swear to God. I'm not going to be doing this; I'm going to be smiling, so any of this gets out of the way before you ever go on stage.”

Comparing her job of entertaining 60,000-plus-person crowds to that of an airplane pilot navigating turbulence while keeping passengers calm, Swift said that if she shows any signs of anxiety or alarm on stage, her fans might panic too.

Advertisement

A professional, she said, “For three and a half hours, they don't have to worry about you. It's like you're a pilot flying the plane and if you were like, ‘Oh, there's turbulence ahead, I don't know if we're going to land in Dallas, like I'm going to try hard, but I don't know if I can figure out how to land through this turbulence.' Like everyone on the plane is going to freak out. You just have to have a cool, calm, collected tone …” 

The “Lover” songstress also reflected, “I've been performing for 20 years. From a mental standpoint, being afraid something's going to happen to your fans at any moment. This is a new challenge. I want to keep all the nerves I have away from the crowd because when you're sort of the ringleader of this show, they can sense any kind of shift energetically in you and you have to really focus and factor that in – you're at the Eras Tour and nothing is wrong!”

During the same episode, Swift attempted to soothe “a physical reaction to [her] nerves” by unwinding backstage at Wembley Stadium with an audiobook and a check-in from her mom, Andrea.

As Page Six reported, two people were arrested in Vienna last August for planning an attack on one of Swift's concerts in the Austrian city. She subsequently cancelled all three concerts in Vienna due to safety concerns.

Swift, 35, addressed the foiled terror plot weeks later, telling Swifties that the whole thing was “devastating.”

“The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows,” she wrote on Instagram on Aug. 21, 2024.

“But I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives.”

Advertisement

She also explained why it took her a few weeks to break her silence on the matter.

“Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows,” Swift said. 

Advertisement

“In cases like this one, ‘silence' is actually showing restraint, and waiting to express yourself at a time when it's right to. My priority was finishing our European tour safely, and it is with great relief that I can say we did that.”

The first two episodes of “The End of an Era” are available to stream on Disney+.

Ethan Hawke candidly shared regret over his daughter Maya Hawke's “really hard and complicated” upbringing.

“There were a lot of things about her childhood that were really, really hard and complicated, and things I regret for her,” Ethan told Sydney Sweeney during their “Actors on Actors” conversation with Variety, which was released on Thursday.

While he neglected to share how her childhood was difficult, Ethan, 55, admitted that he knew Maya would grow up to “be an artist” when she was just 4 years old.

“I knew that she was gonna be a very good one,” the “Black Phone” star shared. “That was her safe place, watercoloring, dancing, singing all throughout her childhood.”

“Anything that had to do with human communication was something she vibrated to,” he said, reflecting with pride on his daughter's wise beyond years knowledge. 

“I remember some teacher said, ‘Maya, are you happy?' Cause they were worried about her. And she said something to the effect of, ‘Do you really think that's the question?'”

“I thought, ‘I love this kid,'” he continued. “She was about 13. [Maya said] ‘I don't think that's a very interesting question. I think there's a lot more interesting questions than whether I'm happy or not. Am I happy? No. But I don't aspire to be happy.'”

Maya would go on to prove her father's hunch correct as she grew up to star in major hits like Netflix's “Stranger Things” and Quentin Tarantino's “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” 

She's also set to star in the forthcoming films “One Night Only,” “Wishful Thinking” and “The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping.”

In addition to Maya, 27, Ethan is also dad to son Levon, 23 — whom he also shares with ex-wife Uma Thurman — and daughters Clementine Jean, 17, and Indiana, 14, whom he welcomed with current wife, Ryan Shawhughes.

As Ethan neglected to explain the hardships his daughter faced, the “Dead Poets Society” star has also purposefully avoided discussions on his high-profile divorce from Thurman in 2005.

However, the actor revealed why he doesn't publicly talk about his breakup from Thurman, citing his children as the reason. 

“I can't really talk about this because I vowed to my kids so many times not to talk about the divorce in public,” he said in November while discussing how he feels divorce is “hard” because of “the family elements.”

Move over Martha Stewart? 

Chef Gordon Ramsay has partnered with Dr. Dre and Stewart's bestie, Snoop Dogg, on a new HexClad cocktail shaker developed with the rappers' Still G.I.N. liquor brand.

Ramsay started the year collaborating with Pete Davidson on a HexClad Super Bowl ad. 

He's ending it by teaming up with the rap legends and longtime collaborators on a commercial for the booze, just in time for the holidays. 

In the ad, Ramsay raps along to “Gin and Juice,” the hit Dre produced for Snoop's 1993 debut album, “Doggystyle.”

“Sippin' on gin and juice. Laid back,” Ramsay raps in his British accent. “I got my mind on money. Money on my mind,” he added, prompting Dre to encourage him to “stick to cooking.”

We're told the fun actually started behind-the-scenes. Ramsay memorized the lyrics to the track, “and rapped the entire song for [Dre] during the shoot. Everyone was cracking up, especially Dr. Dre,” a source said of the British chef's rapping skills.

Insiders revealed Dre and Ramsay met at a private Holmby Hills estate the night before the shoot, and bonded over swimming?

“It was their first time meeting in person and Ramsay brought Dre smart goggles to track his laps,” a source told Page Six.

In exchange, Dre gifted Ramsay's daughter a signed copy of his debut album “The Chronic.”

(Coincidentally, Ramsay opened his first restaurant within a year of the album's release). 

Snoop is heard, but not seen in their new promo. The “Doggystyle” rapper shared his vocal talent by recording the voiceover for the commercial.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","A haunting and hilarious Pluribus stresses ""The Gap"" between Carol and Manousos","https://www.avclub.com/pluribus-recap-season-1-episode-7-the-gap","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Here's something to consider: All we ever really know about television characters is what their creators choose to show and tell us. So maybe it's not fair of us to make snooty judgments about the choices they make—even though it's only natural to do so.

In Pluribus, for example, we know a little bit about Carol Sturka's tough childhood; but we also know that, as a successful author, she's led a life of relative privilege. Conversely, we know almost nothing about Manousos Oviedo, except for where he's from (Paraguay), what he did for a living (storage-unit manager), and his general attitude toward the alien takeover of humanity (extremely hostile). It's fair to say that we are being led to assume that Carol has had an easier ride in life—and in her post-apocalypse—than Manousos has.

But is that assessment fair? I genuinely don't know. I only know what I've been shown and told, which is just enough to find the contrast between their experiences incredibly funny—at least as they're presented in this week's perfectly titled episode, “The Gap.” It's funny, that is, until—inevitably—a gloom descends.

Before I get into the finer details of this very fine episode, let's take a moment to appreciate the level of craft that went into “The Gap.” Director Adam Bernstein and screenwriter Jenn Carroll are the credited creative team here, and they—along with the rest of the Pluribus crew—have adeptly handled a difficult challenge.

With the exception of two short monologues—both in Spanish—there's not a lot of talking in this episode. Carol mutters to herself occasionally, sings to herself a lot, and places a few calls to the Joined. Manousos repeats phrases in English that he's heard on language-lesson tapes. Otherwise, their stories are told almost entirely in images. All of the hallmarks of the Pluribus visual style—the exaggerated framing that makes the whole world feel out of whack, and the fleeting flashes of unsettling everyday horror—are put in service of delivering narrative.

It's two narratives, really. The more dramatic of the two—as well as the more visually stunning and exotic—is the one with Manousos. As I hinted at last week, Manousos's apparent plan to travel to Albuquerque without the help of the Joined was bound to run into a snag once he hit the Darién Gap (the gap!). That stretch of land is infamously impassable. Sure enough…he can't pass it.

In what amounts to an extended montage, we see him driving up through picturesque South America, siphoning gas along the way (and always leaving money behind to pay for it) and trying to ignore the occasional smiling hive-mind pods. He talks only to one guy, who is trying to warn him away from crossing the Darién, offering instead to transport him—and his car—to New Mexico quickly and safely. Manousos coolly tells the aliens they can't give him what they don't own. He considers them all to be thieves.

When Manousos hits the Gap, he burns his car, sets out on foot with his machete, and hacks his way through the wilderness. But, unsurprisingly, he eventually loses his footing on a loose rock, before falling backward into a spiky, bacteria-laden chunga palm. The Joined have to send in a rescue helicopter.

It doesn't take long to summarize what happens to Manousos in this episode. That's why it's so impressive, the time and effort that went into shooting these scenes. We get a real sense of how long and how arduous this journey is for someone who stridently refuses the collective's help. He has to collect rainwater in empty cans, because he won't drink their water. He sleeps in churches. He catches fish in streams. He's remarkably self-sufficient. Watching Manousos do his thing for the 20 or so minutes he's onscreen this week is like watching a gripping survival drama compressed into a mini-epic. 

Because Vince Gilligan has never been big on cutting restlessly back and forth between storylines and characters, the Manousos sequence is seen in full, flanked by two Carol sequences. In the first, beginning on Day 12, Carol drives back from Vegas and starts taking a new approach to bossing around the Joined—not desperately or indignantly, but instead kind of snottily. She goes on golf outings, visits a hot-springs resort, tours the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, and demands gourmet meals. She never sees the collective, who still steer well clear of her. But they're definitely helping to facilitate her self-indulgent spree.

The starkest example of the gap—the gap!—between Carol's and Manousos' experiences comes early in the episode, when she stops at a gas station and realizes that all of the snacks and drinks have been removed. She calls for a Gatorade (“the red kind… ice cold… real sugar”) and scratches off some lottery tickets while waiting for the telltale buzz of the delivery drone. She then calls back to complain that the Gatorade's “tepid.”

One person gets impaled on spikes. The other endures a disappointing sports drink. Nobody knows the troubles they've seen.

After the Manousos sequence, we return to Carol on Day 48. Initially, she seems to be living the same life of solitary slackerhood. Before, we saw her drinking beer and setting off fireworks. She's still doing all of that, and still working on her golf swing, too, rocketing balls from downtown rooftops into office building windows. (The wanton destruction, I have to admit, looks very cool.)

But in the gap—the gap!—in Carol's life immediately post-Vegas and 36 days later, something has changed. She's stopped singing, instead relying on a boom box and mix CDs for her soundtrack. And she doesn't seem to be taking any pleasure in the decadence any more. In a scene legitimately as alarming as Manousos's chunga wound, Carol notices that one of her firework tubes has toppled in such a way that it's pointed directly at her. Rather than setting it upright, she faces it and waits.

The firework misses her, shooting past her head and torching a nearby house. But the incident seems to jar something within Carol. The next day she picks up a bucket of paint and writes “come back” in big white letters on her cul-de-sac's pavement.

This sets up the moving conclusion to a wild episode, as Zosia drives up to Carol's house and Carol collapses into her arms, sobbing. What struck me about this ending is how it turns the usually fun Pluribus game of “think along with Carol” on its head. It's hard to know what's going through her mind as she heads off to the hardware store. And because we don't see her painted message until the very end, it's hard to predict what she's going to do when Zosia arrives. She approaches slowly, hesitantly…almost ominously. And then: tears.

I keep thinking about the O'Keeffe painting, Bella Donna, that Carol takes from the museum to replace the poster she has on her wall of that same piece. While she waits for Zosia, we see her staring at Bella Donna impassively. It's easy to imagine her returning to that painting, day after day, using it as a kind of tether as the weight of loneliness begins to tug at her sanity.

Again: I don't know. I don't know Carol, really. I only know what I've been shown and told. Just enough to empathize, intensely.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","NYC passes landmark laws to tentatively start regulating AI use in ads and films","https://www.avclub.com/new-york-passes-ai-laws-kathy-hochul","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 01:12:00 GMT","

A big part of the Wild West (with less water) vibes surrounding Earth's current AI bubble has come from the way governments have been trying to keep the hell out of the whole thing, at least until the dust has settled. Although the EU passed laws last year setting up a framework for regulating artificial intelligence use, American lawmakers have been way more reticent, with legislators looking nervously to the Supreme Court, which has yet to hand down any truly definitive rulings on any of the thousand or so issues pertaining to copyright, fair use, outright theft, dead people's faces being used as digital puppets, etc., that crop up around this technology.

Now, New York has taken a step toward being one of the first states in the nation to attempt at least a bit of regulation on the topic, with Governor Kathy Hochul signing a pair of bills on Thursday designed to bring some small measure of accountability to companies using AI to generate video content. One focuses specifically on ads—sorry, McDonald's—which will force any commercial featuring “AI-generated synthetic performers” to be accompanied by a disclosure. A second law focuses on using famous people's virtual corpses to shill products or pop up in films: It “requires consent from heirs or executors if a person wants to use the name, image, or likeness of an individual for commercial purposes after their death.”

Neither of these laws feel particularly sweeping or ground-breaking, if we're being honest; there are already statutes on the books about likeness rights, and asking companies to run a tiny disclaimer if they want to generate up some homunculi to fill out the back of a Starbucks feels like a pretty tiny ask. But they do represent a state government stating, definitively, that it can regulate this stuff, something the federal government has so far notably declined to do. It was a big enough deal that Hochul announced the signings from the offices of acting union SAG, where she was accompanied by negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland and former union president Fran Drescher—both major figures in the 2023 strikes that saw the union battle, not wholly successfully, to get AI guidelines into its contract with studios. Alluding briefly to today's Disney/OpenAI news, Hochul noted that regulations weren't intended to curtail innovation: “We do want to embrace innovation. We really do. It's who we are as New Yorkers. It's what makes us so fabulous and so great. But not to the detriment of people. That has to be the dividing line.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","There's not quite enough John Carpenter in John Carpenter's Toxic Commando","https://www.avclub.com/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-preview","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

There are few bigger names in horror filmmaking than John Carpenter, and for good reason: from Illinois suburbs to Antarctic research bases, his films can make just about any place or premise instill dread, tension, and often disgust (ie, that part in The Thing where Copper gets his arms bitten off as he very unsuccessfully delivers CPR). Beyond his career in filmmaking, Carpenter has also expressed an interest in video games, and while this has mostly been limited to admiration from afar, he's contributed to soundtracks and consulted on games like F.E.A.R. 3 (which he also narrated) in the past.

This context makes the prospect of the upcoming co-op zombie shooter John Carpenter's Toxic Commando a bit more exciting, because at least on the outside, this doesn't seem to be a Tom Clancy situation where the name on the tin doesn't mean much. Carpenter is credited as both the game's writer and composer. So this begs the question: just how much John Carpenter is in here?

The short answer is that outside of its synth-laden soundtrack and pulpy action-horror premise, not much. At least through the first few hours of Toxic Commando (which we went hands-on with via a preview), the game works as a great reminder for how auteur theory mostly doesn't apply to bigger-budget video games. The complex, interdisciplinary process of making one (alongside other factors like large budgets that discourage creative risks) ultimately makes it unlikely that one person can single-handedly guide the creative process from the director's chair. And while this FPS has a few distinguishing elements in its own right that slightly separate it from the many other four-person co-op games about blasting zombies, Carpenter's singular direction isn't one of them—honestly, how could it be in this kind of online-focused affair where the expectation is that you'll be bantering with buddies instead of paying attention to dialogue and cutscenes?

If nothing else though, the setup for the plot is certainly in his wheelhouse. Four mercenaries sign up for a job that takes them to a quarantine zone that was the site of a mysterious disaster. Before long, they find out why this area was sealed off when they're suddenly accosted by waves of shrieking former humans infected by a black goo. Hey, it's a bunch of zombies. They hold them off for a bit, but ultimately come down with this plague and are given a week to live, tops. To stop this illness from spreading and escape alive, they'll need to team up with the man responsible for accidentally letting this thing loose in the first place, a vain rich dude who was trying to drill to the center of the Earth in search of renewable energy, as vain rich dudes tend to do.

All of that sounds perfectly Carpenter, whether it's commandos being deployed into a walled-off nightmare zone to complete a job (Escape from New York), human-consuming organisms (The Thing), or critiques of callous corporate elites (They Live), but the reality is that this serviceable spin on a Left 4 Dead-style co-op shooter doesn't quite bring enough new to the table to entirely stand out.

As for its format, you and up to three allies proceed through semi-open-ended levels to complete objectives, all while blasting very large numbers of zombies in the dome and collecting graded resources that can be used to upgrade your arsenal (this part is strikingly similar to Helldivers 2). Shoot various types of monsters and battle tar-covered tendrils while completing objectives like defending power generators and finding decryption keys.



It's pretty standard stuff, but thankfully, there are a few differences from Valve's influential duology and its imitators. For one, your crew has superpowers. As a side effect of the infection, the members of your team gain unnatural skills: the ability to shoot fireballs out of their hands, a defensive shield, a healing sphere, and a killer drone. These function a bit like the powers in a hero shooter, and while the cooldowns are a bit too long to fundamentally alter the experience, it's hard to say no to the satisfaction of launching an explosive ball of plasma into a horde of foes.

Another major distinction from most other zombie shooters is that this one truly, genuinely loves trucks. Like, a lot. In the tutorial mission, you become acquainted with a beefy four-wheel drive outfitted with a heavy machine gun, a harpoon used to rip down doors and gates, and a healthy dose of Mad Max regalia like plate armor and spikes. Then you're encouraged to pilot this bad boy through crowds of bodies, some of which will dive onto the windshield or grab hold of a door until you're able to give them a good shake (or a double tap). The levels are designed around these vehicles, whether it's navigating the elements, like thick mud that puts engines to the test, or how you need to chart pit stops for resources like gasoline and bullets to keep your ride running. These vehicles have a solid weight to them, and the way they interact with environmental obstacles like thick muck, uphill slopes, and, most of all, freaky undead monsters adds a physical, tactile quality to being behind the wheel.

Making good use of these vehicles is particularly important because if you don't, it's easy to become overwhelmed: another area where Toxic Commandos goes a bit past the co-op shooters of yesteryear is that new tech lets it throw even more zombies at you at once. In the opening setpiece, you drive through a sea of undead, as untold thousands of bodies churn in the background before trickling into an abyss like a putrid waterfall. While this segment slightly oversells how many attackers you'll be dealing with during dedicated gameplay sections, even outside of this showy intro, there are times when there will be an uncomfortable number of creepy guys running at you full tilt. Related to this, the highlight of the entire preview was a defense mission that involved holding out against a seemingly endless assault, as the sheer volume of these foes inevitably results in some slipping through the cracks and piling up on the bolted doors you're supposed to be protecting—the scale can be quite impressive, and it's helped by mechanics, like the ability to set up barbed wire and electric traps ahead of time, that make this feel like a last stand.

But while a few aspects here are at least slightly different than its predecessors, the game still can't quite escape a fundamental sense of déjà vu. The weapons you choose from are a variety of barely distinguishable assault rifles that would feel at home in any given military shooter (granted, these aren't real ones licensed from gun manufacturers that intentionally or not advertise AR-15s to teenagers, so that's an improvement). At least so far in the preview, there weren't any wacky contraptions that would feel fittingly pulpy for a game with both “John Carpenter” and “Toxic Commando” in the title. Where are the flamethrowers, nonsensical sci-fi weapons, and most important of all, the inexplicable shuriken?

Even more boilerplate are the progression systems which have all the trademarks of an RPG-ified gaming landscape. There are skill points that deliver thrilling boons, such as a marginal walk speed increases, weapon levels that very slowly increase to grant more attachments, and rifles that glow with rarity indicators like Borderlands. And while the script was apparently written by Carpenter, it feels barely distinguishable from any number of multiplayer-focused action games with forgettable characters and only the thinnest possible pretense to get out and start blasting, something not helped by unremarkable cutscene direction.

Perhaps the most fundamental issue, though, is that pulling the trigger doesn't feel as satisfying as it could. To be specific, it takes a strangely long time for your character to aim down the sights—Call of Duty may be jingoistic propaganda, but damn, the original Modern Warfare really changed this genre forever with its absurdly snappy aiming. Being outdone by an 18-year-old game is not great, especially considering that shooting is the central thing you'll be doing here. The feedback on weapons feels decent (as in, it's satisfying when zombie heads blow up like watermelons), and there's a real tension as your bullets fail to break the next incoming wave, but hopefully, this area improves before the game launches next year.

Regardless, it's easy to imagine at least a few Carpenter-heads will be disappointed that this game isn't something a bit more in his wheelhouse: a survival horror title, an Until Dawn-style choose-your-own-adventure, or really any form of exclusively single-player experience that could build some real ambiance (you can play this one solo, but it's abundantly clear it's meant for co-op). I'm sure just as many have grown cynical about X person's name being on a thing, but considering Carpenter's name is in the credits, it's not unreasonable to have expected a bit more of his style. Judged (perhaps more fairly) by its own merits, the game is a competent enough cooperative zombie shooter with a few unique hooks, like your magic sludge powers and (more literally) your big dumb truck's hook-harpoon gun. It's the type of thing which could quite plausibly keep a friend group busy for a few weekends. Unfortunately, like its B-movie premise, Toxic Commando seems like the kind of game that may have been best saved for a Blockbuster rental.

Ryan Coogler's Sinners will almost certainly be in heavy attendance at the Oscars when they roll around next year, with Coogler's stylish, personal Southern vampire flick already topping lists of expected nominations. But Coogler himself won't be involved in the voting, on account of having turned down an invitation to the Academy way back in 2016. Not, he clarified in a recent interview with The New York Times, out of any animosity toward the Oscar-granting body. But because the man just isn't into passing judgement on other filmmakers' work.

“I'm not good at judging things, bro,” Coogler said in a new Times profile centered on his very good 2025. “The act of ‘Hey, pick the best thing' is very stressful for me, even when there's no stakes involved.” There are, honestly, a lot of directors where we might call bullshit on this—the overlap between people breaking their backs to make movies, and people who like to talk shit about other movies is pretty strong, as Quentin Tarantino has made a pointed note of in recent weeks. But it feels genuine coming from Coogler, a guy who manages, in every interview we've ever read or heard of him, to consistently sound like the world's most humble man, even as he posts an increasingly long and uninterrupted string of box office successes.

THR notes that this isn't the first time Coogler has given commentary about his decision to turn down the invite, which arrived shortly after he directed Creed back in 2015. Back in 2021, he made clear his disinterest in pitting films against each other, and noted that, time being limited, “If I'm going to be a part of organizations, they're going to be labor unions, where we're figuring out how to take care of each other's families and health insurance.” In the Times piece, Coogler noted that, while he tries to get enjoyment out of the awards cycle, it's just not what interests him about making movies. “Most days, I'm wearing coveralls and Columbia gear, trying to find solutions that aggregate up to a story,” he said. “And that enabled me not to engage with any narratives around what it is that we do.”

“Teen Mom” alum Kailyn Lowry shared “really, really sad news” about a beloved family member with her fans.

The mother of seven, 33, took to Instagram on Wednesday, December 10, and revealed that her dog, Buddha, was diagnosed with cancer.

In the video, Lowry sat down in front of the camera as she was getting ready for the day. The former reality star appeared to be holding back tears as she announced the sad news.

“I come bearing some really, really sad news to share with you,” Lowry began. “My dog Buddha has cancer.”

The MTV personality revealed that she got Buddha while pregnant with her fourth child, Creed. Despite Buddha being an older dog, Lowry still treats him like a puppy.

“I know sometimes bigger dogs will get, like, fatty lumps,” she continued. “[He] personally has never experienced the fatty lumps. So I take him to the vet […] and she [the vet] didn't think anything was wrong.”

However, at Buddha's follow-up check-up, Lowry pointed out that one of the fatty lumps attached to his wrist was very tight and close to the bone.

She was later referred to a vet in Pennsylvania, where Buddha was officially diagnosed with cancer.

Lowry revealed that surgery isn't the best option, noting that it'd be incredibly difficult for Buddha to recover from it.

“Because it's so close [to the bone] it would actually probably be a harder time healing after the surgery than it would be if we just sort of left it alone,” the “Teen Mom” star continued.

Lowry gushed about how Buddha is “such a good dog” and that “everyone loves [him].”

Right now, Lowry focuses on making sure that Buddha is “super comfortable” before his time comes. She also asked fans for comfort tips in adult dog life care.

Fans flooded the comments with love and well-wishes for Lowry and Buddha.

One fan wrote, “Sending you so much love and sending that handsome boy love and smooches.”

Another commented, “My friend's Pit Bull got diagnosed with Cancer, and they opted not to do the surgery, and he lived another 5+ years. Enjoy him and just know that he could be around for a lot longer than you think, Mama.”

Someone added, “Cane corso's are the BEST!! Don't know what I'd do without mine. Sending love.”

Jenny Marrs is sharing an emotional message she hopes will help others. As the Marrs family continues to grieve following a heartbreaking year of loss, the HGTV star finds comfort in these powerful words.

On December 8, Marrs took to Instagram to share a powerful message from years ago that still speak to her today.

“Eight years ago, I shared this photo and these words,” she wrote in the caption. “My weary heart needed to read them again today and maybe someone else's does too … “

The photo showed a Christmas tree ornament featuring a photo of her daughter Sylvie. “As I sit by the glow of the tree, steaming coffee in hand, reading about hope and fear and faith … I glance up, right into these eyes,” Marrs wrote.

She continued, “My Sylvie girl … the ornament we hung years ago, with aching, hopeful, anxious, longing hearts. Our first Christmas with a daughter across an ocean. We didn't know of the fight in front of us. We didn't know the days of waiting would turn to months and the months would turn to years. We only knew God called us to say yes to this little girl, yes to an unknown path, yes to hurting and pain and loss and boundless love.”

The HGTV star noted, “He also continually whispered the words I read again just this morning before looking up to the tree and this ornament, ‘Don't be afraid. Just trust me.' (Mark 5:36b)”

Marrs shared her hope that this simple reminder could help her fans in some way. “I don't know what you're facing today, as we enter the season of Advent and walk toward Christmas Day,” she wrote. “But I know when you are grieving or longing for healing or waiting for your baby or hurting deeply, this season can be harder than most.”

Marrs shared, “It can be a reminder, not of the Hope we look to, but of the one miracle or unanswered prayer just out of reach. If you're in the pain, desperate for Hope, hear His words again: Don't be afraid. Just trust me.'”

She concluded with a note about faith and hope. “He is faithful and trustworthy. His story for us is never our story for us but it is always good,” Marrs shared. “He has a plan and a purpose and every tear and every moment of waiting and hurting will someday be redeemed. Maybe this side of eternity, maybe not. But someday, it will all be made new. That is the Hope we can cling to.”

The comments section was flooded with messages from fans who praised Marrs for sharing the important words.

“Look what a beautiful young lady she has turned into. All you faith, love and hope you have changed her world. So blessed,” one fan noted.

Another commenter wrote, “Beautiful! Thank you so much for this important reminder. I needed it today. God bless you and your beautiful family!”

“These words brought tears to my eyes,” one fan shared. “Been going through a whole lot and being reminded of God's words helps. Thank you.”

Others wrote, “A beautiful reminder of God's plans and His faithfulness” and “Thank you for sharing. I needed to read this today.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Ryan Paevey Goes Instagram Official With New Love","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/ryan-paevey-girlfriend-instagram-official-2025/","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 16:00:47 GMT","

Ryan Paevey has been full of surprises in 2025. After announcing he was stepping away from acting in 2024, the Hallmark Channel alum made a surprise return to the small screen in September, re-emerging on the soap opera where he began his career, “General Hospital.”

That's a change that has thrilled his fans, but the surprise he shared on December 11 left many unsure how to feel, as the “Unleashing Mr. Darcy” star appeared to go Instagram official with a new love in his life. Posting ahttps://www.instagram.com/p/DSIyo6kEWmJ/ photo of himself kissing her cheek, Paevey wrote, “Happy born day babe….luff you. : )”

In his December 11 post, Paevey tagged the birthday girl in question, visual artist Kiley Missere. According to her social media feeds, Missere is a Canadian-based abstract painter who loves to travel — much like Paevey. She shared on Facebook in October that she was rebuilding her art website and starting a “new chapter.” 

While many fans congratulated Paevey on his good news, plenty of others expressed dismay that he was off the market. 

Over 200 liked one comment that amusingly said, “Soooooooo our imaginary relationship is…..over? 🥲”

Multiple fans responded to the comment that they felt the same way, including one who wrote, “lol. Same thought process! I guess we're all surprised to see! Good for you Ryan!”

Another weighed in, “🙁😢 yes ! I feel the same here 😢 although…I'm happy for him ❤️❤️❤️”

Lots of people shared how happy they were for Paevey, including fellow Hallmark alum Cameron Mathison, who left three heart-eyes emoji in the comments. 

Someone else wrote, “I'm so happy for you, you've finally found someone who captured your heart ❤️ of gold🥰🙏🏾 Congratulations & best wishes to you both🥰🥰🥰”

Paevey and Missere have plenty in common, from their love of travel and the tropics to their creative pursuits. Paevey started a YouTube series this fall dedicated to his surfing adventures, and he continues to create jewelry for his Fortunate Wanderer website.

The actor has also been making time to meet his fans again, starting with a small gathering in southern California that he organized over the summer. In July, he also attended his first fan convention in several years at Christmas in a Small Town, held in Dahlonega, Georgia, with plans to return in 2026. 

I'm not to thrilled 😒

Thank God you have a new love. May God Bless your relationship. I am very happy for you.

Good Luck! Wish you all the best.Glad to hear you are back soon.

CONGRATULATIONS Ryan. I'm So Happy for You & Your New Love.

Congrats!

When the teaser for “Chrome Alone 2: Lost in New Jersey,” a new short film starring the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, was released, an early complaint on the internet was a brief moment where tech-savvy Donatello consults with ChatGPT on what to get father-figure Master Splinter for Christmas. Cries of character assassination that the super smart Donnie would have to ask an AI algorithm for advice could be found all over Twitter.

As it turns out, Donnie's flirtation with ChatGPT isn't just a throwaway; it's the whole plot of the delightful short, which pits the Turtles against Chrome Dome (voiced by Zach Woods), an AI menace using generative AI to rip off the Turtles' likeness and sell ripoff toy versions of them for profit. Like a lot of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” media, the short has its tongue firmly planted in cheek, but it also sends a strong message that AI isn't capable of what human creativity can manage.

“Chrome Alone 2,” which will play in theaters before screenings of “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants” later this month, is the directorial debut of animator Kent Seki, who served as the head of cinematography on “Mutant Mayhem,” the acclaimed 2023 film that introduced this era of TMNT. Seki, a longtime fan of the characters who collected their comics as a kid, said he initially joined the first film Ramsey Naito, former head of Nickelodeon Animation, connected him with the director Jeff Rowe. Seki had met Naito when he worked on “Boss Baby” in 2017, and told her he wanted to eventually direct; she kept that in mind, and offered him the chance to take on the short soon after “Mutant Mayhem” production wrapped.

 










“I've been trying to direct since 2007,” Seki told IndieWire in an interview. “This short film came up, and she found a place for me on it as a director. And it really was through her goodwill and her belief in me that this all happened.”

Below, Seki talks with IndieWire about making the short, tackling the topic of AI through “TMNT,” and how films like “Uncut Gems” and “Panic Room” influenced his directing process.  

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. 

IndieWire: This film explores the intersection of generative artificial intelligence and art. Why did you want to tackle the subject, which is obviously very topical right now, through the turtles?

Seki: For the last three to four years, we've been hearing and seeing the rise of generative AI, like it's all around us. And for anyone that works in a creative industry, it creates a lot of anxiety about what this means for us? You hear things that you're going to be replaced. You see these tools and they are impressive, at the same time, you see some of their limitations and their downfalls. And there's a lot of hyperbole about what it's going to do, so it ended up being a case that doing a film around AI allowed us to channel and funnel all of that anxiety into the film itself. It ended up being extremely productive for us, when we really decided to focus on AI, it informed all the art styles that we used in it. It informed the writing. I was surprised when the teaser came out, how much people agreed with the sentiment. It was an interesting moment to watch something you made a year ago be more relevant now than it was when we made it. We were afraid, actually, a year ago, we were like, “well, this doesn't come out for a year. Maybe this discussion will be over by then.” If anything, it's become even more topical.

 










Can you explain a little more what you mean about how AI informed the visuals and writing?

If you look at the live-action commercial, for example, even the live-action kids have extra fingers. The notion was that everything's off by a little bit, there was this feeling that we wanted to be everything to be a little bit odd, right? It has this gauze of nostalgia over it that like a retro commercial. We went through and treated the footage to make it look like it was shot off of a videotape. We did the little things that make the turtles more commercial in the sense of their giant muscles and crazy veins sticking out of them.

In the backstory Chrome Dome tells the turtles, the writing is a combination of several franchises. There's a moment in which Chrome Dome encounters a magical being that's a combination of Handsome Squidward, Thanos, the Navi from “Avatar,” and Dr. Manhattan, all made into one character. Even in the scoring, I went to our composer Disasterpeace and said “Imagine this is a piece of diegetic music that the turtles are hearing, that everyone in the movie can actually hear, and that Chrome Dome has created because he believes his own backstory.” The fundamental thing about a liar, is they believe their own lie, and he would have listened to all these amazing Hans Zimmer scores and then made his own version like that, but worse. He went to town with that and made this epic score that's kind of overblown. In the sound design from Mark Mangini, he went through and found sound effects from the actual IP that we were riffing on and parodying and peppered that in. Every department was adding to that storytelling and using AI as the punching bag for our feelings about it.

 










The commercial you mentioned nods back to the franchise's heyday in the '80s and '90s. How did you film it?

We originally had them going into the store and handling the toys themselves, but story artist John Jackson said, “you could have a commercial in the window that we would watch.” And I thought that's a great idea, but we can't afford to do that, and we couldn't afford to do that in CG. But we hired this great company, the Brothers Chaps in Atlanta, and basically we contracted them out to make it. We had to be hands off on it. And they got the prototype toys from the toy company and made this commercial. That's one of the things that we wanted to sort draw on, was this idea of using nostalgia as a weapon to draw in parents to buy toys. The turtles have a long tradition of toys, right? That's a lot of people come to that this franchise through the toys, and to use it as a meta narrative, to say something about AI at the same time the franchise itself and the corporatization of an indie comic, we thought was a very clever way of, sort of taking making a nod to all of these different things that the film has in it.

The short begins with Donnie asking ChatGPT a question about gifts to get Splinter. By the end, after fighting Chrome Dome, he deletes the app. Why did that make sense for his character.
 










I know it was controversial that Donnie used ChatGPT [Laughs]. I think what it comes down to is the turtles created by Jeff Rowe and Seth Rogen are authentically teenage. Teenagers are naturally curious, and they experiment with all these things. So it made sense that in their moment in their lives, that would be something that they would experiment with. It was in contrast to the ceramic mug that Mikey made. Do you make something by hand, this lovingly crafted, the ugly mug, or do you rely on this technology to tell you what to give your parent for Christmas? That's the contrast. If you're a parent, you've received that mug in some shape or form and loved it, even though it has many flaws. And sometimes I would say the flaws make it lovable. Or do you go with the answer that technology gives you, right, and which is sort of the easy answer, and I think that's the contrast we're drawing there. Having Donnie learned that lesson throughout the short doesn't mean he rejects technology, but that he can leave with this healthy skepticism of technology.

How did you think of making the short visually distinct from “Mutant Mayhem”?

That was driven by our Art Director, Garrett Lee, who was really interested in sort of finding a new a new look in it that expanded upon what we did in Mutant Mayhem. One thing we did was we shot with two frames of a focal length longer to try and stack the frame, stack the image with as much New York as possible, so that the Turtles, who ended Mutant Mayhem being accepted into society, would now be part of society. We took a lot of inspiration from the Safdie Brothers and “Uncut Gems,” if you can believe it for that opening bit. We looked to it as something that we wanted to do to make it feel more New York, because the Safdies know how to shoot New York. They are amazing at it. We also drew upon David Fincher's “Panic Room” for when they are breaking into the toy factory, And then for the end fight, we looked at James Cameron's “Avatar.” So we had all these cinematic touchstones that we sort of looked at for inspiration, to help influence how we were making the film.

 










The title is a reference to “Home Alone.” Did that come up as a reference during production?

I think that the physical comedy definitely has roots in “Home Alone.” There was a moment in which we were trying to figure out what the title of the movie should be. We were in a lighting review. And there was concern if we want to have Christmas in the title, and we're like, “I don't know if that feels right for this” but it should evoke feelings that people have of Christmas. And I think it was, I think it was Woodrow White, the character designer, or Garrett Lee, the art director. One of them said, “Chrome Alone 2” and the other added “Lost in New Jersey.” That became the genesis of that title, and it felt right, because it's exactly the sort of thing that we're talking about, in terms of a blatant rip off of something else.

There's a sequel to “Mutant Mayhem” scheduled for 2027. Have you started work on it?

Yes, right now, I am working on the sequel as the head of cinematography, and I'm excited about it. It's a dream team of people. Jeff is a master director to work with, and it's really fun. And I can't wait for people to see it. You have a long time to wait. Hopefully this short film tides you over a bit.

“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Chrome Alone 2 — Lost In New Jersey” will premiere in theaters with “The Spongebob Movie: Search for SquarePants” on December 19.

This year must have been one hell of a ride for Nate Amos. He kicked off 2025 touring his official solo debut, 2024's acclaimed Box for Buddy, Box for Star. Barely three months later, he and Water From Your Eyes bandmate Rachel Brown dropped the also-acclaimed It's a Beautiful Place. Not even a week out from the conclusion of that tour, Amos brings us Holo Boy, his second LP as This Is Lorelei. One imagines he wouldn't have had time to breathe, much less to go through his extensive back catalog and re-record 10 highlights—but somehow he did.

And while Amos' efforts to flesh out his selection of early cuts are valiant, what's most impressive about Holo Boy is how breezy and self-assured it sounds. Few of these songs were intended to live together originally, but it still feels like Amos is coasting in a sweet spot; his sense of humor and ear for hooks shine through. Might as well call it Now That's What I Call Lorelei!

Holo Boy specifically revisits Lorelei tracks dating from 2014-2021, a period when Amos was mostly spitballing EPs and singles on Bandcamp; back then, Lorelei was more like a “demo idea sandbox,” in his words, than an official solo project. But as Lorelei evolved and gained traction, Amos wanted to reexamine his older material in a new light. Where Box for Buddy intentionally experiments with varied production styles, Holo Boy takes a more holistic, integrative approach to reimagining earlier tracks. Both the tinny, slowcore-influenced sounds (like the title track) and straight-up power-pop tunes (“But You Just Woke Me Up”) become bolder and shinier as Amos cranks up the vocals and guitars and places his songwriting center stage.

He's got ironic deflection down to a science, knowing when to tug the heartstrings and when to snip them (remember “But a loser never wins/And I'm a loser, always been”?). Holo Boy's languid, swaggering reinterpretations bring a new confidence to the humorous self-effacement that's endemic to the Lorelei universe, even suggesting Amos' compassion for the person he was at the time he originally recorded them. On the original “I Can't Fall,” quavering strings and breathy falsetto imbue a jaunty melody with unshakeable anxiety; on this re-recording, though, Amos croons in his lower register, and the orchestral swell, richer than ever, pulls the Beach Boys lever. Fuller guitars and clearer vocals on “Dreams Away” bring vital force to a song that previously conveyed mostly resignation: Singing “I've been sleeping all my life/And now I gotta wake up,” he sounds actually excited about the prospect.

Some tracks don't get as drastic a makeover. “SF & GG” and “Money Right Now,” both originally from a 2021 single, benefit from a couple instrumental flourishes that reveal more twinkle behind the eyes, but they sound fuzz-shorn rather than wholly revamped. “Mouth Man” is arguably the one song that shouldn't have been cleaned up: The distorted, atonal vocal melodies, piano chords, and inexplicably awesome clanging that created such tightly controlled chaos in the original feel slapdash when they're sanded down.

But when Amos hams it up, it just works: On lead single “Name the Band,” originally a jangly, lightweight affair, he puts some bass in his voice and beefs up the boy-band guitars to head-bopping effect. And by letting his voice come to the forefront of “This Is a Joke,” the blasé act falls to the wayside in lieu of undeniably charming vulnerability.

Holo Boy doesn't go out of its way to experiment or provoke, but its emphasis on reinterpretation is strangely moving, particularly at this point in Amos' career. He's spoken at length about his recent sobriety, about reevaluating his expectations for his solo work, and about how, pre-Box for Buddy, he approached Lorelei as something like a tongue-in-cheek study on singer-songwriter tropes. On Holo Boy, Amos sounds like he's found genuine joy in taking This Is Lorelei seriously: ready to poke fun at being a singer-songwriter and to whole-heartedly affirm its importance.

Fabiano do Nascimento plays guitar with laser-guided precision, landing clusters of arpeggios and fretboard-spanning chord changes with pinpoint accuracy. The Brazilian American composer and guitarist prefers close-mic'd recordings, zooming in to highlight his agility but making his dizzying proficiency sound as natural as breathing. He spent years as a Los Angeles session musician before starting his solo career in 2015, using his virtuosic knowledge of the afro-samba and choro traditions as a launchpad into uncharted stylistic territory. Even at his most complicated, do Nascimento leaves plenty of air around each note, giving every pluck and strum enough padding to remain crisp and legible.

That understanding of space makes Cavejaz one of his most inviting and inventive works. Everything feels cavernous, from the massive Panda Bear-esque bass hits in “Auguas Serenas” to the synthesizer pads that loom over his jittery finger picking in “Berimba-Guitar.” There's a healthy amount of reverb coating these songs, but rather than wash it all into a colorful blur, it sharpens each element, adding a slight sparkle. Overtones blossom at the edge of the stereo field; echoing tails overlap, forming wispy clouds of harmonics. do Nascimento and his collaborators keep the instrumentation minimal but find ways to intertwine and amplify their impact, creating enveloping arrangements from only a handful of sounds.

do Nascimento recorded Cavejaz in three distinct sessions. The first took place at a studio in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, with producer Leo Marques and percussionist Paulo Santos, a founding member of Brazilian experimentalists Uakti, famous for building their own instruments from materials like PVC pipe and metal. The rest of the album was recorded in Japan, excerpting a live performance with tabla maestro U-zhaan in Tokyo and adding tunes from a solo session in the coastal town of Oiso. Despite its globetrotting origins, the collection hangs together surprisingly well, often playing like the result of one long, inspired jam session. As technically gifted as do Nascimento and his guests are, their greatest asset is intuition; no one overplays, augmenting what the other is doing and pulling back when there's a risk of stealing the spotlight.

Unlike much of do Nascimento's previous work, these compositions don't feel completely demarcated, beginning in media res and circuitously exploring rather than developing linearly. They can be repetitive and hypnotic or buoyant and meandering. In most tracks, do Nascimento introduces a theme and pokes at it from all angles, finding ways to either bolster or deconstruct it. In “Olhos Luz,” ido Nascimento loops a simple figure, letting it repeat while U-zhaan assembles a patient groove. As the piece saunters forward, his soloing feels playful and curious, circling around the refrain and issuing occasional volleys of notes or syncopated accents. It all works to magnify the repeated phrase, building to a payoff in which he briefly doubles it before an abrupt ending. It's an artful way to structure a song, bending jazz toward kosmische to create a flurry of movement while essentially staying still.

The gentle, dreamy tracks on Cavejaz sometimes threaten to blend into a diaphanous haze. But do Nascimento and company are adept at finding the unique textural capabilities of their instruments, creating vivid moments that save it from becoming a smooth, if pleasant, ambient drift. On “Tranquilo” (with U-zhaan), do Nascimento uses a pitch-shifting delay to turn his guitar runs into Alice Coltrane-like glissandos; on “Trilobita,” Paulo Santos plays percussion that sounds like a djembe producing Moog sine waves; Jennifer Souza's breathy, wordless sighs drift beneath do Nascimento's glassy eighth notes on “Maracatú.” The stunning solo cut “Novo Dia” is bathed in plate reverb, a performance so closely recorded that you can hear his fingertips lifting from the frets. All of this makes Cavejaz feel like a capstone to do Nascimento's deep and adventurous catalog, building from the glistening New Age sensibilities of records like Das Nuvens and Mundo Solo, the jazz leanings of The Room, and the hushed intimacy of Olhos D'água. Sweeping and quietly immersive, it's the sound of restraint as a tool for expansion.

At the beginning of the year, Jane Remover told Billboard they had thrown away an entire album of proper pop tracks: “If it came out,” they explained, “I was going to be, like, main pop girl. And I didn't want that.” Even if a bit self-aggrandizing, the claim doesn't seem too far-fetched. They had first found a taste of fame with hyperactive pop mutilations, and even their subsequent pivots towards soupy digital shoegaze or pulverizing rage-pop-rap didn't halt the 22-year-old's ascent into cult stardom. Now, after their most prolific and prominent year yet, Jane Remover offers a small taste of that pop record. Full of perfect hooks and fresh dance-inspired beats, the six songs on ♡ back up Jane Remover's claims as a master crafter of pop songs.

♡ highlights Jane Remover's ability to translate their wide-ranging tastes into wildly imaginative pop packages. “Magic I Want U” takes a loose Think break and peppers it with euphoric synths and VST guitars; it feels equally indebted to '90s freestyle artists like Lisa Lisa and Alisha and aligned with buzzy pop peers like underscores and Quadeca. “Music Baby” is built around a romantic Jersey club groove—and not the mainstream abstraction of Jersey club that's run amok in recent years, but a far more accurate homage to protogenitors like DJ Tameil and DJ Tim Dolla. When artists invoke that famed kick pattern these days, it often feels like fishing with cheap bait, but Jane Remover's adaptations make “Music Baby” feel more sincere and passionate.

Jane Remover has never been afraid to jack a recent trend or two, though. “Flash in the Pan” begins as a queerification of Cash Cobain's insatiable sexy drill groove, but then collapses into a pit of noisy digital shoegaze. The reggaeton influence on “How to Teleport,” though, sticks out like a sore thumb, failing to gel as well as the regional club influences on other tracks. The EP slows to a halt with “Dream Sequence,” an alt-rock meditation that reworks old material from their own indie-rock project as venturing. The track is a tasteful palette cleanser reminiscent of digi-centric rock artists like Parannoul, even if the lethargic shoegaze feels like it's coming from a bygone version of Jane Remover.

♡ is full of delicious moments that feel like biting into a rich chocolate-covered strawberry: the falsetto runs at the end of “Magic I Want U,” the subtle “rock ya hips” sample littered throughout “Music Baby,” or the impressive use of scratching across the whole EP. Songs about partying with your crush are nothing new, but Jane Remover delivers theirs with a playful juvenility that makes the emotional expression on ♡ feel novel. The EP's indulgent sound and thoughtful embellishments make you wonder what new spin on radio pop might result from getting Jane Remover in, say, a Tate McRae or KATSEYE writers room.

More than half of the EP's songs are tweaked versions of older material: In addition to “Dream Sequence,” there's reworked versions of “Magic I Want U” and “Flash in the Pan,” and a slightly extended version of “How to Teleport.” Across the board, the changes are noticeable but minimal. There's no major updates to their vocals or production, just a replaced sample here and a tiny coda there. “Nooo I miss when it sounded like shit,” Jane Remover wrote in a since-deleted tweet about the new version of “Magic I Want U.” But even if that were true, it doesn't feel like the small patch is doing much upheaval. These versions aren't going to win over any new fans, but the changes aren't significant enough to dampen the quality of the material, either. (The original versions are still widely available, anyways.) It makes you wonder: Why do this at all?

Thanks to the living nature of digital music, maybe the answer is simply “because they can.” Jane Remover has long been interested in all the various ways music can be released, tinkered with, re-released, or even deleted in the digital era. Earlier this year, for example, they released an entire mixtape of rage rap on SoundCloud, then took it down after a few hours. Jane Remover's fans have made fun out of hunting down and sharing the old versions of their songs, like a community of digital Deadheads trading Google Drive links and buried YouTube playlists like bootleg tapes. There will be a line where the interesting thought experiment of reinventing old tracks turns into the awkwardness of refusing to let material live out its own lifespan. But until the day Jane Remover deletes a new opus and opts to release the 15th rework of “Magic I Want U” because it still sounds “like shit,” it doesn't seem like their tinkering with the past will prevent them from living in the present.

Credited to Together for Palestine—the British-based operation that put on a major benefit concert in September—“Lullaby” is a cover of the traditional Palestinian song “Yamma Mweel El Hawa,” which Peter Gabriel has adapted from an English translation. The Palestinian musician Nai Barghouti arranged and recomposed the song with Shards' Kieran Brunt. Watch the accompanying video below.

Upon the song's announcement, Eno said in a press release that they were aiming for the United Kingdom's coveted No. 1 spot on the Christmas singles chart. “After a year defined by unimaginable loss, grief and injustice, we want to end with an act of love for Palestine's children,” he said. “‘Lullaby' reflects their beauty, their longing and their hope. If we rally together and download it, we have a real shot at landing Christmas No. 1—and turning that moment into vital life-saving support for Gaza's families.”

Barghouti added, “This lullaby from our Palestinian musical heritage has been with me since early childhood. Today, it returns at a much-needed time as a reminder of what Palestinians will never lose: hope, defiance, beauty, and dignity.”

Kieran Brunt, Benji B, and Henri Davies produced “Lullaby,” which also features Amena, Lana Lubany, Leigh-Anne, London Community Gospel Choir, Sura Abdo, Tyson, Yasmeen Ayyashi, and Ysee. All proceeds go to Choose Love's Together for Palestine Fund, which supports the Palestinian-led organizations Taawon, Palestine Children's Relief Fund and Palestine Medical Relief Service.

Pooh Shiesty has shared his first song since being released from prison in October. The TP808-produced “FDO” is out now alongside a homecoming-themed music video directed by Cotto0verdidit. Watch it below.

The Memphis rapper shouts out a number of contemporaries in the song's sprawling, single verse, including Lil Wayne, former collaborator Lil Durk, and Kendrick Lamar. “If my Drac' jam on me, we beefin', I'ma turn Kendrick Lamar,” he raps.

In 2021, soon after the release of Shiesty Season, Pooh Shiesty was arrested after an alleged altercation at a Miami nightclub. At the time, he was already facing robbery and firearms charges stemming from a 2020 incident in which he and two associates allegedly shot and robbed two people. Pooh Shiesty eventually pled guilty to one federal count of conspiracy to possess a firearm and was sentenced to five years in prison, of which he served three.

				Kehlani's ‘Folded' reigned over a standout year for R&B

T
his year, Kehlani turned 30 after spending more than a decade flying — and at times flailing — in the public eye as one of R&B's modern torchbearers. The singer-songwriter (who uses she/they pronouns) has mastered a lot in that time. Not too long ago, she took up surfing, a hobby that helped further tether her to her late father and inspired her third studio album, Blue Water Road. She's been a faithful gym rat as of late, too, as evidenced by abs so enviable some onlookers were convinced she had etched them.


	Then, after a career spanning four studio albums, four mixtapes, and five Grammy nominations, she found the perfect balance of nostalgia and innovation in “Folded” — an addictive song on romantic reconciliation that became her highest charting hit. It's earned her two more nominations at the 2026 Grammys. Both categories — Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance — are packed with excellent music, representing a banner year for the genre she's been a faithful student of her whole life. In the Best R&B Performance race, in particular, the singer is up against two good friends — Justin Bieber, for “Yukon,” and Leon Thomas, for his rendition of “Mutt” on NPR's Tiny Desk. Over Zoom from her home in Los Angeles, she tells me they've all talked in celebration.

	“I'm so excited to be in a category with people that I love,” says Kehlani. “I love Justin. I fucking love Leon. That is my brother. Those are my family members.” When Kehlani was new to Los Angeles from Oakland and dropping songs on SoundCloud, Thomas was one half of the formidable production duo the Rascals alongside Khris Riddick-Tynes. Today, Riddick-Tynes is executive producing the forthcoming album Kehlani's hard at work on and was part of the team that brought “Folded” to life. “My first sessions in L.A. were with them,” she says of the duo. “I've been working with Leon and Khris since the beginning of time. Leon is secretly doing background vocals on a lot of my music. He texted us that morning and was like ‘My Grammy Award-nominated family!' That's a party. I'm just happy, man.”

	While “Folded” is an incredible feat of music-making, the Best R&B Performance nomination is especially fitting. It's undeniably been a song for the real vocalists — think Whitney Houston's canonical bite in telling an interviewer, “I listen to singers.… I very rarely listen to people who cannot sing,” and citing greats like Anita Baker and Luther Vandross. “Folded” exploded, in part, as netizens across social media tried their hand at covers. The song became part playground, part proving ground for the gifted.


	Slowly but surely, R&B veterans joined in. First, there was Mario, of “Let Me Love You” fame, in August. Then, Brandy — often called the “Vocal Bible” by other singers and who Kehlani has fiercely defended as one of the genre's most seminal voices — shared a cover with runs stacked to the high heavens in September. Jojo, who first debuted her stunning voice as a teen in 2004, tried her hand at it. Toni Braxton surprised fans with her snippet on Oct. 7, her 58th birthday — so did Tank. Later that month, all five artists, plus Ne-Yo, appeared on an official EP of “Folded” remixes. 


	It shows how difficult a song like “Folded” is to body, even for Kehlani and especially live. A seasoned stage performer, the only vocal tracks she uses are background parts and dance breaks. “There's not a lot of room for breath in the lead of ‘Folded,'” she explains. “It's traveling through a lot of my range. You don't really realize, until you have to sing that with no support, that you just got to smack that lead up and down. It's been a funny thing, but I think I got the hang of it now.”


	When I ask Kehlani what most prepared her for the monster of a song, her answer veers slightly from the heuristic. “There's an actual technical factor, and then there's a super spiritual factor that's happening in my life.” As for the latter: “I don't think at any point in my career I was ready to hold the level of pressure and success that I have right now. The way that this song is changing my realm and my world and my trajectory, I don't think that I could have held it any other time. I think God was just waiting for me to meet him with, ‘I can hold this. I'm sound enough. I'm sane enough. I'm spiritually grounded enough to be given a task like this or a season like this,' to be honest.”

	Released in June, “Folded” came as Kehlani was finally finding some peace living with bipolar II disorder, which she shared publicly in April, on her birthday. After months of struggling to find a psychiatrist accepting clients, she says, “I got diagnosed mid-crisis. Actually year one of the genocide, I'm sitting online having full-blown screaming fests with the phone.”

	











	Kehlani has been outspoken against the Israeli government since it began retaliating against Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped 251 hostages. The death toll in Gaza now tops 70,000. Kehlani, a United Nations commission, and the International Association of Genocide Scholars say Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians. Israel's Foreign Ministry has rejected that assertion, specifically calling a report commissioned by the United Nations' Human Rights Council “distorted and false.”


	The star has since been joined in her outcry by hundreds of musicians and labels who have supported initiatives like No Music for Genocide, including Hayley Williams, Japanese Breakfast, Muna, Clairo, Lucy Dacus, Nao, Faye Webster, MIKE, redveil, and more. Yet, back in October 2023, via Instagram, Kehlani broadly criticized her peers for being unengaged. In May 2024, as she prepared to release her last album, Crash, she doubled down. 


	Now, she notes she was also experiencing mania as she posted online incessantly at points. The psychiatric episodes, she says, heightened her very real anger and made her less strategic than she's learned to be since. “I'm just as mind-blown that people can sit around and be silent about this,” she tells me now. “But the way in which I would've gone about it would've probably been a lot more careful because I think I was just screaming and I alienated a lot of people in my realm that I really wish I could have just pulled in for conversation.” (Much more on this, in her own words, below.) 


	While many fans commended Kehlani's advocacy, the backlash was swift and harsh elsewhere. In the spring, Cornell University's president canceled a concert she was set to play, citing Kehlani's “antisemitic, anti-Israel sentiments in performances, videos, and on social media.” She rebuked the notion that she was antisemitic, saying at the time, “I am anti-genocide, I am anti the actions of the Israeli government, I am anti an extermination of an entire people, I'm anti the bombing of innocent children, men women … that's what I'm anti.” Then, under pressure from New York City mayor Eric Adam's office, the popular SummerStage concert series canceled her appearance set to celebrate Pride. 


	Today, Kehlani says, she couldn't even count the total number of paid opportunities she's lost: “It was coming from every angle.” This says nothing of the “massive amounts of death threats” the singer says she's received. Yet, for Kehlani — who has been no stranger to condemnation in the past, for everything from her love life to her tattoos — the most consequential controversy of her career has overlapped with the height of her mainstream success.

	











	“I just don't think that there was a way that I could have appreciated where I'm at right now without experiencing what I experienced,” she says. “I also think that it was necessary because I think that it's imperative that people see me thrive after this, so that they can know that they can speak and they can stand up for things they believe in, in light of being told their career will end because of it.”


	All this thriving means Kehlani is working through Thanksgiving. We're talking the day before. She typically doesn't commemorate the actual holiday, she says, but had a “Soulful Sunday” with friends that week. Her daughter Adeya appears off camera the moment Kehlani details that her routines these days revolve around the first-grader, of whom she has full custody after a legal battle with Adeya's father. She's hosting some of Adeya's pals for the break from school. (Kehlani recently told The Breakfast Club she's protected her daughter from her crises: “I don't fall apart in front of her,” she said. “She doesn't have a clue if anything is going on with me.”) Tomorrow, though, she's set to finalize the vocals for her album. And today, after our call, she has to run and meet the Usher to finalize their song on the LP (more on that below, too). The album title is off the record for now, but the crux of it is not. 


	“I really just homed in on making records,” says Kehlani. “If I think of the difference between bops, little songs here and there — records were things that took time and took effort from multiple people and took thinking of each individual song as a piece of art, versus I just came and doodled the song and spit it out and put it out, which I did for a long time. I'm not saying that there were a million, trillion steps or people involved in it, but I'm saying we treated these songs with the same amount of care.”


	Here, Kehlani goes deep on making an album indebted to classic R&B, the genre's recent queer awakening, what ethical fandom looks like, and how she's learned to live with bipolar disorder. 


On your birthday this year, you shared that you'd been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and BPD. What is the latter an acronym for?That's borderline personality disorder. But honestly, I need to get diagnosed by at least two more people because I think that BPD might be misdiagnosed. I'm speaking to you as [I'm] medicated, been in various forms of therapy. I might just be in some sort of remission for the BPD, but I've been episode-free and kooky-free for almost a year now. The episodes don't necessarily go away, but you can apply thought to them and you can acknowledge when they're happening, like, “Oh, OK, I woke up this morning feeling like a superhero and I need to do 872 things and maybe leave the country and maybe rethink my life. I must be manic.” Or you're like, “Everybody hates me. I think maybe I should die. I must be in a low.” You can go into these parameters of “Here's my steps, here's all the options I can choose to help myself through this right now.” I've been just in that world for the last year, and it's been really nice.

	











You've recently said that even Crash was made during a bout of mania, but as a fan, it can be hard to tell that that's happening. What did that look like for you pre-diagnosis, and how did it affect your career?What's interesting is I got diagnosed mid-crisis. Actually year one of the genocide, I'm sitting online having full-blown screaming fests with the phone, and I chop all my hair off. I had a pink buzz cut, and I was like, “How did nobody fucking just tell me I was in an episode?” I got my legs super tatted — didn't really recall the tattoo session. [The tattoo artist] finishes one leg apparently, and she's like, “OK, I'm done.” And apparently I was like, “Just keep going,” but through an entire bottle of tequila. There was a lot that happened that year; even the mania broke into full-blown paranoia. Leaving my house was difficult, thinking everybody is out to get me. I'm thinking I need to have security set outside my house. All the while, people are having very real conversations with me about my activism: “This is what can happen to your career and this is what can happen to you as a person and your safety.” I also was receiving massive amounts of death threats. So pairing all of the very real issues like that with a disorder like this, I flew off the handles. My romantic life was crazy. Every area of my life you can imagine was just like ass-whoop, ass-whoop, ass-whoop. I had been asking for a psychiatrist for six months, and every single person wasn't taking clients.


They were too busy? They were at capacity?They were full at capacity. And I'm like, if me — with access and money and the ability to have multiple people searching for this — am struggling right now, what is everybody else doing? So for six months, I'm in and out of crisis, in and out of psychosis and hypomania. Top-level manic things that can happen. I ran it up. I think there's been a lot of moments that people may have not noticed as an expression of my bipolar disorder.


It looks like, on paper, you're having your most successful year ever while bravely saying that there has been a genocide happening. How do you hold all of that? You were experiencing mania, but a lot of the things that you were saying were necessary. Before I got medicated, I sat down at lunch with my friend who's also medicated, [and they were] like, “Oh, just so you know, by day two, three on medication, you're going to wake up and look around and want to change everything. People are going to seem different to you. All your choices are going to seem fucking heinous to you. You're going to get ideas, new ideas about your regimen, just take your time with it.” Literally on day three, I was like, “Oh, I was tweaking.”

	











	I wouldn't say that I was brave because I was manic. I also have a hard time calling this brave in general. I think [in mania], you get hyper-confident. You don't think anything can happen to you. I think that how I naturally would feel about witnessing something like this is the same. I'm just as angry, I'm just as upset. I'm just as confused at our world and our government. I'm just as mind-blown that people can sit around and be silent about this. But the way in which I would've gone about it would've probably been a lot more careful, because I think I was just screaming and I alienated a lot of people in my realm that I really wish I could have just pulled in for conversation.


Who do you mean when you say “in your own realm”?In my industry, in my peer group, in my interpersonal circles. I appreciate looking back and just seeing that I was passionate and I cared. I think me now, with the grounding that I have, would've been more strategic. I'm not an organizer, but something I really learned in the last year and two years of moving through all of this and having really patient people teach me is their strategy, the way that they call people in and teach people. That was something that I really appreciated and learned to integrate post-having-more-sanity.


Can you give me an example of an encounter or a conversation that felt more aligned with these principles of organizing that you've learned, versus what felt a little more crash-out-y to you?Like Aja Monet — incredible person, incredible poet, incredible activist — hosted a bunch of us who were all aligned on this topic at her house. Artists, organizers, just people who needed a place to sit and imagine what a new world would look like. [We were] putting our thoughts together. “How can we call more people in? Is there any information you're maybe lacking on this subject? Let's talk about the history of it.” I'm sitting in the living room with people who have actually been to Palestine, who have been going back and forth to Palestine since maybe I was even in middle school. [It's like] “OK, you've done step one, which is you're angry and aware. Now, you have to take step two, and realize that this is a really long battle.” It's a really long fight. Even post ceasefire, the journey to the entirety of freeing Palestine itself is going to be a really long battle and you have to have some type of self-preservation so you don't burn out. We talked a lot about empathy fatigue and doing-the-work fatigue. It was just all of these things that I had never heard of. I think if everybody that was passionate was equipped with these thoughts and these processes, things would go differently. But step one, I'm grateful that I was angry and aware.

	











	But then the crash-out is that I put everybody that worked for me in a group chat and was like, “If you don't fucking say something, you're fired.” Does it come from a great place? Does it come from my heart and my anger? Yes. But does it do anything? Versus [asking], “How can I sit my team down and call them in and say, ‘Hey, you guys may have valid fears about speaking about this. Or you may feel like you don't actually know what's going on'?” Am I here to pacify that? No, but I can lovingly correct [that] being that I'm in a position of being leadership, and I'm responsible for [them] and I also want [them] to be an extension of me. Just all of these more thoughtful processes.


You've said you've lost a lot because of your advocacy for Palestine and against the Israeli government. Are you still losing things?Absolutely. Oh, there's people that have told me verbatim that they'll never with fuck with me. Companies, magazines, all of it. You name it. And you just thug it. That's honestly why I'm so consistent with my art. It's why I'm so direct-to-consumer. I'm going to get this song out to my fans. I'm going to work the song. I'm going to post about the song. I'm going to market it. I'm not afraid to talk to my fans and be in conversation with them because you can't disrupt that. That isn't dependent on a brand deal; that isn't dependent on anything except for me and the other humans that are listening to me. That's just where I've given my focus after the fact.


And do you also think having a decade-ish-long career has taught you that grassroots approach? You've had a very specific fan base follow you all these years. Are you reassured that if you continue to build that relationship that you can keep your life intact?I mean, these are some people that I have had to pass out my physical copy of my CD to when I was 19. These are people that have seen me go from a teenager to a mother. Your entire twenties, people spend not famous, fucking up and tweaking out and wilding out and then come to their thirties and be like, “Whoa, my twenties was a whirlwind.” They did it in private. I did it completely publicly. Every single thing that has been blasted, that's been out in the open, that people have seen gave them an opportunity to love me as a person.


	A lot of people have their opinions and you're not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but I think that people that really can grasp me as a whole human, they love me in a different way, and I definitely attribute [that to] my ability to keep floating and keep thriving too. My interactions with them aren't ever normal. They're full-blown, “How's your cat and how's your dog and how's your daughter and how's your mom doing? Have you spoken to your biological mom?” They care about me as a person.

	











What does responsible, respectful fandom actually look like to you? You're saying these people love you, but they also don't know you personally. I just base it off of “In a perfect world, what do I wish being a fan of someone would look like? In a perfect world, what do the boundaries of still being a person that's ever-changing and growing just like everyone else look like? How would I want to be received?” I've had to correct my fan base a lot over the years. I remember when I first came out [as queer] and they were being awful to the men that were also my fans. Then I had to correct the men from being weird and gross. I've had to [deal with] a lot of them being weird to any partner they've seen me with. I'm like, “Yo, bro, I get that you have a fixation on me, but you can't be awful to the person that I've chosen to share with you.” 


	Also, half the time, I've only chosen to share this with people because I'm tired of sneaking around. It's not a fun feeling in love to know you're going on a date and then you walk into a restaurant and everybody's like [mimics someone recording her on their phone beneath an imaginary table], or you just had a couple drinks with the person that you love and you stumbled out of a club and now there's some video that everybody's like, “Gotcha, bitch!” 


	It's a lot of picking and choosing of what to share and how to share and when to share. Also, being aware that you're not going to be able to ever be in control of the reception. But as far as my ethical fan base goes, I think it's guiding them when I can, correcting them when I can, not letting them bully other people or other artists, other fan bases. 


To your point of not wanting to sneak around, I'm a huge Kwn fan [the British, lesbian R&B singer with whom Kehlani has collaborated and starred on social media]. The public has seen that you guys have some sort of relationship — I don't know what kind, that's your business. I'm interested in how you reconcile those moments where you want to be more private in love — platonic or not — with the moments that you don't want to hide.I'm just going to speak broadly. I think that we just have a right to live freely and love freely. And just like any other girl, any normal person gets excited about anyone and wants to be able to have those moments where they're like, “I'm proud of them,” or, “I care about them, and I want to share,” I don't think celebrities are exempt from that. We don't suddenly have different feelings because we have millions of followers. It's a very strange feeling to come home and be like, “Oh, my God, so-and-so, did we get caught?” That's not pertaining to any relationship I've ever been in or any relationship I ever will be in or am in or not. It's just a rule of thumb that it's damned if you do, damned if you don't, in my position. Either way, it's just not normal. So once you accept that it's not normal, you just got to pick one. I think it'll vary for me. Depending on how I'm feeling, depending on how I'm living at the moment. I'm a 30-year-old woman. I am just learning and loving in front of everyone.


There are two things happening in R&B that I'm really excited about. One is the rise of queer R&B, but the other is the way artists like you are authentically tapping into the past. “Folded” does this really well; your latest single, “Out the Window,” does this well. How do you make music and videos that are an homage to a previous era without cosplaying it?Everything that I'm doing is because it includes the ingredients and the recipe of [an] era. I'm thinking of what I know as the classic recipes of R&B. I'm not a person that thinks something has to be reinvented over and over again. I've done it, but I don't think R&B is broken. I have ventured out of R&B; I've done a lot of pop music. I think most of my [music] has been alternative R&B, but I said I really wanted to make [music that] has the recipe of classic R&B.


	I think that there's a thin line between the cosplay-homage thing and this [thing] that has the ingredients. If you can name eight people when you're looking at my video or listening to my song and say, “OK, so I'm seeing Aaliyah, Janet, Usher, hearing Brandy, seeing Omarion” all at the same time, it just means that I'm doing justice to the era and I'm doing justice to the genre. 


I saw you were recording with producer and artist Ryan Leslie. Is whatever you guys worked on going to be on this album?Me, Ryan Leslie, and James Fauntleroy have a song that I think is dope.

	











What is the vibe of that song?It's very James-y. I love it. The coolest thing about it is when James makes something, you can hear the James in it, and I think it's probably one of the more eclectic songs on the project. It's not so straightforward R&B. It has a little energy in it. It has some bounce to it.


What does James-y mean to you?James has this incredible way of writing these whimsical melodies with these dirty, edgy lyrics that tell stories and paint a picture, but vocally, it's like there's so much traveling in it. I think he has such a sonic thing. You'll press play on a song and be like, “Oh, you went to the school of James Fauntleroy.” Just like I can hear so much Frank [Ocean] in a lot of the new generations, they're not realizing that even a lot of Frank-y stuff is James-y stuff.


	You can just really hear the schools that people graduated from in their music. I don't like when people say that's a bad thing. I think that these conversations were also had in the Nineties. We're paying so much homage to the 2000s and the Nineties. They were also paying homage to what came before them, and also being disruptive at the same time. It's having to navigate that balance.


You've also said that you have a song with Usher. Is that going to be on this album?Yeah, that's going to be on this. I actually have to go after this interview and finish the final vocals with him.


Oh, wait, in person?Yeah, yeah, yeah.


Did you guys make the bulk of this song in person?No, actually, we've been going back and forth multiple times to get the song right. Different songs at that as well. It's just trying to find the right song. But honestly, I just really appreciated how much of a person he's been to me. I had a show in Atlanta where my voice was completely gone when I got there because I was shooting a video until the late wee hours outside.

	











And was the video “Out the Window”?It was actually the original “Out the Window” that isn't coming out.


Quick aside, I don't want you to lose your story, but why did that get stopped?Too many variables. Everything was just seeming to go wrong, and we were missing a lot of footage and a lot didn't get shot, and it was just like, “Damn.” I got sick. I was actually outside in the middle of downtown L.A. Very “Touch” [by Omarion] vibes. I got sick as hell, and so when I got to Atlanta, I put on my [Instagram] story or on my notes “I'm so sick,” and he somehow saw that and called me and was like, “I'm about to bring you everything, and I'm about to put you on with my voice coach.” This man came to my hotel room, did vocal lessons with me, brought me 72 million remedies, and literally brought my voice back. I was only able to do One Music Fest because Usher Raymond saved my guts.


Who are the other dream collaborators you got to work with on this album?Oh, man, so many. The Underdogs. I got to write with Ne-Yo. I got to work with Stargate. I got to write with Tank. I cut a song from Johntá Austin. I did Jermaine Dupri and Brian Michael Cox. Oh, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Man, that was one of the coolest moments of my life, and it's probably my favorite song on the album.


What are you most excited about in bringing this album to life?Honestly, I just want people to have an experience. I want people to just love singing and dancing again. It is really that simple. It's such a personal moment for me right now to be proving myself. I feel so personally just motivated to rewrite my story, and I hope that trickles into the experience that people have. I hope people feel empowered.


What is the log line of the story that's being rewritten?I contributed a lot to R&B in the last 10 years, and I think it gets overlooked. I'm one of the few that are still remaining from my coming-out time [as an artist], and I think that's important. To still be able to make splashes like this 10 years in, I think it's a big deal.


You've been nominated for Best R&B Song at the Grammys back to back, last year for “After Hours.” How do you compare the experience?Last year, I was genuinely shocked. My friend texted me, and he lives in Brazil, so he was just ahead. I was asleep, and he was like, “Grammy noms come out today.” I was like, “They're not worried about me. I'm going back to sleep.” I woke up to seven missed calls and eight texts, and he was like, “They clearly worried about you. Wake up.” And I was like, “What the fuck?” Especially because “After Hours” and Crash in general had gotten such a polarizing reception. I was shocked.


	This year everybody, from week five of “Folded” coming out, was like, “You're getting a nomination.” So I had this opposite pressure, like, if we don't get nominated after everybody's saying this, then all I'm going to have to hear for the next months is how I was snubbed. I don't need that sitting on my back. I just need to be focused on creating, honestly. That's the biggest difference for sure.


How would your ideal Grammy week look? Your ideal Grammy day? What are you wearing? Where are you going? I honestly just want to be not-anxious. I want to be feeling very settled. I want to walk in there knowing that no matter what, I shifted a conversation. I want to spend time with my family. I want to wear a matching outfit with Destin [Conrad, nominated for Best Progressive R&B album for Love on Digital, which features Kehlani]. That's really what I want to do.

	











	I think most importantly, I just want to be sitting in gratitude that week and that day. I don't want any other feelings. I'm not a very competitive person. I don't really have those feelings. I'm stoked and I want to stay in this.


You mentioned Destin; Durand Benarr earned three grammy nominations as well. It really feels like we're in a special moment for queer R&B between you guys and others, similar to the sapphic moment in pop last year. Does it feel like something is happening to you?No, there is. I think that it was very taboo in the beginning for people to be able to use the pronouns they actually talk to in the actual songs that they sing. I think the fact that not only can you do that, but you can present exactly how you want to present, you can make music videos kissing the gender you want to kiss — all of that being possible right now is crazy. I don't know how to say anything that isn't obvious, like duh, people that are growing up need to be able to have their sexuality represented. I'm glad that I'm a part of it.


	It's a trip to be able to watch VH1's Behind the Music from old-ass shit and see how many people were in the closet. You hear these industry stories about how so-and-so was a little queer, and now we just don't have to do that. It's beautiful, and I consider us lucky.


“Folded” is a pronoun-less song. Do you think that it could have broken through like this if it wasn't?Honestly, I don't know. So many people who are new to me because of “Folded” think its about a man to the point where they got mad at me in the video because I wasn't having a man pick up his clothes from my house. And I don't think the video would've been successful if I had a love interest. If I would've did a video where I would've been having a woman come pick up her clothes and [been] kissing on a girl, they would've been mad regardless.


Are there songs on this album that you believe in like you believe in “Folded,” but are gendered in their pronouns?[There are] songs that I want people to, when they're singing the song, either feel like they are me in the song or feel like I am talking directly to them.

Is there anything that we didn't talk about that you would like to, especially with the album coming out?I just want to drill the point home that this was just my time to go this route and hit the nail on the head in a conscious choice to break through this ceiling that I've been [under] for a while. It took a lot of trying and failing [with] other sounds and succeeding in certain lenses. I think it took a lot of polarization in my art. I don't have any regrets about any choices artistically that I've made before. Going this direction doesn't mean this is the direction for the rest of my life either. I take it era by era and creative choice by creative choice. I'm just glad that people are receiving it right now.

	There's never been a tour like Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. Her two-year run around the world brought out a three-hour emotional exorcism of a show each night, getting bigger as it went along, for an unprecedented level of fan hysteria and ticket demand. So it makes sense that her new documentary series, The End of an Era, is anything but a standard concert flick. Instead, it follows the whole tour phenomenon, counting down the final months before the last show and capturing all the backstage drama and fan community that gathered around it.


	As Swift said onstage that final night in Vancouver, it was “the most thrilling chapter of my life to date — my beloved Eras Tour.” The six-part series premieres on Disney+ starting tonight, on the eve of Taylor's birthday. We saw the first two episodes — just the tip of this iceberg. Here are 13 takeaways from The End of an Era.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The doc counts down to the farewell night of the Eras Tour — the ultimate climax for the most mythically gargantuan tour in history. The final show was in Vancouver on Dec. 8, a few days before Taylor's birthday and almost exactly a year before the series premieres. Taylor refers to the epic run of the tour as “a lifetime within my life.” The End of an Era captures the madness of life on the road for everyone swept up into the Swiftian whirlwind — not just the star, or even just the onstage performers, but the giant community that goes into making this tour go, from the crew to the creative team to her family. —Rob Sheffield












	The doc focuses on the whole tour community, making stars out of the band and the dancers. There's so much Madonna Truth or Dare energy in the way the whole team becomes part of the story. Taylor's band is full of musicians who have been at her side for years — fans have been seeing and hearing them for so long, it's a rare treat to see them finally open up and tell their stories. We all know Amos Heller as the fan-fave bass stud who's been with Taylor since the early days — there's hilarious footage of them clowning around on the 2007 tour. He reveals one of his secret pro tips for keeping his musical chops in shape on the road — he practices his bass in the shower, since it's the one place where he won't wake up any of the neighbors in the nearby rooms. It's definitely surreal to see Amos busting out his bass moves in the middle of an empty bathroom when he's used to stadium stages, but like everything in the documentary, it's about capturing the gritty day-to-day work that goes into the glamour of those few hours onstage. That's showbiz, baby. —R.S.

The End of an Era doesn't shy away from the dark side of the spotlight, which makes it a sobering watch. In the first episode, Swift openly discusses the thwarted terror plot that forced the singer to cancel three nights of the Eras Tour in Vienna. (For the unacquainted, Swift has only cancelled a handful of shows in her 20-year career, and one was due to a military coup). “Never in my life did I think we would have a terrorist plot,” Swift says as she wipes tears from her eyes. “We dodged a massacre,” Swift continues. She then explains how she copes with such life-altering events and continues to push forward to put on a show to millions of fans. “You block it off,” she says, comparing herself to a pilot who needs to reassure everyone that all is well, even when it's not. — Maya Georgi


	Don't hold your breath, Tayvis Nation. Taylor's fiancé, Travis Kelce, isn't as prominent in the first two episodes; he's more of an off-camera presence. Kelce is only ever heard over the phone in two separate calls. Swift places the first call in the lead-up to her shows in London, clearly in need of some reassurance. She bemoans the fact that Kelce has practice but is still grateful to hear from him. “Some people got a vitamin drip, I got this conversation,” she tells her beau. Once the first show back is a smashing success and Swift is in a van home, she immediately calls Kelce again to share how elated she is at getting through it all. “I can hear it in your voice,” he says. “I'm just so happy to be back doing this,” she tells him. There's a few moments we hear “baby!” exchanged, but sadly, no “honey.” —M.G.

	It didn't take long for the fan community buzzing around the Eras Tour to take over as the star of the show. Swifties began their own tribal rituals that became part of the tour, after starting out on a strictly organic grass-roots level — most notably, the friendship-bracelet craze. As Taylor told the crowd on that final night in Vancouver, “I never thought that writing ONE line about friendship bracelets would have you guys all making friendship bracelets, making friends, and bringing joy to each other.” There's something a bit terrifying about the intense Deadhead-like devotion of the Swifties every night — and the singer is as mystified by it as anyone else. On the Eras Tour, the parking lot became a place for fans to hang out, sing along, meet fellow Swifties. As one older observer marvels in the doc, “It's like Woodstock without the drugs!” —R.S.












	Nobody knew what Taylor was going to do when she returned to the road. Her Lover Fest performances in the summer of 2020 got canceled in the pandemic, along with every other tour — on the day Taylor got the news her tour wasn't happening, she was so miserable she wrote “Mirrorball.” That led to Folklore and Evermore, not to mention — by the time she hit the road for the Eras Tour — Midnights. With this backlog of massive albums she hadn't performed live, people openly speculated that she might have simply gotten too big to tour at all. The whole idea of this experiment seemed impossible. (As Heller quips, “It seems obvious now, because it did work.”) But Taylor treated the whole show — era to era — as the long and winding tale of her life, growing up in public through her music. As she puts it, the show features “all the different girls I was until I turned into this one.” —R.S.


	Yeah, we still don't know. Sorry. Some of us are still traumatized by that. —R.S.


	A sight to warm anyone's heart: Taylor gives the London crowd in Wembley Stadium a little extra when it's Surprise Song o' Clock, with a local boy for a guest. Ed Sheeran was just a folkie kid when he went on the road with Taylor on the Red tour, making massive waves with his solo acoustic sets, blowing up into one of her most wildly successful proteges as well as one of her most enduring and endearing musical friendships. Even Ed, a man who's been rocking stadiums on his own for years now, seems a little daunted by the size and scale of the Eras Tour. But they sit down backstage to work on their classic Red duet “Everything Has Changed” — a transformative song in both their stories, not to mention the most famous song ever written by two people while bouncing on a trampoline. For both of these superstars, it's a reunion that's deeply personal even though they're sharing it with thousands of fans in realtime, tapping into their shared history — two old friends getting back to where they once belonged. —R.S.


	Who knew Florence Welch was so funny? As the singer and frontwoman for Florence + the Machine preps for a surprise performance of “Florida!!!” in London, it's like watching a fairy with impeccable comedic timing. “In my own shows, I just show up and run around,” she says during choreo rehearsals. The best part is when she describes popping up on the Eras Tour stage at showtime. “It was like walking on Mars,” she says. Welch was so out of orbit, she was even awestruck by her friend. “The persona is huge but the person is soft,” she says of Swift. But as soon as she saw the singer in her element, Welch recalls thinking what everyone else in the stadium was thinking: “That's Taylor fucking Swift!” —M.G.












	Taylor goes into some of the details of touring — like the way she started her physical training regimen six months before rehearsals even began. In early footage of tour rehearsals, there's a shot of her practicing the nightly move where she dives through a narrow hole in the stage. (That dive turned so many of us into anxious wrecks every night — it's still scary to witness when she's just rehearsing it. Too risky!) It's a revelation to see how hard everyone has to work just to keep up. As Swift says, “It is our job to make this look accidental, and it is our job to make this look effortless.” We see her downtime rituals, listening to audiobooks (in one scene she's taking in Liz Moore's crime novel The God of the Woods). Late in the tour, all the lighting crew get matching tattoos proudly proclaiming their number of shows. Taylor does a double take when she sees it, asking, “Why does it show the Grim Reaper?” Because they're surprised they even survived it. —R.S.


	Anyone who went to the Eras Tour, watched livestreams from home, or even tuned into the first concert film, was instantly charmed by lead dancer Kameron Saunders and his various ad-libs. (Like ever!) So it's a delight to watch him describe the arduous journey that brought him to the Eras Tour stage. Saunders opens up about facing discrimination as a black dancer with a larger body and being raised by a single mother, which makes dancing for the historic tour that much more special. “This feels like my Super Bowl,” Saunders says of the Eras Tour in a pointed remark. As fate would have it, Saunders' brother, Khalen, became a two-time Super Bowl champion with the Kansas City Chiefs alongside none other than Travis Kelce. —M.G.

	Two of the doc's most fascinating characters are the badass dancing queens: choreographer Mandy Moore and associate choreographer Amanda Balen. (Fans got to see both at work in The Life of a Showgirl movie, as part of the team behind the video for “The Fate of Ophelia.”) We get up close and personal as they share their professional stories, from Moore's work in Hollywood (Swift's friend Emma Stone urged her to hire Moore after La La Land) to Balen's career dancing for Janet Jackson, Céline Dion, and Lady Gaga. During one rowdy rehearsal for “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” Taylor announces at top volume, in her snootiest faux-Brit accent, “We are doing theeee-aaaterrrrr!” But even in dance rehearsals, Taylor is constantly jumping into the creative flow. Working on one move, she tells Moore, “I'm seeing this as ‘girl in an insane asylum'-slash-‘wood nymph.'” —R.S.












	When Taylor sang “Long Live” on that final night in Vancouver, she changed the key line, “It was the end of a decade” to “it was the end of an era,” and that's the spirit of this doc. Like the tour itself, it ends up turning into a love song from Swift to the crowd, with her downright scary obsession with making a unique connection with the listeners. “You look out there and it's not just a blob of lights,” Taylor says in one candid moment. “There's millions of stories and counter-narratives all colliding in one place where we feel safe to be demonstrative of a whole spectrum of emotion.” That's the crowd she's performing for. The Eras Tour is what happens when a one-of-a-kind artist comes face-to-face with a one-of-a-kind audience — not just the people who made it into the room for the Eras Tour, but the ones who followed it from afar, joining in the global community that coalesced around this musical adventure. It's a project that only Swift — and her fans — could have brought to life. —R.S.

	Sean “Diddy” Combs is threatening to sue Netflix for airing a docuseries that is, to say the least, unflattering to him. The disgraced music mogul's cease-and-desist letter claims the series, Sean Combs: The Reckoning, uses “stolen footage.” 


	The footage includes Combs launching into a tirade against former Danity Kane and Diddy-Dirty Money artist Dawn Richard after learning of her sexual harassment lawsuit against him and strategizing with his attorneys days before his September 2024 arrest. “We have to find somebody that'll work with us,” Combs says in the footage. “That has dealt in the dirtiest of dirty business. We're losing!”


	Asked how he got the footage, executive producer Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson declined to answer, explaining, “I figured most journalists would not disclose their sources.” (Side note: Some federal appellate judges could learn a thing or two about journalist-source confidentiality from Jackson.) 


	Michael Oberlies, a documentarian who Combs hired to film him, blamed a freelancer he said he'd hired to briefly fill in for him while he was away. In any event, series director Alexandra Stapleton says her team obtained the footage lawfully. 

	











	Assuming Stapleton is telling the truth, Combs' argument that Netflix is responsible for her source's alleged misconduct shouldn't fare well. It was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2001 case Bartnicki v. Vopper, and for good reason. The media has a First Amendment right to publish information of public concern obtained from sources who broke the law, so long as it didn't participate in the illegality. 

	











	Combs, of course, thinks the rules don't apply to him — hence his current address in federal prison. And he's got a history of trying to erase incriminating footage, like the hotel surveillance video of him beating then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura that he allegedly bribed security guards to bury. 


	But the same reasoning that protected a Pennsylvania radio host reporting on illegally recorded conversations about school union negotiations in the Bartnicki case also protects streaming giants airing docuseries about alleged predatory celebrities.

	Unless Netflix hacked Combs' computer, broke into his home, or otherwise stole the footage, the Supreme Court says Combs, to quote his debut album title, has “no way out.” Combs' legal team may think that's “unfair,” given that he didn't intend for the footage to go public. But that's his problem, not Netflix's. The public interest in the news outweighs a public figure's desire to control the narrative. (For similar reasons, any copyright claim Combs could bring against Netflix should fail under the “fair use” doctrine allowing excerpts of copyrightable materials to be used for journalism and commentary, among other purposes.) 


	Some of the most consequential reporting in history relied on records unlawfully obtained by others. Legendary whistleblower and Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) co-founder Daniel Ellsberg expected a life sentence when his conscience compelled him to copy classified documents to expose the government's lies about the Vietnam War and give them to the press. 


	But the case against Ellsberg fell apart due to government misconduct, and the Supreme Court ruled that the press could not be restrained from publishing the Pentagon Papers. The government's primary argument was not that The New York Times was responsible for Ellsberg stealing the documents. It argued the documents threatened national security — a theory the court rightly rejected as far too speculative to justify a “prior restraint” on publication.

	Years later, even Nixon officials admitted the government was never really concerned about national security, just embarrassment and reputational harm. That's exactly what Combs is worried about. In other words, his arguments are so flimsy that even the Nixon administration knew better than to rely on them. 


	But the Pentagon Papers case was over 50 years ago, and Bartnicki is already older than many of Combs' alleged victims were when he met them. The once-ironclad principle that journalists can publish documents stolen by their sources is under unprecedented attack.

	











Los Angeles Times reporter Maya Lau published an investigation exposing hundreds of L.A. County Sheriff's deputies with histories of misconduct. In response, the department launched a secret criminal investigation of Lau for “knowingly receiving stolen property.” Lau is now suing, and rightly so. Her case is far from the only example. 


	The Biden administration's prosecutors went after right-wing outlet Project Veritas for possessing and transporting Ashley Biden's diary, which it purchased from someone who stole it. The government characterized the diary as “stolen property,” which Project Veritas illegally possessed and transported. As FPF, the ACLU, and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) argued in a legal brief, the right to publish stolen materials becomes meaningless if merely having them is illegal. 


	The Trump administration dropped that case, but its reasons appear to have been political, not constitutional. It's currently pursuing charges against Daniel “Des” Sanchez for transporting anarchist literature, claiming he was concealing evidence that would incriminate his wife, who had attended a protest at which a police officer was shot. There's no evidence his wife had anything to do with the shooting, though, and possession of literature isn't incriminating.


	It's against this backdrop that the Trump administration threatens to do what was once unthinkable — prosecute reporters for obtaining and reporting leaks. He's got a weapon in his arsenal not available to Combs — the archaic Espionage Act, which, taken literally, prohibits mere obtainment and retention of national defense information, regardless of whether the defendant is a spy, a whistleblower, or a reporter.


	For decades, presidents resisted impulses to prosecute routine reporting under the act, recognizing the constitutional problems with doing so. But the Biden administration's extraction of a guilty plea from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (in a case initiated by the first Trump administration) for obtaining and publishing documents from sources opened the door to similar theories against more conventional journalists. 


	As Rolling Stone reported in June, Trump is eager to barge through that door. His Pentagon's ridiculous requirement for journalists to pledge not to publish “unauthorized” information — even if they obtain it lawfully from willing sources — makes clear how the administration sees the press's role.

	That's why it's so important that the courts don't allow those with the “Benjamins” — whether Combs or his former “good friend,” Trump — to chip away at Bartnicki's principles. When the powerful lock the front door to information, journalists and filmmakers need to find the back door. That means obtaining newsworthy footage and records from whoever has them, and telling the public what they say. That's not theft. As 50 Cent astutely notes, that's journalism.

	As promised, Taylor Swift‘s The End of an Era documentary series gives a behind-the-scenes look at the Eras Tour — even when it gets dark. The series' first episode chronicles the unimaginable horror that struck the tour during the European leg. In August 2024, Swift was forced to cancel three nights in Vienna, Austria, after a terrorist plot was foiled.


	“Never in my life did I think we would have a terrorist plot,” Swift says in The End of an Era. She is wearing a black shirt in a direct-to-camera interview and wipes her teary eyes. “We dodged a massacre,” Swift continues. She then explains how she copes with such life-altering events and continues to push forward to put on a show to millions of fans. “You block it off,” she says, comparing herself to a pilot who needs to reassure everyone that all is well, even when it's not.


	Less than a week after the thwarted terrorist plot in Vienna, Swift and her crew had a five-date run at Wembley Stadium in London. The End of an Era series' first episode follows the singer as she returns to the stage and a packed stadium, days after the terrorist plot targeting Swift's Vienna concert run would have put thousands of lives at risk.

	











	“I have a weird feeling going into these last five shows in Europe,” Swift admits in the lead up. In the clip,  it is clear that Swift is still very shaken by the calamitous events; her voice is raw and raspy, and she is wearing an oversized T-shirt. But Swift remains resilient.

	











	“There's not a challenge she isn't going to conquer,” says Swift's longtime bassist Amos Heller as the team revs up for the Wembley dates. (Heller would know; he's been touring with the star since 2007).


	So the challenge to provide her fans with the best comeback show ever begins. Swift calls up her longtime collaborator and friend Ed Sheeran to perform with her for the surprise song set. In an intimate moment backstage with Sheeran, Swift reveals that the filming crew capturing them at that moment was supposed to have started filming in Vienna. In that same clip, she admits to “feeling very hunted recently.”

	Following the terror plot and Vienna show cancellations, Swift was admonished online for remaining silent in the immediate aftermath. The singer commented on the major news only after she wrapped her London shows. “Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows,” Swift wrote on Instagram at the time. “My priority was finishing our European tour safely.”

The End of an Era episodes also show how Swift's Wembley Stadium shows, which were filled with unique surprises and a resilient joy, were quite emotional for the singer. While in London, the star met with families affected by the stabbings at a kids' Swift-themed dance studio backstage. The actual meet-and-greets are not shown, but afterward, the singer breaks down in tears backstage as her mother offers comforting words. “You really helped them, I know it,” Andrea tells her daughter. 


	“It is my job to be able to handle all these feelings and perk up immediately,” Swift says at another moment in the documentary. After the safe execution and successful performance at the first Eras show in London, Swift is seen leaving, clearly relieved. But just before she gets into a black van, she can't help but ask her tour manager Robert Aleen, “Did anything bad happen that I don't know about?”

The man who has staked his reputation—and billions of pounds—on turning humanity into an interplanetary species has a surprising secret: he doesn't believe in aliens. Elon Musk may be determined to colonise Mars, but when it comes to Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) buzzing Earth's atmosphere, the world's richest man is convinced they have nothing to do with little green men and everything to do with weapons programmes right here on our planet.

This startling dichotomy—the audacious visionary versus the grounded sceptic—was laid bare during his recent appearance on Katie Miller's podcast, where he offered a definitive dismissal of extraterrestrial life visiting Earth. It's a claim that carries considerable weight, given that Musk is, arguably, the person most likely to be tipped off to any cosmic secrets, running the company responsible for more civilian space launches than anyone else.

'I have seen no evidence of aliens,' Musk told Miller, before addressing the notion that a major player like SpaceX might be withholding cosmic knowledge. He confirmed he had directly questioned his highest-level staff. 'No one on the SpaceX senior team has any evidence of aliens. Because I've asked the team, ""Guys, am I missing something? Has anyone on the team – has anyone seen any evidence of aliens?""'

This is a promise the fifty-four-year-old billionaire has made before, explicitly stating during a previous interview with Joe Rogan that he is not part of some global celestial cover-up. If any evidence of non-human intelligence were to cross his desk, the public, he insists, would be the first to know.

'I was aware of any evidence of aliens, Joe, you have my word. I will come on your show, and I will reveal it on the show,' he had guaranteed the popular podcast host.

Yet, his dismissal of aliens pivots directly into a far more worrying theory when discussing the prevalence of UFO sightings. For Musk, these mysterious objects aren't vehicles from another star system, but rather terrestrial prototypes developed by governments right here on Earth, likely the US government. His assessment is cold, cynical, and centred firmly on national security, suggesting these are not interstellar explorers but rather advanced military hardware.

'UFOs... it could be like a new weapons programme... or hypersonic missiles. It's just basically a weapons prototype. It's not aliens.'

While he is a sceptic of external threats, Musk remains committed to solving what he views as humanity's greatest existential weakness: having all our eggs in one planetary basket. The solution, he says, is Mars.

Despite the scepticism surrounding the ambitious timelines and technical challenges, Musk has consistently reiterated his goal to turn the Red Planet into a second home. Earlier this year, the entrepreneur claimed there would be a self-sustaining city on Mars in 20 years. He is targeting 2028 for the launch of an unmanned Starship mission, with a crewed flight likely to follow in 2030.

This timeline, however, is subject to the notoriously fluid realities of space engineering, a fact Musk himself acknowledged when discussing the possibility of putting his Optimus robot on the planet. Responding to an X user who asked about the schedule, the billionaire gave a highly detailed, if cautious, projection.

'Slight chance of Starship flight to Mars crewed by Optimus in Nov/Dec next year. A lot needs to go right for that. More likely, first flight without humans in ~3.5 years, next flight ~5.5 years with humans,' he wrote. Regardless of the slight shifts, the ultimate goal remains fixed: the creation of a Martian colony. He later affirmed that Mars will have a 'self-sustaining city in 20 to 30 years.'

Musk's vision for planetary redundancy, however, comes with a terrifying potential consequence for the first generation of true Martians—a consequence that has been scrutinised by the scientific community. Biologist Scott Solomon has previously argued that human colonisation of Mars could 'kill humanity,' suggesting the living conditions would be so 'brutal' that they would spark rapid, catastrophic evolutionary changes.

In his book, Future Humans, the author predicted that children born to Mars settlers would endure drastic evolutionary changes, a process that could result in them developing 'brittle bones,' 'weaker muscles,' and a 'freakishly green colouring' due to the unforgiving combination of low gravity and high radiation. Other predicted mutations include an inevitable change in skin colour and a resulting loss of eyesight.

Musk's refusal to accept the possibility of advanced alien life visiting Earth stands in stark contrast to his readiness to embrace a future where our own species mutates beyond recognition. It presents a high-stakes, deeply compelling choice: to remain on Earth, facing the perceived dangers of covert government weapons programmes, or to flee to Mars, and risk turning into something entirely new.

The future, according to Elon Musk, holds no little green men, only the terrifying spectre of clandestine, hyper-advanced weaponry on Earth, or a biological mutation lottery on Mars. As humanity stands on the cusp of an interstellar jump, the real question is not if we will survive, but what we will become.

LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — For 27 months, Las Vegas was UFO central. A secret program, known as AAWSAP, was created in 2008 with support from Nevada Senator Harry Reid and became the largest UFO investigation ever undertaken by the U.S. Government (so far as we know).

But the investigators for the program, all of whom had top-secret security clearances, encountered things that were far stranger than UFOs, phenomena that could be accurately described as “paranormal.” 

8 News Now Chief Investigator George Knapp was the only journalist allowed to know about AAWSAP, which stands for Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program, and spoke to the government scientist who was the program's director. 

Back in that era, 2008-2011, Knapp heard the name Dr. James Lacatski a few times, mostly in hushed whispers. Knapp finally met him face to face on St. Patrick's Day in 2018 at a meeting in Washington arranged by Senator Reid. That's when Knapp received a full download about AAWSAP that stunned him.  

What they found in this sprawling UFO investigation is that these unknown craft, whatever they are, seem to generate spooky phenomena that seemingly shouldn't exist. 

“We heavily went into Skinwalker Ranch, a property of Robert Bigelow's,” Lacatski said. “He offered a facility where we could see UFOs and the paranormal all at once.” 

So, how did this ranch in northeastern Utah, previously owned by Las Vegas aerospace tycoon Robert Bigelow, become a key part of the government's classified UFO investigation?  

It started at DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, where rocket scientist and intelligence analyst Lacatski and a colleague, Jay Stratton, became both puzzled and alarmed by reports about UFO intrusions at many of our nation's most sensitive national defense facilities.     

Residents of the Uinta Basin in northeastern Utah had been reporting frequent UFO incidents for decades, probably longer, and the Bigelow Ranch was deemed an epicenter of weird activity, not just UFOs, but also unknown creatures, things that presumably exist only in myths or movies.

Bigelow's organization, NIDS, or National Institute for Discovery Science, moved onto the ranch, and its team of scientists and investigators began collecting testimony from residents, then started seeing the creatures and phenomena for themselves. Lacatski, Stratton, and the bosses at the DIA were intrigued, not repelled, by the wild stories. They wanted to know if UFOs and the seemingly related paranormal incidents might be considered a threat. 

“I could see from my organization the threat potential, and we were uncovering many of the things you were observing, you know, strange creatures,” Lacatski said. “I mean, think of inducing what might be called delusions by some people into an enemy force. We wanted to learn what can be weaponized here.” 

Lacatski and Stratton put together a program that DIA approved; the acronym was AAWSAP. Senator Harry Reid helped secure the funding, and Bigelow Aerospace was the contractor. Fifty full-time investigators were hired, obtained top secret security clearances, and went to work.  

The main focus was UFOs and UFO technology, but one smaller focus was measurable health effects on people who encountered a UFO and were physically harmed, or developed rare diseases, including psychological effects. That allowed AAWSAP to cast a wide net and to report seemingly outlandish stories about creatures, poltergeist-type activity, and other weirdness.   

Lacatski said that AAWSAP created a massive database of UFO accounts, but the witnesses were typically reluctant to admit that they also had paranormal experiences after encountering UFOs. 

“We realized that people who openly say ‘I observed a UFO up close,' maybe on the ground that they always seemed to have a paranormal connection in some ways, if you gently push them,” Lacatski said. 

The connection between UFO encounters and paranormal experiences isn't new. It traces back to the first big UFO event of the modern era. In 1947, a pilot named Kenneth Arnold saw nine objects flying in formation over Washington State. His family said that for most of the rest of his life, Arnold's home was bedeviled by inexplicable phenomena.   

Perhaps the strangest experience reported by nearly everyone in AAWSAP who visited the Bigelow Ranch is what is now known as the hitchhiker effect. At least five highly experienced intelligence officers who went to the ranch to check things out, came into contact with paranormal phenomena, and then took it home with them.  

They and their families would see balls of light inside their homes, shadowy figures, even creatures that were physical, not a mere mental image. After one investigator returned from the ranch to his east coast home, his entire family was bedeviled by orbs and what they described as a wolf that walked on two legs. 

“The one here in the Washington area, that's why you have to say paranormal,” Lacatski explained. “I mean, what, did it get on a train or a plane to come to Washington?  It left deep scratch marks on the tree it was resting against; there was physical evidence.” 

Among those who have reported hitchhiker type events, Dr. Colm kelleher, the Las Vegas manager for AAWSAP, physicist Dr. Eric Davis, the DIA's Jay Stratton, several security personnel, and the former owner of the ranch, Robert Bigelow. 

After the existence of AAWSAP was first reported by us in 2018, and the full scale of the strange phenomena it had examined was made public by Dr. Lacatski in his books, including the newest one, “New Insights.” Skeptics claimed the DIA had killed AAWSAP at the end of 2010 because the reports it received were simply too weird. The man who oversaw every part of AAWSAP said weirdness had nothing to do with it, that DIA leadership was supportive to the end. 

“Did they ever have the opinion that this is getting kind of weird?” Knapp asked.  

“No, they never did. They basically wanted it kept quiet, that's all,” Lacatski explained. They didn't want to see it in The Washington Post.” 

Lacatski and others familiar with AAWSAP tried to find a new home for a spinoff version, something called Kona Blue. Harry Reid helped lead the charge, and the Department of Homeland Security initially said yes, then higher-ups killed it. Lacatski's new book hints that some slice of Kona Blue did move forward, but he declines to spill further details about that for now.

Online Running Coach | Running Shoe and Gear Reviews

When I first learned about the R.A.D. UFO I wasn't sure what to expect from this new brand. Would this shoe be able to compare to some of the other brand name running shoes on the market?

The R.A.D. UFO is certainly trying to make a statement with its bright neon colors. If you can get past the looks of these shoes, they may just have a place in your running shoe rotation. (Spoiler we saw some big name brands with similar looking shoes at The Running Event recently. And some of us on the team think they look very cool.)

While I expected these to feel light and fast, I found them to be more suitable for easy runs or some tempo paced miles, which in truth  is exactly what they were designed for!

A super trainer is not the same as a super shoe, they have different goals and I needed to adjust my expectations.

R.A.D. (which stands for Rally Against Destruction) describes these shoes as a “road-running super trainer- designed to build speed across distance”. I just didn't find these to be a great shoe for long runs or speed workouts, but their sweet spot may just be somewhere in the middle.

This shoe is great for runners looking for soft cushioning and a wide toe box. They're well suited for easy runs or tempo runs up to 8-10 miles.

A super trainer is designed with lightweight bouncy cushion that in theory should leave your legs feeling less fatigued after a run, therefore keeping you fresher for the big efforts. Now that, I could see, but I just really wanted them to feel faster, which is not the shoes fault.

I know you can't judge a book by its cover, but when I pulled these shoes out of the box I was definitely caught off guard by the bright neon pink color and huge heel bevel.

It would be one thing if there were a few pops of hot pink throughout the shoe, but having almost the entire shoe all the same bright color is a bit much.

Aside from the blinding color, I noticed that the heel bevel came out really far, but wasn't rounded much underneath. When I put them on the rocker felt very obvious. I almost felt like I was losing my balance walking around in them.

That balance issue has been a thing with other recent shoes and it's notable that they are 100% for running, not walking around. Once you start moving the rocker helps to prevent all that foam from just slowing you down, instead it aids in your momentum.

I also noticed that they were very squeaky. As I was trying to leave for my 5am run I was worried I'd wake up my family with how loud they were.

But let's talk about the actual run because that's what matters.

They had a smooth, cushioned ride and felt like a pretty stable shoe. I was expecting that these would feel like a fast shoe, but that wasn't the case. In fact, I was a little unsure about what speed I wanted to run in them. The soft cushioning encouraged a nice easy run, but the rocker felt more suited for some faster running.

In fact, we'd say this might fall in the category of the Saucony Endorphin Trainer. It's bouncy, it's got a max cushion, but it doesn't give you that fast feeling of other Saucony Endorphin shoes.

While I wouldn't wear them for over 10 miles, many of you might disagree. A super trainer should allow you to take them out on long runs to aid in that more recovered feeling for the next workout.

Pros


Smooth cushioned ride
Roomy toebox
Lightweight



Cons


Large heel bevel
Not ideal for long runs
Squeaky



Personally I think the hot pink neon color is a bit much. I'm all about fun colors on running shoes but these are just a little overboard. There are 4 colors offered: neon pink, neon yellow, neon orange, and plain white. And I know that performance matters more than looks, but these just don't feel worth the $200 price tag.

Coach Amanda: Listen I'm not a huge colors person either, but I've heard loud and clear from most of you that color is a winning feature. So for all of you, rock on this is going to make you feel bright and bold!

The toe box is nice and roomy which I appreciate. The width of the shoe tapers around the midfoot and is not as wide there, but does offer some space again in the heel. I wouldn't necessarily say it's perfect for wide feet, but it does offer a decent amount of space in the forefoot and heel.

These fit true to size and are even a bit roomy, but once I tied the laces well they were pretty much a perfect fit. The tongue stays secure and the upper is soft and comfortable. Even with some space around the heel my foot stayed in place once the shoe was tied well.

The R.A.D. UFO uses “SupeFoam” (that's not a typo- there's no “r”)  which is a dual-layer PEBA blend.

There is a soft layer to reduce fatigue and improve running economy, and a firm layer for energy return. I only felt the soft layer, which is what you should notice. That firmer layer is really to help ensure you don't sink into the shoe and lose all the momentum.

I just didn't feel that energy return which meant that going faster than tempo pace just didn't feel right in these. Again, that's a mental block where may the color made me want to think of them as a fast shoe, when really they are more like a daily trainer.

This is a pretty light shoe and that's exactly how it felt on the run. It looks like it would be heavier than it is.

But I do worry about the durability. The material of the outsole feels like it may not last long. After some miles I kind of felt like my feet were sinking into the shoe. While these shoes offer a lot of cushioning, they also felt pretty stable on the run. They have a wide sole at the heel and forefoot which I think helps with that.

Occasionally I found my heel scraping the ground during initial contact. Perhaps this is due to my running form, but I think in part it was because of that large heel bevel that extends well beyond the back of the shoe.

While I found the rocker to be very obvious while standing and walking, it wasn't as noticeable on the run. It did help with transitions and toe-off but I didn't feel like I was going to fall over like I did while standing in these shoes.

The moderate 8 mm heel drop felt like the right amount for these high stack shoes- any higher and I think they would have felt less stable.

We've tested a few that feel similar, but different based on the brand fit:

Our Verdict

The more I ran in the R.A.D. UFOs, the more they grew on me. While they are not a shoe I will pull out multiple times a week I do think that they will be a good addition to my shoe rotation. If you're looking for a highly cushioned super trainer that is smooth and bouncy, these are worth checking out.

Inspired by the scary film franchise, playwright Levi Holloway and Punchdrunk maestro Felix Barrett are bringing the ‘bizarrely joyous' world of terror to the stage

Malevolent spirits be damned – theatres can be haunted simply by the memory of bad plays and perhaps unscary horror in particular. The last time London's Ambassadors theatre aimed to give audiences the shivers, with The Enfield Haunting, it led to some frightfully poor reviews. But a couple of years later, this intimate West End playhouse is hosting Paranormal Activity, a new instalment in the franchise that was kickstarted by a low-budget supernatural movie about a couple plagued by inexplicable nocturnal noises. “Hold your nerve” runs the play's tagline – a directive you suspect applies not just to the audience.

Arriving at the theatre on the day of the first preview, it's not creepy bumps and thuds that echo through the building but whizzing drills, sound checks and the last-minute discussions of a crew with a deadline. Perched in the dress circle bar, US playwright Levi Holloway and director Felix Barrett (best known as the founder of immersive theatre specialists Punchdrunk) are discussing how rarely they have been frightened in the theatre.

“I saw The Woman in Black 20 years ago,” says Barrett. “I so wanted it to be the most terrifying thing I'd ever seen. There were flourishes and moments but it just didn't get me … I haven't seen anything that has really scared me. We're raising the bar on that ambition.”

Holloway's CV includes Grey House, a hair-raising drama set in a cabin amid a blizzard, as well as a retelling of Pinocchio that amps up the fairytale's fear factor. “I think horror in theatre is a burden and a privilege,” he says. “It's pretty daunting. If the first question you ask is how you scare someone, you're probably off on the wrong foot … Good theatre is usually about people being forced to change. And horror usually has people being forced to change in order to survive. So you just have to have a good, honest story. The weapons you deploy to unnerve or scare have to be in the narrative.”

The pair make the case that horror brings audiences together like no other genre – more even than musicals or comedy. “It's a bit of a sanity check with your neighbour, which seems kind of relevant right now,” says Holloway. “Like, does this scare you too? Yeah, stranger, this does scare me too!”

Barrett says it provides catharsis “when the world itself is very scary” and the result is “bizarrely joyous”. Holloway adds: “Imagine if a rollercoaster only had one car. It's a different thing. There's something so thrilling about the camaraderie that happens in the lobby at the interval or after the show.” The pair enjoy eavesdropping on rattled audience members wrapping their heads around the show's mystery.

Paranormal Activity premiered at Leeds Playhouse in the summer of 2024 (it has since been given a new ending) and a parallel production is touring the US to great acclaim. “What's amazing about this, which is different from anything that I've done before, is that we did the illusions first,” says Barrett. Illusions designer Chris Fisher is more used to being summoned later in the process. “The clue's in the title – we knew they needed to be baked in,” Barrett explains.

Set designer Fly Davis has created a two-storey house for the play's couple who have recently married in Chicago and moved to London for a fresh start. “They quickly encounter a truth that they can't run from,” says Holloway. “So it's about a marriage and it's about the ghosts each person brings into that marriage.”

The first Paranormal Activity film, written and directed by Oren Peli and filmed in his own house over seven days, suggested that people can be as unfathomable as the occult – perhaps as malicious as any demon. The seven films in the franchise also explore the frazzled states that come with change and leave us vulnerable – such as moving to a new city or having a family. Starting work on the show, Barrett and Holloway were as sleep-deprived as the average doomed Paranormal Activity character. “Our sons were born back to back when we started this process,” says Holloway. “The original haunting!” laughs Barrett. Holloway says he hopes that audiences find the couple in the play familiar as his script “gives teeth to the mundane”. For Barrett, “it's a portrait of a marriage and then there's a third force coming in”. Holloway laughs: “A throuple!”

What excited Barrett about the project was the memory of a trailer for the first film in 2009 featuring cinemagoers' terrified responses. (It helped create a buzz that saw the $15,000 film make more than $100m within weeks at the US box office.) Barrett's eyes flash as he savours the opportunity “to make an audience physically recoil in the theatre”. Seeing “the sweat and the fear in the eyes of the cast” will, he hopes, “bring it home all the more directly”.

Grounding the story in realism has been key. The franchise followed the found-footage technique of The Blair Witch Project, with the first film featuring a series of timecoded nocturnal video recordings made by the couple who – like the audience – scrutinise each frame to help uncover the uncanny activity. It's a “genius device” for a film, says Barrett. “But we made the decision on day one to not do that – let's come up with a story that's about liveness and about the threat and plausibility of what a live audience would be scared of.” He adds: “There's a lot of cinematic trickery and camera work happening across theatre generally … we wanted to get under your skin and play with the idea of safety, what happens when that is under threat.”

Horror theatre is all the rage. 2: 22 – A Ghost Story, with its celebrity-led casts, had several West End seasons and is on tour. The macabre comedy Inside No 9: Stage/Fright returns for another London run in January. Rose Glass's haunting film Saint Maud was brought spectacularly to the stage in Newcastle last year. Meanwhile Stranger Things: The First Shadow has run for two years at the Phoenix theatre in London and is likely to get a boost from the fifth season of the Netflix show.

What do the pair say to those who bemoan the dominance of plays based on such existing IP? “They're in the service of bringing new audiences to the theatre,” says Holloway, who points out: “We've been lucky enough to do something original that is tied to a franchise, but it is about our fingerprint.”

Barrett says that while the Paranormal Activity banner will attract new theatregoers, Holloway has written an emotionally affecting play that “could have a different title and be on at the Royal Court instead … There are touchstones that audiences are going to know if they're into the franchise but we've striven to create something with substance.”

On the play's previous outings, both have noticed an audience new to the world of theatre. “Like people shouting at the stage, ‘Don't go in there!' It's so noisy,” says Holloway. “It took a minute, but then we just started embracing it because people are coming in and they're like … is this what theatre can be?”

Horror films and books fuelled the duo's collaboration and burgeoning friendship. They rewatched Don't Look Now, Jacob's Ladder and When a Stranger Calls, turned to the stories of Arthur Machen and the novels of Joe Hill. “We love creeping dread rather than schlocky gore,” adds Barrett. “The tendrils of a film wrapping around your neck.” As such, atmosphere is critical to Paranormal Activity, which has a sound design by Gareth Fry and lighting by Anna Watson.

“The lights are as much a part of the narrative as the design, the illusion, the cast … You need an alchemy of ingredients to have the space in between,” says Barrett. “With a two-storey house you can't watch everything simultaneously. There are corners and shadows where your imagination fills in the gaps. Anna's lighting is amazing. You think you can just see to the back of the room but you can't quite. As the claustrophobia builds, your imagination is starting to play tricks on you, like when you're a kid in your bedroom.” In rehearsals, the company discussed their childhood fears and played games such as “grandmother's footsteps”.

Holloway: “The whole thing is kind of a dare.”
 Barrett: “It is! I yelped with fear and joy yesterday.”
 Holloway: “Yesterday! You've seen it a thousand times already …”
 Barrett: “It's a visceral response. And it's taken the journey from Leeds to here to get to that physicality.”

The Ambassadors, with its proscenium arch, is a very un-Punchdrunk setting. “It's like an amazing holiday,” Barrett laughs. “I'm getting a taste for it!” His company, founded in 2000, built a huge fanbase by taking over often unconventional spaces for site-specific spectaculars. More recently, their shows (including the gothic Viola's Room) have been put on at their sprawling headquarters at Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, south-east London. But years of finding the right sites for their shows have given Barrett an astute understanding of a building's feel.

“The base job of any Punchdrunk show is to listen to the atmosphere of the space, work out where the threat is, the perceptible residue of something that's gone before – the weight of time that can be felt keenly in a space.”

But how much do they believe in the whole supernatural shebang? “I would love to believe,” says Holloway. “And I do believe people when they believe it. But I've never experienced the paranormal. I'm open to it.” Barrett adds: “I profoundly don't believe but I'm obsessed with the history of spiritualism.”

Several West End theatres are said to house ghosts, from “the Man in Grey” at Theatre Royal Drury Lane to an actor-manager at Theatre Royal Haymarket. But the Ambassadors is not famously haunted. “It will be after this show,” jokes Barrett. Holloway chuckles: “We're working on it!”

 Paranormal Activity is at the Ambassadors theatre, London, until 28 March and on a US tour until 15 March","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","other"

Grab a seat in the Impala, buckle up, and enjoy the ride because the Winchesters are back — kind of. In case you missed it, the demon-hunting siblings of Supernatural recently made their return a full 20 years after the debut of the hit series by way of a new comic series. Written by Greg Pak and illustrated by Eder Messias, the first issue hit shelves back in October with the third installment slated for an arrival on December 17. The best part about the new project is that it carries fans back to the glory days of yesteryear as it takes place between the first and second seasons of the TV show when it was just two brothers fighting the forces of evil with their beloved Impala by their side.

The latest to come from the folks at Dynamite, the Supernatural comic returns fans to that sweet spot and takes them along with Sam and Dean while they travel from one American town to the next in search of monsters. Many fans would agree that the first five seasons of the Eric Kripke-created teen drama were the best of the batch and this new, more colorful version sticks to what made the show great in the first place. For those out there who are ready to reconnect with the Winchester brothers, but aren't quite sure they can do a 15-season rewatch, the first few issues are precisely what the doctor ordered.

In the last five years since the fan-favorite series came to an end, fans have questioned whether this was truly the last time that we'd see Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki as Dean and Sam Winchester, respectively. In that time, the pair have joined with several other cast mates to travel around the world and meet fans at special Supernatural conventions, which has certainly kept the hope alive. Right now, both leading men are incredibly busy with their own projects and hustles, but there is still a chance that the gang will get back together again, it just might look a little bit different. While celebrating the pilot's 20 year anniversary, Ackles said, “We're all a lot older than we were 20 years ago. I don't know if I have 22 episodes of Supernatural in me. I think a limited series would be great.”

For now, audiences can continue the story by going back in time to the golden era of Supernatural with Dynamite's new comic series.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","The Only Supernatural Sequel Worth Making Just Got Way More Likely","https://screenrant.com/supernatural-sequel-best-pitch-comic-meta-tv-show/","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

Thanks to Dynamite, Dean and Sam Winchester have officially returned to Supernatural for a Season 1.5, and yes, this is a canonical return. With the brothers back to small-town monster hunting, the only Supernatural sequel worth making just became more likely: a spinoff that explores Adam's time in Hell.

For those out of the loop, Sam and Dean have returned to the Golden Era of Supernatural in Greg Pak & Eder Messias' Supernatural comic series, set between Seasons 1 and 2 of the TV show.

Part of the official canon, the series returns to the beloved “monster-of-the-week” format. Two issues have been released so far, with Supernatural #3 hitting comic shelves on December 17, 2025. So why does this series make a sequel more likely than ever?

The fact that the Supernatural franchise is once again dipping its toes into comics makes it more likely that this universe will continue to be explored in this format. With Dynamite's Supernatural taking place between Seasons 1 and 2, it's clear the publisher is interested in expanding lore directly connected to the TV series.

Dynamite could truly capitalize on building a comic empire for the Supernatural franchise. If they do, a sequel exploring Adam's time in Hell should be a top priority. Fans have long been curious about the “forgotten Winchester” brother, and now is the perfect opportunity for the comics to explore this previously untold, yet canon, part of the TV series.

For those needing a quick refresher, Adam Milligan was Sam and Dean Winchester's half-brother, introduced in Season 4, Episode 19, “Jump the Shark.” The brothers didn't know he existed until they investigated a case that ended with the discovery that Adam and his mother had been killed by a ghoul.

Adam was eventually resurrected by angels to serve as a temporary vessel for the archangel Michael in the Season 5 finale after Dean refused. However, Michael/Adam falls into Lucifer's Cage along with Sam. While Sam is rescued from Hell the following season, Adam remains trapped, and the fact that he was essentially forgotten has long been a running joke among fans.

Adam is ultimately remembered in Season 15. After a decade trapped in the Cage, he is freed, sharing his body with Michael and switching control with him. When Chuck kills Michael, Adam's soul survives, with the show implying that he finally finds peace, closing a wild chapter in the Winchester saga.

While the show eventually tied up Adam's story, fans were never shown his time in Hell with Michael. With Supernatural returning for Season 1.5 through Dynamite, it would be beyond epic if a spin-off series explored Adam and Michael's full story in Hell, finally giving fans the long-awaited exploration of the “forgotten Winchester” brother's untold journey.

SUPERNATURAL #1 & #2 is available now from DYNAMITE!

A seer from Pakistan has emerged with a chilling prediction for the imminent future. Riaz Ahmed Shahi foresees a comet colliding with Earth, resulting in the annihilation of all life forms before the end of this year.

According to the Daily Mail, he believes this catastrophe will serve as retribution for humanity straying ""too far from spiritual truths"". In his 2000 book The Religion of God, Shahi writes: ""A comet has been sent towards Earth for total destruction. The comet is expected to fall on Earth in the next 20-25 years. That will be the last day of this world"". The clairvoyant is a spiritual leader and founder of several organisations, including Anjuman Serfaroshan-e- Islam and Messiah Foundation International (MFI), which propagate his philosophy of ""divine love"".

His teachings combine Sufism, an Islamic sect, and eschatology, and he has been vocal about his criticism of governments and entities that prioritise space exploration over human welfare. In another part of his book, he questions: ""If they are making all these efforts for scientific research, what is the benefit to humanity even if they have reached the Moon and Jupiter?""

He further challenges: ""Have they discovered a breakthrough medicine which can prolong the ageing process, or a medicine that can defeat death?'"" The book hit the shelves just before Shahi mysteriously vanished in London in 2001.

Despite his disappearance, followers believe he's been alive and in hiding for the past quarter-century. Some disciples at the MFI add to the prophecy, predicting that the comet would trigger tsunamis, earthquakes and widespread social upheaval, reports the Express. However, the organisation tasked with keeping an eye on cosmic activities doesn't seem to be losing any sleep over these predictions. NASA has confirmed that no celestial bodies are on a collision course with Earth this year. The nearest comet set to traverse our solar system is 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to maintain a safe distance of no less than 170 million miles from our planet.

Research led by Julia Aspernäs (Linköping University)

 Dec 12, 2025

Conservatives are more likely than liberals to believe conspiracy theories and share fake science news. But when it comes to bending the truth to support their political team, both sides do it equally.

That's the key finding from a large Swedish study that tracked how people across the political spectrum responded to different types of misinformation. Across three studies with samples of 1,005 (Sweden), 417 (U.K.), and 1,008 (Sweden) — with one Swedish sample analyzed in two separate papers — the research offers a more nuanced picture than the usual “one side is worse” narrative that dominates debates about fake news.

Author Julia Aspernäs, from the Department of Behavioural Sciences and Learning at Linköping University in Sweden, found evidence of both symmetries and asymmetries in misinformation susceptibility. It all depends on what type of misinformation you're looking at.

When researchers asked people about conspiracy theories, like whether the science behind global warming has been invented or distorted, or whether experiments with new drugs are routinely carried out on the public without their knowledge or consent, conservatives consistently believed them more often than liberals. This pattern held up even after accounting for other factors like education level and thinking styles.

The gap extended to sharing behavior too. When participants encountered scientific results in a fictional social media scenario covering controversial topics like gender differences, organized crime, and unemployment, conservatives reported higher willingness to post misleading summaries that twisted the research to match their views.

Aspernäs also tested whether people could spot flawed logic in political arguments. They created puzzles where participants had to figure out if a conclusion actually followed from the evidence presented—like a detective checking if the clues really point to the suspect.

Some arguments had conservative conclusions. Others had liberal ones. The trick was that participants were told to ignore whether they agreed with the content and just check if the logic worked.

Both liberals and conservatives failed this test in the same way. When an argument supported their political views, they'd often accept it even when the logic was broken. When an argument opposed their views, they'd reject it even when the reasoning was sound.

A conservative might nod along to a logically flawed argument for tax cuts. A liberal might do the same for a poorly reasoned argument about wealth inequality. Neither side was better at catching their own bias.

This matters because it suggests that when people have skin in the game politically, they bend facts at similar rates regardless of ideology.

One trait did protect people from some types of misinformation: taking time to think things through rather than going with gut instinct.

Aspernäs tested this with trick questions. Here's an example: “A bat and a ball cost 110 kronor total. The bat costs 100 kronor more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?”

Most people immediately think “10 kronor.” But if you pause and work it out, the answer is actually 5 kronor.

People who caught these tricks were better at spotting logical flaws in political arguments, whether conservative or liberal. Slowing down and double-checking your instincts appeared to help people resist at least some forms of bias.

But analytical thinking wasn't a cure-all. It helped with logic puzzles but didn't stop people from believing conspiracy theories or sharing misleading science posts. Something else was going on there.

Aspernäs uncovered another factor that has been almost completely neglected in misinformation research: what people believe about truth itself.

Some people lean toward thinking truth is objective: either the earth is round or it isn't, regardless of anyone's opinion. Others lean toward thinking truth is personal or subjective. Someone with strong subjectivist beliefs might agree that “truth is nothing more than a person's subjective experience of the world.”

People with stronger subjectivist beliefs about truth were more likely to fall for impressive-sounding nonsense, believe conspiracy theories, and report willingness to share fake science news. This held true across the political spectrum. It wasn't that conservatives believed truth was more subjective, they just happened to believe more conspiracy theories for other reasons.

This finding points to a deeper vulnerability than political bias. If someone thinks truth depends on personal feelings rather than evidence, they may be more susceptible to misinformation that triggers the right emotions, regardless of facts.

The study doesn't fully explain why conservatives show higher rates of conspiracy belief. It's not that they're worse at analytical thinking or more biased in general; the research found them similar to liberals on those dimensions.

One possibility is that conservative ideology attracts people with certain personality traits, like stronger distrust of institutions, that also make conspiracy theories more appealing. Another is that right now, many popular conspiracy theories happen to align with conservative narratives, though this wouldn't explain why the pattern shows up even with politically neutral conspiracies.

Aspernäs stresses that the findings describe group averages, not individuals. Plenty of conservatives reject conspiracy theories completely. Plenty of liberals believe them. The differences, while real, are modest.

Both sides engage in motivated reasoning when their political identity is threatened. But conservatives show an additional vulnerability to conspiracy thinking and science misinformation that appears separate from this bias.

This creates a challenge for fighting fake news. Different problems need different solutions. Teaching people to check their logic might help with motivated reasoning. But conspiracy beliefs might require addressing deeper issues about trust in institutions. And if someone fundamentally believes truth is subjective, fact-checking might not work at all.

It's worth noting that the study was conducted in Sweden and the United Kingdom, where the political landscape differs from the United States. American conservatives might show different patterns than Swedish or British ones. But the finding that misinformation susceptibility isn't one-dimensional — that people can be resistant to some types while vulnerable to others — likely applies across cultures.

Perhaps the biggest takeaway is this: accusations that “the other side” is uniquely prone to fake news miss the mark. Everyone has vulnerabilities. They just show up in different ways depending on what you're measuring.

The research used online surveys where people reported their own beliefs and stated willingness rather than tracking actual behavior. People may not always accurately report what they believe, or their survey responses might not match how they'd act in real situations. The science misinformation measure used hypothetical social media scenarios rather than observing what people actually share online.

One study asked participants to evaluate logical arguments but instructed them not to think too long before answering, which might have accidentally encouraged snap judgments over careful reasoning. An attempt to experimentally manipulate people's beliefs about truth was unsuccessful, preventing conclusions about whether believing truth is subjective actually causes greater susceptibility to misinformation.

All participants came from Sweden or the United Kingdom. Patterns might differ in other countries with different political cultures and media environments.

We have officially entered the conspiracy theory phase of the Philadelphia Eagles season, and honestly, it was only a matter of time. When a team loses three straight games, all of them as favorites, the brain starts reaching for explanations that go beyond missed throws and bad turnovers.

That is how we ended up here, with fans squinting at HBO's Hard Knocks like it is the Zapruder film. Is it convenient that Hard Knocks shows up right when the Eagles looked like they had the NFC East wrapped up and then everything immediately goes sideways? Sure.

Does that mean the league, HBO, and the football gods got together to sabotage the offense? No. After the past few weeks, I understand why people are at least entertaining the thought.

Angry fanbase, star quarterback struggling, offense sputtering, and a weekly primetime microscope courtesy of HBO. ESPN, HBO, and every rage bait outlet in existence is eating this up.

What they fail to realize is that Birds fans are sports psychopaths in the most affectionate sense. We will consume every clip, every rumor, and every half baked theory no matter how ridiculous it is.

After the we crushed the Chiefs in the Super Bowl, this franchise felt like it was becoming the gold standard of the NFL. That made a lot of people uncomfortable. For whatever reason, everyone outside Philadelphia hates the Eagles.

Maybe it is the fans. Maybe it is Jalen Hurts being different than the traditional quarterback mold. Maybe it is Nick Sirianni. I truly do not care. The hate is real, and it always has been.

That is why the Hard Knocks discourse has taken off the way it has. People are watching because the Birds are struggling, not because the league is scripted. If the NFL were scripted, the Chiefs would have already three-peated and we would not even be having this conversation.

Just when you thought it couldn't possibly get any worse, Spike Eskin proposes an ‘Eagles Positivity Pledge' against the Raiders on Sunday which includes standing ovations and no booing >>

At some point, the conspiracy theories stop being fun and start becoming a distraction. We are there now. The mental gymnastics are exhausting. The Eagles are not losing because of cameras, producers, or a hidden agenda. They are losing because they are playing bad football and beating themselves.

The solution is simple. Go out on Sunday, crush the Raiders, and get this thing back on track. Win games and the noise dies down. Win games and Hard Knocks is forced to show the Eagles doing what they do best. Winning.

Enough talk. Beat the Raiders, stabilize the season, and let the rest sort itself out.

A thick layer of more than 12 miles of rock may explain why Bermuda seems to float above the surrounding ocean.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Move aside, Bermuda Triangle: The newest North Atlantic mystery lies beneath this enigmatic archipelago. Scientists have discovered a strange, 12.4-mile-thick (20 kilometers) rock layer below the oceanic crust under Bermuda. This level of thickness has never been seen in any other similar layer worldwide.

""Typically, you have the bottom of the oceanic crust and then it would be expected to be the mantle,"" said study lead author William Frazer, a seismologist at Carnegie Science in Washington D.C. ""But in Bermuda, there is this other layer that is emplaced beneath the crust, within the tectonic plate that Bermuda sits on.""

While the origin of this layer is not entirely clear, it may explain an ongoing mystery about Bermuda, Frazer told Live Science. The island sits on an oceanic swell, where the ocean crust is higher than its surroundings. But there is no evidence of any ongoing volcanic activity creating that swell — the island's last known volcanic eruption was 31 million years ago.

The discovery of the new giant ""structure"" suggests the last eruption may have injected mantle rock into the crust, where it froze in place, creating something like a raft that raises the ocean floor by about 1,640 feet (500 meters).

Bermuda has long had a reputation for mystery, largely because of the Bermuda Triangle, an area between the archipelago, Florida and Puerto Rico where a supposedly unusual number of ships and aircraft have gone missing. (This reputation, however, has been largely exaggerated.) The real mystery, though, is why the Bermuda oceanic swell exists.

Island chains such as Hawaii are thought to exist because of mantle hotspots, which are places in the mantle where hot material rises, creating volcanic activity. At the point where the hotspot meets the crust, the ocean floor often buoys up. But when tectonic movement slides the crust away from that hotspot, the oceanic swell typically subsides.

Bermuda's swell hasn't subsided, despite 31 million years of volcanic inactivity there, Frazer said. There is some debate over what's happening in the mantle beneath the island, but there are no eruptions happening at the surface.

Frazer and study co-author Jeffrey Park, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Yale University, used recordings from a seismic station on Bermuda of distant large earthquakes around the world to get an image of Earth down to about 31 miles (50 km) below Bermuda. They examined places where the seismic waves from these quakes suddenly changed. This revealed the unusually thick layer of rock, which is less dense than the other rock around it.

Their findings were published Nov. 28 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

""There is still this material that is left over from the days of active volcanism under Bermuda that is helping to potentially hold it up as this area of high relief in the Atlantic Ocean,"" Sarah Mazza, a geologist at Smith College in Massachusetts who was not involved in the work, told Live Science.

Mazza's own research into Bermuda's volcanic history found that the types of lavas there are low in the mineral silica, which is a sign that they come from rock high in carbon. Mazza's examination of variations in zinc molecules in samples from Bermuda, published in September in the journal Geology, found that this carbon comes from deep in the mantle. It was likely first pushed there when the supercontinent Pangea formed between 900 million and 300 million years ago, Mazza said. This is different from what is seen at hotspot-formed islands in the Pacific or Indian oceans, she added. This difference may be because the Atlantic, which opened up when Pangea split apart, is a young ocean compared to the Pacific or Indian oceans, which were at Pangea's edges.

— Mysterious 'blobs' in Earth's mantle are not what we thought, study claims

— Extreme 'paradise' volcano in Costa Rica is like a piece of ancient Mars on our doorstep

""The fact that we are in an area that was previously the heart of the last supercontinent is, I think, part of the story of why this is unique,"" she said.

Frazer is now examining other islands around the world to find out if there are any similar layers to the one found under Bermuda, or whether the archipelago is truly one of a kind.

""Understanding a place like Bermuda, which is an extreme location, is important to understand places that are less extreme,"" Frazer said, ""and gives us a sense of what are the more normal processes that happen on Earth and what are the more extreme processes that happen.""

      6 videos released by AARO throughout this month (12/25) I've included the report name and date of sighting at the beginning of each clip.
    


      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, opinions on Reddit are varied and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and credible cases:
    


Description: Over 60 children at the Ariel School in Zimbabwe witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard and a few beings coming out.
    


Credibility: The incident was investigated by a well-known psychologist, and there are numerous witness testimonies. ""The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Surprised it hasn't been mentioned. 60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out.""



Description: A Japanese pilot had a multi-hour documented encounter with a UFO that broke off into several smaller UFOs.
    


Credibility: The sighting was confirmed by ground radar, and the pilot was put on desk duty for disclosing the incident. ""Mid 1980s a Japanese pilot, had a multi-hour documented encounter with a UFO, that broke off into several smaller UFOs that surrounded his plane.""



Description: Military personnel, radars, and a civilian plane encountered a UFO. The radar signature resembled a Boeing 707, and instrumentation failed when approaching the object.
    


Credibility: Multiple witnesses, radar confirmation, and a military spy satellite recorded the incident. ""1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO.""



Description: Thousands of people in Arizona witnessed a massive, V-shaped formation of lights in the sky.
    


Credibility: Numerous witnesses, including the governor at the time, confirmed seeing the phenomenon. ""I live in AZ, and saw the Phoenix Lights with my own eyes, (which actually happened twice).""



Description: Military personnel at a US Air Force base in England reported seeing strange lights and a craft in the forest.
    


Credibility: Multiple military witnesses, audio recordings, and official reports support the claims. ""Rendelsham Forest or Shag Harbour.""



Description: Several witnesses in Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, saw a large, illuminated object crash into the water.
    


Credibility: Multiple independent witnesses and official investigations confirmed the event. ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shag_Harbour_UFO_incident""



Description: US Navy pilots encountered a Tic Tac-shaped object performing impossible maneuvers.
    


Credibility: Pilot testimony, FLIR footage, and official confirmation from the US Navy make this case highly credible. ""I think the Nimitz/tic tac sighting in 2004 is likely to have the most credence to a skeptic given the pilot testimony and FLIR footage.""



Description: US Air Force personnel at two bases in England reported seeing multiple UFOs on radar and visually.
    


Credibility: Official radar logs and multiple military witnesses confirmed the sightings. ""Lakenheath Bentwaters 1956, Kenneth Arnold 1947, Malmstrom, The Colares Incident, Stephenville 2008, Yukon 1996, and the Montreal UFO to name a few.""



Description: A supposed crash of a UFO near Roswell, New Mexico, which the government initially confirmed as a ""flying disc"" before retracting the statement.
    


Credibility: Numerous eyewitnesses claimed to see alien bodies and a large military cover-up. ""I know it'll probably get me downvoted, but I'd say Roswell.""



Description: The US military used anti-aircraft weapons against an unidentified object over Los Angeles.
    


Credibility: Multiple witnesses and official military reports confirm the event. ""The Battle of Los Angeles where the military had to resort to using AA weapons against a 'weather balloon'.""



Description: A pilot reported seeing nine disc-shaped objects flying in a formation near Mount Rainier.
    


Credibility: This sighting coined the term ""flying saucer"" and was widely reported. ""Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting""



Description: Similar to the Ariel School incident, this involved multiple children witnessing a UFO.
    


Credibility: Numerous child witnesses and subsequent investigations. ""The Ariel encounter, Zimbabwe, Westall, Australia, The Phoenix Lights USA, Holloway Air Force Base USA, Falcon Lake, USA, Pentrych, Wales, are all examples of well documented and extremely intriguing cases.""



Credibility: Several high-ranking military officials and astronauts have publicly stated their belief in UFOs and extraterrestrial life. ""I believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets which obviously are a little more technically advanced than we are here on Earth.""

r/aliens



r/HighStrangeness



      These cases represent some of the most compelling evidence for UFOs, supported by multiple witnesses, radar confirmations, and official investigations. While skepticism is healthy, these incidents provide a strong basis for further exploration and discussion.

Your company's Dell laptops are about to cost more.

Starting December 17, the computer maker is set to hike prices across its commercial product lines, according to an internal list of upcoming price changes sent to staff on December 9 and seen by Business Insider.

The list outlines price hikes for Dell's commercial business — meaning its sales to corporate clients rather than individual consumers. The commercial business accounts for about 85% of Dell's annual revenue in the Client Solutions Group (CSG), the division that sells laptops and PCs, according to its latest annual results.

The company is one of the leading providers of computer hardware to US companies, and prices aren't just rising at Dell. An industry-wide shortage of memory and storage chips is driving up costs across the PC industry, affecting competitors like Lenovo and HP as well.

The soaring demand for AI infrastructure has tech companies snapping up enormous quantities of memory and storage chips, increasing competition for consumer devices.

A Dell spokesperson told Business Insider that ""like others in the industry, Dell takes targeted pricing action, when necessary, while maintaining supply continuity and its commitment to customer value.""

""Our supply chain is resilient and globally diverse. It's designed to offer the needed flexibility when navigating macroeconomic, regulatory and trade dynamics,"" the spokesperson said.

How much more expensive a laptop at Dell will be next week depends on how much memory and storage you require.

The global shortages are hitting two key types of chips that are essential components in most user devices: DRAM and NAND.

When you buy a laptop, DRAM — dynamic random-access memory — is the memory, usually 8GB to 32GB for an average customer. NAND — non-volatile flash memory — is used for SSD storage, typically around 512GB or 1TB.

From next week, Dell Pro and Pro Max notebooks and desktops with 32GB of memory will cost between $130 and $230 more, according to the list of price changes seen by Business Insider. If opting for the top-of-the-range 128GB memory, the price is set to rise by between $520 and $765 per device.

Selecting a laptop with 1 TB of storage will add to the overall cost by between $55 and $135.

An employee at Dell who works in sales said the percentage increase would be ""between 10% and 30%"" depending on the contract. They asked to remain anonymous as they are not permitted to speak publicly, but Business Insider has verified their employment.

The price list also includes price hikes for AI laptops containing Nvidia Blackwell GPUs and individual monitors. For example, a Dell Pro 55 Plus 4K Monitor, currently listed on Dell's website at $1,349.99, will be $150 more expensive, according to the price list.

AI laptops containing an Nvidia RTX PRO 500 Blackwell GPU with 6GB will become $66 more expensive, and a 24GB GPU will cost $530 more, the pricing chart shows.

""It's impacting everyone, and there's no way around it currently, so customers will just have to pay more if they want the products,"" the sales employee said.

Higher prices make for a tougher sell, already a challenge for sales teams amid today's tariff-weary consumers and enterprises.

Dell sent an email to its ""go-to-market"" (GTM) sales staff on November 25, which Business Insider has seen, outlining the ""critical next steps"" sellers should take to prepare ahead of the increase.

""Global memory and storage supply are tightening fast,"" Dell warned GTM team members.

The price of contracts for DRAM and NAND chips has ""already risen significantly this quarter, and suppliers are signaling further increases and allocation constraints driven by AI demand,"" Dell said in the email.

The company told its sellers to ""move decisively"" ahead of the price increases to ""protect value for our customers and for Dell.""

The email advised teams to engage with top accounts in the coming week, close deals, and plan significant opportunities and multi-quarter deals to protect the sales pipeline.

""Ordering today for future delivery DOES NOT lock in current pricing,"" Dell warned, but said that acting now would help customers stay ahead of ""significant anticipated memory increase.""

The Dell sales employee said that there had been an initial rush to help customers buy remaining inventory, but now the situation is largely viewed as ""out of our control.""

The employee said Dell was also absorbing some of the costs internally, through hits to margins and limiting discounts that sales staff can offer.

In the company's third-quarter earnings call on November 25, Jeff Clarke, Dell's COO and vice chairman, said the market's price increases were ""unprecedented.""

""We have not seen costs move at the rate that we've seen,"" Clarke said. ""Demand is way ahead of supply. And as we wade our way through that, we're going to lean on the things that we've always done.""

Tech companies are buying massive amounts of DRAM and NAND to power AI models and cloud services, leaving fewer chips for consumer devices.

Combined with global supply-chain tensions, the explosion in demand has prompted the three companies that dominate the DRAM market — Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron — to raise their prices.

DRAM prices are expected to rise 30% in the final quarter of 2025, having already increased by 50% so far this year, according to Counterpoint, a global technology market research firm.

""The entire supply chain simply can't meet the demand that is now required and that inevitably leads to these kinds of challenges,"" Bob O'Donnell, the president and chief analyst at Technalysis Research, told Business Insider.

These price increases will ""likely have a noticeable impact for all types of PCs from every PC vendor,"" said O'Donnell, adding that the supply shortage is expected to continue throughout 2026.

Five years after legalizing psilocybin to treat a raft of health problems, practitioners worry the industry has become too costly, too white, and too regulated. Can the landmark program find its footing?

Jenna Kluwe remembers all the beautiful moments she saw in a converted dental clinic in east Portland.

For six months, she managed the Journey Service Center, a “psilocybin service center” where adults 21 and older take supervised mushroom trips. She watched elderly clients with terminal illnesses able to enjoy life again. She saw one individual with obsessive compulsive disorder so severe they spent hours washing their hands who could casually eat food that fell on the floor.

“It's like five years of therapy in five hours,” Kluwe, a former therapist from Michigan, said.

In 2020, Oregon made history by becoming the first US state to legalize the use of psilocybin in a supervised setting, paving the way for magic mushrooms to treat depression, PTSD and other mental health challenges. A flurry of facilities like the Journey Service Center, as well as training centers for facilitators to guide the sessions, sprung up across the state.

But five years later, the pioneering industry is grappling with growing pains. Kluwe recalled how early last year, her business partner abruptly told her the center was out of money and would close in March – the first in a wave of closures that set off alarms about the viability of Oregon's program.

The Journey Service Center isn't alone. The state's total number of licensed service centers has dropped by nearly a third, to 24, since Oregon's psilocybin program launched in 2023. The state's 374 licensed facilitators, people who support clients during sessions, similarly fell. And just this week, Portland's largest “shroom room” – an 11,000 sq ft venue with views of Mt Hood offering guided trips in addition to corporate retreats – reportedly closed down.

“The attrition is setting in, and a lot of people are not renewing their license because it is hard to make money,” said Gary Bracelin, the owner of Drop Thesis Psilocybin Service Center.

Many worry about how the program's rules and fees have pushed the cost of a psilocybin session as high as $3,000, putting it out of reach for many just as psychedelics are gaining mainstream acceptance as a mental health treatment. Insurance typically doesn't cover sessions, meaning people have to pay out of pocket.

Furthermore, the industry is struggling to reach a diverse group of clients: state data show that most people who've taken legal psilocybin in Oregon are white, over 44 and earn more than roughly $95,000 or more a year.

Depending on who you ask, these are either signs of an experiment buckling under hefty rules and fees – or a landmark program finding its footing.

“It's not totally shocking for a brand new program to have a higher price tag,” said Heidi Pendergast, Oregon director of advocacy group Healing Advocacy Fund. She added: “I think that any new industry would see this sort of opening and closing.”

Pendergast pointed to data showing the program is safe with severe reactions vanishingly rare among the estimated 14,000 people who have taken legal psilocybin in the state since mid-2023.

Some practitioners, however, say the state has a long way to go to realize the program's promises, while other centers are experimenting with new ways to keep costs down, broaden their clientele, and integrate with the mainstream medical system.

Legal psilocybin seemed like a natural fit for Bracelin. The self-described serial entrepreneur previously founded a cannabis dispensary chain and did sales and marketing for outdoor products during snowboarding's early days. When the program launched, he started jumping through the many hoops for Drop Thesis to start taking clients in January 2024.

The first obstacle, he said, was finding a property that met the state's requirements to be more than 1,000 feet from a school and not located in a residential area – with a landlord willing to rent for the center. Bracelin said more than a dozen landlords turned him down before he found a spot. Then there was the challenge of getting insurance for a business centered on a federally illegal drug. The center used private funders instead of banks, he said.

Drop Thesis charges $2,900 for a session, which can last up to six hours as well as before and after meetings with a facilitator, while offering discounts to veterans and during Pride Month as well as one monthly scholarship that covers the full price, Bracelin said.

Factored into the price of a session is the cost of a facilitator and a “licensee representative” who walks clients through paperwork and other requirements. State rules require centers to pay a $10,000 annual licensing fees, install surveillance cameras, alarm systems and securely store mushrooms in safes.

“Some [rules] are definitely justified,” Bracelin said. “And some of them are total overkill, out of fear from people who don't understand the product.”

Meanwhile, he said the black market is thriving and less-regulated companies sell products marketed as “magic mushroom edibles” that contain chemicals, some dangerous, instead of psilocybin.

Adding to regulatory hurdles is the fact that Oregon's local governments can ask voters to ban psilocybin businesses, creating a patchwork of bans in 25 of Oregon's 36 counties and in dozens of cities.

Angela Allbee, the manager of Oregon's psilocybin program, said in an emailed statement that the state became the first to enact regulations for a drug that's federally illegal, and those regulations were written with broad input that have proven safe. As more data and feedback come in, the state will consider adjusting the rules, she said.

The drug's illegality at a national level also makes marketing difficult with social media companies banning content that mentions it, Pendergast said. A survey conducted by her group last year found that 58% of Oregon adults had “some or little knowledge” of psilocybin therapy.

After a wave of people trained to become facilitators, many dropped off because there weren't enough clients, said Max Kelemen, executive director of the Portland Psychedelic Society.

“It's like a cart before the horse,” he said.

Tucked away in a drab building in south-east Portland, the Pacific Northwest Integrative Center feels more like a yoga studio than a psilocybin center.

A sign inside advises visitors to remove their shoes before entering an open area where mats are spread out on the floor. Here, the center hosts “microdosing” sessions, where participants take a fraction of the amount of psilocybin used for profound, day-long psychedelic experiences.

Centers have turned to microdoses, which have been touted for their supposedly subtle cognitive benefits, to broaden their base of repeat clients with a less costly and time-consuming option.

Rules still require microdose clients to fill out paperwork and stay at the center for 30 minutes for their first session and 15 minutes for sessions afterward. The center fills that wait time with yoga or meditation classes for up to 25 people, offering packages of 10 microdose sessions for $200 (plus $10 to $20 for the psilocybin).

“Most of our microdosing is basically like a yoga class, where you take a microdose at the beginning and fill out a whole bunch of paperwork,” said Mike Averill, the center's founder.

Averill said clients will benefit by moving away from doing just a single day-long session to multiple doses in a community. But he added that microdosing will never be the center's main source of income, and insurers covering longer macrodose sessions would be key to long-term sustainability.

Drop Thesis also offers microdoses that are paired with black-light painting night or a 1920s-themed interactive murder mystery game. But Bracelin said potential microdose clients are still turned off by the requirements, especially how state regulations bar them from driving home.

“You're over regulating us because there is this fear that people are going to freak out and run naked down the street,” Bracelin said.

Early last year, Dr Eric Lee had cleared Oregon's bureaucratic hurdles and was on the verge of opening a psilocybin service center. But he hesitated – the only way to make it work financially was to charge clients the prohibitively high rate for a session.

Three years ago, Lee found himself depressed after being sued and breaking up with a longtime partner. A friend convinced Lee to go to a music festival where he took mushrooms, felt supported by his group of friends and bounced back.

Lee said he didn't want others to face barriers to that kind of experience. So he paused the opening and reworked the business model for Space Psychedelic Center, which charges $900 for a session. He said he cut costs by owning the building and running the center himself – cleaning, bookkeeping, and handling other chores. His facilitators are independent contractors paid $560 per session. But he acknowledged his model “isn't easily replicable”.

Although psilocybin is associated with mental health concerns, the 2020 ballot initiative that created Oregon's program was designed to keep it outside of the medical system. Now, many supporters say it needs an outside source of cash, which could come from integration with the medical system.

Oregon lawmakers earlier this year took a first step toward making that a reality.

Any adult who clears an initial screening can take psilocybin for any purpose. That removed medical gatekeeping. But it has kept doctors, counselors and other licensed professionals from discussing the legally gray drug with patients for fear of sanctions.

A new bill that takes effect next year allows medical professionals to discuss psilocybin with patients, which could open the door to insurance covering part of the cost.

Before a session, clients meet with facilitators for “preparation”, to discuss their goals, and again afterward for “integration”, to process the experience. Both meetings often touch on mental health, so a therapist who is also a facilitator could potentially bill insurance for those portions, said Averill, owner of the Integrative Center and a licensed therapist.

Colorado and New Mexico have both passed psilocybin laws that integrate the drug into their medical systems.

Erin Pappas, a facilitator at Drop Thesis and a doctoral student in psychiatric nursing, said she hopes psilocybin will be legally reclassified federally, allowing her to prescribe it to patients.

“We're having a mental health crisis in this country right now,” she said. “I don't understand the negativity against something that is working so well.”

But Kluwe, the manager of the closed Journey Service Center, cautioned that insurance coverage might not be a panacea. She said insurers are not likely to cover psilocybin for grief because it isn't medically necessary.

“Why are we making this so hard for this program to work?” she said.

Rebecca Martinez worked as the volunteer coordinator for the 2020 ballot initiative that legalized psilocybin in Oregon. But after voters approved it, she began to have regrets.

She heard critiques that the initiative would create an overly restrictive system that would cost too much and worsen existing disparities. She started worrying the system critics warned of was taking hold.

Instead of stepping back, she went on to co-found the Alma Institute, a now defunct facilitator training school with a focus on diversifying the workforce. Last year, she co-founded the Cora Center, the first center with a majority of Bipoc and LGBTQ+ facilitators.

Located in a converted residential home on a busy Portland street, the center specializes in group sessions of six to eight participants. Group sessions mean lower costs because the cost of facilitators is split among multiple clients. Sessions take place in a hall-like room centered on an altar with a candle, traditional herbs, and a charango – a small Andean stringed instrument. The center's lead facilitators, both raised in the Andes, aim to blend Oregon's psilocybin framework with their ancestral traditions, Martinez said.

“There's just something special that happens in groups,” Martinez said. “Especially if they have a shared purpose, whether it's a grief group or people living with chronic pain, or if they share a lived experience or identity.”

The center welcomes everyone and its clients are mostly white. It also holds quarterly sessions for people of color and plans to add one for immigrants, Martinez said. Prices are sliding scale, with group sessions ranging from $650 to $1,200. The Sheri Eckert Foundation, a psilocybin financial-aid nonprofit, also sponsors some groups.

Still, Martinez said the state-required demographic data shows the center has more work to do to ensure psilocybin is accessible. Currently, the center is in a sprint to get enough partner organizations and programming to keep its doors open, she said. If not, it'll close in June.

“I'm still hopeful that this model can work,” Martinez said. “But a lot of things would have to go right. And it's possible.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","EU officials ‘raping the law'","https://www.rt.com/news/629357-orban-eu-raping-law/","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 09:33:00 GMT","

EU officials are “systematically raping the law” by planning to strip member states of veto powers over frozen Russian assets, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said.

The European Commission is due to vote later on Friday on a plan to invoke Article 122 of the EU treaties, an emergency clause that allows decisions to pass by qualified majority instead of requiring unanimous approval. The measure would let the bloc immobilize frozen Russian sovereign assets indefinitely and use the profits or interest to support Ukraine – even if some member states object.

“With today's procedure, the Brusselians are abolishing the requirement of unanimity with a single stroke of the pen, which is clearly unlawful,” Orban wrote on X on Friday. “The rule of law in the European Union comes to an end, and Europe's leaders are placing themselves above the rules. Instead of safeguarding compliance with the EU treaties, the European Commission is systematically raping European law.”

Orban accused EU “bureaucrats” and warmongers of pushing the move “to continue the war in Ukraine, a war that clearly isn't winnable.”

“With this, the rule of law in the EU is being replaced by the rule of bureaucrats. In other words, a Brusselian dictatorship has taken hold,” he said. “Hungary protests this decision and will do everything in its power to restore a lawful order.”

Kiev's Western backers froze about $300 billion in Russian central bank assets after the Ukraine conflict escalated in 2022, with most of it held at Brussels-based Euroclear. A sharp dispute has emerged in recent weeks between European nations seeking to use the frozen funds as collateral for a ‘reparations loan' for Kiev and those firmly opposed, citing legal and financial risks.

Invoking the emergency clause to freeze the assets indefinitely would strip opponents such as Hungary of their ability to veto a six-month renewal of the freeze. Under the plan, the freeze would remain in place until Russia pays post-conflict reparations to Ukraine and the EU decides there is no longer “an immediate threat” to its economic interests from potential legal retaliation.

Moscow has condemned any attempt to use its assets as illegal. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said this week that Moscow will retaliate against any expropriation, adding that “robbing” Russia is the last remaining option for Ukraine's European backers to sustain Kiev in its conflict with Moscow.

Hungary has long argued against further aid to Kiev, with Orban comparing it to trying to “help an alcoholic by sending them another crate of vodka.” Budapest is not alone in opposing the ‘reparations loan' scheme. Belgium, which holds most of the funds, has sharply criticized the plan, with Prime Minister Bart De Wever calling it tantamount to “stealing” Russian money. EU states are set to vote on the proposal at a summit next week.

Latest batch includes photos of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Richard Branson as top Democrat says ‘all we want is full transparency'

House Democrats release Epstein photos with Trump, Bannon, Clinton and others

In pictures: latest Epstein photos released

House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries has called on the Trump administration to “comply with the law” and release the full Epstein files, adding that his party would continue to pressure the justice department to release the files by the congressionally mandated 19 December deadline.

A reminder that the 19 images shared by the House oversight committee in today's drop are separate to the archive that the DoJ has been ordered to release, but they do add to the political momentum and pressure mounting on the Trump administration over the issue.

Jeffries told reporters earlier:

The so-called Department of Justice under the Trump administration needs to comply with the law.

These people who are part of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump and JD Vance himself, all said for years that they wanted to release the Epstein files.

Didn't they come into office and do the exact opposite, obstruct and obfuscate, hide stuff from the American people?

All we want is full transparency so that the American people can get the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. That's what the Epstein survivors deserve and have demanded and we are going to make sure that the Department of Justice complies.

Donald Trump said today that the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to a cease fire in their ongoing border conflict.

In a post on Truth Social, the president said he spoke to Thailand's Anutin Charnviraku and Cambodia's Hun Manet this morning. “They have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening, and go back to the original Peace Accord made with me, and them, with the help of the Great Prime Minister of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim,” Trump wrote.

A reminder that fighting erupted again on Sunday in the longstanding border dispute between the two countries. As my colleague Rebecca Ratcliffe notes, Thailand and Cambodia initially agreed to a ceasefire in July, and signed a formal agreement six weeks ago in Trump's presence. However, the ceasefire arrangements have been precarious, and both sides have accused the other of violations. Since the fighting broke out last week, at least 20 people have been killed, and almost 200 injured.

“Both Countries are ready for PEACE and continued Trade with the United States of America,” Trump added on social media today.

My colleagues have collated the 19 photographs from the Epstein estate, released today by Democrats on the House oversight committee.

You can see them all below. A warning that some contain sensitive material.

Earlier, I reported that Richard Branson and an unidentified man were pictured in a photograph with Epstein. That man is Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway.

According to the Boston Globe, Kamen did not respond to a request for comment after today's pictures were published. The Globe reports that Kamen – a New Hampshire based entrepreneur – is connected to Nadia Marcinko, a fashion model turned pilot, who was close with Epstein.

A quick note that the Trump condom appears to be part of the Smithsonian Institution's collection, where it is described as “political satire”.

The packaging was designed by Fishs Eddy, a housewares and novelty shop in New York, and launched in 2015. “It's been a runaway hit, that's for sure,” shop owner Julie Gaines said in November 2016, a few days before the presidential election that Trump went on to win. “People get the joke and that's why they buy it. They don't buy it because it's an homage to him.”

She said the inspiration for the package design came after Trump “started mouthing off [the word] ‘huge' every five minutes”. “We've always been political, but it's at a whole new level this year,” Gaines said. “We are very, very much for Hillary [Clinton] and we make that very clear. The only time we do Trump products is when we're trying to get our two cents in, not to promote him.”

In comments to reporters earlier, Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, said that just under 25,000 images had been examined out of the 95,000 photographs from the estate, and said that more photos from the Epstein estate would be released “in the days and weeks ahead”.

“Some of the other photos we did not put out today are incredibly disturbing,” he added.

So there's an enormous amount of photos that we have not gone through. It'll take days and weeks to make sure we have those photos and redaction is done in the appropriate way.

We will continue to put out more photos in the days and weeks ahead, but I caution folks at the redaction process, and ensuring we protect survivors and women abused by Epstein.

He accused the White House of a cover-up and implored the Trump administration to “release the files immediately”.

House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries has called on the Trump administration to “comply with the law” and release the full Epstein files, adding that his party would continue to pressure the justice department to release the files by the congressionally mandated 19 December deadline.

A reminder that the 19 images shared by the House oversight committee in today's drop are separate to the archive that the DoJ has been ordered to release, but they do add to the political momentum and pressure mounting on the Trump administration over the issue.

All we want is full transparency so that the American people can get the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. That's what the Epstein survivors deserve and have demanded and we are going to make sure that the Department of Justice complies.

Republicans who lead the House oversight committee lambasted Democrats for the images they released from the Epstein estate today, accusing them of “chasing headlines by releasing a handful of selectively censored and cherry-picked photos”.

They added:

Democrats' hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. Nothing in the documents we've received shows any wrongdoing. Ranking Member Robert Garcia and Oversight Democrats should be ashamed of this disgusting behavior of putting politics above justice for the survivors.

Also included in today's trove of pictures is British billionaire and co-founder of Virgin group, Richard Branson.

Branson is seen smiling on a beach, sitting next to an unidentified man and holding up a pad of paper with indiscernible writing, as Epstein walks behind them.

Upon releasing the most recent trove of photos from the Epstein estate, the oversight committee's top Democrat – Robert Garcia – said “it is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends”.

The California congressman added that the 19 photos published today “raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW.”

Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon appears in several of the pictures released by House Democrats on the oversight committee.

As I reported earlier, in one of the photos Bannon is seen having a conversation while sitting across a desk from Epstein.

In another, Epstein is taking a selfie of the pair in front of a full-length mirror. Bannon, who was Donald Trump's top White House strategist until he was fired less than a year into the president's first term in office, is also pictured speaking with film director Woody Allen in one photograph.

Included in this latest batch of pictures from the Epstein estate are explicit photos of sex toys. One appears to show a black latex glove with ridges on the fingers, and another features ropes, restraints and a book on “shibari” – a type of Japanese bondage.

Another picture features a bowl of “Trump condoms” selling for $4.50. On the parody packaging it makes fun of the president's style of speech, reading: “I'm HUUUUGE!”

Included in the latest batch of photos from House oversight Democrats today, are several pictures of high profile individuals at public events.

The picture of former prince Andrew and Microsoft founder Bill Gates appears to be from at a summit in London, where the former's brother – King Charles III – was in attendance. The image in the House oversight batch appears to be a cropped version of a picture available on the photo agency Getty.

Here's the image from the news wires:

Similarly, a picture of Epstein and his former lawyer Alan Dershowitz is included in the drop of photos, but appears to be an older photo of the pair back in 2004 that was already published.

Here is the news wire image:

In the new batch of photos released by House oversight Democrats, there is also a picture of Donald Trump surrounded by women, some of whom are wearing leis around their necks. All of their faces have been obscured, but the president appears in the middle holding the waists of two of the women.

Democrats on the House oversight committee have published 19 new photos from the 95,000 they have received from Jeffrey Epstein's estate today. In the latest drop, there are pictures of Bill Clinton alongside the late sex-offender and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. There are also pictures of Donald Trump and Epstein at social events, and even a picture of the president onboard a plane, sitting beside a woman whose face has been redacted.

There are several pictures in the drop which include billionaire Bill Gates.

Another notable face is former Trump adviser and noted ally, Steve Bannon, who appears in one picture sitting across a desk, engaged in conversation with Epstein.

It's worth noting that appearing in pictures from the estate doesn't imply any wrongdoing.

According to multiple outlets, the navy has sent a report to the Pentagon about Senator Mark Kelly's role in a video published to social media last month, where six Democratic members of Congress urged active service members to “refuse illegal orders”.

The video sparked fury from the president, who said the lawmakers were guilty of “seditious behavior” that was “punishable by death”. Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said he would launch an investigation into Kelly – a decorated former navy captain – for possible breaches of military law. This included a memorandum to John Phelan asking the navy secretary to review Kelly and a group of fellow Democrats' comments in the video.

According to the New York Times, the Pentagon's office of general counsel is “providing a legal review and input” of the navy's report, per a Department of Defense official, who spoke to the Times on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.

In response, a spokesperson for Kelly told the Hill that “it defies belief that with all of the threats facing our country, Pete Hegseth initiated this ridiculous process to try to intimidate senator Kelly for saying something Pete Hegseth himself has said repeatedly.”

A reminder that footage from 2016, of the defense secretary repeatedly saying that service members should refuse “unlawful” orders from a potential president Trump on Fox News, was unearthed by CNN earlier this month.

Per our earlier post, a federal judge on Friday morning issued a temporary restraining order to prohibit immigration officials from detaining Kilmar Ábrego García just hours before he was scheduled to appear at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Baltimore.

His lawyers asked the judge to block authorities from detaining him again. The judge says officials cannot re-detain him until the court conducts a hearing on the motion for the temporary restraining order.

Ábrego had been freed from an immigration detention facility in Pennsylvania early on Thursday evening not long after a federal judge in Maryland ordered his release.

On Friday morning, Paula Xinis, a US district judge in Maryland, said that Ábrego cannot be re-detained and in her ruling she wrote that he was likely to succeed in further requests of “relief” from ICE detention, citing the merits of his case.

Donald Trump announced he would pardon former Colorado election clerk Tina Peters. In a post on Truth Social the president wrote that Peters – who is currently serving a nine-year state sentence for her attempts to overturn the 2020 election results – is a “Patriot who simply wanted to make sure that our Elections were Fair and Honest”.

Trump added that “Democrats have been relentless in their targeting” of Peters, who served as the clerk for Mesa county. She was found guilty on state charges of election interference, including four felony counts.

In response to Trump's announcement, several Democratic officials decried his efforts to overturn a state conviction. A reminder that the constitution grants the president pardon power for federal crimes.

“Tina Peters is rightfully in Colorado state prison,” said senator Michael Bennet. “Trump's corrupt and political attempts at a pardon won't work here. Once again, if you can't do the time, don't do the crime.”

Donald Trump is in Washington today. We'll see him at 3pm ET for a bill signing in the Oval Office. We'll make sure to bring you the latest lines.

Earlier, he'll take part in a swearing-in ceremony for Ben Black, the CEO of the US International Development Finance Corporation, and John Jovanovic, who serves as the chair of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM).

A reminder that Jovanovic is married to the daughter of Trump's administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz.

That ceremony is currently closed to the press, but we'll let you know if that changes.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The WHO has not changed the “status quo” of how it collaborates with Taiwanese health authorities, the global health body said on Thursday, after Japanese Minister of Finance Satsuki Katayama said the organization plans to strengthen ties with Taiwan.

Katayama on Saturday last week in a post on X said that WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed an intention to strengthen relations with Taiwan while he was attending a high-level universal health coverage forum in Tokyo last week.

“WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explicitly said the ties with Taiwan will be strengthened,” she cited Ghebreyesus as saying.

However, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post on Thursday reported that the WHO, in response to the media outlet's query about Katayama's post, said the organization has not changed its position on relations with Taiwan.

“Our position is that we have existing relations with Taiwanese health partners,” a WHO representative told the paper.

Speaking to the Taipei Times, a WHO representative said that comments regarding Taiwan attributed to Ghebreyesus involved “an apparent misinterpretation.”

Ghebreyesus described the WHO's technical collaboration with Taiwanese experts via an interpreter during a meeting with Katayama, the representative said.

His comments were made within the WHO's legal framework, which states that “the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate representative of China to the WHO,” the representative said.

The collaboration “reached its highest levels” in recent years due to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the “status quo” of how the WHO works with Taiwanese experts on health issues, the representative said.

“At no time did Dr Tedros mention any change in this arrangement,” the representative said.

The people signed up through Chinese travel agencies for tours of neighboring Russia with companies claiming they could obtain Russian visas and fast-track border clearance, the source said on condition of anonymity. 
The travelers were actually issued one-time-use Chinese passports, they said. 
Taiwanese are prohibited from holding a Chinese passport or household registration. If found to have a Chinese ID, they may lose their resident status under Article 9-1

The video shows a hotel room shaking violently amid Monday's quake, with objects falling to the ground.
Two Taiwanese began filming with their mobile phones, while two others held the sides of a TV to prevent it from falling.
When the shaking stopped, the pair calmly took down the TV and laid it flat on a tatami mat, the video shows.
The video also captured the group talking about the safety of their companions bathing

US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's comments in November last year that “we lose every time” in Pentagon-conducted war games pitting the US against China further highlighted the uncertainty about the US' capability to intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

S&P 500, Nasdaq open lower as Broadcom adds to AI bubble angst

 

 

 

- Darcy Keith

There's been no shortage of the usual year-ahead forecasts for the S&P 500 in recent weeks from Street analysts. But FactSet is out today with a report that looks at Street forecasts using a unique “bottom-up” approach, instead of the usual “top-down”. 

This bottom-up target price for the index at year-end 2026 is calculated by aggregating the median target price estimates, based on the company-level target prices submitted by industry analysts, for all the stocks in the index.

The result of this unusual number crunching: a target price for the S&P 500 of 7,968.78, which is about 15 per cent higher than current levels. 

“At the sector level, the Information Technology (+19.8%) sector is expected to see the largest price increase, as this sector has the largest upside difference between the bottom-up target price and the closing price. On the other hand, the Financials (+8.3%) sector is expected to see the smallest price increase, as this sector has the smallest upside difference between the bottom-up target price and the closing price,” FactSet said in the report.

But how has this forecasting approach worked in the past?

“At the end of last year (December 31, 2024), the bottom-up target price for the S&P 500 was 6,728.40. Based on yesterday's closing price of 6,901.00, analysts underestimated the price of the index by 2.5% at the start of calendar year 2025 as of yesterday. However, it is important to note that industry analysts have historically overestimated the closing price of the index at the start of the year. Over the previous 20 years (2005 – 2024), the average difference between the bottom-up target price estimate at the beginning of the year (December 31) and the final price for the index for that same year has been 5.9 per cent.”

Most Wall Street analysts liked Broadcom's (AVGO-Q) earnings but markets really hated it, and sold the stock along with most of the AI-related market sector. Oracle didn't help, announcing that some of their data centres slated to open next year will have to wait until 2027. 

Citi analyst Christopher Danely applauded Broadcom's announcement of a new customer, Anthropic, and 13 per cent year over year gain in revenue. Next quarter revenue was guided higher by 6.0 per cent. A big negative, however: Broadcom guided gross margins lower by 1.0 per cent. 

The stock is trading sharply lower – down 11 per cent in midday trading. Oracle's announcement of data center delays has its stock down just over 5.0 per cent. 

Despite the fall on Friday, its stock is up nearly 70 per cent for the year.

It trades at about 32 times enterprise value to forward core earnings, compared with 19.6 times for AI chip giant Nvidia and 30.2 times for Advanced Micro Devices, according to Reuters. Nvidia shares are up 34 per cent this year, while AMD has gained 83 per cent.

More drops for superstars that had earlier soared in Wall Street's frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology are dragging the U.S. stock market off their records on Friday.

The S&P 500 fell 1.2% from its all-time high set the day before, and the weakness for tech stocks yanked the Nasdaq composite down a market-leading 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 266 points, or 0.5%, from its own record set the day before, as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern time.

Broadcom dragged the market lower and tumbled 10.5% even though the chip company reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. 

Broadcom's stumble came a day after Oracle plunged nearly 11% despite likewise reporting a bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

Doubts remain about whether all the spending that Oracle is doing on AI technology will end up being worth it, along with how it will pay for it. Such questions are dogging the AI industry broadly, even as many billions of dollars continue to flow in.

Broadcom was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 Friday, followed by Nvidia. The chip company that's become the poster child of the AI boom fell 2.5%.

The stock market was also broadly feeling pressure from the bond market, where the yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.19% from 4.14% late Thursday. The gains were biggest for yields of the longest-term Treasurys, which tend to track long-term expectations for economic growth and inflation.

The stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has much less of an emphasis on tech, are still up 1% for the week so far. That's much better than the Nasdaq composite's drop of 1.7%.

Shares of Rivian Automotive (RIVN-Q) surged 18% on Friday as analysts issued bullish commentary on the electric pickup truck and SUV maker's efforts to develop a custom chip for self-driving features and its integration of artificial intelligence.

The stock had closed about 6% lower on Thursday after the company's announcements at its first Autonomy and AI Day, where it said it would shift away from Nvidia's processors that power autonomous driving and had launched a paid package for self-driving features.

Rivian's shares rose 17.9% to $19.37, its highest in nearly two years. The stock had risen about 24% this year, as of Thursday's close.

The company's new R2 model cars, which are expected to roll out first half of 2026, will carry the new chips.

The self-driving and driver-assistance systems still require human oversight. The company expects to launch “eyes-off” functionality in 2026.

“The event exceeded our expectations and cements our view for Rivian to become the number 2 North America EV player, even leapfrogging Tesla right now in certain AI-integration areas,” James Picariello, senior analyst at BNP Paribas said.

Brokerage Needham and Co raised its price target by 64% to US $23 per share, citing increased confidence “in Rivian's positioning as software-defined vehicles increasingly become industry table stakes.”

Rivian's custom self-driving and AI chip, dubbed the Rivian Autonomy Processor, will be produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Canada's benchmark stock index dropped on Friday, ending a week filled with central bank meetings.

At 11:28 a.m. ET, The TSX index was was down 252.98 points, or 0.8 per cent, at 31,407.75. The commodity-heavy index is up 28 per cent for the year and has outperformed its Wall Street peers due to a stellar performance from its mining and materials shares.

“Global stocks are trading at record highs despite ongoing technology valuation doubts,” said Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY.

“The ongoing themes of equity sector rotation, a better 2026 outlook aided by Fed easing, and tame inflation leave hopes that doing nothing will keep the holiday rally intact.”

Information technology stocks lead declines, falling 4.3 per cent, with Celestica Inc. (CLS-T) dropping 12.1 per cent and Lightspeed Commerce Inc. (LSPD-T) losing 3.1 per cent.

Healthcare index gained the most on Friday at 5.4 per cent, with the shares of cannabis firm Curaleaf (CURA-T) soaring 26 per cent.

Shares of cannabis companies rose after a Washington Post report said U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to push the government to dramatically loosen federal restrictions on marijuana. Canada's Canopy Growth and Tilray Brands rose 22 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively.

The founder of Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU-Q) is calling for an overhaul of the company's board of directors, as the purveyor of athleisure searches for a new chief executive officer – accusing the leadership of “complacency” as the brand has lost its cachet.

Friday's statement from Chip Wilson followed the news of CEO Calvin McDonald's ouster on Thursday afternoon.

Mr. McDonald, who has led Lululemon since 2018, will step down at the end of January. While he presided over years of growth at the company, under his leadership Lululemon also experienced a significant slowdown in its U.S. business starting last year.

The company's stock price – which had dropped by more than 50 per cent this year prior to the news – jumped by roughly 10 per cent in Friday-morning trading.

The founder, Mr. Wilson, took credit for Mr. McDonald's departure in his statement on Friday, saying that he had been urging members of the company “publicly and privately” to spearhead a “revitalization and an infusion of new skills” to fix its lagging performance.

Silver often gets dismissed as gold's poor cousin. But that title hardly stands up to the reality of this past year. The precious metal has soared 120 per cent year to date, and the spot price reached a record US$64.09 per ounce this morning in London. That's about a 10-per-cent weekly gain. Not bad for a commodity that rarely comes up in dinner conversations.

Various reasons have been linked to the rally. Gold's surge (the two metals often trade in tandem) and the general decline in the U.S. dollar have surely played a role. Strong demand for physical silver from Indian consumers and from the solar industry – which is eager to help meet demand for the power needs of AI chips – has probably helped too. 

But Capital Economics is out Friday with a warning for those investors only now catching on to the powerful gains of the commodity this year. It thinks silver gains could rapidly go into reverse in the new year. 

The Bank for International Settlements argued this week that the surge in retail interest and the gold price rally is indicative of a bubble. Capital Economics thinks the same argument can be made for silver, too. It points out both gold- and silver-backed ETF holdings have increased by 15-20 per cent since the start of this year. 

“This pick-up in investment demand for precious metals, especially in the West where sentiment tends to be sensitive to changes in US monetary policy, could rapidly shift into reverse. A potential trigger could be if, as we expect, concerns about Fed independence prove to be overblown,” wrote Capital Economics climate and commodities economist Hamad Hussain in a note this week. 

“Admittedly, silver prices may rise further in the near term since the risk of US tariffs still looms. For context, the ongoing Section 232 trade investigation on critical minerals, which includes silver, has coincided with a hoarding of silver inventories on the COMEX and this appears to have caused stress in the broader silver market. But while we have no insight as to whether tariffs will be put in place, it is notable that Trump backed away from tariffing gold when similar dynamics in that market were playing out. In any case, the tariff uncertainty should end by mid-April at the latest when President Trump would be expected to make a decision.”

Mr. Hussain also notes the gold/silver price ratio – a commonly used valuation metric – has fallen sharply since ‘Liberation Day'. “Of course, price ratios are not perfect guides to the future since there is no fixed level that they should revert to. But for what it's worth, the gold/silver price ratio previously bottomed out around 65 on two occasions in the past decade or so – not far from its current level.”

He thinks both gold and silver prices will fall next year, with silver falling faster, reaching US$42 an ounce by the end of 2026. 

If true, it could be a rough year for Canadian precious metals producers that have a heavy exposure to silver.

The K-shaped economy meme – the economy improving for the wealthy while deteriorating for the lower wealth quintiles – might be going in reverse, according to BofA Securities investment strategist Michael Hartnett in his weekly report. 

Mr. Hartnett often needs to come with subtitles, but there's an important trend evident in his weekly Flow Show report. He writes, “Ferrari falling sharply vs General Motors; K-shape ‘rich vs poor' consumer all the rage in '25, but markets front-running ‘run-it-hot' in '26 via rotation to ‘Main St' (MDY MidCap, IYR Small-Cap, IWC Microcap) from ‘Wall St' (MGC Mega Cap)”

The relative returns for Ferrari and General Motors potentially indicates the reversal of the K-shaped “rich versus poor” economic trend. The “run-it-hot” idea is that fund managers are positioning for an inflationary environment that benefits less wealth cohorts. They are buying SPDR S&P Midcap 400 ETF (MDY-A), iShares U.S. Real Estate (IYR-A) and iShares Microcap (IWC-A) while reducing Vanguard Mega Cap Index ETF (MGC-A).

Oil prices inched lower on Friday and were on track for a weekly decline as investors focussed on a supply glut and potential Russia-Ukraine peace deal, which outweighed concerns over Venezuelan supply disruptions.

Brent crude futures were down 14 US cents, or 0.2 per cent, to US$61.14 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 3 US cents at US$57.57. Both benchmarks fell by about 1.5 per cent on Thursday.

While there might be sporadic support from hits to supply, the general market mood reflects supply exceeding demand, and any rallies are expected to be brief, said PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga.

Brent and WTI have lost more than 4 per cent this week. International Energy Agency forecasts published on Thursday indicated that global oil supply will exceed demand by 3.84 million barrels per day next year - a volume equal to almost 4% of world demand.

Canada's main stock index opened higher on Friday, with mining shares leading gains at the close of a week filled with highly anticipated central bank meetings.

At 9:30 a.m. ET, Toronto's S&P/TSX composite index was up 0.24 per cent at 31,737.44 points.

In New York, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq opened lower on Friday as Broadcom's latest results added to concerns about an AI-fueled bubble, dampening optimism stoked by the Federal Reserve's less-hawkish-than-expected signals on 2026 rate cuts.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 102.80 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 48,806.81, the S&P 500 lost 10.85 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 6,890.37 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 105.00 points, or 0.43 per cent, to 23,491.12. 

Broadcom (AVGO-Q) slid 7.9 per cent in early trade after the chipmaker warned of slimmer future margins on its AI system sales, despite projecting strong quarterly revenue. This sharpened worries about the profitability of surging AI investments.

Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica (LULU-Q) jumped 10.7 per cent after the apparel maker said that CEO Calvin McDonald was leaving the company and raised its annual profit forecast.

Shares of Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU-Q) are poised to soar after the late Thursday announcement chief executive officer Calvin McDonald will step down at the end of January.

Mr. McDonald, who has led the athleisure retailer since 2018, has been struggling to reassure investors amid a slowdown in its U.S. business and as its stock price plunged by 50 per cent since the beginning of the year.

Lululemon has hired an executive search firm and is looking for its next CEO, the company announced Thursday. Mr. McDonald will leave the role on Jan. 31, 2026, and will also step away from the company's board of directors but will continue as a senior adviser until March 31.

The announcement overshadowed the release of third-quarter financial results that exceeded the Street's expectations. That included earnings per share of US$2.59, topping the consensus projection of US$2.21, driven by higher gross profit dollars and share repurchases.

“Results were better than feared and FY25 revenue and guidance moves higher at the midpoint,” said Stifel analyst Peter McGoldrick in a client note. “We continue to believe the stock will remain range-bound until the core Americas business stabilizes; continued challenges (Americas negative 5-per-cent cc comp vs. negative 3 per cent cc in 2Q25) with concentration around shopping holidays and promotional seeking behavior points to uneven trends in demand, which we expect persist into CY26. We expect the forthcoming leadership change catalyzes investor interest in the stock, though believe the structural market conditions driving challenging results (scaling competition, loyal customer attrition) will take time to correct.”

The company's shares have halved in value this year as it lost ground to newer rivals including Alo Yoga and Vuori in the U.S., as well as to lower-priced styles from established players such as Nike and Gap.

Lululemon's forward price-to-earnings multiple, a common benchmark for valuing stocks, is 14.66, compared to 31.26 for Nike and Abercrombie & Fitch's ratio of 10.8, according to LSEG data.

BMO senior economist Robert Kavcic found that Canadian households are a lot more liquid than the heavy debt levels would suggest. 

My strong suspicion is that these assets are not distributed equally among the populace,

“Canadian households are flush with liquid assets, another strike against those deeply concerned about conditions going into 2026. Canadians now hold almost $260 in liquid financial assets (e.g., cash, bonds and stocks, excluding pension and insurance assets) for every $100 in financial liabilities (e.g., mortgage debt). The bull market in equities is obviously helping, but so have sturdy income growth and savings. Importantly, not only is there some wealth effect here, but it is also going to help cushion households renewing into higher-rate mortgages through 2026 (the peak of the renewal wave is around mid-year). Canadians can lean on these liquid assets to reduce outstanding balances or support higher monthly payments. There are a few sidebars to explore further. Wealth in liquid financial assets is arguably more accessible than a fixed asset like housing, which has stagnated for most. Also, the distribution of increases in financial assets has, of course, been skewed to the higher end of the income spectrum”

Futures tracking the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq slipped on Friday as Broadcom's latest results reignited fears of an AI-fueled bubble and tempered the optimism sparked by a less hawkish commentary than expected from the Federal Reserve on 2026 rate cuts.

At 7:00 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 59 points, or 0.12 per cent, S&P 500 E-minis were down 15.25 points, or 0.22 per cent, Nasdaq 100 E-minis were down 162.25 points, or 0.63 per cent.

Broadcom (AVGO-Q) shares fell nearly 6 per cent in premarket trading after the chipmaker warned of lower future margins on its AI system sales, despite forecasting strong quarterly revenue, deepening concerns about the profitability of investments in the technology.

Other chip stocks including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-Q) and Nvidia (NVDA-Q) lost 0.3 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, a day after Oracle (ORCL-N) unveiled a weak forecast.

Shares of the cloud company fell 1.2 per cent after logging its biggest daily drop since January in the previous session.

Despite the gloomy overhang, the S&P 500, the Dow and the Russell 2000 all closed at record highs on Thursday and were on track for weekly gains after the Fed trimmed borrowing costs and delivered a less hawkish outlook than investors had feared.

Among others, Vancouver's Lululemon Athletica (LULU-Q) jumped 9.8 per cent after the apparel maker said that CEO Calvin McDonald was leaving the company and raised its annual profit forecast.

Goldman Sachs' new chief U.S. equity strategist Ben Snider (the widely regarded David Kostin retired) published his S&P 500 targets for 2026. 

The details underscore the incredible dominance of the tech hyperscalers in terms of both size and profit generation,

“We forecast S&P 500 EPS growth of 12 per cent year/year in 2026 (to $305) and 10 per cent in 2027 (to $336). Our estimates incorporate GS macro forecasts for solid US GDP growth and a weaker US dollar alongside GS equity analyst forecasts for continued earnings strength among the largest technology stocks. Our 12-per-cent EPS growth forecast for 2026 combines revenue growth of 7 per cent with 70 bp of profit margin expansion. The seven largest stocks in the S&P 500 (NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, AVGO, META) account for 36 per cent of S&P 500 market cap and 26 per cent of earnings and should contribute 46 per cent of index EPS growth in 2026. This represents a decline from their 50-per-cent contribution in 2025 as earnings growth for the S&P 493 accelerates from 7 per cent in 2025 to 9 per cent in 2026. The mega-caps' above-average sales growth and profit margins provide a mechanical tailwind to margins for the aggregate S&P 500. For example, if NVDA sales grow by 50 per cent in 2026 and its margins remain flat, the S&P 500 profit margin would rise by 30 bp from that boost alone. We expect AI-driven productivity gains will lift S&P 500 EPS by 0.4 per cent in 2026 and 1.5 per cent in 2027”

CIBC Capital Markets bank analyst Paul Holden is struggling to see upside in major bank stocks,

“The banks reported another strong set of EPS beats with FQ4, making it four for four on the year. We remain positive on the outlook based on excess capital, conservative credit provisioning, an expectation for improving economic conditions into F2027 and potential for regulatory capital relief. However, we are increasingly challenged to paint significant upside for the group given valuation multiples and rising consensus estimates. Our two Outperformers are TD and BMO, where we believe consensus estimates remain low and where relative valuation multiples look reasonable … Key themes for F2026. F2025 results got a huge lift from capital markets, wealth management and NIM [net interest margin] expansion. We expect the primary drivers of F2026 EPS growth will be somewhat different: NIM expansion (again), expense efficiencies and capital deployment. We think our two Outperformers are well positioned across these drivers”

RBC Capital Markets head of global commodity strategy Helima Croft expects the U.S. to force a regime change in Venezuela that will eventually affect global crude markets,

“We are currently watching the U.S. military buildup off the coast of Venezuela and believe a U.S.-led regime change operation is likely in the cards in the coming weeks or Q1'26 … Even if President Maduro leaves Venezuela voluntarily, we think it will be a protracted process before the country sees significant production gains due to the decades -long decline of the sector. Removing all sanctions could in principle lead to a relatively swift increase of several hundred kb/d, but anything beyond that would require enormous investment and a stable operating environment. They also warned that the military could play the spoiler role in a contested power situation since it plays such a large role in the operations of PDVSA [state-owned crude and natural gas producer] —as well as the broader economy”

Analysts at TD Cowen think “2026 could be real estate's turn to outperform.”

“Following two years of wide underperformance comparable to 1998-1999 (which led to four years of subsequent outperformance), REITs increasingly appear ready to regain some market leadership,” said the firm's real estate equity team, led by Sam Damiani and Jonathan Kelcher. 

“Macro changes are hard to predict, but REITs offer attractive and stable yields and growth while biding time until the next catalyst for a bounce in valuations.”

Shares of cannabis companies jumped on Friday after the Washington Post reported U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to push the government to dramatically loosen federal restrictions on marijuana.

U.S.-listed shares of Tilray Brands (TLRY-Q, TLRY-T) gained 28 per cent, while SNDL (SNDL-Q), Canopy Growth (CGC-Q, WEED-T) and ETF AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis (MSOS-A) were up between 13.5 per cent and 32.5 per cent in premarket trading.

According to the report from Thursday, Mr. Trump plans to direct agencies to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug, reducing oversight of the plant and its derivatives to the same level as some common prescription painkillers and other drugs.

“We believe this would open the door for pharmaceutical companies to seek approval for more cannabis products, which could then be dispensed the same as other prescription drugs,” TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note.

Mr. Trump's administration has been looking to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a shift that could ease criminal penalties and reshape the industry through potentially lower taxes and by making it easier to secure funding.

Funding remains one of the biggest challenges for cannabis producers, as federal restrictions keep most banks and institutional investors out of the sector, forcing pot producers to turn to costly loans or alternative lenders.

Broadcom shares (AVGO-Q) fell nearly 6 per cent before the market open on Friday after the chipmaker said its margins would fall due to a higher mix of AI revenue, adding to worries about the payout from AI.

Investor optimism over the nascent technology has recently cooled amid bubble concerns, wiping out hundreds of billions in tech market value since late October. Adding to the worries, Oracle's massive spending and weak forecasts fanned doubts over how quickly the big bets on AI will pay off, sparking a tech selloff in the previous session.

“Right now, the spending intentions still seem so big by so many, hitting that panic button is premature,” said Ben Reitzes, analyst at Melius Research.

Broadcom's margins will be affected throughout the year by the revenue mix of infrastructure, software and semiconductors, while it has a US$73-billion backlog that it anticipates shipping over the next 18 months.

“We attribute the selloff to commentary on gross margin dilution from AI chips. We aren't concerned with this, given that these chips are operating-margin-accretive,” said analysts at Morningstar.

Broadcom has gained from strong demand for its custom chips amid a major data center buildout, securing a growing foothold in an industry led by Nvidia, with its stock rising nearly 75 per cent this year.

Global markets advanced following strength on Wall Street overnight, though a fresh decline in Oracle's share price sent jitters through the tech sector.

Wall Street futures were mixed as tech concerns continue to weigh on the Nasdaq.

TSX futures edged up after Canada's main stock market closed at another record high yesterday.

“Oracle announced disappointing earnings alongside further investment in data centres, triggering fresh concerns about AI-related spending, with investors questioning whether the high level of investment will ultimately deliver the required returns,” analysts from Westpac wrote in a research note.

Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.42 per cent in morning trading. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.3 per cent, Germany's DAX advanced 0.52 per cent and France's CAC 40 climbed 0.69 per cent.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed 1.37 per cent higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.75 per cent.

World shares rose on Friday, tracking Wall Street's climb to records despite a sell-off for Oracle as worries persisted about a potential bubble in artificial-intelligence technology.

The future for the S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1 per cent, while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent.

In early European trading, Germany's DAX added nearly 0.6 per cent to 24,427.67. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.4 per cent to 9,737.25, and the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.4 per cent to 8,141.66.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index climbed 1.4 per cent to 50,836.55, rebounding from the previous session's losses.

Investors remain cautious ahead of next week's policy meeting of the Bank of Japan, where it is expected to raise interest rates, but technology shares helped lead broad gains.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 inched up 0.2 per cent to 6,901.00 and eked past its prior all-time closing high, which was set in October. The Dow Jones Industrial leaped 1.3 per cent to 48,704.01, to top its own record set last month. The Nasdaq composite lagged behind and slipped 0.3 per cent to 23,593.86 because of weakness in AI stocks.

It's the latest return to records for the market following what had appeared to be a debilitating set of worries. Some of the most recent included concerns about what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates and whether all the dollars flowing into AI chips and data centers will produce profits and productivity as prolific as proponents are promising.

Oracle shares fell 10.8 per cent on Thursday in their biggest one-day drop since late January.Brian Snyder/Reuters

The S&P 500 and the Dow boasted record closing highs on Thursday after a U.S. Federal Reserve policy update that was less hawkish than expected, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq underperformed as Oracle Corp.'s ORCL-N financial update made investors wary of artificial-intelligence bets. The TSX also closed at another record.

Oracle shares tumbled 10.8 per cent in their biggest one-day drop since late January, and they were the top S&P 500 decliner after the company's quarterly forecasts fell short of analysts' estimates. It had also warned that annual spending would run US$15-billion higher than previously planned, stoking fears about its big push into AI. The cost of insuring Oracle debt against default surged as investors feared that the company's heavy reliance on debt financing could be part of an AI bubble similar to the dot-com bust of the early 2000s.

While Oracle helped drag other technology names lower, the Dow rallied along with the Russell 2000 small-cap index, which closed up 1.2 per cent and the S&P 500 value index, up 0.6 per cent, outperformed the growth index, which ended off 0.12 per cent.

Investors also continued to digest the U.S. central bank's update from Wednesday, when the Fed lowered borrowing costs by 25 basis points and chair Jerome Powell signalled a pause on further easing. However, investors were relieved that the Fed still had some rate cuts on its dot plot as it balanced still-elevated inflation with signs of labour market weakness.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 646.26 points, or 1.34 per cent, to 48,704.01, vaulting above its Nov. 12 closing record. The S&P 500 gained 14.32 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 6,901.00, breaching its Oct. 28 record close. The Nasdaq Composite lost 60.30 points, or 0.25 per cent, to 23,593.86.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index ended up 169.88 points, or 0.5 per cent, at 31,660.73, surpassing its record closing high on Wednesday.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will produce a new documentary for the Sundance Film Festival about girl scouts selling cookies.

Cookie Queens will be a “a coming-of-age story about the joys, pressures, and pain points woven into one of America's most cherished rituals: Girl Scout Cookie season,” according to the festival programme seen by Deadline.

The Sussexes will executive produce the film through Archewell Productions, their media company, which is due to be released at the iconic US film festival next year.

Sundance's programme says the documentary, directed by Alysa Nahmias, follows “four tenacious girls (who) strive to be a top-selling ‘Cookie Queen', navigating an $800 million (£598 million) business in which childhood and ambition collide”.

It will premiere at the Rose Wagner Performing Arts Center in Salt Lake City on Jan 24. 

The Duchess of Sussex said the chance to work on the film was “absolutely irresistible”.

“As a former girl scout myself, with my mom as my troop leader, I have a personal affinity for this film and am proud that all our conversations and collaboration have led to Archewell Productions partnering with this award-winning team to executive produce this incredibly captivating documentary,” the duchess told Deadline.

“When we first viewed the early footage of this documentary, it was immediately something we wanted to be involved in.

“The creative point of view, the edgy yet humanising tone and tenor of the directing, and the glimpse behind-the-scenes into such a nostalgic and also modern tradition of girl scout cookie season are absolutely irresistible.”

Last April, the duchess shared photographs of herself as a child selling cookies in her uniform.

It coincided with the launch of her podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, and her As Ever shortbread butter cookies.

The duke and duchess said in August that they would be extending their creative partnership via Archewell to work on more TV and film projects.

It comes after they signed a deal with Netflix in 2020 for a reported $100 million.

The pair are also reported be working on a film adaptation of Meet Me At The Lake, the bestselling romantic novel by Carley Fortune.

The bill passed with 20 Republicans joining all Democrats in voting “yes,” in a rare rebuke to Trump.

As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today.

The House has voted on a bipartisan basis to restore labor rights to 1 million federal workers after President Donald Trump yanked them away in an executive order earlier this year, in a rare show of defiance against the president by over a dozen GOP members.

In a 231 to 195 vote on Thursday afternoon, the House passed the Protect America's Workforce Act, which would nullify Trump's orders in March and August to exempt workers at dozens of agencies from collective bargaining rights.

The bill passed with 20 Republicans joining all Democrats in voting “yes.” The bill simply nullifies the order and says that collective bargaining agreements — known otherwise as union contracts — in effect before the order will be restored.

The legislation was forced onto the floor after a discharge petition surpassed the requisite 218 signatures in November. The bill now goes to the Senate, where it may face more difficult odds of passing the chamber's 60-vote threshold. A companion bill introduced in the Senate has 48 cosponsors, only one of them Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. 

Trump's orders have been slammed by labor advocates as the largest single act of union busting in U.S. history. They were especially disastrous for the labor movement since public sector workers are unionized at a far higher rate than those in the private sector. 

The affected unions had sued the Trump administration following the March order, but a federal appeals court had allowed it to stand, paving the way for Trump to issue his follow-up order in August to strip yet more workers of union rights.

Advocates had already decried restrictions on federal workers' labor rights that were in place before Trump's orders; those restrictions limit workers to bargaining solely on labor conditions, and not factors like wages or benefits.

Labor advocates celebrated the House vote.

“President Trump betrayed workers when he tried to rip away our collective bargaining rights. In these increasingly polarized times, working people delivered a rare bipartisan majority to stop the administration's unprecedented attacks on our freedoms,” said AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler in a statement. 

“Americans trust unions more than either political party. As we turn to the Senate — where the bill already has bipartisan support — working people are calling on the politicians we elected to stand with us, even if it means standing up to the union-busting boss in the White House,” Shuler said.

Indeed, approval of labor unions has reached highs, hovering around 70 percent in recent years as the labor movement and unionization surged.

December is the most critical time of year for Truthout, because our nonprofit news is funded almost entirely by individual donations from readers like you. So before you navigate away, we ask that you take just a second to support Truthout with a tax-deductible donation.

This year is a little different. We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. 2025 was a year of frightening censorship, news industry corporate consolidation, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board.

We can only resist Trump's agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

We've set an ambitious target for our year-end campaign — a goal of $250,000 to keep up our fight against authoritarianism in 2026. Please take a meaningful action in this fight: make a one-time or monthly donation to Truthout before December 31. If you have the means, please dig deep.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","The Justice Department can keep trying to reindict Letitia James, but is it worth the risks?","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/12/politics/justice-department-can-keep-trying-reindict-letitia-james-risks","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 11:01:00 GMT","


            The Justice Department's mortgage fraud investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James is on life support after a grand jury, for the second time, rejected an indictment that would have revived charges against her.
    


Lindsey Halligan, appointed by President Donald Trump to run the office, now faces the decision on whether to try again next week or pull the plug and risk the wrath of the president who wants James indicted.
    


            The rejection is an embarrassing setback for the Justice department — which had sought to revive the criminal case after a federal judge ruled Halligan was appointed unlawfully — and for the administration, who had positioned James' case as a centerpiece in its retribution campaign.
    


            But this latest setback may not necessarily be the end of the story. Prosecutors could go back to a grand jury again and continue their efforts to re-indict James over the same allegations in the hopes that one will approve charges.
    


            Continuing to pursue indictments is “exceedingly rare” in federal cases, according to former federal prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky. The Trump Justice Department, however, has shown a proclivity to try the strategy in some other immigration-related cases earlier this year.
    


            “One no true bill is a point. Two points make a line. That line points to an acquittal at trial,” Zelinsky said. “The Government should hang it up at strike two rather than go down swinging.”
    


            The Justice Department declined to comment on the grand jury's declination.
    


            In the original indictment, prosecutors said James had claimed on mortgage paperwork that a home she purchased in Norfolk, Virginia, would be her second residence, allowing her to get a favorable mortgage rate. Prosecutors said that James didn't use the house and rented it instead.
    


            James had pleaded not guilty to one count of making false statements to a financial institution and one count of bank fraud before the case was dismissed.
    


            In a statement to CNN, James' attorney Abbe Lowell said this “unprecedented rejection makes even clearer that this case should never have seen the light of day.”
    


            Legal experts told CNN that such repeated efforts to revive the case could raise policy and constitutional concerns.
    


            “The prosecutor, as a matter of policy, shouldn't be presenting charges before a grand jury unless they have a reasonable belief that they could win before a jury,” said retired federal Judge Nancy Gertner. “Losing before the grand jury once is one of the best indications that there's no there there — that they don't have a case.”
    


            But such repeated attempts — if eventually successful — may help fuel James' allegation that she's being unfairly targeted for prosecution.
    


            “The evidence of vindictiveness is to go back and back before the grand jury, notwithstanding their inability to secure an indictment,” Gertner said. “That's one classic measure of vindictiveness — meaning that you're doing this not because you actually have a case, but you simply want to get her.”

            President Donald Trump's Gaza ceasefire plan is set to enter a new phase within weeks, but crucial pieces of the agreement remain undefined as Israel tightens its military grip on the battered enclave.
    


            With the return of all but one of the deceased hostages held by militants – and questions about whether Hamas will even be able to locate the last set of remains – the first phase of the 20-point plan is verging on completion.
    


            Now, amid international concern that the two-month-old ceasefire is at risk of collapse, Trump is determined to move to the far more complicated second phase of the agreement, which includes Hamas' disarmament, the beginning of reconstruction, and the establishment of post-war governance. At the center of the new plan for administering Gaza is the creation of a “Board of Peace” to be led by Trump and other world leaders.
    


            “It'll be one of the most legendary boards ever. Everybody wants to be on it,” Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.
    


            Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's public embrace of the deal in September, significant gaps remain between the US and Israel. The US is pushing to move quickly into the next phase, but Israel is conditioning major steps on the return of the final deceased hostage and has been resisting US efforts to resolve a standoff with a pocket of isolated Hamas militants in the Israeli-occupied parts of southern Gaza.
    


            “Much (of the second phase) is left open to interpretation, which, in the Middle East is both the best and the worst thing,” an Israeli official told CNN.
    


            Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, along with Egypt and Norway, warned over the weekend that the ceasefire is at a “critical moment,” at risk of collapse as mediators try to make progress. “It's not yet there, so what we have just done is a pause,” al-Thani said at the Doha Forum on Saturday.
    


            While the Trump administration is ready to begin rehabilitation and reconstruction of the enclave, Israel remains focused on disarming Hamas and the demilitarization of Gaza – a key component of the agreement, but one that has no clear path forward.
    


            “The question is whether, in the meantime, Hamas remains there, and that's it – we just get used to it and accept it,” a second Israeli official told CNN. Trump, the official said, wants to see progress before Netanyahu visits Mar-a-Lago, the president's private estate in Florida, at the end of the month.
    


            The US is also still working to finalize key details ahead of a potential phase two announcement, including the makeup of the international security force called for by the plan and the Board of Peace that would oversee Gaza's governance, a US official said.
    


            Two months in, the ceasefire has been tested repeatedly, with both Hamas and Israel accusing each other of violating the agreement. Nearly 400 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military since it went into effect in October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The Israeli military says three of its soldiers were killed by Hamas militants in that same period. And human rights groups have accused Israel of failing to uphold its commitments regarding the flow of humanitarian aid and blocking essential supplies, like tents, from entering the strip.
    


            On Sunday, Israeli military chief Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said Israeli forces will remain on the so-called yellow line inside Gaza, to which they retreated as part of the truce, referring to the frontier as a “new border line – serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity.”
    


            The Israeli military occupies more than half of Gaza but is required to withdraw completely in subsequent phases of the agreement. According to the deal, Israel is prohibited from permanently occupying or annexing the enclave.
    


            Meanwhile, the US has pressed Israel to open the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, which was supposed to restart operations as part of the ceasefire agreement. But Israel said in October it would remain closed “until further notice.” Earlier this month, Israel announced it would open the crossing only in one direction, for Palestinians to leave Gaza, but none would be allowed to enter, sparking outrage from Arab and Muslim nations who called the move an attempt “to displace the Palestinian people from their land.” Ministers in Netanyahu's right-wing government have repeatedly advocated for the “voluntary” emigration of Gaza's residents and the settlement of Jews in their place.
    


            The US has been working to resolve the dispute, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to raise the issue with his Israeli counterpart on Wednesday, a US official said ahead of the meeting.
    


            An Egyptian official attributed the lack of progress on the next phase to the chasm of distrust between Israel and Hamas. “Every point in it is tied to internal calculations on both sides,” the official told CNN. Political divisions – both within the Israeli government and amongst Palestinian factions – restrict the mediators' ability to take meaningful steps on a series of issues, they added.
    


            “Phase two is not frozen because of one point,” the official said. “It is frozen because every step affects Gaza's future, and the parties are not yet willing to pay the political cost of making a final decision.”
    


            The foremost demand for Israel is the demilitarization of Gaza. The agreement calls for the decommissioning of Hamas' weapons and the destruction of militant infrastructure.
    


            On Sunday, a senior Hamas official said the militant group was “very open-minded” about what to do with its weapons.
    


            “We can talk about freezing or storing or laying down, with the Palestinian guarantees, not to use it at all during this ceasefire time or truce,” Bassem Naim told the Associated Press in an interview in Qatar. The proposal appears to fall short of the disarmament clauses under the ceasefire agreement, and it's not clear if Israel would accept anything else.
    


Hamas willing to discuss ‘freezing or storing' weapons, senior official says, amid concerns over ceasefire



            To manage disarmament, the agreement calls for an international force that will secure parts of Gaza ahead of Israel's withdrawal. But that force only exists on paper now. The United Nations Security Council passed a US-sponsored resolution last month that enshrined Trump's 20-point plan, including the mandate necessary to create a multinational force for Gaza, but not a single nation has formally committed troops to it yet.
    


            The Trump administration's goal is to have the force deploy to Gaza sometime early next year, according to the US official. But it's not clear which countries would participate. Even those like Indonesia and Azerbaijan, both of which had previously expressed willingness to send troops, appear far less committal now. American and Israeli officials told CNN the international force would initially deploy alongside the Israeli military in the Israeli-occupied parts of Gaza, though whether Muslim nations would want to be seen cooperating with Israeli forces is uncertain.
    


            In the meantime, Israel will continue to back local anti-Hamas militias in Gaza, according to the Israeli officials, even after the death of the leader of the most prominent gang last week. In a potential blow to Israel's post-war plans in Gaza, Yasser Abu Shabab was killed in what one of the sources described as “internal clashes,” underscoring the volatile nature of the territory after two years of war.
    


            Without any clear prospect of Hamas' disarmament or the international oversight mechanism, the second phase will focus on reconstruction efforts within Israeli-occupied Gaza. Israel has begun clearing areas in Rafah in southern Gaza to allow for the rebuilding of the shattered territory, as part of a broader strategy to convince Palestinians to move to what the US has dubbed “alternative safe zones,” and isolate Hamas.
    


            In the near-term, the Trump administration is focused on finalizing elements of Gaza's post-war governance. According to US and Israeli officials, the US is working to finalize the Board of Peace that will oversee the redevelopment of Gaza and the Palestinian technocratic committee to run the territory. At some unspecified date after that, a reformed Palestinian Authority, which currently governs parts of the occupied West Bank, is supposed to take over the administration of Gaza, opening the door to what the UN resolution called a “credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination.”
    


            Highlighting the long-term difficulties of the ceasefire agreement, Israel has already rejected both Palestinian Authority responsibility for Gaza and any notion of Palestinian statehood.

DORAL, Fla. (AP) — A U.S. Navy admiral who oversees military operations in Latin America handed off command responsibilities Friday as scrutiny increases over the Trump administration's deadly strikes on alleged drug boats in the region.

Adm. Alvin Holsey has retired one year into a posting that typically lasts three to four years and transferred leadership duties to his top military deputy, Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Pettus, during a ceremony at U.S. Southern Command headquarters near Miami. 

In farewell remarks, Holsey did not mention the military operations or the reasons for his early retirement. But he urged his successor to uphold longstanding partnerships in the region by standing firmly behind the shared values of democracy and support for the rule of law.

“To be a trusted partner, we must be credible, present and engaged,” Holsey said.

Holsey's shock retirement was announced by the Pentagon in October, over a month into the Trump administration's strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 87 people. With the campaign facing growing scrutiny by Congress, Holsey briefed key lawmakers earlier this week.




The ceremony Friday was more subdued than past retirements, held outdoors amid a small crowd of mostly Southern Command staff and without Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, because President Donald Trump has yet to nominate Holsey's replacement. 

Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made no mention of the military operations in Latin America as he thanked Holsey for his 37 years of service. Caine referred to Holsey as a “stoic” leader and “quiet professional” who always leads with his heart and head.

“It's never been about you, it's been about people, it's been about others,” Caine said. “You've never said ‘I' in all the conversations we've had. You've always said ‘we.' … The impact you've had will last for a long time.”

Holsey is departing as Congress is scrutinizing the boat attacks, including one that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of an initial strike. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Hegseth and other top officials have given classified briefings on Capitol Hill this week. 

Holsey also spoke this week to key lawmakers overseeing the U.S. military by classified video call. Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said afterward that Holsey answered senators' questions but that “there are still many questions to be answered.” Reed later added that Holsey did not give a reason for his retirement other than saying it was a personal decision.

Experts in the rules of warfare, human rights groups and even some of Trump's allies in Congress have questioned the legality of the attacks on those accused of ferrying drugs. For decades, they were arrested at sea by the Coast Guard and brought to the U.S. for criminal prosecution.

The 22 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels are being supported by a giant flotilla of U.S. warships, attack helicopters, thousands of troops and even the nation's most advanced aircraft carrier.

Trump's Republican administration has defended its aggressive tactics, designating several drug cartels in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations and declaring that the U.S. is in armed conflict with those criminal organizations, relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

The campaign has ramped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. In a sharp escalation Wednesday, U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration has accused of smuggling illicit crude. Sale of that oil on global energy markets is critical to Maduro's grip on power.

Maduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.

Holsey's departure is the latest in a long line of sudden retirements and firings that have befallen the military's top ranks since Hegseth took charge of the Pentagon.

A native of rural Fort Valley, Georgia, whose father and several uncles served in Vietnam, Holsey relinquished his command to Pettus to a soulful rendition of “Midnight Train to Georgia.”

Pettus, a fighter jet pilot with combat experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, had been serving as Holsey's top deputy since late 2024. However, it's unclear how long the Arkansas native will remain in the job. Whomever Trump nominates must be confirmed by the Senate.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, discusses the subpoena of former special counsel Jack Smith on ‘Hannity.' 

House Democrats plan to urge a federal judge in Florida to unseal former special counsel Jack Smith's final report, escalating their push to obtain the document ahead of Smith's deposition with Congress next week.

The 19 Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said, according to an amicus brief reviewed by Fox News Digital on Friday, that Judge Aileen Cannon's longstanding order blocking the release of the report, which details Smith's investigation and prosecution of President Donald Trump related to classified documents, had no basis and unconstitutionally hindered Congress from performing its duties.

""The continued suppression of [Volume II of Smith's report] now serves only to obstruct the constitutional processes by which the political branches oversee one another and report to the American people,"" the brief reads.

The Democrats, led by ranking member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., also sent a demand letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, the latest of several letters they have sent to her on the matter, saying she had no justification for withholding the report.

They said the decision to keep it from the public was ""baffling"" and that Cannon's order did not bar the DOJ from handing the document over to House lawmakers. They also said Bondi could easily ask Cannon to unseal it, but she has not done so.

""This Administration has repeatedly boasted that President Trump is ‘the most transparent and accessible president in American history.' Your campaign to bury Mr. Smith's report makes a joke out of that claim,"" the Democrats wrote. ""You are permitting prosecutors to be hauled before Congress to defend their work while denying Congress and the American public the written record that would explain it.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the DOJ for comment.

House Judiciary Committee Republicans subpoenaed Smith to testify next week behind closed doors as part of their investigation into his special counsel work, despite Smith asking to testify at a public hearing.

Democrats have been pushing as part of that probe for the second portion of Smith's final special counsel report, which likely contains Smith's deeply detailed account of how he went about investigating and charging Trump for allegedly retaining classified documents. The first volume was released last year under the Biden administration.

House Judiciary Republicans noted in a statement to Fox News Digital that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ordered Cannon to decide on whether to unseal the report by next month.

""Judge Cannon will decide by January 2026 whether Volume II should be released. Jack Smith will be questioned about his entire investigation next week before the Judiciary Committee,"" a committee spokesman said. ""Of course, Ranking Member Raskin knows all of this, but despises President Trump so much that he would rather mislead the American people than get the facts straight.""

Cannon, a Trump appointee, blocked the release of the report in January, saying it would interfere with the classified documents case against Trump's two co-defendants. Smith dropped Trump's charges alleging he mishandled national defense information after Trump won the election, citing a policy discouraging the DOJ from prosecuting sitting presidents.

The DOJ this year then dropped the charges against the co-defendants, but the U.S. attorney in southern Florida maintained in a recent court filing that the release of the special counsel report detailing the classified documents case would still cause ""extraordinary prejudice"" against the two former defendants.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that the federal government will yank tens of millions of dollars from New York state if they do not ""come into compliance"" with rules pertaining to the granting of commercial driver's licenses.

Duffy indicated that the state has 30 days to get in line.

""Fifty-three percent of New York's non-domiciled CDLs were issued unlawfully or illegally,"" he said during a press conference on Friday.

He asserted in a post on X, ""We're holding New York accountable for issuing non-domicile commercial driver's licenses to truckers illegally. FULL STOP. We're giving New York 30 days to comply or we'll withhold $73 MILLION! The safety of the American people comes first.""

Duffy blamed the prior presidential administration during the press conference.

""We have this problem because Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg did not enforce the law. And millions of people came into the country during their tenure and then when they were here, these rules were still there,"" he said, accusing them of turning ""a blind eye.""

New York State Department of Motor Vehicles spokesperson Walter McClure has accused Duffy of lying about the Empire State.

""Secretary Duffy is lying about New York State once again in a desperate attempt to distract from the failing, chaotic administration he represents. Here is the truth: Commercial Drivers Licenses are regulated by the Federal Government, and New York State DMV has, and will continue to, comply with federal rules,"" McClure said in a statement.

""Every CDL we issue is subject to verification of an applicant's lawful status through federally-issued documents reviewed in accordance with federal regulations. This is just another stunt from Secretary Duffy, and it does nothing to keep our roads safer. We will review USDOT's letter and respond accordingly.""

Harvard medical student Nick Norwitz reveals the science behind his food experiment, in which he consumed 133,000 mg of dietary cholesterol

Millions of Americans battle chronic anxiety — but new research claiming a missing brain nutrient may be partly to blame is already drawing skepticism from experts who say the findings are far from conclusive.

Using a non-invasive MRI-based technique that measures brain chemicals, researchers at UC Davis Health in California looked at data from 25 previous studies, comparing 370 people with anxiety disorders to 342 without anxiety. 

They found that, across the combined studies, individuals with certain anxiety disorders showed an average of about 8% lower choline levels in brain regions that help regulate thinking and emotions. 

BITE OF DARK CHOCOLATE COULD SHARPEN YOUR MEMORY WITHIN AN HOUR, STUDY SUGGESTS

""An 8% lower amount doesn't sound like that much, but in the brain, it's significant,"" said senior study author Richard Maddock, a medical doctor and research professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, Davis.

Choline — found in foods such as eggs, beef, chicken, fish and soybeans — plays a key role in memory, mood and cell health, according to experts.

The study authors propose that heightened stress responses in anxiety disorders may increase the brain's demand for choline, gradually lowering levels of the nutrient — especially in regions that help regulate stress and reduce the threat response, according to the published research.

The findings don't prove that low choline causes anxiety. The researchers also emphasized that it's too early to recommend eating more choline or taking large doses of it in supplement form. 

BRAIN AGING MAY SLOW WITH GREEN TEA, WALNUTS AND TINY SWAMP PLANT, STUDY FINDS

The research does, however, reveal a pattern across three major anxiety disorders that could shape future research into how nutrition and brain chemistry interact with anxiety disorders, they said.

""It suggests nutritional approaches — like appropriate choline supplementation — may help restore brain chemistry and improve outcomes for patients,"" study co-author Jason Smucny said in a statement.

Anxiety disorders affect nearly 30% of U.S. adults, according to experts. (iStock)

But several clinicians and nutrition experts told Fox News Digital the results should be interpreted cautiously and warned Americans against assuming anxiety is caused by a nutrient deficiency.

Maddock said more research is needed to learn if increasing choline will reduce anxiety. He warned that heavy choline supplements can cause side effects.

Experts note that people may benefit from reviewing their choline intake as part of routine nutritional guidance and recommend discussing any changes — especially for those with anxiety — with a healthcare provider.

YOU MAY BE EATING KALE ALL WRONG AND MISSING OUT ON KEY NUTRIENTS, RESEARCHERS WARN

Choline is considered ""essential"" because the body makes only a small amount of it, and the rest has to come from food, research has shown. Studies have found that most Americans, including children, don't get the recommended daily amount of the nutrient.

Some omega-3 fats found in fish, such as salmon, may be ""especially good"" at delivering choline to the brain, Maddock noted.

Experts say a balanced, choline-rich diet may support brain health but is not a replacement for anxiety treatment. (iStock)

""Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting about 30% of adults,"" Maddock said. 

""They can be debilitating for people, and many people do not receive adequate treatment.""

Nona Kocher, a board-certified psychiatrist in Miami Beach, agreed that an 8% drop is not ""trivial."" 

Kocher, who was not involved in the study, described the pattern as potentially indicating stress on metabolic processes.

""One big misunderstanding is thinking that a nutrient deficiency is the main cause of anxiety."" 

""We know from the clinic that this kind of burden is associated with feeling easily overwhelmed, feeling less resilient under stress and being mentally tired earlier in the day,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Nonetheless, the data suggest a consequence more than a cause, she noted.

The researchers emphasized that the new findings do not mean choline is the cause of anxiety — or that people should ditch treatment plans in favor of diet tweaks. The MRI technique they used captures chemical stress signals in the brain, so low choline may reflect metabolic strain and not simply a nutrient deficiency.

""One big misunderstanding is thinking that a nutrient deficiency is the main cause of anxiety,"" said Lauren Manaker, a registered dietitian nutritionist in South Carolina. 

Researchers say lower choline levels in brain regions are responsible for emotion regulation and stress response. (iStock)

""Anxiety is complicated and usually involves a mix of factors, like genetics, life experiences and brain chemistry,"" Manaker, who was not involved in the research, told Fox News Digital. 

""While low choline might have an association, it's not the whole story.""

Mood and anxiety disorders have been tied to other nutrient deficiencies, including vitamin D, Manaker said. 

A balanced diet that includes foods like dairy milk and eggs — which provide choline, vitamin D, B12 and other brain-supporting nutrients — may help address those gaps, but nutrition is only one piece of managing anxiety, she emphasized.

Experts caution that more research is needed before recommending choline supplementation. (iStock)

Kocher agreed choline is just ""one of many pieces of a larger stress biology puzzle, not the sole driver.""

Manaker said a choline-rich diet is important for overall brain health, regardless of whether someone has anxiety.

ARLINGTON, Virginia — My wife was surprised to learn that I was headed to the airport on Monday. The next day was our daughter's birthday, and I had been gone most of the past three weeks. I had not mentioned any travel plans to her, and she was counting on me to cook dinner. Alarmed may be the word.

But I told her I wasn't flying anywhere. I was headed to Ronald Reagan National Airport to cover an event hosted by the Department of Transportation, titled “Make Travel Family-Friendly Again.”

I didn't wake up that morning intending to go cover anything, but I had to. For one thing, with artificial intelligence supposedly improving rapidly and ready to take our jobs, I resolved to make myself less AI-replaceable (could we shorten that “replAIceable”?) in part by covering more things in person.

HUNGARY'S LITTLE BABY BUST

Also, I simply had to cover the event. After all, I wrote a book last year, titled Family Unfriendly, about how so much of our culture needs to be made more family-friendly, and here was the transportation secretary, who has eight or nine children, talking about exactly that.

But I noted that one email about the event, and about this family-friendly travel campaign, said the “campaign will focus on incentivizing more family-friendly resources in airports and expanding access to healthier food options on the go.”

Hmm. Those seem like two different things — both good things, but different things. Keeping your children from melting down and not getting fat and lazy are not the same undertaking.

As soon as I got to the airport, I ran into a family from Seattle. Their names were Shane and Jeatt, the latter pronounced “Jet.” This was regrettable, because I feared my readers would have trouble believing that the mother I interviewed about flying with children had the name “Jet.”

While their three-year-old (I am guessing here) wriggled on the floor and on top of one of the large suitcases, Shane and Jeatt told me that they had no trouble flying with their three children all the time. They said they believe air travel in the United States is already perfectly family-friendly. Another sad trombone played in my mind. This undermined the premise of both my book and this DOT event.

(At this point, Shane handed me his family's leftover Metro SmarTrip cards, each with about $6 left. For journalistic ethics purposes, I feel I need to report here that I accepted these gifts.)

During the interview, I realized something: While I consider myself somewhat of an expert on raising children (my wife and I have six of them), and I have numerous ideas and systems when it comes to traveling with children, I actually have zero insights into flying with children.

My wife and I just don't do it. We are not rich enough to afford eight plane tickets. Instead, we vacation by minivan or SUV.

Literally, the first time I flew with more than one child at a time was two weeks ago, and it was my 19-year-old and my 17-year-old. The only logistical problem on that trip was that my daughter, returning to college, threw a party for herself the night before and had to pack at 4 a.m. before a 6:05 a.m. flight. Also, I had mild acid reflux, probably from drinking hazy IPAs the night before (not at my daughter's party, FWIW).

On Monday, when I arrived at the spot for the DOT airport event, I noticed a big pull-up bar. It was about 9 feet off the ground. I reviewed the email from DOT and became even more confused. Here were the problems the department hoped to address in its “family-friendly campaign”:

“From [1] needing more dedicated spaces for young children and [2] exercise equipment, to [3] finding places for mothers to nurse their children, to [4] staying fit on the go, or [5] struggling to find more healthy food options …”

Most of those five problems have nothing to do with children. If I had flown with my brood when they were young, I would not have been upset about the lack of salads or gone in search of a lat pulldown machine. I would have wanted a bar overlooking a massive play area for children, ranging from ages 2 to 12, where I could eat wings and drink IPAs. That bar would also feature a menu item currently lacking in airports: all-you-can-eat chicken nuggets.

Picture that: I'm downing Dogfish 60-Minute because the Southwest pilot is doing the driving, Charlie's wrestling Brendan on a floor mat, Sean's grabbing a handful of nuggets, Meg and Eve are climbing a jungle gym, and Lucy's sneaking a sip of her mother's pinot. That's family-friendly travel.

When I consider other families traveling by air, my main concern is the attitudes of other Americans. Some adults seem to think that children don't belong on airplanes.

Babies cry. If you wanted your children to sit next to you, they say, you should have ordered your tickets 10 months ago. Toddlers drool and occasionally yell while they have headphones in as their parents try to pacify them with the digital babysitter.

Somehow, we have reached a point as a culture where parents are expected to feel bad about bringing their children into public places. Again and again, stories appear in the news of parents bringing goodie bags on board for those who need to sit near their babies: earplugs, drink coupons, and so on.

And then there are the stories of parents having to move heaven and earth to sit next to their children on a plane.

That's total crap.

I love hanging out with my children, but I don't need to sit next to them. I certainly don't need to haggle with the person sitting next to me to give up their seat for my children.

Had I flown with my children, I would have brought a different sort of baggie and handed it to the person seated next to my children. “Here are some wet wipes and a little trash bag, because I have no idea what's gonna come out of my boys. And here are some snacks: If you pace them out right, Sean won't talk at all for the whole flight.”

As we got closer to the start of the airport event, I started to gather clues that this was not for me. I spotted a woman with an eight-month-old and introduced myself, figuring she was a DOT staffer. She was very well put together, with perfect hair, but I figured this was just normal in the Trump administration. Later, I learned that she is a “content creator.” That is, she is an influencer. Specifically, now she would qualify as a “momfluencer.”

A “momfluencer” who has only one child and who has been a mother for only a few months was one of the speakers at this event. Another speaker was a fitness influencer with an Italian name.

Also, there was Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

When Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy took the stage, the influencers stood to his left, along with the CEO of Farmer's Fridge, which sells vending-machine salads. To Duffy's right stood RFK Jr.

RFK Jr., I realized, was the reason this event involved a pull-up bar and a vending machine full of salads. He stood in shirt and tie, looking jacked and awkwardly stiff. If you didn't know he was a Kennedy and didn't know he was a Cabinet official, you would have thought, by his stance, that RFK Jr. was Duffy's bodyguard, whose only weapons were his hands. 

Most people who heard about this airport event afterward learned from the posts of Aaron Rupar, a liberal social media user whose job is to post out-of-context quotes to make Republicans look bad.

But this event made Rupar's job easy. It was not very hard to make a 71-year-old RFK Jr. sound weird when he began his remarks with an ode to “the infant formula in a mother's breast.”

Much of what RFK Jr. and Duffy said was good and important. Crucially, Duffy was not laying out a set of mandates or new funding for airports. He was announcing rule clarifications that would allow airports to use already-existing federal funds for family-friendly infrastructure, such as better play places or dedicated family TSA lines.

Children need to burn as much energy as possible before getting on a flight, as Jeatt and Shane commented, and as every parent knows. If airports use millions of federal dollars to build awesome, sprawling, bar-adjacent playgrounds, that really would be great for families.

WE'RE GETTING FEWER BIRTHS, NOT JUST LATER BIRTHS

Yet somehow this discussion at the airport soon devolved into a pull-up contest between RFK Jr., Duffy, the fitness influencer, and one of Duffy's many daughters.

One reporter asked Duffy if he thought it was a good idea for people to get really sweaty before getting packed into a plane for hours. Duffy brushed that idea off while RFK Jr. panted heavily with sweat glistening on his brow. As my wife texted me telling me to come home and cook the chicken, the CEO of Farmer's Fridge started offering us all free food. For journalistic ethics reasons, I declined the free vending machine salad, but I thought, man, I wish my children could have been here to see this odd spectacle. My boys could have done pull-ups, and maybe I could have forced them all to eat the salad.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Nearly 100,000 photos obtained by House Democrats from the estate of notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein include images of President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, film director Woody Allen, and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon and others in social settings.

Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as they made the photos public, urged the Department of Justice to release investigative files it has related to Epstein ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to do so to comply with a newly passed law.

One image among a batch of photos released Friday morning shows Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release. Some of the women are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks. 

Trump is shown in another photo standing behind Epstein at what appears to be a social event. A third photo shows Trump sitting next to a woman, whose face is blacked out, on what appears to be a plane.

Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein before the two men had a falling out sometime in the early 2000s. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and has denied knowledge of Epstein's abuse of girls and women while they are friends.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, in a statement to CNBC, accused House Democrats of ""selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative.""

Jackson called the Democrats' focus on the president's connection to Epstein a ""hoax,"" and argued that the Trump administration ""has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have"" by releasing documents and calling for transparency.

Clinton is shown in one photo standing with Epstein, his now-convicted procurer Ghislaine Maxwell, and another man and woman. The photo has Clinton's signature on it.

Other photos show former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was previously known as Prince Andrew of Britain, and Epstein's one-time lawyer Alan Dershowitz.

The dates, locations and context of the photos were not revealed as part of the release Friday. 

CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos, all of whom have denied wrongdoing. This story will be updated with their responses.

""This latest production contains over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein,"" a statement from Democrats on the Oversight Committee said.

""Images also include thousands of photographs of women and Epstein properties,"" the statement said. ""Committee Democrats are reviewing the full set of photos and will continue to release photos to the public in the days and weeks ahead. Committee Democrats are committed to protecting the identities of the survivors.""

Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee, in a statement said, ""It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.""

""These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW.""

 Trump and top law enforcement officials in his administration for months resisted the idea of releasing investigative files related to Epstein and Maxwell before Congress in November overwhelmingly passed a law mandating their release by the Department of Justice.

Those files, which are separate from the ones released by the Democrats on Friday, have yet to be made publicly available.

Garcia said the committee received the new batch of photos from Epstein's estate on Thursday night.

He said that the committee's Democrats have reviewed ""maybe about 25,000 of [the photos] so far.""

""There's an enormous amount of photos we have not gone through,"" Garcia said. ""It will take days and weeks to ensure that we got those photos and that a redaction is done in the appropriate way.""

""Obviously there are photos of powerful men, and folks that we want to have an opportunity to speak with and ask questions of,"" Garcia said.

He noted that the photos were in the estate's possession, and that Epstein took some of them himself, while others may have been sent to him.

""Some of the other photos that we did not put out today are incredibly disturbing,"" Garcia added.

Republicans on the Oversight Committee, in their own statement, said, ""Once again, Oversight Democrats are chasing headlines by releasing a handful of selectively censored and cherry-picked photos from the Epstein Estate.""

""Democrats' hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. Nothing in the documents we've received shows any wrongdoing,"" the Republicans said. ""Ranking Member Robert Garcia and Oversight Democrats should be ashamed of this disgusting behavior of putting politics above justice for the survivors.""

Epstein died from a jailhouse suicide in August 2019, weeks after he was arrested on child sex trafficking charges filed by the DOJ during Trump's first term in office.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for her 2021 conviction of crimes related to procuring underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.

Angel Urena, a spokesperson for Clinton, had said in a July 2019 statement, ""President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York.""

""In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation. Staff, supporters of the Foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip,"" Urena said. 

""He had one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein's New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail. He's not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein's ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida.""

Oracle's earnings miss and $80B market cap wipeout show how tightly Bitcoin now tracks AI-driven tech risk, but the policy response to a credit crunch could recreate the liquidity conditions.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Oracle lost roughly $80 billion in market value on Dec. 11 when revenue missed expectations, and management hiked AI-related capex from $35 billion to about $50 billion, funded in part with rising debt.

The stock dropped up to 16%, dragging Nvidia, AMD, and the broader Nasdaq lower.

Reports framed the move as fanning “AI bubble” fears, with investors questioning whether the payoff from building massive data-center capacity is arriving fast enough to justify those costs.

On the same tape, Bitcoin slipped below $90,000, likely due to worries over the AI sector denting risk appetite.

The single-day episode encapsulates Bitcoin's new structural vulnerability: it has become the high-beta tail of the AI trade, moving in lockstep with tech equity sentiment and bleeding harder when AI-linked stocks crack.

The correlation between Bitcoin and Nvidia reached approximately 0.96 over a rolling three-month window leading into Nvidia's November earnings, according to analysis from 24/7 Wall St.

Regarding Nasdaq, The Block data shows that the 30-day aggregate Pearson Correlation coefficient was 0.53 as of Dec. 10.

Additionally, Bitcoin is down around 20% since the Fed began easing interest rates on Sept. 17, while the Nasdaq is up 6%. This suggests that when tech stocks crash, Bitcoin tanks harder.

The AI bubble narrative has matured rapidly over the past few weeks.

Reuters reported in late November that AI-linked valuations and macro gauges such as the Buffett Indicator have pushed overall US equity valuations beyond dot-com-era extremes, while AI-heavy indices show sharp pullbacks and rising volatility even as enthusiasm remains high.

Besides, big tech companies have raised hundreds of billions of dollars in bonds this year to finance data centers and hardware. Morgan Stanley estimated a funding gap of around $1.5 trillion for the AI infrastructure build-out, and Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi warned that AI-related borrowing now exceeds tech's run-up before the dot-com crash.

Essays in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and The Atlantic both cite roughly $400 billion in AI spending this year against only about $60 billion in revenue.

The math implies that most firms are deeply loss-making and that the wider economy is now partly leaning on an AI investment boom that cannot last indefinitely.

If the AI bubble bursts, the damage to Bitcoin will go beyond simple correlation, as AI capex increasingly becomes a credit story.

Estimates indicated that AI-related data center and infrastructure financing deals jumped from about $15 billion in 2024 to roughly $125 billion in 2025, driven by bond issuance, private credit, and asset-backed securities.

Analysts in a Reuters piece compare some of the structures and opacity to pre-2008 patterns and warn of “untested risks” if tenants or cash flows disappoint.

Central banks now treat this as a financial-stability problem. The Bank of England's recent stability update explicitly highlights stretched valuations in AI-focused firms. It also warns that a sharp correction in AI-linked equities could threaten broader markets via leveraged players and private-credit exposures.

The ECB's November 2025 Financial Stability Review makes a similar point: the AI investment boom is increasingly funded through bond markets and private capital, making it more exposed to swings in risk sentiment and credit spreads.

Oracle is the poster child. Its $50 billion capex plan for AI data centers, alongside a roughly 45% jump in long-term debt and record credit-default-swap spreads, represents exactly the sort of over-extended balance sheet regulators worry about.

If an AI bubble pops, those spreads widen, refinancing costs jump, and leveraged funds that were long AI-themed debt and equities are forced to cut gross exposure. Bitcoin sits at the end of that chain.

Chinese researchers' analysis of Bitcoin versus global liquidity finds a strong positive relationship between Bitcoin prices and global M2 or broad liquidity indices. Their paper called BTC a “liquidity barometer” that performs well when global liquidity is high and poorly when it contracts.

The liquidity story is straightforward: if the AI bubble bursts and forces a credit squeeze, the first-order effect is a global de-risking and liquidity pullback.

Bitcoin is one of the first things macro and growth funds sell when margin calls come in, and its outsized sensitivity to liquidity makes the drawdown worse.

The other half of the story is what happens after the first wave of deleveraging.

The same institutions that worry about an AI-driven correction also implicitly point toward the likely response. If over-levered AI and credit markets wobble hard enough to threaten growth, central banks will re-ease financial conditions.

The IMF's latest Global Financial Stability Report warns that AI-driven equity concentration and stretched risk asset valuations make a “disorderly correction” more likely and stresses the need for careful, but ultimately supportive, monetary policy to avoid amplifying shocks.

History gives a template. After the COVID shock in March 2020, aggressive quantitative easing and liquidity provision coincided with a massive rise in total crypto market cap from around $150 billion in early 2020 to roughly $3 trillion by late 2021.

A recent Seeking Alpha report mapped Bitcoin against global liquidity and the dollar index shows that, once easing starts in earnest and the dollar weakens, BTC tends to put in large upside moves over the following quarters.

The narrative rotation also matters. If AI equities go through a classic post-bubble hangover, with lower multiples, negative headlines, and political backlash over wasted capex, some portion of speculative and macro capital could rotate into a different “future of money” or “anti-system” bet.

Bitcoin is the cleanest non-corporate candidate.

Recent market stress has already seen capital concentrate back into BTC rather than alts. As liquidity thinned and volatility rose recently, Bitcoin's dominance has climbed to around 57%, with ETFs serving as the institutional on-ramp.

Additionally, although Bitcoin has recently shown a correlation with tech stocks, decentralization and scarcity remain the core of the “hedge” narrative.

Bitcoin's structural problem is that it cannot decouple from the AI trade in the short term, but it depends on policy responses to an AI bust for its medium-term upside.

In the immediate aftermath of an AI credit crunch, Bitcoin bleeds because it is the high-beta tail of macro risk, and global liquidity contracts faster than most assets can adjust.

In the months that follow, if central banks respond with renewed easing and the dollar weakens, Bitcoin historically has captured outsized gains as liquidity flows back into risk assets and speculative narratives reset.

The question for allocators is whether Bitcoin can survive the first hit well enough to benefit from the second wave.

The answer depends on how violent the AI correction is, how quickly policy pivots, and whether institutional flows through ETFs and other vehicles hold or break under stress.

Oracle's Dec. 11 earnings miss is a preview: Bitcoin dropped below $90,000 in the same tape that wiped $80 billion off Oracle's market cap, showing that the correlation is live and the sensitivity is real.

If the AI bubble fully unwinds, Bitcoin takes the punch first. Whether it emerges stronger depends on what central banks do next.

However, one short term positive indicator revealed itself later in yesterday's trading session. Nvidia recovered 1.5% from its intraday low, while Bitcoin followed suit but gained over 3%, reclaiming $92,000.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Solo Bitcoin Miner Beats the Odds, Winning $282K Reward","https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solo-bitcoin-miner-beats-odds-181347598.html","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 18:13:47 GMT","

Oops, something went wrong

A solo Bitcoin miner netted a reward of 3.13 BTC, valued at around $282,000, on Thursday. 

The feat had odds of around 1 in 30,000 in happening, according to the administrator of CK Pool, the service used by the miner, which is designed to help solo miners win blocks. 

“Congratulations to miner 1Ng9~VoQz with 270TH for solving the 311th solo block at solo.ckpool.org,” the pseudonymous developer and pool administrator wrote on X.

To use the pool, miners pay a 2% fee—about 0.062 BTC (around $5,734) in this case—to the service when they win blocks, but they do not need to incur the overhead of running a full, expensive Bitcoin mining rig.

The latest block victory was the fourth in the last three weeks for Solo CK Pool-powered miners. Prior to that, you'd have to go back to September to find the latest Solo CK block reward, according to data from mempool.space. 

Solo CK Pool miners have now earned 5,553 BTC in total for their mining efforts, a total sum of around $511 million at current prices.

However, while solo miners can sometimes strike gold and earn their own block, experts told Decrypt earlier this year that mining without the support of a big pool “is like playing the lottery.”

The statement is especially true as Bitcoin's hashrate, or the total computational power of the network continues to increase—now averaging more than 1 ZH/S in the last 24 hours, up from around 736 EH/S on this day last year.

Bitfarms Will 'Wind Down' Bitcoin Mining and Pivot to AI After $46 Million Loss

Mining Bitcoin, or other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, requires that miners spend exorbitant computational power to solve complex mathematical equations. In order to solve these equations, it takes a lot of power and energy, and special hardware that can be costly.

As a reward, miners are given freshly minted Bitcoin—currently 3.125 BTC, along with user fees from the mined block.

As the economics of Bitcoin mining shift, some publicly traded mining firms are shifting priorities towards powering the AI boom—or opting out of the Bitcoin business altogether. In November, publicly traded firm Bitfarms announced it would wind down its Bitcoin mining operation after a $46 million loss in order to focus on providing compute for the burgeoning AI industry.

Bitcoin is flat in the last 24 hours, recently changing hands at $90,062. ","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

At least 5.6 million people had their names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers stolen in a data breach at 700Credit, a company that runs credit checks and identity verification services for auto dealerships across the United States.

In a statement on its website, the Michigan-based company blamed the October data breach on an unidentified bad actor.

According to Michigan's attorney general, the hacker stole personal data collected from dealers between May and October 2025.

The company said it was now sending letters by mail to individuals whose information had been stolen in the data breach, which offers credit monitoring services.

“If you get a letter from 700Credit, don't ignore it,” said Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel. “It is important that anyone affected by this data breach takes steps as soon as possible to protect their information. A credit freeze or monitoring services can go a long way in preventing fraud, and I encourage Michiganders to use the tools available to keep their identity safe.”

I don't care about most vice industries, even ones that have harm and addiction. What I care deeply about is advertising and persuasion. Gambling should be allowed, however bookmakers should never be allowed to initiate contact to entice the behavior. No push notifications, no ads, no TV network, no tv sponsorships. If people want to engage in your vice, they should have to find you.Also, severe penalties. If a kid somehow gets access to an account, the bookmaker should have to unwind and refund all bets that they can't definitively prove were made by an adult in addition to paying fines, or something similarly draconian. The burden of proof and responsibility needs to be on the people providing something that is proven dangerous to society. If that means that we can't have betting apps, that's fine.The proven societal harms of the sports gambling boom more than justify this level of regulation.

There are many places where gambling has been fully legal for decades. We should be able to look at data to make conclusions about whether something is good or bad.(I do, however, wish people would shine a spotlight on scratch off tickets... mainly because the odds are so terrible compared to how they're advertised -- if it weren't state-sponsored, I don't think private companies would be able to get away with running ads for lottery tickets that pay out so incredibly poorly)

Yes, there was a fair amount of unlicensed sports betting, and of course a pro sports scandal every so often.Alternatively, if you cap the amount of bets the bookies can retain, that might solve my immediate problem of I'm so tired of seeing the sports players with betting ads on their jerseys, the commentators yapping about bets, and then half of the commercials are sports betting ads. If they can't keep much, they won't have money to advertise.Personally, I enjoyed the ads a lot more when the poker industry was advertising their no money .net sites and hoping people would just happen to go to their .com sites instead. That was at least a little amusing.

Its generally the case that people didn't ask for it, most of the legalization of gambling in 21st century America was done by state legislatures, not referendums, and there's plenty of evidence that lobbying had a big role in this.  However its also true that the public failed to reject it, most of the times it was put to referendum.  Most people probably never asked for it, but when they were themselves asked most people took a libertarian position and said let people do as they want, even if it harms their kids by ruining their family finances...

The commercials are a celebration of addiction, and its disgusting to those of us who have struggled with addiction and know, like you say, the damage is clear. And they tacitly admit it too at the end of the commercial where they hurriedly say ""struggling with gambling addiction? call this number."" As if that absolves anything.And it's not just the gambling either. A typical commercial break these days consists of: gambling ads where they try to get you addicted, crypto ads where they try to bilk you, political ads where they lie to you, and then there's the omnipresent pharmaceutical ads. And now we've got AI ads on top of it all. Every one of those ad categories should be made illegal, like tobacco advertising.

The institutions that enable gambling receive the majority of the upside, while society receives all the negative externalities of people not being able to pay their bills, digging themselves into holes, not able to participate in the real economy.The institutions enabling this use dark patterns and addictiveness to fuel a cycle of dependence.I am also of the libertarian ideology that we should mostly let people do whatever they want so long as it doesn't hurt others. But lately I've been starting to think there are some habits (gambling) and some drugs (fentanyl) that are impossible to use responsibility and that destroy individuals and degrade society.I think gambling should be regulated and taxed. This should not be such a lucrative or desirable industry to target.At least gambling in the stock market, housing market, etc. is actually tied to real securities and derivatives. Betting on sports is useless. It pads the wallets of the gambling marketplaces and decreases the fitness, mental health, and security of the losers.

You cannot avoid it, every free to air channel is basically now sponsored by sports betting ads, every traditional newspaper is kept alive by sports betting ads and every second billboard and poster is for sports betting. Children are now exposed and normalised to it from birth.Absolutely nothing is being done from a regulatory point of view. It enables traditional media and it seems traditional media still call the shots in Australia.

I think it's both a cause of and a symptom of the middle class disappearing.Part of the compulsion towards gambling and lotteries is this sense that there's no other viable path upwards from where you are.If you can't even imagine a reasonable chance of success from starting a small business, finding a better job, going back to school, or some other healthy path towards security and prosperity, then literally rolling the dice starts to seem like the most tangible (if unlikely) path towards wealth.People gamble when they believe they don't have any better opportunities to spend their meager amount of discretionary income on.(Of course, there is a separate compulsion towards gambling that is more a direct mental illness like alcoholism. But if you see a large-scale rise in gambling, I think you need to look for societal causes.)

We already are regularly asked to accept mere emotionally motivated opinion as information.  Of course its relayed as ""fact-based reporting"", wrapped in mostly tidy narratives which wear the makeup of a journalistic endeavor.  But look at which facts are amplified, suppressed, or omitted; or the adjectives used around the facts or which facts are only ever spoken by the journalists and which facts are allowed to be conveyed directly by the participants.  Even the choice of which stories are newsworthy and which aren't plays a role.Modern journalism is already largely a call to action for adopting a particular worldview rather than an effort to ensure that you have the best information in formulating opinions.  The press, the government, and activists already have taken the stand that you are a fool that is better manipulated into ""correct thinking"" by your betters than left to your own devices.Given all that, I would contend that most reporting is not there to inform you in the first place: its there to manipulate your emotions on a subject while convincing you that somehow you are now ""informed"".  I would say under those circumstances that any trust that still exists in the media is already misplaced.  The betting question is just another avenue exacerbating an already unreliable journalistic landscape.

While I understand the first counterexample, this one seems a bit blurry. Can anybody clarify why a directed acyclic graph whose underlying undirected graph is cyclic is bad in the context of microservice design?

reply

If service A feeds both B and C, and they both feed service D, then D can receive an incoherent view of what A did, because nothing forces B and C to keep their stories straight.  But B and C can still both be following their own spec perfectly, so there's no bug in any single service.  Now it's not clear whose job it is to fix things.

reply

People treat the edges on the graph like they're free. Like managing all those external interfaces between services is trivial. It absolutely is not. Each one of those connections represents a contract between services that has be maintained, and that's orders of magnitude more effort then passing data internally.You have to pull in some kind of new dependency to pass messages between them. Each service's interface had to be documented somewhere. If the interface starts to get complicated you'll probably want a way to generate code to handle serialization/deserialization (which also adds overhead).In addition to share code, instead of just having a local module (or whatever your language uses) you now have to manage a new package. It either had to be built and published to some repo somewhere, it has to be a git submodule, or you just end up copying and pasting the code everywhere.Even if it's well architected, each new services adds a significant amount of development overhead.

And then N4 is a shared utility service that's responsible for e.g. performance tracing or logging or something similar. To make the dependency ""harder"", we could consider that it's a shared service responsible for authentication and authorization. So it's clear why many root services are dependent on it—they need to make individual authorization decisions.How would you refactor this to remove an undirected dependency loop?

The only way I can see to avoid this is to have all those cross-cutting concerns handled in the N1 root service before they go into N2/N3, but it requires having N1 handle some things by itself (eg: you can do authorization early), or it requires a lot of additional context to be passed down (eg: passing flags/configuration downstream), or it massively overcomplicates others (eg: having logging be part of N1 forces N2/N3 to respond synchronously).So yeah, I'm not a fan of the constraint from TFA. It being a DAG is enough.

But what if we add 2 extra nodes: n5 dependent on n2 alone, and n6 dependent on n3 alone? Should we keep n2 and n3 separate and split n4, or should we merge n2 and n3 and keep n4, or should we keep the topology as it is?The same sort of problem arises in a class inheritance graph: it would make sense to merge classes n2 and n3 if n4 is the only class inheriting from it, but if you add more nodes, then the simplification might not be possible anymore.

You'll probably also have lines pointing to your storage service or database even if the data is isolated between them. You could have them all
be separate but that's a waste when you can leverage say a big ceph cluster.

You absolutely want the same identity service behind all of your services that rely on an identity concept (and no, you can't just say a gateway should be the only thing talking to an identity service - there are real downstream uses cases such as when identity gets managed).Similarly there's no reason to have multiple image hosting services. It's fine for two different frontends to use the same one. (And don't just say image hosting should be done in the cloud --- that's just a microservice running elsewhere)Same for audit logging, outbound email or webhooks, acl systems (can you imagine if google docs, sheets, etc all had distinct permissions systems)

If you look at this proposal and reject it, i question your experience. My experience is not doing this leads to codebases so intertwined that organizations grind to a halt.My experience is in the SaaS world, working with orgs from a few dozen to several thousand contributors. When there are a couple dozen teams, a system not designed to separate out concerns will require too much coordinated efforts to develop against.

Said less snarky, it should be trivial to define and restrict the dependencies of services (Although there are many ways to do that).  If its not trivial, that's a different problem.

A polytree has the property that there is exactly one path that each node can be reached. If you think of this as a dependency graph, for each node in the graph you know that none of its dependencies have shared transitive dependencies.I'll give it one though: if there are no shared transitive dependencies then there cannot be version conflicts between services, where two otherwise functioning services need disparate versions of the same transitive dependency.

On Instagram, Ross Duffer revealed a tiny bit more about the next drop of Stranger Things season five episodes coming to Netflix this Christmas.

“Chapters Five, Six and Seven: locked, mixed, scored, colored… Volume Two is DONE,” he wrote, and revealed a video of their titles.

Chapter Five, is titled “Shock Jock.” It “picks up moments after the end of ‘Sorcerer.' Frank Darabont is back, but he flexes very different muscles on this one than he did on ‘Turnbow Trap'—it's far darker, and far scarier,”  Ross Duffer wrote. Darabont, a veteran director in the Stephen King universe, delivered one of the strongest episodes in Stranger Things 5‘s first batch.

The Duffer Brothers' longtime collaborator, Shawn Levy, who is currently working on Star Wars: Starfighter, makes his franchise return with Chapter Six. It's called “Escape from Camazotz,” and Ross Duffer described it as “the biggest episode of the three—and the performances make us cry every time we watch it.” That's the kind of character work we expect as we draw closer to the last stand for Hawkins against the Upside Down.

Then there's Chapter Seven, “The Bridge.” The penultimate Stranger Things installment will be co-directed by the Duffers and Levy. “Don't want to say too much, but aside from the finale, it's probably the most emotional chapter of the season. It's gonna be a long six-day wait for the finale…” he teased.  He also added, “Runtimes to come.”

Stranger Things season 5, volume one, is now streaming on Netflix. Volume Two will be released on December 25, and the series finale will take its bow on December 31.

The RAM is in another castle.

Something's rotten in Mushroom Kingdom, and this time around it's not Bowser's fault. Nintendo's stock price took a 4.7% nosedive today, due to predictions that the Japanese console maker won't be able to keep its profit margins as high as expected. As has become the norm these days, the fear is caused by the ongoing RAM and chip availability crisis, as AI datacenters grab any transistor that's not nailed to the floor.

The latest dip wiped $14 billion off Nintendo's market cap and brought the stock roughly to its May price, eroding gains made since then. It's also the second hit in as many days, with the weekly drop being about 9.8%. The production cost for the Switch 2 has risen substantially, given that it uses 12 GB RAM chips whose cost has reportedly risen by 41% in Q4 alone.

Adding insult to injury, the NAND flash onboard the console also saw an 8% aggravation. Bloomberg notes that this rise in storage pricing will also reflect itself on storage cards, further cementing statements previously made by OEMs like Transcend and Adata, some of which are even unable to secure flash chips to begin with. The Reuters report also points out that microSD cards aren't really optional, as some titles chew up most of the Switch 2's capacity.

Stockholders are right to be concerned, as reports from earlier in the year remark that Nintendo was apparently selling the Switch 2 at a very slim profit margin, with some outfits estimating that non-Japanese sales could be at a simple break-even point, or even at a loss. The U.S. tariff situation is only likely to complicate that matter further.

Having said all that, the Switch 2 actually sold at an aggressive price during Black Friday, effectively bundling Mario Kart World for free with the console, so it's not impossible that Nintendo saw where the RAM winds were heading and took the appropriate precautions beforehand.

Plus, even with this latest dip, the stock is still up around 25% for the year. Add to that the fact that Nintendo almost certainly makes the lion's share of its money from games rather than hardware, and maybe this situation is just a temporary concern.

Adjunctive use of the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide was associated with greater glycemic control and better weight outcomes in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, new research suggested.

In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, adults treated with clozapine or olanzapine achieved larger 26-week reductions in A1c level when once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide was added vs matching placebo.

In addition, patients receiving adjunctive semaglutide had greater reductions in body weight, waist circumference, and fat mass.

The results support the use of the medication “as a potential early intervention strategy to reduce cardiometabolic risk in this vulnerable population,” Marie R. Sass, PhD, Mental Health Center Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, and colleagues wrote.

The findings were published online on December 3 in JAMA Psychiatry.

Previous research has shown that patients with schizophrenia who take second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have an increased risk for adverse metabolic events, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, which can lead to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Sass and colleagues wanted to assess whether the use of a GLP-1 could help mitigate these risks. They conducted a multicenter, double-blind trial that included 73 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who were between the ages of 18 and 65 years (mean age, 35 years; 65% women; mean BMI, 36.1). Participants were enrolled at three sites in Denmark from 2021 to 2024.

All had initiated treatment with clozapine or olanzapine during the previous 5 years and had early-stage glycemic dysregulation at baseline, including A1c levels of 5.4%-7.4%.

They were randomly assigned to receive once-weekly placebo (n = 37) or semaglutide (n = 36) at a starting dose of 0.25 mg that was titrated up to 1 mg from week 8 to week 26. Participants with adverse events (AEs) were maintained at a dose of 0.5 mg.

Adherence and safety were monitored at study visits conducted every 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in change in A1c level from baseline to week 26. A total of 78% of patients fully completed the trial.

At 26 weeks, adjunctive semaglutide produced a significantly greater A1c reduction than placebo (mean difference, -0.25%; P < .001). Low-risk A1c levels (< 5.4%) were reached by 43% of semaglutide-treated participants compared with 3% on placebo.

Results showed a significant reduction in A1c at 26 weeks for adjunctive semaglutide compared to placebo (mean difference, -0.25%; P < .001) — with 43% vs 3% achieving A1c levels of less than 5.4%.

In all sensitivity analyses models, semaglutide was associated with a greater reduction in A1c than placebo.

Body weight and waist circumference were also reduced more in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group (differences, -9.2 kg and -7 cm, respectively; P < .001 for both), as was fat mass (difference, -6.1 kg; P = .006).

Psychiatric symptoms, lipid levels, blood pressure, and liver function did not differ between the treatment groups.

Gastrointestinal events were the most common AEs, with nausea reported in 47% of the semaglutide group vs 41% of the placebo group, vomiting reported by 39% vs 14%, and constipations reported by 33% vs 19%. Serious AEs were reported by 14% vs 16% of the groups.

“These results suggest that semaglutide may represent an effective strategy to mitigate the substantial metabolic burden associated with SGA treatment,” the investigators wrote, adding that confirmatory large-scale and long-term studies are needed.

Interestingly, the findings are similar to a study published in September in JAMA Psychiatry. As reported by Medscape Medical News, its results also showed that adjunctive semaglutide treatment was linked to reduced body weight (mean difference, -9 kg) and A1c (difference, -0.46%) and better physical quality-of-life scores compared with placebo in adults with schizophrenia, prediabetes, and obesity.

The study was funded by the Mental Health Services in the Capital Region of Denmark, as well as Novo Nordisk A/S for semaglutide and semaglutide-placebo pens. Many of the investigators reported having ties with various organizations, which are fully listed in the original article.

Soybean oil (SO), one of the most widely used cooking oils in the US and a staple in many processed foods, is regarded as benign or even beneficial when compared with saturated fat.

But new research suggests SO may contribute to weight gain and postulates a potential mechanism behind this effect. Although the study was conducted in mice, the researchers said it could have implications for humans.

“Soybean oil isn't toxic per se. But the quantities in which we consume it are triggering pathways our bodies didn't evolve to handle,” senior author Frances Sladek, PhD, professor of cell biology and toxicologist, Department of Cell, Molecular, and Systems Biology, University of California Riverside, told Medscape Medical News.

The study was published online in the Journal of Lipid Research.

Composed of primarily polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), SO is rich in linoleic acid (LA), an essential omega-6 fatty acid. The consumption of SO has “remarkably increased” in the past century, according to the authors.

“We were concerned about the ever-increasing rates of obesity in the US. We learned from a seminal study that SO is the single component that has changed the most in the American diet over the past 100 years — more than chicken and more than fructose,” said Sladek and lead author Sonia Deol, PhD, assistant research professor, University of California Riverside, in an e-mail to Medscape Medical News.

Their previous research suggested that oxylipins — downstream bioactive metabolites of PUFAs — are associated with several metabolic and inflammatory conditions, notably obesity. In particular, they showed that oxylipin metabolites of LA and alpha-LA(ALA) were associated with obesity in male mice who were fed a high-fat diet rich in SO.

LA is a ligand for hepatocyte nuclear factor alpha (HNF4-alpha), a protein manufactured in the liver that regulates the expression of numerous genes that play a role in fat metabolism, Deol and Sladek explained. “HNF4-alpha is considered to be the ‘master regulator' of liver-specific gene expression,” they said.

HNF4-alpha exists in two major isoforms — P1- and P2-driven. Although P1 tends to predominate, P2 can be induced under certain conditions (eg, metabolic stress, fasting, and liver disease).

“We thought this variation in HNF4-alpha isoforms, together with other differences like age, sex, medications, and genetics, may shed light on the reason some people gain weight from SO, while others don't.”

Results of previous experiments found that mice whose HNF4-alpha gene was altered to produce only the P2 isoform (alpha-7HMZ mice) had decreased expression in the liver of some of the enzymes that metabolize LA.

“So we thought we might see a different response to SO in these mice,” the researchers said. “We wanted to understand why one of the most widely consumed edible oils in the world leads to more obesity than other types of fats.”

In the current study, the researchers compared the effect of the LA-rich SO diet to an isocaloric diet based on coconut oil, which is low in LA. These two high-fat diets were fed to alpha-7HMZ mice and to ordinary wild-type (WT) mice. Standard lab chow was fed to a third group of mice, who were used as a low-fat control group.

Following the feeding period, the researchers harvested liver samples and performed targeted lipidomic and proteomic analyses, quantifying LA, ALA, their downstream metabolites, and the enzymes that metabolize them.

The alpha-7HMZ mice gained significantly less weight on the SO diet than the WT mice and exhibited insulin resistance. Notably, oxylipin levels in the liver rather than in the blood correlated with body weight, “suggesting that blood tests would not accurately capture early metabolic changes related to the SO diet,” Deol and Sladek said.

The livers of the alpha-7HMZ mice exhibited significantly fewer oxylipins, relative to WT mice. Enzymes involved in the metabolism of LA and ALA showed reduced expression or activity in the alpha-7HMZ mice, who also showed superior mitochondrial function. “This suggests a potential role for mitochondria in the resistance to diet-induced obesity and might explain why these mice gained less weight,” Deol and Sladek said.

“Our research showed that diets high in SO can cause obesity and can also increase intestinal inflammation, make the gut microbiome less beneficial, and drastically alter the gene expression in the liver, intestines, and hypothalamus,” they said.

“This suggests that SO, or any other dietary component that is ubiquitous in our diet, should not be seen as a ‘free ride,'” they added. “You cannot assume that just because a small amount of something is good for you, a lot more of it will be better.”

Further research should determine whether these findings can be generalized to other PUFAs and to human beings.

Commenting for Medscape Medical News, Marion Nestle, PhD, MPH, professor of nutrition, food sciences, and public health, emerita, New York University, New York City, wondered “what this complicated mouse study has to do with human nutrition.”

Since fat has more than twice the calories of protein and carbohydrates, “not eating too much of any kind [of fat] might help with weight maintenance,” said Nestle, a visiting professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.

Also commenting for Medscape Medical News, Scott Isaacs, MD, president of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, called the findings “scientifically intriguing but not a reason for people to avoid SO.”

The study “underscores that fat quality matters and suggests there may be nuanced differences among specific monounsaturated fatty acids and PUFAs; but it remains hypothesis-generating,” said Isaacs, an adjunct assistant professor of medicine, Emory University, Atlanta. “More human research is needed before changing dietary advice for patients.”

This study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Institutes of Health. Deol, Sladek, the other authors, and Isaacs reported no relevant financial relationships. Nestle reported receiving royalties and honoraria for books and lectures about food politics.

Alex Garlick worked in Congress during the 2017 debate over whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was one of the most memorable years for federal healthcare policy in recent memory.

He's now a political science professor at the University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, where he analyzes the ability of healthcare lobbyists to wield influence and shape policy reforms, and how that ends up increasing prices for everyone. Garlick's research on the topic and his own experience in Congress served as the foundation to write a new book, “Pre-existing Conditions: How Lobbying Makes American Health Care More Expensive,” which was published in October.

Garlick talked to Medscape Medical News for a Q&A about his book and what his research tells us about how special interest spending can block wide-scale changes in the healthcare system and what can be done to combat lobbying efforts and reduce healthcare costs. Answers have been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Why did you decide to write this book?

I worked in Congress in 2017, when the effort to repeal and replace the ACA was going on, so that was really like a front-row seat to see just how many interests and lobbyists were involved in the issue. And while that reform didn't pass, I think it really informed the country on how the ACA worked, and many of the policy battles we've seen since then have kind of echoed some lessons of that, including this fall with the government shutdown.

Political scientists have not always believed that lobbyists have a major impact on policies that are made. But when I look at healthcare finance policy in particular, I think that this is an issue where lobbyists are particularly influential in their ability to stop cost containment policies from being put into effect.

Now that the country is seemingly having a cost of living or affordability crisis, it's getting more attention. And I think the influence of lobbyists is more important to understand now than ever.

In your book, your research shows that, at the state level, each individual healthcare lobbyist adds about $7 to healthcare costs. How did you come to that number, and what does that mean for healthcare costs as a whole?

The data from the book look at changes in each state's per capita expenditures on healthcare. So how much do the people living in each state pay for healthcare? And what we see is that when more healthcare industry lobbyists are in each state, year over year, there tends to be less healthcare legislation that's introduced, and the costs tend to rise more.

I see that as a function of the fact that many efforts at regulating the healthcare industry are going to make things more affordable for patients and consumers. And when legislators or bureaucrats are putting less effort into regulating their healthcare market, costs tend to inflate higher, and that's why we see each individual lobbyist associated with higher spending in each state.

So then how does health lobbying shape what reforms are even viable for state legislatures to take on?

The major way lobbying affects the policies that are considered is that lobbyists can almost dictate what legislators will work on. And what I mean by that is healthcare is a very complicated subject to understand and to legislate. The best way to understand the healthcare field is to talk to healthcare professionals.

So, when legislators are relying on the healthcare industry for information, it gives the industry lobbyists leverage and the ability to broker what information will be given to lawmakers to make them more comfortable and able to legislate on an issue.

Moving to the federal level, are there any examples in Congress right now that show how lobbyists have been effective in shaping healthcare policy?

The $50 billion rural hospital transformation fund [included in the domestic tax bill passed earlier this year] is an acknowledgment that the future cuts that are going to come to Medicaid are going to disproportionately affect rural hospitals that rely on Medicaid reimbursements to keep the lights on.

I think that it is in some ways an indication of the effectiveness of the hospital lobby that they were able to get the Senate to acknowledge the future cuts to Medicaid were going to affect hospitals in particular. This fund was an effort by the Senate to shore up the hospitals, and it's also an opportunity for states and hospitals to have their lobbyists continue to have an impact.

Zooming back to Vermont — because that's where you work and do research — what can other states learn from Vermont in terms of trying to lower healthcare prices?

First of all, healthcare is not very affordable in Vermont, and I think there are kind of two lessons that can be learned from that.

I think the first lesson is you don't want to let a hospital monopoly dominate your market the way that it does in Vermont. The University of Vermont Medical Center charges much higher prices than independent providers do around the state….Those costs really add up for the insurers and then eventually for the residents of Vermont over time.

In terms of a positive lesson for Vermont, Vermont has a regulator with the ability to approve or reject upcoming price changes year over year. It's called the Green Mountain Care Board. In recent years, the Green Mountain Care Board has had showdowns with the University of Vermont Medical Center, which kind of shows the ability of a powerful regulator to make things slightly more affordable for residents.

Last year, the Green Mountain Care Board rejected a hospital-projected price increase. The response of the hospital was pretty disruptive, as the CEO of the hospital system actually left, and the hospital is now under new leadership. While I'm not privy to what happened on the hospital side, it's clear that the regulator has had an impact on the business model of what the hospital is doing there.

What are some other policy ideas that you might have for healthcare cost containment?

I think the tool that legislators and bureaucrats should be eager to look for is ways to increase the supply of healthcare providers, particularly in hard-to-reach areas such as rural areas. Because in some ways, healthcare is like other parts of the marketplace. When supply is restricted, prices go up because healthcare demand does not seem to be going down anywhere….When personnel is lacking, hospitals end up paying exorbitant prices for travel nurses or having to patch things up on a short-term basis.

The other thing I think that legislators should be thinking about is how to address prices directly. Wholesale administrative price controls have been attempted before in the country. Preventing the emergence of vertical or horizontal monopolies is another way to protect patients. If healthcare is going to be provided in the open market, at least give patients a chance.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved an extension to the licensed indications for Mounjaro (tirzepatide, Eli Lilly Nederland B.V.) to enable its use for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that is not satisfactorily controlled in children and adolescents aged 10 year and older.

The drug is currently indicated together with diet and physical activity in adults to treat type 2 diabetes that is not satisfactorily controlled. It can be used as monotherapy in patients who cannot take metformin or as an add-on to other diabetes medicines.

It is also currently indicated for individuals who are obese (BMI of ≥ 30) or overweight (BMI between 27 and 30) and have at least one weight-related health problem. This covers comorbid conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Tirzepatide acts to help people lose weight and keep it under control.

The EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) said that it was recommending the change to extend tirzepatide's use to children in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management.

Tirzepatide is a prescription-only medicine that acts as both a GLP-1 agonist and a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide agonist. This dual action enhances insulin secretion, reduces blood sugar levels, regulates appetite, slows gastric emptying, and regulates fat metabolism. 

The drug is available in prefilled pens as a solution for injection. It is injected subcutaneously once weekly into the abdomen, upper arm, or thigh. 

Five main studies involving more than 6000 adults with type 2 diabetes previously showed that tirzepatide is effective at controlling blood glucose, as demonstrated by reductions in A1c, a measure of long-term control. These studies showed A1c reductions of between 2.1 and 2.6 percentage points after 40-52 weeks when added to existing treatments and/or lifestyle measures. In comparison, the placebo groups registered A1c reductions between 0 and 0.9 percentage points, while those on comparative treatments had reductions of 1.3 to 1.9 percentage points.

More broadly for weight management, studies on more than 2500 adults with obesity or overweight and at least one weight-related comorbidity had shown tirzepatide in varying doses combined with diet and physical activity for 72 weeks reduced weight by at least 15% on average. In comparison, those on placebo had an average weight loss of just 3%. The CHMP previously commented that more than 85% of people taking tirzepatide were able to reduce their weight by at least 5%, compared with 35% of those given placebo. Weight loss was mainly due to loss of fat mass and occurred along with improvements in other measures such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

In a phase 3 trial of tirzepatide in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes, results published in The Lancet in October showed that the drug met the primary and all key secondary endpoints at 30 weeks, and showed sustained improvement in glycemic control and continued BMI reduction through the study's 52-week extension. A1c was reduced by an average of 2.23% in the tirzepatide group vs an increase of 0.05% in the placebo group. The safety and tolerability profile of the drug in children was generally consistent with previous adult studies.

In adult studies, the most common side effects of tirzepatide have been gastrointestinal, including nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting.

The full indication for tirzepatide is now: for the treatment of adults, adolescents, and children aged 10 years and older with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise; as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications; or in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.

Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product characteristics, which will be published on the EMA website in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing authorization has been granted by the European Commission.

Every year, thousands of individuals develop flu or flu-like symptoms but never seek medical care. These mild and common episodes often go uncounted, obscuring the true circulation of respiratory viruses worldwide.

According to the acute respiratory infection surveillance system SiVIRA, managed by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, between September and May 2025, influenza led to more than 33,000 hospital admissions, approximately 1800 intensive care admissions, and approximately 1800 deaths in Spain. These figures capture only the most severe cases that require medical care, leaving many mild infections unrecorded and limiting understanding of respiratory virus circulation.

To address this gap, researchers developed Epidemiradar, an online surveillance platform created by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) within the European Data Science Initiative EOSC-SIESTA, the Influenzanet network, and the CSIC Interdisciplinary Platform on Global Health.

Epidemiradar is part of the broader Influenzanet network in Spain and invites any resident of Spain to voluntarily participate in building a collaborative map of respiratory virus incidence and spread. After registering on the website, participants complete a short questionnaire and then receive weekly emails asking them to report their current health status, allowing the system to generate continuous population-level surveillance data.

Any resident of Spain can register and complete a short questionnaire on the Epidemiradar. Participants then receive weekly emails asking them to report their current health status, enabling the system to build a collaborative map of respiratory virus activity.

Speaking with Univadis Spain, part of the Medscape Professional Network, Jose J. Ramasco, PhD, researcher at CSIC's Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems (IFISC CSIC-University of the Balearic Islands) and head of Epidemiradar in Spain, said, “The traditional system for measuring the prevalence of infectious diseases relies on what are called sentinel physicians, which are reports coming from the health system about the cases that are observed.” According to the epidemiology expert, these cases are usually relatively severe “because if the illness is mild, patients don't go to the doctor, and therefore some of the information that could be important for understanding the extent of the disease in the population is lost.”

Although the platform currently focuses on influenza and COVID, “some trials have been conducted, such as for dengue fever in Italy, and this same system can be used to monitor However, he noted that “Such platforms like Epidemiradar are better suited to diseases that are common in the population. Less common diseases are difficult to detect because the population sample is necessarily small.”

“Epidemiradar operates in several European countries, such as Italy, France, the UK, and Netherlands. It is important to emphasise the word ‘standardised' because the questions about symptoms are agreed upon to obtain comparable information on diseases at a continental level,” he said.

“The first survey of each season asks about risk factors, and information is collected in case it can be used in specific studies beyond Epidemiradar's normal activity, where this information is not published. Of course, these additional studies, like everything on the platform, must be approved by a certified ethics committee,” he continued.

Users who have already experienced COVID or the flu can also register on the platform. “Because they can get it again. Moreover, the important thing now is to build a community of people interested in collaborating on health,” Ramasco emphasised.

The tool's responses are anonymised and aggregated weekly by region and province, generating maps that track the presence and evolution of flu-like symptoms across the country. These data help researchers detect early patterns and anticipate potential outbreaks, thereby improving the understanding of how respiratory viruses spread.

According to Ramasco, this information is valuable at various levels. “In infectious diseases like COVID or the flu, there is a wide range in the severity of symptoms. Some patients have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. This is important because these patients do not feel extremely ill, continue with their normal activities, and contribute to the spread of the disease. This profile is fundamental for models that help predict when and how diseases spread.”

Ramasco also highlighted that “these models need to be calibrated, and it's crucial to have as broad an understanding as possible of the infection's spread within the population across geographic areas over time in order to do so.” He added that “in some diseases, such as emerging epidemics, there are community transmission mechanisms that are not as well understood, and this information, together with the models, can help characterise them. For example, with COVID-19, the significance of mass infections wasn't clear until quite late in the pandemic.”

He further noted the adaptability of the platform. One of the most compelling features of Epidemiradar, he said, is that “it helps to get a snapshot of the situation, currently focused on influenza and COVID, but it can be expanded. However, its potential is enormous. It's necessary to build a community interested in health and willing to collaborate, but with this same system, many more diseases, both infectious and non-infectious, can be monitored.” Ramasco emphasised that “having as many users as possible is fundamental.” He concluded that if a new pandemic were to emerge, “this tool could focus on monitoring that disease and help public health managers better understand the situation quickly. It would help prevent outbreaks by ensuring that the measures taken are more effective.”

The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

 December 12, 2025  

As artificial intelligence (AI) use gains ground in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, it raises a host of data privacy, provider liability, and equity and bias concerns. The World Endoscopy Organization issued a consensus statement that aims to help clinicians, technology developers, regulators, and medical societies address these issues.

“Gastrointestinal endoscopy has some of the most translationally mature AI applications, with new use cases emerging rapidly,” corresponding author Omer F. Ahmad, MBBS, PhD, a consultant gastroenterologist and interventional endoscopist at University College Hospital, London, England, told Medscape Medical News.

Computer-aided detection (CADe) of colon polyps, the most validated AI application, already is making its way into clinical practice, and emerging uses — CA diagnosis (CADx), automated report generation, and AI-derived quality metrics — are sparking interest, the authors noted.

“As these tools become increasingly capable and complex, there is an urgent need for expert-informed, consensus-based guidance to support their safe and responsible integration into clinical practice,” Ahmad said.

The 10-point consensus statement, published in Annals of Internal Medicine, was developed by a panel of 14 experts from 11 countries.

AI tools generate and process vast amounts of patient data, raising questions about data privacy, ownership, and use, as well as algorithm development, the authors noted. To safeguard patient information, AI algorithms for GI endoscopy should adhere to local governance policies related to patient privacy and data-sharing agreements, the statement recommended. In the endoscopy suite, commercial AI algorithms and research initiatives should follow data privacy and security regulations, and providers should establish clear policies on data ownership and usage, so patients know how their data will be used.

Additionally, developers of AI tools for GI endoscopy should implement mechanisms to document and transparently report algorithm modifications, updates, and performance outcomes to regulatory and clinical stakeholders.

“Together, these practices strengthen regulatory oversight, enable postmarket surveillance, and help clinicians understand model changes and limitations in everyday use,” the authors wrote.

The use of AI in GI endoscopy requires clinicians to balance AI-generated insights with their own clinical judgement, often in real time, potentially blurring conventional boundaries of medical liability, the authors noted. For example, where does liability lie if a clinician relies on an inaccurate CADx or disregards an accurate one? What risks may arise when an endoscopist dismisses an AI-generated report saying mucosal inspection was inadequate because he or she disagrees?

To help guard against liability, physicians and healthcare organizations should ensure that they're using AI systems in agreement with the manufacturer's intended use, according to the statement. Clear guidance from medical societies and legal experts could mitigate liability concerns, especially with the emergence of semi-automated reading of capsule endoscopy and CADx, the authors wrote.

Before AI-driven report generation and AI-enabled performance indicators are widely adopted, it is essential to evaluate their accuracy, understand their clinical relevance, and clarify associated medicolegal implications, they added.

Further research is needed to evaluate the real-world clinical impact of AI in GI endoscopy, ideally with evidence linking AI to meaningful patient outcomes, beyond technical performance, especially regarding automated reporting and AI-generated quality metrics, Ahmad said.

Healthcare research has shown that AI tools can yield biased outcomes if training datasets aren't representative of the patient population. To improve equity and minimize bias, AI algorithms developed for use with GI endoscopy should be trained and validated on datasets that reflect the race, ethnicity, and gender mix of the populations they serve, according to the statement. Similarly, AI research and development should include transparent reporting of the study population, so clinicians can assess the generalizability and equity of the technology, the authors wrote.

Research is needed to determine whether the use of AI in GI endoscopy may exacerbate disparities through underrepresentation in training sets or unequal access to AI technology, they added.

“Although perhaps not every AI model for GI endoscopy will require stratification by race or gender, a default assumption of irrelevance risks overlooking subtle but important sources of inequity. Diversity in data sets should therefore be seen not as a burden but as a safeguard for generalizability,” the authors wrote.

Prospective implementation studies will be essential to understand the many ways AI adoption will change GI endoscopy, including workflow, accountability, and standards of care, Ahmad said. “Research demonstrating AI performance across diverse populations and care setting will be important to avoid potentially widening existing disparities,” he added.

The new consensus statement is a welcome addition to recent guidance and guideline statements, including the World Endoscopy Organization position statement on both CADe and CADx,the MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem Foundation and BMJ Living Clinical Practice Guideline, and the American Gastroenterological Association Living Clinical Practice Guideline on CADe-Assisted Colonoscopy, Jeremy Glissen Brown, MD, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, told Medscape Medical News.

“As the authors rightly point out, this is the perfect time to create and critically appraise structured frameworks for thinking through responsible integration, safe evaluation, and governance of AI in endoscopy,” said Glissen Brown, who was not involved in developing the statement. “CADe for colonoscopy has been in clinical use in Europe since approximately 2019, in Asia since 2020, and in the United States since 2021. In addition, ambient scribe technologies, automatic report generation, CADq systems (computer-aided quality assessment) and many CADx applications are relatively deep into the development-to-deployment pipeline.”

Although additional research is needed to address ongoing questions related to the key areas of medical liability, data governance, privacy, transparency, data ownership, and risk of bias, the consensus statements represent an important starting framework, Glissen Brown said.

The consensus statement was developed as part of the part of the OperA (Optimising Colorectal Cancer Prevention through Personalized Treatment with Artificial Intelligence) project funded by the European Commission. The authors had no relevant financial conflicts to disclose. Glissen Brown disclosed serving as a consultant for Medtronic and Olympus/OdinVision and speaking honorarium for Magentiq.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Mass General Brigham launches AI company to enhance clinical trial matching","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251212/Mass-General-Brigham-launches-AI-company-to-enhance-clinical-trial-matching.aspx","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 16:28:00 GMT","

Mass General Brigham is announcing the spinout of AIwithCare, a company founded by researchers from the health system who developed an artificial intelligence (AI) screening tool that significantly outperformed manual screening for determining a patient's eligibility and enrolling them in a clinical trial.

The tool, RECTIFIER (RAG-Enabled Clinical Trial Infrastructure for Inclusion Exclusion Review), was first developed and studied by researchers at Mass General Brigham's Accelerator for Clinical Transformation. Since the publications of a proof-of-concept study in June 2024 and prospective, randomized-controlled, blinded trial in February 2025, RECTIFIER's use has continued to expand across the healthcare system, with more than 20 active and onboarding use cases in research and clinical operations, including in cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, neurology, pathology and psychiatry.

RECTIFIER represents the first new company spun out by Mass General Brigham involving a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI application developed by researchers within the health system. The development and deployment of the tool was born out of a collaborative effort between the healthcare system's Digital, Personalized Medicine, Accelerator for Clinical Transformation and Innovation groups.

Through AIwithCare, and its AIwithCare Studio platform, the researchers plan to scale this capability to other healthcare systems, hospitals and clinics seeking to match their patient populations with relevant clinical trials and support medical and operational applications with improved analytics.

Building tools that fit smoothly into clinical trial workflows requires cross-functional teams with expertise in clinical practice and with technical aptitude. That includes change management, software development, information security, and product and program management. Our ability to bring all these skills together to develop AI solutions was essential. Now that this work is complete, it will be much easier for others to deploy and benefit from the capabilities.""

Jane Moran, Chief Information and Data Officer, Mass General Brigham

RECTIFIER leverages generative AI to screen a patient's electronic health record for information that can determine their eligibility for a clinical trial such as diagnoses, key health indicators and current or past medications. The tool assesses unstructured data available in notes and reports, which are often crucial for determining trial eligibility but are typically inaccessible without a laborious manual review process from research coordinators and clinical staff.

In a 2024 study in NEJM AI, RECTIFIER was found to more accurately identify eligible patients that met a heart failure trial's eligibility criteria when compared to manual screening, and at a far lower cost than traditional methods. A follow-up randomized trial of nearly 4,500 patients, published in JAMA earlier this year, found that the rate of enrollment using RECTIFIER for patient screening was almost double that of traditional manual screening. That study also showed no significant differences in trial eligibility and enrollment rates in separate analyses factoring in patients' race, gender and ethnicity.

""Licensing RECTIFIER is a major milestone in our goal of delivering AI-powered solutions that improve operational workflows, enhance clinical trial efficiency and optimize care delivery pathways,"" said RECTIFIER research co-senior author and AIwithCare CEO and co-founder Alexander ""A.J."" Blood, MD, MSc, associate director of the Accelerator for Clinical Transformation and cardiologist in the Heart and Vascular Institute at Mass General Brigham.

""The tool's demonstrated ability to rapidly and accurately identify patients for studies can be a game-changer for research teams and especially for the patients who deserve timely access to clinical trials of cutting-edge therapies,"" added Sandy Aronson, president and Chief AI Officer, AIwithCare, former executive director of IT and AI at Mass General Brigham Personalized Medicine, and current digital research principal architect for the health system.

In addition to clinical trials, groups at Mass General Brigham are using RECTIFIER to accelerate patient identification and reduce the burden of manual chart review in clinical and population health use cases.

Pediatric gastroenterologists are using RECTIFIER to perform patient referral triage with demonstrated 94.7% accuracy, identifying urgent labs and symptoms buried within clinical notes with 98% accuracy. The Mass General Brigham Population Health Service Organization, a department responsible for improving care for over 650,000 patients through value-based models, has also used RECTIFIER to streamline patient assessment eligibility for a heart failure management program. Additionally, the group is using the tool to accurately identify those above their goal blood pressure, allowing health system resources to be directed towards them to reduce their cardiovascular risk. Other groups are using RECTIFIER to perform high-resolution phenotyping of patients with sickle cell disease or across ALS trials to accelerate patient identification and enrollment for faster access to potentially life-altering therapeutics.

Mass General Brigham Innovation, which facilitated the new company spinout, works with researchers throughout the healthcare system to manage tech transfer commercialization and coordinate industrial relationships such as licensing agreements, formation of new companies and other contracts, in addition to intellectual property (IP) management and general advising, with an ultimate goal of translating novel research advances and innovations from bench to bedside. In the past year alone, Mass General Brigham Innovation had more than 1,400 active licenses, more than 600 new inventions disclosed, and nearly 200 issued U.S. patents.

Advancing AI that can streamline matching patients with clinical trials reflects our commitment to practical innovation that strengthens patient care and expands access to promising therapies. Deploying such technology more broadly could help reduce significant barriers in care delivery and ultimately accelerate clinical research.""

As the U.S. and Canada prepared for the 2026 soccer World Cup tournament, rumors abounded about the rapport between U.S. President Donald Trump and the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the international self-regulatory body for association soccer.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has been criticized for violating ethics rules when he created a FIFA Peace Prize for Trump, including by former FIFA President Sepp Blatter. Infantino is no stranger to controversy, having been implicated in the Panama Papers scandal in 2016, targeted in a FIFA ethics committee investigation for alleged malpractice in 2017, and investigated for criminal conduct in Switzerland in 2020. 

The recent relationship between Trump and FIFA under Infantino's leadership has raised many questions and fueled several rumors, true and false, eight of which Snopes investigated.

Kylian Mbappe left Paris Saint-Germain for Real Madrid in 2024 Photos: Ryan Pierse/Robbie Jay Barratt/Getty Images. Design: Eamonn Dalton/The Athletic

Kylian Mbappe spent seven years at Paris Saint-Germain. It is his hometown club. While there, he won six Ligue 1 titles and scored a record 256 goals.

However, the relationship between Mbappe, one of the world's greatest footballers, and PSG, the European champions, has since blown up spectacularly.

A bitter dispute over unpaid wages and bonuses saw both sides appear before a labour court in Paris on November 17.

They are both claiming extraordinary sums of money. Mbappe's legal side are seeking €263million (£230m; $309m) in total, while PSG have filed a counterclaim against Mbappe, asking for around €440m in damages.

A decision on that is expected on December 16.

This is the tale of how the relationship between Mbappe and PSG deteriorated to the point of a messy legal battle.

Mbappe arrived at PSG from Monaco on August 31, 2017, on an initial one-year loan, before joining in a permanent €180m transfer on a four-year deal. PSG had already broken the world transfer record that summer by signing Neymar for €222m from Barcelona.

Mbappe won a domestic treble in his first season before becoming one of the most recognised figures in the sport after winning the World Cup with France in the summer of 2018.

In the summer of 2021, with one year left on his contract, there was an expectation that Mbappe would depart, especially after he turned down two extension offers. Leonardo, PSG's sporting director at the time, told broadcaster RMC it seemed “clear” Mbappe wanted to leave. However, PSG rebuffed two bids from Real Madrid, and instead added more dazzle to their star-studded squad by bringing in Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi from Barcelona.

Mbappe opted to stay in May 2022. After signing a new contract, he was paraded around the Parc des Princes holding a shirt aloft with his name and 2025 on the back. But the deal was actually a two-year contract extension until the summer of 2024, with the option of extending for a further year.

In their legal arguments, shared with The Athletic, PSG claim that if Mbappe chose to stay until 2025, he would receive the same €33.3m net annual salary and ethics bonus identical to the previous two seasons, along with a €60m extension-option bonus, a €55m gross — the amount before any taxes or deductions — loyalty bonus, and an additional €9.5m gross bonus.

“I had the call of the homeland and of the capital city,” he declared, in an interview with Le Parisien. Mbappe also told the New York Times he'd been encouraged to stay in Paris by Emmanuel Macron, the French president.

Mbappe went on to score 41 goals the following campaign, landing another Ligue 1 title, but things turned sour the next summer.

In their legal arguments, PSG said they received a letter from Mbappe on June 12, 2023, informing the club he didn't want to exercise his option to extend for another year. They claimed that the letter was backdated to July 15, 2022, just two months after he had signed his contract extension.

In a club statement, shared with The Athletic, PSG claimed this was evidence Mbappe had “acted disloyally by concealing, for nearly 11 months, his decision not to extend his contract, thus depriving the club of any possibility of organising a transfer”.

At the November 17 hearing, Delphine Verheyden, Mbappe's lawyer, said the letter was sent in the interests of transparency, to make it clear he wasn't going to extend for an extra year, as reported by RMC. Mbappe's legal team didn't respond to further questions when asked by The Athletic.

That summer, Mbappe turned down the chance to join Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia, despite PSG giving him permission to speak to them following a €300m bid in July 2023. He favoured a move to Real Madrid.

Eager to avoid losing Mbappe for nothing the following summer, he was placed on the transfer list in the summer of 2023 and excluded from PSG's pre-season tour to Japan. Mbappe was also omitted from PSG's season opener against Lorient on August 12.

The day after that 0-0 draw, PSG claimed a deal had been reached between the two sides.

PSG claimed Mbappe initiated the agreement in a letter sent on August 11. In this letter, PSG claim that Mbappe offered to reduce (by €55m gross) the bonuses due for the 2023-24 season, as long as he was reinstated in the PSG squad. The deferred payment was only payable if he remained at the club — he would not receive it if he left on a free transfer in 2024.

A meeting was held the next day, and PSG say they struck an agreement on August 13.

Two options were set out under that deal, according to PSG. The first involved Mbappe extending his contract for the 2024-25 season, allowing the club to bank a transfer fee of €180m.

The second was that, if he chose not to extend, he would hand back various financial entitlements to compensate the club for a free transfer in the summer of 2024. In their statement, PSG said this was done “to preserve the club's financial stability after the exceptional investment made”.

However, Thomas Clay, one of Mbappe's lawyers, told a press conference on April 10, 2025, that it was a “fairy tale” to suggest any agreement had been reached in August 2023 between PSG and Mbappe, as reported by Le Monde.

“The club are not above the law, and the law is on the player's side,” Clay added.

According to PSG's legal arguments, the player's statements suggested he was still considering extending his contract at the start of the January 2024 transfer window after he had been reinstated into the side. For example, he told media members in the mixed zone after PSG's 2-0 victory against Toulouse in that month's Trophee des Champions final (France's Super Cup) that he was still considering what to do.

“I have not yet made my decision,” he said on January 3. “But with the agreement I made with the president this summer, regardless of my choice, we have managed to protect all parties and preserve the serenity of the club for the challenges to come, which remains the most important.”

The January window shut with Mbappe's future still unclear.

However, sources told The Athletic on February 15 that Mbappe had informed PSG he would leave that summer. On May 10, he publicly confirmed he was leaving on a free transfer that summer.

Three days later, PSG said they sent a letter to Mbappe's legal team explaining they were applying the second option of the August 13 agreement.

According to their legal arguments, this involved not paying Mbappe his €36.6m gross signing bonus due at the end of February 2024, as well as suspending payments from April 2024 (totalling €17.25m) until the end of his contract on June 30, 2024.

In response, Mbappe's legal team sent PSG a letter on May 31 demanding the club pay the striker what they said he was owed.

In their view, PSG felt this went against the “gentlemen's agreement” they had agreed “in good faith” in that August 13 meeting, which they reminded Mbappe of in a letter on June 10.

Mbappe's legal team are adamant that no evidence of any agreement has ever been proven. They added that if there had been an agreement, it would have required a formal amendment.

On June 18, Mbappe's lawyers again sent a formal notice to the club to pay what they said the France captain was entitled to.

Mbappe would go on to leave PSG on a free transfer when his contract expired before joining Real Madrid.

Verheyden, Mbappe's lawyer, told L'Equipe that the striker is the “real victim” in the dispute.

She added that PSG “will finally understand that under French law, contracts must be respected and what is owed must be paid”.

Mbappe's legal team told The Athletic how he was seeking the application of the law, like any employee.

They explained how the hearing on November 17 focused primarily on the part of his claim that related to non-payment of Mbappe's wages and bonuses for April, May and June 2024. They said Mbappe was owed about €55m gross, which included his bonuses and wages for April, May, and June 2024, plus some extras his contract added on. This would take it to €60.9m gross in total.

On April 10 this year, Mbappe obtained a court order to freeze PSG's accounts. That came after Mbappe's legal team held a press conference to say “a decision has been taken, this time to go on the attack”.

However, a month later, PSG successfully overturned it and had their accounts unfrozen. In November, Mbappe took the matter to the appeal court, which this week dismissed his case and ordered him to pay the legal costs as well as a €3,000 payment to PSG.

Mbappe's legal team told The Athletic that no evidence of a waiver agreement had been provided by the club, despite their public statements.

A legal source, with close working knowledge of the case but who asked to remain anonymous to protect relationships, told The Athletic that PSG accept they didn't formally sign a document, but there was an agreement in place. They said PSG wanted to take a firm stance to set a precedent and to ensure such a thing did not happen again. They added how it was a case of the new PSG taking a stand against its past, which was all about too much player power.

Mbappe's legal team told The Athletic that his fixed-term contract should legally count as a permanent one, which would automatically entitle him to things such as notice pay and statutory redundancy compensation.

In response, PSG said “the request to reclassify his contract as a permanent contract… is completely without legal basis”.

In total, Mbappe's legal team are seeking €263m from PSG.

He is also pursuing claims for unpaid bonuses, back pay, ethics bonuses, undeclared work, psychological harassment, unfair dismissal, and safety breaches.

In their statement, PSG said they “reject all accusations of harassment or pressure”. They also pointed out how Mbappe had been involved in more than 90 per cent of matches during the 2023-2024 season.

Meanwhile, PSG are seeking a total of around €440m in counterclaims against Mbappe. They are asking for damages, largely related to financial losses and harm caused by alleged breaches of contract and the missed chance to cash in on a hefty transfer fee.

Responding to that, Frederique Cassereau, one of Mbappe's lawyers, told L'Equipe: “It's the first time in my 30 years of professional experience that I've seen an employer claim almost double the amount claimed by an employee. It's absolutely stratospheric.”

In their statement, PSG said they wanted to seek “recognition of the significant damages suffered by the club as a result of Mr Mbappe's serious breaches of his legally binding contractual commitments and the most basic principles of good faith and loyalty”.

They added how Mbappe had “continuously attacked the club at every opportunity… a regrettable situation for the player himself, as well as for French football as a whole”.

They went on to say this was “a matter of good faith, honesty, upholding values and respect for the Parisian institution and its supporters. At the same time, Paris Saint-Germain continues to build on the most successful season in its history, based on solidarity, hard work, team spirit and the precedence of the club over any individual”.

A decision on that case is expected on December 16, although either side would have the right to appeal to the Paris Court of Appeal.

Running alongside this main legal dispute is one relating to an Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) decision in the case.

In September 2024, the LFP ordered PSG to pay Mbappe the €55m in salary and bonuses he was allegedly entitled to, a decision that was upheld by their appeals panel a month later. But PSG challenged this ruling, and instead filed a case against the LFP in the Paris judicial court, arguing the LFP did not have the authority to decide the matter because a civil court case was already underway.

Following this, both the LFP and the French Football Federation (FFF) said they could no longer adjudicate the dispute, leaving it to be settled in the judicial system.

A preliminary hearing for that has now been set for February 23, 2026, as first reported by AFP.

That means this long-running dispute is going to rumble on for some time yet.

World Cup

Ticket prices released by FIFA this week for the men's World Cup in 2026 were, on average, 174 per cent higher than projected in the official bid book submitted by the joint proposal from the United States, Canada and Mexico to soccer's world governing body.

As part of an official FIFA process to be considered to host a World Cup, bidding nations must submit a bid book, which can be studied by both FIFA and federations across the world, who in turn judge its merits and decide who to vote for. The so-called ‘United' bid, which brought the American, Canadian and Mexican bids together under one umbrella, was published by FIFA in March 2018. The bid said that it made projections after “careful research and consultation with various resources and industry experts.”

The bid book's pricing, according to a person familiar with the bid who remains anonymous to protect relationships, leaned on the high side because the United bid was seeking to persuade FIFA and its member associations across the world that the World Cup in North America would return plenty of money into the global soccer ecosystem. Pricing for the World Cup is set by FIFA, with no input for the national soccer federations of the host country.

Yet even the projections made by the United bid do not come close to the prices unveiled by FIFA after the World Cup draw last weekend.



This week, in a phase which opened on Thursday, FIFA sold tickets in its “lottery phase” for specific matches, adjusting its prices based on the anticipated demand for each fixture. It revealed prices for Category One (the highest), as well as Category Two and Category Three. The vanishingly small number of Category Four tickets available in previous phases of sales were not present at all for this lottery phase.

FIFA's average price across the three categories for the opening games (i.e. the three opening matches of the tournament for hosts Canada, Mexico and the United States) was $1,728, compared to the projected average of $569 across the three categories in the bid book. This represents an increase of 204 per cent for those seeking to watch the USMNT play Paraguay, Mexico play South Africa, or Canada play the winner of a UEFA playoff between Wales, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Italy, or Northern Ireland.

An even more dramatic increase is present in the average price across the three categories for the World Cup final, which will take place at MetLife Stadium in New York/New jersey on July 19. While the bid book projected an average price of $1,099 across the three categories, FIFA has increased this by 459 per cent, with their average at $6147.

For the semi-finals, the increase is 197 per cent, up from $733 in the bid book to $2174 in FIFA's released pricing. In the quarter-final, the leap is 153 per cent, increasing to $1044 in FIFA's pricing across the three categories from an average of $412 in the bid book. The increases in the group stage, round of 32 and round of 16 is more modest, but still substantial, with increases of 49 per cent, 61 per cent and 94 per cent respectively.

FIFA's elimination of category four tickets also counters the projections in the bid book, which had indicated that seven per cent of available seating would be set aside for the lowest price point. FIFA did have some of these available in previous phases of sales, priced at $60 for some group stage matchups, but they never confirmed how many existed and those which did appeared to be very small in number, often limited to the upper corners of upper decks of NFL stadiums. Then, on Thursday, the category disappeared altogether for the current sales phase.

The bid book had projected that Category 4 tickets would be available for $21 during the group stages, $31 in the round of 32, $42 in the round of 16, $66 for the quarter-final, $84 for the semi-final and $128 for the final.

FIFA's pricing for the tickets at the World Cup has been criticised by the leading European soccer fans' group. Football Supporters Europe has called on FIFA to “immediately halt” ticket sales for participating member associations (PMA) due to what it calls a “monumental betrayal of the tradition of the World Cup”.

FIFA has been approached for comment but did not do so by the time of publication.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Mikel Arteta tells Viktor Gyokeres 'two things have to merge' if £64m striker is to become Arsenal success","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/mikel-arteta-viktor-gyokeres-two-things-merge-gbp64m-striker-become-arsenal-success/blt4a010a519b954212","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 17:44:28 GMT","

Mikel Arteta has delivered a clear message to £64 million signing Viktor Gyokeres, insisting that “two things have to merge” for the Swedish striker to thrive at Arsenal. The manager believes both player adaptation and tactical integration are essential as Gyokeres searches for form. After an injury setback and a slow Premier League start, expectations remain high for the summer arrival.

Gyokeres arrived at Arsenal in the summer after scoring heavily for Sporting CP, but his transition to the Premier League has been slower than expected. The striker managed just one league goal since September and missed crucial development time after joining without a proper pre-season and then picking up an injury. Arteta has repeatedly defended the player's progress, emphasising that adaptation to Arsenal's system and the demands of English football takes time.

His limited goal return has become a talking point as the Gunners battle at the top of the Premier League table, especially after their lead was narrowed following a recent defeat at Aston Villa. Despite Gyokeres' struggles, Arsenal have remained competitive, but Arteta is aware that the No.9 position must eventually provide greater scoring output. With Gabriel Jesus returning to fitness, competition for minutes is intensifying at a key point in the campaign.

As pressure around Gyokeres grows, questions have been raised about whether Arsenal must change their approach to suit him or whether he must mould himself to their tactical demands. Arteta, addressing this balance directly, outlined the combined responsibility needed from both sides. His explanation offers the clearest insight yet into how the club sees Gyokeres' long-term development and what must happen for his £64m move to be considered a success.

Speaking to the media, Arteta explained the shared responsibility between Arsenal and Gyokeres, saying: “I think the two things have to merge. I think we have to put the player in the best possible condition to explode and fulfil his potential. And there are certain things that within the role, in the manner that we play, has to be fulfilled.”

He continued by highlighting the importance of the team around the forward, adding: “And that's a combination of both. And then it's not only that. I think more important is the connections and the players around him at the end.”

Addressing Gyokeres' progress and fitness, Arteta said: “Those interactions, that understanding, how it develops. And before the injury, I think he was in a great place. I think it took him a while at the beginning because, as you said, it's a different league, different demands. He had no pre-season. And now he's starting to get, again, some momentum. And the goals will come, and we're going to be very pleased with him.” Asked what will help unlock the striker's form, he added: “Yes, probably the thing that's going to unlock him is goals, and he's so used to that that I think he needs that for himself, for his confidence, and I think we're going to judge his performances based on that as well. That's logical, but for the rest, I think he's in a really good place. I think physically he's in a good place, and now he needs to start to convert the chances that he's getting.”

Gyokeres was signed to bring a more direct, physically dominant option to Arsenal's attack, a contrast to the fluid movement provided by Jesus. The Swede's impressive scoring record in Portugal created major expectations, but the transition to England has exposed the differences in tempo, physicality and tactical discipline between leagues. Arsenal believe his profile still fits the long-term vision, especially with Arteta seeking more vertical threat and penalty-box presence.

His early adaptation was hindered by arriving without a pre-season, something Arteta repeatedly referenced as a critical factor in his slower start. Players who join late or return from injury often struggle with Arsenal's high-intensity demands, which rely on timing, pressing structure and positional rotations. Gyokeres' lack of rhythm made it difficult for him to integrate in the same way as those who completed a full summer programme.

Arsenal plan to continue giving Gyokeres minutes as he rebuilds sharpness, but he now faces competition from Jesus, whose return naturally increases expectations for goal output. Arteta is convinced that Gyokeres will eventually “explode” once adaptation and tactical cohesion fully align, but patience will be required from fans and analysts alike.

If Gyokeres can begin converting chances, the long-term outlook changes dramatically, as Arsenal believe he has all the tools to become a top Premier League striker. Should the drought continue, pressure will inevitably increase, but Arteta remains publicly unwavering in his support.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Bayern Munich legends Oliver Kahn and Dietmar Hamann have delivered a damning verdict on Xabi Alonso's tumultuous start at Real Madrid. Kahn argues the Spaniard's tactical obsession clashes with the club's DNA, while Hamann claims the squad are now 'untrainable' after Vinicius Jr was allowed to undermine the manager's authority.

The pressure is mounting on Alonso at the Santiago Bernabeu, with Real Madrid struggling to replicate the dominance of previous seasons. The Spanish champions have endured a nightmare December, suffering a shock home defeat to Celta Vigo before falling to Manchester City in the Champions League midweek.

Reports from the Spanish capital suggest the dressing room has grown weary of Alonso's methods, with complaints emerging about ""excessive"" video analysis sessions and a perceived lack of creative freedom. Speaking on Sky Sport Germany, former Bayern CEO Kahn suggested that these struggles were inevitable because Alonso's philosophy is fundamentally incompatible with the 'Galactico' culture.

""It is no surprise because his idea does not fit Real Madrid,"" Kahn explained. ""The approach Xabi pursues with this system football and positional play requires very specific players. At Real Madrid, however, completely different football is played.

""It is about freedom and individuality; players do not want to be pressed into systems there, and that is the great misunderstanding. You need a coach who finds the best way to bring superstars together, but not one who starts explaining to them that they must play a very specific system.""

While Kahn focused on tactics, fellow pundit Hamann pinpointed a breakdown in discipline as the root cause of the crisis. Hamann believes the club's decision to boycott the Ballon d'Or ceremony in 2024 due to  Vinicius Jr not winning it created a dangerous precedent, shifting the power dynamic fatally towards the players. The Brazilian escaping any serious punishment for his reaction to being substituted against Barcelona is proof, he says, that Madrid are now ""unmanageable"".

""The decline began with the FIFA Ballon d'Or, when Vini Jr. and the whole club boycotted the event,"" Hamann stated. ""That gave Vini the feeling he is bigger than the club. Then came Barcelona, when he was substituted after 70 minutes, made a huge fuss, and received no punishment.

""The coach was finished after that, and now this is just a consequence of what has happened in the last few months. At the moment, they are unmanageable. It took five or six months to burn the hottest stock on the coaching market, and if an Alonso can't manage it, then God have mercy on whoever follows him.""

The comments from the two German legends highlight the unique difficulties of the Real Madrid job. Unlike other elite European clubs where the manager is the primary architect of the team's identity, recent success at the Bernabeu has historically come under managers like Carlo Ancelotti or Zinedine Zidane - figures who facilitated the talents of their stars rather than imposing complex tactical grids. Alonso arrived as the most coveted young coach in Europe, but his attempt to implement the structured 'positional play' that won him the Bundesliga appears to have alienated a dressing room accustomed to on-pitch freedom. 

Alonso enjoyed a perfect start after joining from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer. His side won their first seven games across La Liga and the Champions League before finally going down 5-2 to Atletico Madrid. Another six straight wins followed - including a 2-1 Clasico victory - but a European loss to Liverpool kicked off their current woeful run, which has seen them win just two of their last eight. They now sit four points behind Barcelona in La Liga and are seventh in the Champions League table.

Alonso now faces a critical period leading up to the winter break to save his job. He must find a way to balance his tactical principles with the individual freedom his stars clearly demand. They return to domestic action with a game against Alaves on Sunday followed by a Copa del Rey clash in midweek.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The F1 Rookies' Season Review

A chaotic Cooldown Room end of season quiz

Despite missing out on this year's title, Oscar Piastri will achieve the feat one day according to McLaren team mate Lando Norris.

Lando Norris believes that Oscar Piastri ""will be a world champion"" one day, having denied his McLaren team mate this year's title in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Norris became only the 35th driver to win the Formula 1 Drivers' Championship, with third place in Sunday's race at the Yas Marina Circuit enough for him to claim the crown by two points from Red Bull's Max Verstappen.

Piastri finished third in the standings, just 13 points behind Norris, despite having led for the majority of the season and recording the same number of wins as Norris with seven.

Piastri also held a 34-point lead at one stage after Norris' Dutch GP retirement, but a run of six Grands Prix without a podium in the final part of the season ultimately contributed to him missing out on a maiden title.

While Piastri admitted it was ""not quite the ending I wished for"", Norris was quick to praise his team mate and Verstappen amidst his own title celebrations, believing Piastri's time would come.

""I had two other guys who were pretty freaking fast and certainly made my life tough this year,"" said the 26-year-old.

""Oscar the whole way since round one, I knew he was probably going to be the toughest guy to beat and then you can never count out Max, he's Max.

""We certainly never counted him out and for anyone who might have done, he proved you wrong. I'm glad we kept ourselves on our toes and we were ready for such a thing, but a pleasure to fight Max, four-time world champion.

""For me to have those fights against him and enjoy those moments, maybe not always enjoy them but some of them, but just to share the track and fight against another world champion like him and certainly Oscar as well, who will be a world champion.

""I really enjoyed this season because of that. As much as they made my life hell a lot of the time, those moments I almost enjoyed the most.""

From the individual journeys of her crew to the guest stars that brought the tour to a new level, here are the insights provided in the first two episodes.


													By
												

	Jason Lipshutz


Editor


	One year after taking one final bow on the Eras tour stage, Taylor Swift is pulling the curtain back. The End of an Era, a six-part docuseries focused on the biggest tour of the superstar's career, premiered its first two episodes on Disney+ on Friday (Dec. 12), with further episodes rolling out in the coming weeks. 


	And while The End of an Era could have existed as pure fan service — and that is certainly an aspect of the opening episodes, with slow-motion shots of an unstoppable Swift and adoring supporters — the heart of the series is a documentation of singular pop spectacle, unpacking the personalities behind the tour and how they came together to producer something so massive.


	Of course, that starts with Swift, whose attention to detail is both unsurprising and mesmerizing to witness in the context of pushing the Eras show to become more dazzling. The docuseries showcases the germination of the tour, and how it kept changing — including the incorporation of a new era, The Tortured Poets Department, as well as recurring and guest stage presences. 


	Her passion to entertain, to take care of her tour family, to clarify her artistic intent and to also simply enjoy every moment of the tour is presented as a balancing act that she can't help but keep up. Just as there were no half-measures in the three-hour-plus show, Swift does not hold back in The End of an Era, and you finish each episode with a greater understanding of her intent.


	The Eras tour will forever be a special experience for countless attendees, and The End of an Era honors that indispensability — while also tossing out new tidbits that even the super-fans will appreciate. Here are six things we learned from the first two episodes of The End of an Era.








Swift explains how the confluence of her fight for her masters and the beginning of the pandemic at the beginning of the 2020s resulted in a re-examination of her back catalog and the dreams of a sprawling tour at a moment when live shows were shut down. That inspiration is common knowledge among fans, but the footage of Swift hatching the first Eras ideas — beat by beat, moment by moment, unpacking her approach to a crew of future tour mates — is fresh, and thrilling to witness.


Not surprisingly, the Eras dancers, band members and overall brain trust provide plenty of straight-to-camera commentary, both of Swift's work ethic and of various touring details. Yet The End of an Era also digs deep into their pathways toward the biggest stage show of their lives, with their backstories — from the bassist who's been alongside Swift since her teens, to the fan-favorite dancer who was always told ‘no' until Swift told him ‘absolutely' — providing levity at some points, and producing tears at others.


The thwarted terrorist plot that led to the cancellation of a full weekend of Eras tour dates created an understandable sense of unease, and the docuseries showcases how Swift picked up the pieces both practically (with heightened security at the following shows in London) and personally (refusing to buckle to her nerves in the immediate aftermath). The docuseries makes space for the complicated feelings around the incident, from the disappointment of fans in Austria who missed out on the tour to Swift figuring out how to avoid a breakdown as the leader of a positive communal space.


The first two episodes of the docuseries features one guest star each, which we won't spoil here — and their appearances are not treated as an enviable co-sign by Swift on her biggest stage yet, but as a means of support, elevating the tour's artistic value and contributing to its overall vision. Aside from the onstage fireworks, the behind-the-scenes interactions between Swift and her fellow artists are gentle and authentic, with A-list personalities rendered as old friends bouncing ideas off of each other.


If you're a pop nerd, with a curiosity for how something with the scale of the Eras Tour is orchestrated, the docuseries illustrates several elaborate processes that help a mega-tour come together (and evolve) seamlessly. From on-the-fly staging ideas to custom choreography to top-secret rehearsal requirements to stripped-down vocal arrangements, The End of an Era painstakingly explains how it all comes together, and some of the best moments of the first two episodes play out like a step-by-step guide to something that's never been accomplished before.


Yes, we get to hear some conversations between Swift and Travis Kelce. Yes, they are as encouraging and adorable as you'd expect. More than anything, though, those moments ground Swift in the middle of a whirlwind, a larger-than-life idol for millions of concertgoers with the same hopes, fears, need for reassurance and desire to revel in good news as the rest of us. We'll see how the rest of the docuseries incorporates Swift's fianceé, but so far, his presence underlines the humanity of the story's hero.

It has one new song, “Zoo,” performed by Shakira, who voices the pop star character named Gazelle in both films. “Zoo” was written for the film by Shakira, Ed Sheeran and Blake Slatkin. (“Zoo,” meanwhile, also debuts at No. 6 on the Digital Song Sales chart.)


	Elsewhere in the top 10 on the latest Kid Albums chart, three holiday titles dot the region, led by the soundtrack to A Charlie Brown Christmas and Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! at Nos. 1 and 2, respectively. Christmas With The Chipmunks, from Alvin, Simon and Theodore With David Seville, vaults 24-8.

“Love Island USA” fan-favorite Chelley Bissainthe is officially single — and she broke the news exclusively on SiriusXM's Page Six Radio on Friday.

During an emotional conversation, the Season 7 star revealed for the first time that she and fellow Islander Ace Greene — whom she fell for and coupled up with on the hit Peacock reality dating series — have ended their relationship.

“Ace and I actually decided to part ways,” Bissainthe shared, explaining that the choice was far from easy. “It really was a tough decision, like, for the both of us and very hard to decide. But, you know, when you love someone, sometimes loving someone means letting go. So I think we just got to a decision that was best.”

Bissainthe, 24, and Greene, 23, became one of the standout couples of Season 7, quickly forming a deep bond that viewers rallied behind. Their chemistry carried them through challenges, recouplings and Casa Amor turbulence — ultimately solidifying them as one of the season's most beloved pairings even after cameras stopped rolling.

But behind the scenes, Bissainthe says the pair faced real-world pressures that tested them in ways villa life never did.

“[There was] a mutual level of respect and understanding that we wanted this to work. But sometimes things don't work,” she admitted. “Couples go through things that are very challenging and sometimes the best thing to do is make a decision that needs to be made.”

The reality star explained that the breakup didn't happen overnight — and that both she and Greene were committed to communicating openly before choosing to part ways.

“We had a lot of conversations,” she said. “At the end of the day, it was just a mutual agreement of, like, this is for the best.”

Part of what weighed on her, Bissainthe acknowledged, was thinking about the fans who championed the couple from the moment they met on the show. Still, she trusts their supporters will understand.

“I've definitely thought about our supporters, our fans and stuff,” she said. “But I'll trust that they'll understand that this decision needed to be made if we were able to come to this mutual decision.”

Bissainthe chose not to disclose specifics about what led to the split, saying both she and Greene deserve grace and privacy.

“A lot happens in relationships. People can understand that,” she explained. “I think out of respect for the both of us, the details aren't really necessary. I think that we can be peaceful and understand that we're good with being able to be on the same page.”

Despite the breakup, Bissainthe insists the love between them was always real.

“Our relationship, from the very beginning, our understanding was our relationship wasn't for the press, for the media or anything,” she said. “It was because I truly love you, you truly love me. But challenges happen in relationships and sometimes, like I said, you just want to be able to say, ‘You know what, let's leave it right here before it turns into something it never needs to be.' Like, we can leave off with light and love.”

Now, the Los Angeles-based beauty says she's embracing a new chapter — one focused entirely on herself.

“Honestly, this whole process is going to come with a lot of healing, a lot of growth, a lot of time with myself,” she noted. “So I would just love that privacy and be able to focus on myself going forward.”

Still, she holds nothing but gratitude for Greene and the time they shared.

“We are put on this earth to experience people,” she reflected. “Sometimes we want it to last a lifetime and sometimes … it's for that moment in time. I'm very grateful nonetheless and at the end of the day, I wish Ace the best. And for myself, I just have to focus on healing and growth, what's next.”

Page Six reached out to a rep for Greene for comment, but did not immediately hear back. 

As for whether that “next” could include another appearance on “Love Island USA,” Bissainthe laughed.

“I don't know about that,” she said. “Maybe if they want me to guest-host or something, I would love that. But as far as searching for love there and being a contestant, I think I had my fair share.”

“Dancing with the Stars” professional dancer and current judge Derek Hough and his wife, Hayley Erbert, are eagerly awaiting the birth of their first child. Although the couple has not publicly announced the due date, their baby is expected to arrive in December and is due any day now!

A heavily pregnant Erbert and her husband Hough celebrated the last few moments of her pregnancy by showing off their dance moves and expressing their excitement about becoming parents. 

Erbert posted the short video on Instagram on December 10. It shows her and Hough showing off their moves, including standing on their coffee table, kissing, and being playful. In the caption, she shared her thoughts, writing, “Parents gone wild.” Fans have reacted to the post with loving and supportive messages, but Hough also left a comment on his wife's post. 

“Dang she a sexy woman,” he wrote. 

“So excited for you two. But also, why does it feel like you've been pregnant forever?” a fan shared. “Oh noooo…this baby better come soon,” another person wrote. 

Other reactions include, “That baby is gonna be dancing before they walk lol,” “Adorable! Save this video to embarrass your kids when they're teenagers,” and “Omg these two are so hilarious!! Hayley looks super cute!! Derek is such a big kid full of energy, he's gonna be an amazing dad!!! This baby is so blessed on may ways!!! Wishing Hayley a safe, easy & fast delivery!!!”

Fans are really invested in this pregnancy and cannot wait for Baby Hough's arrival. This baby is already so loved. But Erbert also deserves praise for the many things she has overcome in the last two years. On December 6, she posted a black-and-white photo of herself on Instagram. It shows her cradling her baby bump. 

In the caption, she shared her thoughts in a long, emotional message. “Two years ago today, I was given a second chance at life through life-saving brain surgery,” she began. “In these two years, I've gone through every human emotion imaginable, the kind that cracks you open and the kind that puts you back together. I've reclaimed parts of myself I thought I'd never find again, rediscovered who I am, and moved through seasons of loss, triumph, joy, endless fear, grief, healing, and quiet hope. It was a whirlwind to say the least.” 

Erbert shared her gratitude for what she has overcome and revealed how proud she is of herself for what she has accomplished. She ended her message with a powerful statement, writing, “What a miracle it is that two years ago I was fighting for my life… and now, here I am creating life.”

Writer/director Kurtis David Harder‘s 2023 thriller “Influencer” is the best kind of indie genre film, a smart, funny, chilling look at the intersection between sociopathy and social media that was as visually expressive as it was thematically rich. Unlike so many low-budget thrillers that restrict themselves to limited locations and diminished ambitions, “Influencer” is expansive in its pleasures, with gorgeous Thailand locations and an impressive sense of scale.

“Influencer” was a discovery that took genre fans by surprise, a luxury Harder wouldn't be afforded when he set out to make a sequel. Fully aware of heightened expectations that the fans would have of him — and that he, in fact, had of himself — Harder took inspiration from “Aliens,” “The Godfather Part II,” and other sequels that doubled down on the satisfactions of their predecessors and made “Influencers,” which drops today on Shudder, even bigger and better than the original.

“Influencers,” which continues the adventures of deranged psychopath CW (Cassandra Naud) as she starts a new life with girlfriend Diane (Lisa Delamar) in the South of France — the first of several spectacular locations in which Harder sets his twisty story, which also features breathtaking vistas and architecture in Bali. Cinematographer David Schuurman takes full advantage of the surroundings, fully capturing their vivid beauty while also creating a palpable sense of menace; it's a movie that invites (at one point via an explicit homage) and earns comparison with one of the most gorgeous thrillers of all time, Alfred Hitchcock's “To Catch a Thief.”

 










Of course, “To Catch a Thief” was a generously budgeted studio movie shot in VistaVision, whereas Harder was working on a more modest independent scale. So how did he create one of the most spectacularly beautiful and visually varied movies of 2025 without Hitchcock's resources? 

According to Harder, it came down to perfecting a methodology he implemented on 2020 drama “Summerland,” in which a stripped-down crew allowed the cast and filmmakers to be more mobile and nimble.

“I made that film with around six friends, including myself and the actors and my co-director [Noah Kentis],” Harder told IndieWire. “We made this little road trip movie with just six people driving down the coast in an RV.” When it came time to make “Influencer,” Harder decided to try to apply the same approach to a thriller. “We went to Thailand totally under the radar with 11 people and traveled all over the country.”

The idea, Harder said, was to treat the movie like a documentary and not be bogged down by the logistics and machinery of massive company moves. “The gear was essentially anything we could fit in a van,” Harder said, adding that evolving drone technology and other technical innovations have made making a great looking film for a price more possible than ever before. Although he knew the success of “Influencer” meant he would have a bigger budget and crew for “Influencers,” he still tried to keep the “pseudo-documentary” sensibility of the original.

 










“We were trying to avoid the balloon that gets bigger as you expand the crew,” Harder said. “Once the crew gets bigger, you need more infrastructure to handle it. You need more transportation, you need more of everything.” For “Influencers,” Harder only let the crew get big on specific days when it was warranted, such as a club scene with hundreds of extras. “We hired another AD and more crew people for that day, but for most of the shoot we're keeping it under 15 or 20 people.”

That allowed Harder to give his film the dynamic international flavor it has by trading personnel for more shooting days, and making the most of those shooting days by spending as little time as possible on logistics. “It allowed us to get in and out of locations quickly and to shoot over a period of five months traveling between France, Bali, and North America,” Harder said. In each country, Harder secured a production services company to help with location scouting and scheduling, and created a rigorous plan to make sure he'd be prepared for any unseen challenges. Working with a minimal crew, however, meant he could deviate from that plan easily whenever a better idea came along.

“There were a couple of times where we saw something just driving by and said ‘Oh, we can shoot this sequence over there, let's go,'” Harder said. “I think a little bit of fluidity like that is key — having a very strong plan that you can throw out on the day. We go in knowing exactly how we want something to work, but we're hoping for three or four happy accidents every day. Having extra time allows for that; when you're shooting two to four pages a day instead of 10, you have a lot more flexibility to find some magic. Whereas when you're rushing and have to get your shot list exactly as you planned it, that's just not really possible.”

 










The extra time also pays off in terms of the performances, which are uniformly terrific. Harder's sly script walks a fine line between satire and horror that's perfectly served by the actors' flawlessly calibrated characterizations, another thing Harder things is more achievable by giving everyone more time. “It's very liberating,” Harder said. “There are fewer people, but they're all on the movie for a longer period of time and that allows everyone to become close and explore.”

It also meant the casting process required Harder to look beyond the usual criteria of which actor was right for each role. “You're not only casting for performance, you're casting personalities who are going to fit and be willing to go on this crazy adventure, because it's strenuous. They're difficult shoots. We're traveling every day without many breaks. But everybody signing up knows that. Everybody's wearing multiple hats. Cassandra designed all the wardrobe, for example — she was the costume designer while also being the lead of the movie.”

Although the multitasking led to stress at times, Harder feels the extra work on everyone's part paid off in the form of fully realized ambitions at both the script and performance level. “I have friends who shoot movies in 13 or 14 days, and you're halfway through the shoot when the actors say, ‘Oh, I finally know who this character is,'” Harder said. “So, for me, the key is just to allow the actors to really find things. That's the benefit of a longer shoot, and the benefit of doing a sequel where you're returning to characters you've lived with for so long. It's a luxury that you don't see much in modern filmmaking.”

 










“Influencers” is now streaming on Shudder, and will play at select Alamo Drafthouse theaters on Monday, December 15.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","These mysterious flashes linked to nuclear tests are reviving an old UFO case","https://www.futura-sciences.com/en/these-mysterious-flashes-linked-to-nuclear-tests-are-reviving-an-old-ufo-case_22131/","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

More than seven decades after a mysterious series of light flashes were captured in California's night sky, scientists are still debating what they mean. Two new peer-reviewed papers suggest that thousands of unexplained bursts recorded by the historic Palomar telescope might be linked to Cold War nuclear tests and even UFO sightings — a claim that's igniting controversy in the scientific community.

Back in the early 1950s, astronomers at Palomar Observatory photographed multiple star-like flashes that appeared and vanished within an hour — long before the launch of the first satellite, Sputnik 1. Now, researchers have reanalyzed those vintage sky plates and discovered that many of the transients — brief, glowing points of light — occurred on or near the dates of nuclear weapons tests. They also coincided with a sharp rise in reported UFO sightings. Could that timing be more than coincidence?

While random meteors, variable stars, or camera glitches could explain some flashes, several of the Palomar events display unusual traits — sharp, bright points seemingly aligned in straight lines — that don't match any known natural or technical causes.

“We've ruled out some of the ordinary explanations, which means we have to at least consider that these might be artificial objects,” said co-author Bruehl, an anesthesiologist at Vanderbilt University with a keen interest in UFO research. Bruehl worked alongside Beatriz Villarroel, an astronomer at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in Sweden.

“If these transients are reflective objects orbiting Earth — and they predate Sputnik — who put them there? And why do they seem connected to nuclear testing?” Bruehl asked.

But not everyone is convinced. Michael Garrett, director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester, praised Villarroel's creative approach but cautioned that the quality of mid-century data makes firm conclusions risky. “Before Sputnik, the data are patchy at best,” he said. “Even the UFO, or UAP, reports from that era are anecdotal and haven't been verified for accuracy.”

Garrett added that while the scientific method is the right tool for exploring such mysteries, it requires “time, replication, and patience.” His hunch? “With better data, those correlations would likely vanish.”

Today, transient light events are well-known in astronomy. Modern observatories — from California's Zwicky Transient Facility to Hawaii's Pan-STARRS — regularly detect thousands of short-lived flashes in the sky. And the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to find millions each night within the next decade.

Most of these transients are tied to known cosmic events: eruptions from comets and asteroids, exploding stars, flickering black holes, or neutron star mergers that create brilliant kilonova bursts.

For now, though, the Palomar flashes remain an open question — a relic of early astronomy that continues to intrigue scientists and fuel speculation about what might really be shining, and vanishing, above us.

The conferenced version of the fiscal year (FY) 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) gives the Pentagon's UFO sleuths three specific mandates, including expanded briefings to Congress.

The Defense Department's (DOD) All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) was established in 2022 to investigate unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), which are more colloquially known as UFOs.

The DOD has been rebranded as the War Department by the Trump administration.

However, lawmakers have found issue with the quantity and the transparency of reports from the AARO to Congress. To address those deficiencies, lawmakers added several new requirements to the NDAA, which establishes defense funding levels and priorities.

First, the NDAA directs the AARO to provide expanded congressional briefings on UAPs.

Specifically, the mandate targets any UAP intercepts conducted by the U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command.

Briefings must include the number, location and nature of intercepts, as well as descriptions of procedures and protocols followed, and any data collected or analyzed. The first briefing must also include intercepts dating back to Jan. 1, 2004, that have not previously been reported.

Second, the NDAA eliminates duplicative reporting requirements and streamlines how UAP-related data is provided to AARO.

It requires the director of national intelligence and the defense secretary to ensure all intelligence community elements and DOD components immediately make such data available to the office, while protecting intelligence sources and methods.

Third, the NDAA requires the AARO to account for all security classification guides that govern UAP-related reporting and investigations, an area that has drawn new attention on Capitol Hill as Republicans call for UAP document declassification.

According to the NDAA provision, the director may issue a consolidated classification matrix for programs affected by UAP inquiries, and information on these guides must appear in AARO's 2026 annual report.

The FY 2026 NDAA, which authorizes $900.6 billion in defense spending, cleared the House on Dec. 10 by a 312-112 vote. Leadership from the House and Senate Armed Services committees released the compromise text on Dec. 7, and Senate passage is expected the week of Dec. 15.

The White House has already signaled its support, putting the bill on track to become law before the holiday recess.","{'href': 'https://www.meritalk.com', 'title': 'MeriTalk'}","other"

Spielberg's new UFO movie, cryptic billboards reignite real alien conspiracies","https://nypost.com/2025/12/12/entertainment/steven-spielbergs-new-ufo-movie-billboards-reignite-et-alien-conspiracies/","Fri, 12 Dec 2025 18:50:00 GMT","

They come in peace.

Steven Spielberg's new UFO movie has reignited speculation within the alien conspiracy theory community, especially after cryptic billboards teasing the upcoming film popped up across the country this week.

“All will be disclosed,” read billboards for the forthcoming flick in New York City and Los Angeles, alongside the “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” director's name and the project's June 12, 2026, release date.

The posters also included a creepy image of what appeared to be a human eye peeking through a mysterious and reflective silhouette.

Spielberg fans quickly rushed to social media after seeing the new billboards to theorize about what the still-untitled movie might be about, while others suggested the “Jaws” director is using the film to disclose the existence of real aliens to the world.

“A conspiracy theory that's so crazy it just might be brilliant!” Chris Ramsay, who has a YouTube channel devoted to UFO theories, wrote on X. “The theory goes like this: Spielberg has been chosen to deliver the next phase of disclosure.”

“Not a leak in the traditional sense, but a carefully constructed big reveal,” he continued. “What if Spielberg has been granted unprecedented access to real UAP footage or better yet, an actual UFO?”

The tinfoil hat wearer added that there is “no better way to get disclosure” than by the “very means which have conditioned us to believe in them in the first place. The silver screen.”

However, Ramsay also speculated that Spielberg's next project might be “another way to control the narrative” around extraterrestrial life.

“Good luck searching ‘UFO Disclosure' after this movie hits the theatres…” he wrote.

The fact that Spielberg's new project was filmed in New Jersey has excited UFO hunters as well.

Last year, hundreds of residents reported seeing mysterious lights flying around the state. 

While several people thought they might be witnessing UFOs, the Trump Administration later confirmed that the mysterious aircraft were FAA-authorized drones.

But this wouldn't be the first time one of Spielberg's movies has ignited alien conspiracy theories.

Back in 2011, while discussing a special screening Ronald Reagan hosted for “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” at the White House in 1982, the “War of the Worlds” filmmaker recalled what the then-president said as the credits rolled.

“There are a number of people in this room who know that everything on that screen is absolutely true,” Reagan reportedly shared.

Spielberg suggested that Reagan wasn't kidding.

“The whole room laughed because he presented it like a joke,” the director said, per The Telegraph. “But he wasn't smiling as he said it.”

Spielberg himself, meanwhile, believes in alien life and has shared his thoughts about the subject several times in the past.

“I don't believe we're alone in the universe,” the “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” director said most recently in 2023. “I think it's mathematically impossible that we are the only intelligent species in the cosmos.”

“I think that's totally impossible,” he added.","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}","other"

      Has anyone seen this short documentary by NHK on drones over Japanese nuclear sites?  Interesting perspective. I saw the documentary today. ""Time: 12/12/2025 and time 12.30pm et. Location: Orlando""
    


      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever recorded, opinions on Reddit are varied and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and credible cases:
    


Description: Over 60 children at the Ariel School in Zimbabwe witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard and a few beings coming out.
    


Credibility: The incident was investigated by a well-known psychologist, and there are numerous witness testimonies. ""The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Surprised it hasn't been mentioned. 60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out.""



Description: A Japanese pilot had a multi-hour documented encounter with a UFO that broke off into several smaller UFOs.
    


Credibility: The sighting was confirmed by ground radar, and the pilot was put on desk duty for disclosing the incident. ""Mid 1980s a Japanese pilot, had a multi-hour documented encounter with a UFO, that broke off into several smaller UFOs that surrounded his plane.""



Description: Military personnel, radars, and a civilian plane encountered a UFO. The radar signature resembled a Boeing 707, and instrumentation failed when approaching the object.
    


Credibility: Multiple witnesses, radar confirmation, and a military spy satellite recorded the incident. ""1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO.""



Description: Thousands of people in Arizona witnessed a massive, V-shaped formation of lights in the sky.
    


Credibility: Numerous witnesses, including the governor at the time, confirmed seeing the phenomenon. ""I live in AZ, and saw the Phoenix Lights with my own eyes, (which actually happened twice).""



Description: Military personnel at a US Air Force base in England reported seeing strange lights and a craft in the forest.
    


Credibility: Multiple military witnesses, audio recordings, and official reports support the claims. ""Rendelsham Forest or Shag Harbour.""



Description: Several witnesses in Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, saw a large, illuminated object crash into the water.
    


Credibility: Multiple independent witnesses and official investigations confirmed the event. ""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shag_Harbour_UFO_incident""



Description: US Navy pilots encountered a Tic Tac-shaped object performing impossible maneuvers.
    


Credibility: Pilot testimony, FLIR footage, and official confirmation from the US Navy make this case highly credible. ""I think the Nimitz/tic tac sighting in 2004 is likely to have the most credence to a skeptic given the pilot testimony and FLIR footage.""



Description: US Air Force personnel at two bases in England reported seeing multiple UFOs on radar and visually.
    


Credibility: Official radar logs and multiple military witnesses confirmed the sightings. ""Lakenheath Bentwaters 1956, Kenneth Arnold 1947, Malmstrom, The Colares Incident, Stephenville 2008, Yukon 1996, and the Montreal UFO to name a few.""



Description: A supposed crash of a UFO near Roswell, New Mexico, which the government initially confirmed as a ""flying disc"" before retracting the statement.
    


Credibility: Numerous eyewitnesses claimed to see alien bodies and a large military cover-up. ""I know it'll probably get me downvoted, but I'd say Roswell.""



Description: The US military used anti-aircraft weapons against an unidentified object over Los Angeles.
    


Credibility: Multiple witnesses and official military reports confirm the event. ""The Battle of Los Angeles where the military had to resort to using AA weapons against a 'weather balloon'.""



Description: A pilot reported seeing nine disc-shaped objects flying in a formation near Mount Rainier.
    


Credibility: This sighting coined the term ""flying saucer"" and was widely reported. ""Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting""



Description: Similar to the Ariel School incident, this involved multiple children witnessing a UFO.
    


Credibility: Numerous child witnesses and subsequent investigations. ""The Ariel encounter, Zimbabwe, Westall, Australia, The Phoenix Lights USA, Holloway Air Force Base USA, Falcon Lake, USA, Pentrych, Wales, are all examples of well documented and extremely intriguing cases.""



Credibility: Several high-ranking military officials and astronauts have publicly stated their belief in UFOs and extraterrestrial life. ""I believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets which obviously are a little more technically advanced than we are here on Earth.""

r/aliens



r/HighStrangeness



      These cases represent some of the most compelling evidence for UFOs, supported by multiple witnesses, radar confirmations, and official investigations. While skepticism is healthy, these incidents provide a strong basis for further exploration and discussion.

S&P 500, Nasdaq open lower as Broadcom adds to AI bubble angst

 

 

 

- Darcy Keith

There's been no shortage of the usual year-ahead forecasts for the S&P 500 in recent weeks from Street analysts. But FactSet is out today with a report that looks at Street forecasts using a unique “bottom-up” approach, instead of the usual “top-down”. 

This bottom-up target price for the index at year-end 2026 is calculated by aggregating the median target price estimates, based on the company-level target prices submitted by industry analysts, for all the stocks in the index.

The result of this unusual number crunching: a target price for the S&P 500 of 7,968.78, which is about 15 per cent higher than current levels. 

“At the sector level, the Information Technology (+19.8%) sector is expected to see the largest price increase, as this sector has the largest upside difference between the bottom-up target price and the closing price. On the other hand, the Financials (+8.3%) sector is expected to see the smallest price increase, as this sector has the smallest upside difference between the bottom-up target price and the closing price,” FactSet said in the report.

But how has this forecasting approach worked in the past?

“At the end of last year (December 31, 2024), the bottom-up target price for the S&P 500 was 6,728.40. Based on yesterday's closing price of 6,901.00, analysts underestimated the price of the index by 2.5% at the start of calendar year 2025 as of yesterday. However, it is important to note that industry analysts have historically overestimated the closing price of the index at the start of the year. Over the previous 20 years (2005 – 2024), the average difference between the bottom-up target price estimate at the beginning of the year (December 31) and the final price for the index for that same year has been 5.9 per cent.”

Most Wall Street analysts liked Broadcom's (AVGO-Q) earnings but markets really hated it, and sold the stock along with most of the AI-related market sector. Oracle didn't help, announcing that some of their data centres slated to open next year will have to wait until 2027. 

Citi analyst Christopher Danely applauded Broadcom's announcement of a new customer, Anthropic, and 13 per cent year over year gain in revenue. Next quarter revenue was guided higher by 6.0 per cent. A big negative, however: Broadcom guided gross margins lower by 1.0 per cent. 

The stock is trading sharply lower – down 11 per cent in midday trading. Oracle's announcement of data center delays has its stock down just over 5.0 per cent. 

Despite the fall on Friday, its stock is up nearly 70 per cent for the year.

It trades at about 32 times enterprise value to forward core earnings, compared with 19.6 times for AI chip giant Nvidia and 30.2 times for Advanced Micro Devices, according to Reuters. Nvidia shares are up 34 per cent this year, while AMD has gained 83 per cent.

More drops for superstars that had earlier soared in Wall Street's frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology are dragging the U.S. stock market off their records on Friday.

The S&P 500 fell 1.2% from its all-time high set the day before, and the weakness for tech stocks yanked the Nasdaq composite down a market-leading 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 266 points, or 0.5%, from its own record set the day before, as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern time.

Broadcom dragged the market lower and tumbled 10.5% even though the chip company reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. 

Broadcom's stumble came a day after Oracle plunged nearly 11% despite likewise reporting a bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

Doubts remain about whether all the spending that Oracle is doing on AI technology will end up being worth it, along with how it will pay for it. Such questions are dogging the AI industry broadly, even as many billions of dollars continue to flow in.

Broadcom was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 Friday, followed by Nvidia. The chip company that's become the poster child of the AI boom fell 2.5%.

The stock market was also broadly feeling pressure from the bond market, where the yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.19% from 4.14% late Thursday. The gains were biggest for yields of the longest-term Treasurys, which tend to track long-term expectations for economic growth and inflation.

The stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has much less of an emphasis on tech, are still up 1% for the week so far. That's much better than the Nasdaq composite's drop of 1.7%.

Shares of Rivian Automotive (RIVN-Q) surged 18% on Friday as analysts issued bullish commentary on the electric pickup truck and SUV maker's efforts to develop a custom chip for self-driving features and its integration of artificial intelligence.

The stock had closed about 6% lower on Thursday after the company's announcements at its first Autonomy and AI Day, where it said it would shift away from Nvidia's processors that power autonomous driving and had launched a paid package for self-driving features.

Rivian's shares rose 17.9% to $19.37, its highest in nearly two years. The stock had risen about 24% this year, as of Thursday's close.

The company's new R2 model cars, which are expected to roll out first half of 2026, will carry the new chips.

The self-driving and driver-assistance systems still require human oversight. The company expects to launch “eyes-off” functionality in 2026.

“The event exceeded our expectations and cements our view for Rivian to become the number 2 North America EV player, even leapfrogging Tesla right now in certain AI-integration areas,” James Picariello, senior analyst at BNP Paribas said.

Brokerage Needham and Co raised its price target by 64% to US $23 per share, citing increased confidence “in Rivian's positioning as software-defined vehicles increasingly become industry table stakes.”

Rivian's custom self-driving and AI chip, dubbed the Rivian Autonomy Processor, will be produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Canada's benchmark stock index dropped on Friday, ending a week filled with central bank meetings.

At 11:28 a.m. ET, The TSX index was was down 252.98 points, or 0.8 per cent, at 31,407.75. The commodity-heavy index is up 28 per cent for the year and has outperformed its Wall Street peers due to a stellar performance from its mining and materials shares.

“Global stocks are trading at record highs despite ongoing technology valuation doubts,” said Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY.

“The ongoing themes of equity sector rotation, a better 2026 outlook aided by Fed easing, and tame inflation leave hopes that doing nothing will keep the holiday rally intact.”

Information technology stocks lead declines, falling 4.3 per cent, with Celestica Inc. (CLS-T) dropping 12.1 per cent and Lightspeed Commerce Inc. (LSPD-T) losing 3.1 per cent.

Healthcare index gained the most on Friday at 5.4 per cent, with the shares of cannabis firm Curaleaf (CURA-T) soaring 26 per cent.

Shares of cannabis companies rose after a Washington Post report said U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to push the government to dramatically loosen federal restrictions on marijuana. Canada's Canopy Growth and Tilray Brands rose 22 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively.

The founder of Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU-Q) is calling for an overhaul of the company's board of directors, as the purveyor of athleisure searches for a new chief executive officer – accusing the leadership of “complacency” as the brand has lost its cachet.

Friday's statement from Chip Wilson followed the news of CEO Calvin McDonald's ouster on Thursday afternoon.

Mr. McDonald, who has led Lululemon since 2018, will step down at the end of January. While he presided over years of growth at the company, under his leadership Lululemon also experienced a significant slowdown in its U.S. business starting last year.

The company's stock price – which had dropped by more than 50 per cent this year prior to the news – jumped by roughly 10 per cent in Friday-morning trading.

The founder, Mr. Wilson, took credit for Mr. McDonald's departure in his statement on Friday, saying that he had been urging members of the company “publicly and privately” to spearhead a “revitalization and an infusion of new skills” to fix its lagging performance.

Silver often gets dismissed as gold's poor cousin. But that title hardly stands up to the reality of this past year. The precious metal has soared 120 per cent year to date, and the spot price reached a record US$64.09 per ounce this morning in London. That's about a 10-per-cent weekly gain. Not bad for a commodity that rarely comes up in dinner conversations.

Various reasons have been linked to the rally. Gold's surge (the two metals often trade in tandem) and the general decline in the U.S. dollar have surely played a role. Strong demand for physical silver from Indian consumers and from the solar industry – which is eager to help meet demand for the power needs of AI chips – has probably helped too. 

But Capital Economics is out Friday with a warning for those investors only now catching on to the powerful gains of the commodity this year. It thinks silver gains could rapidly go into reverse in the new year. 

The Bank for International Settlements argued this week that the surge in retail interest and the gold price rally is indicative of a bubble. Capital Economics thinks the same argument can be made for silver, too. It points out both gold- and silver-backed ETF holdings have increased by 15-20 per cent since the start of this year. 

“This pick-up in investment demand for precious metals, especially in the West where sentiment tends to be sensitive to changes in US monetary policy, could rapidly shift into reverse. A potential trigger could be if, as we expect, concerns about Fed independence prove to be overblown,” wrote Capital Economics climate and commodities economist Hamad Hussain in a note this week. 

“Admittedly, silver prices may rise further in the near term since the risk of US tariffs still looms. For context, the ongoing Section 232 trade investigation on critical minerals, which includes silver, has coincided with a hoarding of silver inventories on the COMEX and this appears to have caused stress in the broader silver market. But while we have no insight as to whether tariffs will be put in place, it is notable that Trump backed away from tariffing gold when similar dynamics in that market were playing out. In any case, the tariff uncertainty should end by mid-April at the latest when President Trump would be expected to make a decision.”

Mr. Hussain also notes the gold/silver price ratio – a commonly used valuation metric – has fallen sharply since ‘Liberation Day'. “Of course, price ratios are not perfect guides to the future since there is no fixed level that they should revert to. But for what it's worth, the gold/silver price ratio previously bottomed out around 65 on two occasions in the past decade or so – not far from its current level.”

He thinks both gold and silver prices will fall next year, with silver falling faster, reaching US$42 an ounce by the end of 2026. 

If true, it could be a rough year for Canadian precious metals producers that have a heavy exposure to silver.

The K-shaped economy meme – the economy improving for the wealthy while deteriorating for the lower wealth quintiles – might be going in reverse, according to BofA Securities investment strategist Michael Hartnett in his weekly report. 

Mr. Hartnett often needs to come with subtitles, but there's an important trend evident in his weekly Flow Show report. He writes, “Ferrari falling sharply vs General Motors; K-shape ‘rich vs poor' consumer all the rage in '25, but markets front-running ‘run-it-hot' in '26 via rotation to ‘Main St' (MDY MidCap, IYR Small-Cap, IWC Microcap) from ‘Wall St' (MGC Mega Cap)”

The relative returns for Ferrari and General Motors potentially indicates the reversal of the K-shaped “rich versus poor” economic trend. The “run-it-hot” idea is that fund managers are positioning for an inflationary environment that benefits less wealth cohorts. They are buying SPDR S&P Midcap 400 ETF (MDY-A), iShares U.S. Real Estate (IYR-A) and iShares Microcap (IWC-A) while reducing Vanguard Mega Cap Index ETF (MGC-A).

Oil prices inched lower on Friday and were on track for a weekly decline as investors focussed on a supply glut and potential Russia-Ukraine peace deal, which outweighed concerns over Venezuelan supply disruptions.

Brent crude futures were down 14 US cents, or 0.2 per cent, to US$61.14 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 3 US cents at US$57.57. Both benchmarks fell by about 1.5 per cent on Thursday.

While there might be sporadic support from hits to supply, the general market mood reflects supply exceeding demand, and any rallies are expected to be brief, said PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga.

Brent and WTI have lost more than 4 per cent this week. International Energy Agency forecasts published on Thursday indicated that global oil supply will exceed demand by 3.84 million barrels per day next year - a volume equal to almost 4% of world demand.

Canada's main stock index opened higher on Friday, with mining shares leading gains at the close of a week filled with highly anticipated central bank meetings.

At 9:30 a.m. ET, Toronto's S&P/TSX composite index was up 0.24 per cent at 31,737.44 points.

In New York, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq opened lower on Friday as Broadcom's latest results added to concerns about an AI-fueled bubble, dampening optimism stoked by the Federal Reserve's less-hawkish-than-expected signals on 2026 rate cuts.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 102.80 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 48,806.81, the S&P 500 lost 10.85 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 6,890.37 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 105.00 points, or 0.43 per cent, to 23,491.12. 

Broadcom (AVGO-Q) slid 7.9 per cent in early trade after the chipmaker warned of slimmer future margins on its AI system sales, despite projecting strong quarterly revenue. This sharpened worries about the profitability of surging AI investments.

Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica (LULU-Q) jumped 10.7 per cent after the apparel maker said that CEO Calvin McDonald was leaving the company and raised its annual profit forecast.

Shares of Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU-Q) are poised to soar after the late Thursday announcement chief executive officer Calvin McDonald will step down at the end of January.

Mr. McDonald, who has led the athleisure retailer since 2018, has been struggling to reassure investors amid a slowdown in its U.S. business and as its stock price plunged by 50 per cent since the beginning of the year.

Lululemon has hired an executive search firm and is looking for its next CEO, the company announced Thursday. Mr. McDonald will leave the role on Jan. 31, 2026, and will also step away from the company's board of directors but will continue as a senior adviser until March 31.

The announcement overshadowed the release of third-quarter financial results that exceeded the Street's expectations. That included earnings per share of US$2.59, topping the consensus projection of US$2.21, driven by higher gross profit dollars and share repurchases.

“Results were better than feared and FY25 revenue and guidance moves higher at the midpoint,” said Stifel analyst Peter McGoldrick in a client note. “We continue to believe the stock will remain range-bound until the core Americas business stabilizes; continued challenges (Americas negative 5-per-cent cc comp vs. negative 3 per cent cc in 2Q25) with concentration around shopping holidays and promotional seeking behavior points to uneven trends in demand, which we expect persist into CY26. We expect the forthcoming leadership change catalyzes investor interest in the stock, though believe the structural market conditions driving challenging results (scaling competition, loyal customer attrition) will take time to correct.”

The company's shares have halved in value this year as it lost ground to newer rivals including Alo Yoga and Vuori in the U.S., as well as to lower-priced styles from established players such as Nike and Gap.

Lululemon's forward price-to-earnings multiple, a common benchmark for valuing stocks, is 14.66, compared to 31.26 for Nike and Abercrombie & Fitch's ratio of 10.8, according to LSEG data.

BMO senior economist Robert Kavcic found that Canadian households are a lot more liquid than the heavy debt levels would suggest. 

My strong suspicion is that these assets are not distributed equally among the populace,

“Canadian households are flush with liquid assets, another strike against those deeply concerned about conditions going into 2026. Canadians now hold almost $260 in liquid financial assets (e.g., cash, bonds and stocks, excluding pension and insurance assets) for every $100 in financial liabilities (e.g., mortgage debt). The bull market in equities is obviously helping, but so have sturdy income growth and savings. Importantly, not only is there some wealth effect here, but it is also going to help cushion households renewing into higher-rate mortgages through 2026 (the peak of the renewal wave is around mid-year). Canadians can lean on these liquid assets to reduce outstanding balances or support higher monthly payments. There are a few sidebars to explore further. Wealth in liquid financial assets is arguably more accessible than a fixed asset like housing, which has stagnated for most. Also, the distribution of increases in financial assets has, of course, been skewed to the higher end of the income spectrum”

Futures tracking the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq slipped on Friday as Broadcom's latest results reignited fears of an AI-fueled bubble and tempered the optimism sparked by a less hawkish commentary than expected from the Federal Reserve on 2026 rate cuts.

At 7:00 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 59 points, or 0.12 per cent, S&P 500 E-minis were down 15.25 points, or 0.22 per cent, Nasdaq 100 E-minis were down 162.25 points, or 0.63 per cent.

Broadcom (AVGO-Q) shares fell nearly 6 per cent in premarket trading after the chipmaker warned of lower future margins on its AI system sales, despite forecasting strong quarterly revenue, deepening concerns about the profitability of investments in the technology.

Other chip stocks including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-Q) and Nvidia (NVDA-Q) lost 0.3 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, a day after Oracle (ORCL-N) unveiled a weak forecast.

Shares of the cloud company fell 1.2 per cent after logging its biggest daily drop since January in the previous session.

Despite the gloomy overhang, the S&P 500, the Dow and the Russell 2000 all closed at record highs on Thursday and were on track for weekly gains after the Fed trimmed borrowing costs and delivered a less hawkish outlook than investors had feared.

Among others, Vancouver's Lululemon Athletica (LULU-Q) jumped 9.8 per cent after the apparel maker said that CEO Calvin McDonald was leaving the company and raised its annual profit forecast.

Goldman Sachs' new chief U.S. equity strategist Ben Snider (the widely regarded David Kostin retired) published his S&P 500 targets for 2026. 

The details underscore the incredible dominance of the tech hyperscalers in terms of both size and profit generation,

“We forecast S&P 500 EPS growth of 12 per cent year/year in 2026 (to $305) and 10 per cent in 2027 (to $336). Our estimates incorporate GS macro forecasts for solid US GDP growth and a weaker US dollar alongside GS equity analyst forecasts for continued earnings strength among the largest technology stocks. Our 12-per-cent EPS growth forecast for 2026 combines revenue growth of 7 per cent with 70 bp of profit margin expansion. The seven largest stocks in the S&P 500 (NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, AVGO, META) account for 36 per cent of S&P 500 market cap and 26 per cent of earnings and should contribute 46 per cent of index EPS growth in 2026. This represents a decline from their 50-per-cent contribution in 2025 as earnings growth for the S&P 493 accelerates from 7 per cent in 2025 to 9 per cent in 2026. The mega-caps' above-average sales growth and profit margins provide a mechanical tailwind to margins for the aggregate S&P 500. For example, if NVDA sales grow by 50 per cent in 2026 and its margins remain flat, the S&P 500 profit margin would rise by 30 bp from that boost alone. We expect AI-driven productivity gains will lift S&P 500 EPS by 0.4 per cent in 2026 and 1.5 per cent in 2027”

CIBC Capital Markets bank analyst Paul Holden is struggling to see upside in major bank stocks,

“The banks reported another strong set of EPS beats with FQ4, making it four for four on the year. We remain positive on the outlook based on excess capital, conservative credit provisioning, an expectation for improving economic conditions into F2027 and potential for regulatory capital relief. However, we are increasingly challenged to paint significant upside for the group given valuation multiples and rising consensus estimates. Our two Outperformers are TD and BMO, where we believe consensus estimates remain low and where relative valuation multiples look reasonable … Key themes for F2026. F2025 results got a huge lift from capital markets, wealth management and NIM [net interest margin] expansion. We expect the primary drivers of F2026 EPS growth will be somewhat different: NIM expansion (again), expense efficiencies and capital deployment. We think our two Outperformers are well positioned across these drivers”

RBC Capital Markets head of global commodity strategy Helima Croft expects the U.S. to force a regime change in Venezuela that will eventually affect global crude markets,

“We are currently watching the U.S. military buildup off the coast of Venezuela and believe a U.S.-led regime change operation is likely in the cards in the coming weeks or Q1'26 … Even if President Maduro leaves Venezuela voluntarily, we think it will be a protracted process before the country sees significant production gains due to the decades -long decline of the sector. Removing all sanctions could in principle lead to a relatively swift increase of several hundred kb/d, but anything beyond that would require enormous investment and a stable operating environment. They also warned that the military could play the spoiler role in a contested power situation since it plays such a large role in the operations of PDVSA [state-owned crude and natural gas producer] —as well as the broader economy”

Analysts at TD Cowen think “2026 could be real estate's turn to outperform.”

“Following two years of wide underperformance comparable to 1998-1999 (which led to four years of subsequent outperformance), REITs increasingly appear ready to regain some market leadership,” said the firm's real estate equity team, led by Sam Damiani and Jonathan Kelcher. 

“Macro changes are hard to predict, but REITs offer attractive and stable yields and growth while biding time until the next catalyst for a bounce in valuations.”

Shares of cannabis companies jumped on Friday after the Washington Post reported U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to push the government to dramatically loosen federal restrictions on marijuana.

U.S.-listed shares of Tilray Brands (TLRY-Q, TLRY-T) gained 28 per cent, while SNDL (SNDL-Q), Canopy Growth (CGC-Q, WEED-T) and ETF AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis (MSOS-A) were up between 13.5 per cent and 32.5 per cent in premarket trading.

According to the report from Thursday, Mr. Trump plans to direct agencies to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug, reducing oversight of the plant and its derivatives to the same level as some common prescription painkillers and other drugs.

“We believe this would open the door for pharmaceutical companies to seek approval for more cannabis products, which could then be dispensed the same as other prescription drugs,” TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note.

Mr. Trump's administration has been looking to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a shift that could ease criminal penalties and reshape the industry through potentially lower taxes and by making it easier to secure funding.

Funding remains one of the biggest challenges for cannabis producers, as federal restrictions keep most banks and institutional investors out of the sector, forcing pot producers to turn to costly loans or alternative lenders.

Broadcom shares (AVGO-Q) fell nearly 6 per cent before the market open on Friday after the chipmaker said its margins would fall due to a higher mix of AI revenue, adding to worries about the payout from AI.

Investor optimism over the nascent technology has recently cooled amid bubble concerns, wiping out hundreds of billions in tech market value since late October. Adding to the worries, Oracle's massive spending and weak forecasts fanned doubts over how quickly the big bets on AI will pay off, sparking a tech selloff in the previous session.

“Right now, the spending intentions still seem so big by so many, hitting that panic button is premature,” said Ben Reitzes, analyst at Melius Research.

Broadcom's margins will be affected throughout the year by the revenue mix of infrastructure, software and semiconductors, while it has a US$73-billion backlog that it anticipates shipping over the next 18 months.

“We attribute the selloff to commentary on gross margin dilution from AI chips. We aren't concerned with this, given that these chips are operating-margin-accretive,” said analysts at Morningstar.

Broadcom has gained from strong demand for its custom chips amid a major data center buildout, securing a growing foothold in an industry led by Nvidia, with its stock rising nearly 75 per cent this year.

Global markets advanced following strength on Wall Street overnight, though a fresh decline in Oracle's share price sent jitters through the tech sector.

Wall Street futures were mixed as tech concerns continue to weigh on the Nasdaq.

TSX futures edged up after Canada's main stock market closed at another record high yesterday.

“Oracle announced disappointing earnings alongside further investment in data centres, triggering fresh concerns about AI-related spending, with investors questioning whether the high level of investment will ultimately deliver the required returns,” analysts from Westpac wrote in a research note.

Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.42 per cent in morning trading. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.3 per cent, Germany's DAX advanced 0.52 per cent and France's CAC 40 climbed 0.69 per cent.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed 1.37 per cent higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.75 per cent.

World shares rose on Friday, tracking Wall Street's climb to records despite a sell-off for Oracle as worries persisted about a potential bubble in artificial-intelligence technology.

The future for the S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1 per cent, while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent.

In early European trading, Germany's DAX added nearly 0.6 per cent to 24,427.67. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.4 per cent to 9,737.25, and the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.4 per cent to 8,141.66.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index climbed 1.4 per cent to 50,836.55, rebounding from the previous session's losses.

Investors remain cautious ahead of next week's policy meeting of the Bank of Japan, where it is expected to raise interest rates, but technology shares helped lead broad gains.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 inched up 0.2 per cent to 6,901.00 and eked past its prior all-time closing high, which was set in October. The Dow Jones Industrial leaped 1.3 per cent to 48,704.01, to top its own record set last month. The Nasdaq composite lagged behind and slipped 0.3 per cent to 23,593.86 because of weakness in AI stocks.

It's the latest return to records for the market following what had appeared to be a debilitating set of worries. Some of the most recent included concerns about what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates and whether all the dollars flowing into AI chips and data centers will produce profits and productivity as prolific as proponents are promising.

Oracle shares fell 10.8 per cent on Thursday in their biggest one-day drop since late January.Brian Snyder/Reuters

The S&P 500 and the Dow boasted record closing highs on Thursday after a U.S. Federal Reserve policy update that was less hawkish than expected, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq underperformed as Oracle Corp.'s ORCL-N financial update made investors wary of artificial-intelligence bets. The TSX also closed at another record.

Oracle shares tumbled 10.8 per cent in their biggest one-day drop since late January, and they were the top S&P 500 decliner after the company's quarterly forecasts fell short of analysts' estimates. It had also warned that annual spending would run US$15-billion higher than previously planned, stoking fears about its big push into AI. The cost of insuring Oracle debt against default surged as investors feared that the company's heavy reliance on debt financing could be part of an AI bubble similar to the dot-com bust of the early 2000s.

While Oracle helped drag other technology names lower, the Dow rallied along with the Russell 2000 small-cap index, which closed up 1.2 per cent and the S&P 500 value index, up 0.6 per cent, outperformed the growth index, which ended off 0.12 per cent.

Investors also continued to digest the U.S. central bank's update from Wednesday, when the Fed lowered borrowing costs by 25 basis points and chair Jerome Powell signalled a pause on further easing. However, investors were relieved that the Fed still had some rate cuts on its dot plot as it balanced still-elevated inflation with signs of labour market weakness.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 646.26 points, or 1.34 per cent, to 48,704.01, vaulting above its Nov. 12 closing record. The S&P 500 gained 14.32 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 6,901.00, breaching its Oct. 28 record close. The Nasdaq Composite lost 60.30 points, or 0.25 per cent, to 23,593.86.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index ended up 169.88 points, or 0.5 per cent, at 31,660.73, surpassing its record closing high on Wednesday.

The administration's National Security Strategy signals a return to more outwardly interventionist policies.

On Wednesday, December 10, Donald Trump announced that the United States had seized a tanker in the Caribbean carrying more than 1.6 million barrels of Venezuelan crude oil.

“Large tanker, very large, largest one ever, actually, and other things are happening,” Trump told the press.

The seizure is only the latest move in a long build-up of U.S. military action in the Caribbean and increasing U.S. threats against Venezuela and its President Nicolas Maduro.

Trump — without evidence — says Maduro is the head of an international terrorist group running drugs into the United States. He has called Maduro's days numbered.

Over the last three months, the United States has hit at least 22 alleged “drug boats” in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people. The campaign is the first unilateral lethal action the U.S. military has undertaken in Latin America since the 1980s.

The United States has now amassed the largest military buildup in the Caribbean in decades, including the world's largest warship, the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford. Fifteen thousand U.S. troops are stationed in the region, on the ready.

Responding to news of the tanker seizure, Democratic Senator Chris Coons told NewsNation that he is “gravely concerned that [Trump] is sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela.”

Even Congress has been shocked by how the administration has conducted the boat strikes. But a new document offers insight into the thought process behind Trump's threats and actions in the region.

On December 4, the White House released a 33-page document titled the National Security Strategy. It lays out U.S. military goals and foreign policy strategies for the world.

“In everything we do, we are putting America First,” it reads on page two. “This document is a roadmap to ensure that America remains the greatest and most successful nation in human history.”

The National Security Strategy condemns U.S. foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. It champions the U.S. economy and military and says that the United States “must be preeminent” in the Americas and around the world. If there is one overarching principle it is the concept of “peace through strength.”

“Strength is the best deterrent. Countries or other actors sufficiently deterred from threatening American interests will not do so,” it reads. “The United States must maintain the strongest economy, develop the most advanced technologies, bolster our society's cultural health, and field the world's most capable military.”

Front and center is the Western Hemisphere. It's the first region mentioned in the document — China isn't mentioned until page 23. The priority and focus on the Americas clearly marks a shift away from U.S. attention elsewhere around the world.

One detail in the document stands out more than any other — a reference to a new “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine. This is made twice — first it's included top among the overall policy goals and then again in the section on the Western Hemisphere.

The term “corollary” may seem like an odd choice to describe Trump's embrace of the foreign policy position, but it is actually a clear historical nod to a moment when the Monroe Doctrine was used to justify widespread U.S. military actions in the region.

Now, analysts believe this is the direction we are headed again.

When U.S. President James Monroe issued his state of the union address on December 2, 1823, it included in it an articulation of a foreign policy position that would come to be known as the Monroe Doctrine.

Essentially, the doctrine was a message to European countries following the independence of most of the countries of the Americas: Foreign powers had no right to interfere in the politics of the newly independent nations of the Western Hemisphere.

The “doctrine” was applauded by many independence leaders in the Western Hemisphere, including Simon Bolivar.

But by the beginning of the 20th century, the United States had grown in prominence, power and ambition. President Theodore Roosevelt's 1904 “Roosevelt Corollary” vastly reinterpreted the Monroe Doctrine, essentially turning it into a tool to justify U.S. intervention across the region.

“Any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship,” read the Roosevelt Corollary. “Chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation. And in the Western Hemisphere, the adherence of the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power.”

The United States would roll out exactly that police power — deploying marines, invading and occupying countries, intervening again and again across the Americas, under the guise of stability and security while advancing U.S. interests.

“Teddy Roosevelt basically says, our goal is still to kind of keep the Europeans out. But in order to do that, we're going to be proactive. We're going to be unilateral,” Alan McPherson, a professor of Latin American history at Temple University, told Truthout. “We're going to be kind of a cop on the beat. And the beat is going to be our neighborhood. It's going to be the Caribbean.”

“We're going to patrol it, and walk softly, carry a big stick,” McPherson said. “And we're going to have this sort of international police power to keep foreigners out. But sometimes you have to do it ahead of time.”

In the subsequent years, the United States would invade and occupy the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and many more countries, under the pretext of the Monroe Doctrine.

The late distinguished historian of U.S. foreign policy Walter LaFeber wrote that it got “to the point where the United States Marines become known in the area as ‘State Department troops' because they are always moving in to protect State Department interests and State Department policy in the Caribbean.”

Trump's use of the word “corollary” is not an accident. It is a direct reassertion of a return to a Monroe Doctrine where the U.S. flexes military, political, and economic power to achieve its goals in the region. Though those goals still may seem unclear, the Trump Corollary reads as a veiled threat against countries who might be unwilling to bend to U.S. interests.

“We will assert and enforce a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine,” the National Security Strategy document states. “We want to ensure that the Western Hemisphere remains reasonably stable and well-governed enough to prevent and discourage mass migration to the United States; we want a Hemisphere whose governments cooperate with us against narco-terrorists, cartels, and other transnational criminal organizations; we want a Hemisphere that remains free of hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets, and that supports critical supply chains; and we want to ensure our continued access to key strategic locations.”

Analysts say the Trump administration's visible actions toward Latin America in recent months — the seizure of the oil tanker, the boat attacks, threats of war with Venezuela, intervention into Honduran elections, tariffs on Brazil — all fit into this rubric.

Arizona State University associate professor of Latin American history Alexander Aviña explains that, for him, the National Security Strategy is the “signal of a realistic assessment from Trump's people that they can't compete, or militarily or economically dominate China.”

“So the way to take on China is to retrench U.S. power and dominance in the Americas. No more space or tolerance for an alternative government or ideas of governance as represented perhaps by a place like Venezuela or Brazil,” where left governments are unwilling to submit to U.S. demands, Aviña told Truthout. In July, Trump announced a 50 percent tariff on all Brazilian goods, citing a trial against Trump ally, former president Jair Bolsonaro, for attempting to carry out a coup d'état following the 2022 Brazilian elections.

“It's just all about sheer U.S. power,” said Aviña.

In moments of defeat or weakness, the U.S. has often returned its focus to dominating the hemisphere. This happened in the wake of the Vietnam War. By the early 1980s, Central America was the top focus for U.S. foreign policy, with the United States spending billions of dollars a year in interventionist policies across the region — backing bloody authoritarian dictators and training and supporting paramilitary groups fighting left governments.

Isolationism, for the United States, doesn't actually mean isolation. It means the U.S. shifting its attention back onto its own hemisphere, and doubling down on the countries the United States has long considered its own backyard.

“If we think back historically, to the moment of so-called U.S. isolationism in Latin America,” said Aviña, “that was actually a period of constant U.S. military intervention to the tune of 34 invasions,” marked over a period from the end of the 19th century until the mid-1930s.

Like the Roosevelt Corollary, which, following 1904, would be used for years to justify intervention after intervention across the region, the new National Security Strategy is a means of justifying the policies, threats, and attacks Trump may unleash across the region.

“It's going to take a while to digest everything, but it's easy to think of this as a return to imperialism — sort of neo-imperialism — where the United States is using its military force to get what it wants,” McPherson told Truthout. “The National Security Strategy that the Trump Administration just published is essentially saying, we're going to use our military to get more out of Latin America.”

That includes raw resources and markets. It is not by accident that Venezuela is Trump's top target. Venezuela happens to be both one of the most antagonistic left governments to U.S. interests in the region and the country with the largest proven oil reserves on the planet, just across the Caribbean from the United States.

McPherson said that the goal of the corollary is more about an intensification of neoliberalism, rather than a simple return to the past. “What really comes out of the National Security Strategy, at least in terms of Latin America, is that the priority of the U.S. government is U.S. corporations,” said McPherson. “What this government is essentially saying is that governments are neoliberal puppets of corporations. And so we need to apply this to foreign policy.”

Trump allies are excited for a heyday for U.S. corporations if Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is removed. “Venezuela, for the American oil companies, will be a field day,” Florida Republican Congresswoman Maria Salazar told Fox Business, in an interview in late November, where she called for increased U.S. pressure to overthrow president Maduro. “This is a number 1 goal for this administration from the economic standpoint.”

“It's just pure extraction,” said Aviña. “It's like that Elon Musk tweet about how we will intervene in Bolivia to get all the lithium that we want whenever we want.”

Bolivia is home to one of the largest reserves on the planet for lithium, a key ingredient in Lithium-ion batteries, which power the electronic vehicles made by Elon Musk's Tesla.

“We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it,” Elon Musk tweeted in July 2020, in the wake of the 2019 coup against President Evo Morales.

Gone are the past U.S. pretexts of spreading democracy, or standing for the good of humanity, or civilization building.

“This guy [Trump] shows up and he says, ‘I'm not going to waste my time with that. This is about sheer revanchism and power. And if you don't do what we tell you to do, we're going to make you pay',” said Aviña. “I think this is why it's difficult to define what a Trump corollary is other than ‘do what we tell you to do.'”

There is another way some experts see the Trump foreign policy and the new National Security Strategy: A repudiation of the liberal international order set in place in the wake of World War II and a return to a 19th-century idea around sites of power.

“Trump believes that these big powers [Russia, China and the United States] are entitled to have their own spheres of influence,” University of Denver Latin American History Professor Rafael Ioris told Truthout. “And in terms of the United States, that region is, of course, the Western hemisphere, which does not bode well for Latin America.”

“It's not entirely surprising given the extreme right logic, but it's somewhat surprising because it hasn't really been seen in the 21st century.”

Professor Alexander Aviña says on a scale of 1 to 10, he is highly concerned about the increasing possibility of direct U.S. intervention in Latin America.

“It's seven or eight,” he told Truthout. “If you think about it, the U.S. hasn't directly gotten involved militarily in Latin America many times since the end of World War II. Dominican Republic in 1965. They invaded Grenada in 1983. Panama, 1989. So the fact that we are where we're at now … It's a really scary moment that hopefully we will somehow avoid.”

            The nation's top historic preservation group is suing the Trump administration to block construction of President Donald Trump's plans for a massive new White House ballroom until review boards weigh in on the project.
    


            The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a congressionally chartered non-profit tasked with preserving historic buildings, said it was bringing the suit because its previous letter urging a pause on the project had gone unheeded.
    


            The group, which alleges the construction project is “unlawful,” is asking the US District Court for the District of Columbia to halt further activity until the administration complies with review processes, including a public comment period.
    


            “The White House is arguably the most evocative building in our country and a globally recognized symbol of our powerful American ideals. As the organization charged with protecting places where our history happened, the National Trust was compelled to file this case,” said Carol Quillen, the group's president and CEO.
    


The White House's East Wing is now demolished. Here's what was lost



            The suit names Trump as a defendant, along with the National Park Service, the Department of Interior, and the General Services Administration, along with officials who work in those agencies. The case is assigned to District Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee.
    


            “President Trump has full legal authority to modernize, renovate, and beautify the White House – just like all of his predecessors did,” White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement to CNN.
    


            While Trump announced months ago his plans to replace the East Wing with the new ballroom — a necessary addition, he says, to accommodate large events — the demolition proceeded without an extensive public review process.
    


            “No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Joe Biden, and not anyone else,” the complaint from the trust says.
    


            In October, the group addressed a letter to the administration  “respectfully” urging it to “pause demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes, including consultation and review by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, and to invite comment from the public.”
    


            The two commissions the letter was addressed to — the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts — have in the past reviewed proposed additions to the White House. That includes changes to the perimeter fence and the construction of a new tennis pavilion within the past decade.
    


            The current chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, Will Scharf, who also serves as Trump's staff secretary, said during a meeting of the commission last month that its jurisdiction covers construction, but not demolition — suggesting the body would eventually be involved in the project, but not until after the East Wing was demolished.
    


            At an early December NCPC meeting, Scharf said he has been told by colleagues at the White House that the ballroom plans will be submitted to the agency this month.

Once again, Mauricio Pochettino was in tears.

The 53-year-old Argentine is, by his own admission, emotional. It's something fans of the U.S. men's national team came to learn after a narrow loss to rival Mexico in the Gold Cup final in July, when Pochettino broke down while addressing his players. 

But this time, his vulnerability wasn't public. It occurred last month in Tampa after Pochettino sparred with reporters — full disclosure, I was one of them — about the idea of the U.S. team having ""regular"" players following a resounding 5-1 win over two-time world champion Uruguay. 

It was when Scott Goodwin pulled him aside.

The post-match episode reminded Goodwin, one of the deep-pocketed donors who helped U.S. Soccer underwrite the former Chelsea, Paris Saint Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager's reported $6 million salary, of one of the most iconic tales in American sports. And one that was made into a Disney movie. 

The 2004 film ""Miracle"" recounts the true story of the triumphant 1980 U.S. men's Olympic hockey team. At those Games, a team comprised of amateur college players somehow defeated the fully professional four-time defending champion Soviet Union en route to the gold medal. Five decades later, the ""Miracle on Ice"" team and its story is still considered one of the greatest upsets in global sports history.

That squad was coached by Herb Brooks, a no-nonsense taskmaster who despised entitlement above all else and who demanded total sacrifice and buy-in from his players. He kept them guessing about who would make the final roster all the way until the eve of those Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, lest anyone took their spot on the squad for granted.

In the film, Brooks was deftly portrayed by actor Kurt Russell, who delivered on those great movie scenes that make you want to run through a wall. 

Pochettino, for all his obvious charm and warmth in social settings or in front of the cameras, is every bit as demanding on the training field — and, if necessary, as ruthless — as Brooks was on the ice.

""When Mauricio was mad at your question after the Uruguay game, he said something like, ‘These are the players today. It's not the A players or the B players' — that was a repeat of a scene from the film,"" Goodwin told me when I spoke to him this week.  ""I said, ‘Watch this movie on the flight home.' 

""Well, he watched it.  And right away he sent me back the quote, 'I'm not looking for the best players. I'm looking for the right players.'  He picked up on that immediately."" 

Since he was hired to replace Gregg Berhalter almost 15 months ago, Pochettino has tried to remake the U.S. team in his own image. The Americans were coming off a historically poor performance at the 2024 Copa América, where they became the first host nation not to reach the knockout stage in that tournament's century-plus-long history. With the all-important 2026 FIFA World Cup looming, the need for a world-class coach who could hold a group that had become far too comfortable to account and get the best out of them was obvious.

Having successfully managed the egos of bona fide superstars like Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar over a 15-year European club career, Pochettino would not tolerate even the most decorated U.S. veterans putting themselves ahead of the greater good. He called in hungry newcomers, some of whom have risen to the challenge to become mainstays. 

After losing to Panama and Canada in March, the U.S. ended the year on a five-game unbeaten streak (with four wins) — all against nations who have qualified for the World Cup next summer. It took some time, but Pochettino's message has clearly gotten through. The goal, he said again after last week's World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., is to win the World Cup — nothing less.

Previous U.S. coaches didn't dare set the bar so high publicly. Jürgen Klinsmann, a World Cup-winning player with Germany who helmed the Americans at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, famously said flat out it was impossible beforehand. Bruce Arena did the same 12 years earlier despite repeatedly telling his players in private they'd beat a stacked Portugal in their 2002 opener in South Korea. They did, and Arena's U.S. went on to reach the quarterfinals, still the country's best finish on the men's side since the inaugural 1930 event.

Although it might engender increased pressure and expectations — just eight countries have ever hoisted the World Cup — there's a good reason Pochettino and his staff aren't setting any limits on what the U.S. can accomplish on home soil. The current odds for the Americans lifting the trophy next July 19 in New Jersey are about 80-1. In just his second full season coaching in England's Premier League, Leicester City overcame 5000–1 odds to win the title. Greece won the Euros in 2004 as a 150-1 underdog. (The 1980 Olympic hockey team's chances of beating the Russians were as high as 1000-1, based on some estimates.)

There's even a precedent with the U.S. team, which stunned pre-tournament favorite England 1-0 at the 1950 World Cup in Brazil — a result so unlikely some news outlets reported it as a 10-1 victory for the Three Lions, assuming the wire services were in error.

But to ""do the impossible,"" as the coach likes to say, all of Pochettino's charges have to believe that they can achieve what most clear-eyed outsiders are convinced they can't.

""If we don't have this synergy and that energy in between 26 players, we can win one game,"" Pochettino told reporters last week after the U.S. drew Paraguay, Australia and a yet-to-be-determined European side as their World Cup opponents.  ""But [to win] a competition like the World Cup, it's impossible.""

Which is why he needs the right collective group of players — not necessarily the best individual ones. 

""Good and right is completely different,"" he said, yet another reference to ""Miracle.""

Speaking at U.S. Soccer's Beyond the 90 Summit in New York City a few days earlier before the World Cup draw, it was clear the story had greatly influenced Pochettino.

""I'm in love with this movie,"" he told FOX Sports colleague Jenny Taft, who moderated the discussion. ""I was watching, and I was nearly crying.""

""Nearly?,"" Taft joked.

""OK, I was crying,"" Pochettino said. ""We identified with so many things in the movie, how a group of 20 players who really believed in an idea [made it come true]. It's an amazing story.  I think it represents very well the culture of the USA — your culture.""

That was Goodwin's idea when he made the recommendation.

""It's an American story about grit,"" he said. ""At Mauricio's first press conference, he talked about grit and confidence and belief, and that's what he's tried to instill in this team.

""I thought the movie would allow him to connect with American culture more and understand a little bit more about our sports culture,"" Goodwin added. ""Because in this country, sports is a lot of the culture. Some of the most patriotic moments in this country have been sports moments. 

""So for him to get to see that, and know that this kind of thing happened in this country, it made him believe a bit more that the kind of passion and belief and grit that he says the Argentinian national team has also exists here.""

Pochettino has tapped into that notion even more in the days since the draw. An avid consumer of American pop culture — music, TV shows — the country's can-do spirit is one of the things that attracted him to the job. He's talked openly about his desire to leave a legacy behind whenever he leaves. For him, the opportunity to try to make history with an underdog that also happens to be the home team at the biggest World Cup ever staged was too seductive to pass up.

Which is why Pochettino even attended a New York Rangers hockey game at Madison Square Garden – coincidentally, the team that Brooks coached from 1981-85. 

""This is an unbelievable country, unbelievable people,"" said Pochettino during an appearance on the Pat McAfee Show on Monday, a day after the Rangers game. ""When you are [invested], it's possible that you can achieve everything that you want. You arrived on the moon, you were the first. It's the most powerful country in every single area. Why not in soccer?""

He has the same question for those who doubt that the U.S. can orchestrate its own miracle next summer: ""Why not us?""

Scotland fans and politicians have criticised Fifa over its ""outrageous"" ticket prices for next summer's World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico.

The men's national team will face Haiti and Morocco in Boston before taking on Brazil in Miami when they return to the tournament for the first time in 28 years.

After the ticket application window opened on Thursday, it emerged prices for the group games will range from £134 to £523.

The Scottish Football Association (SFA) - which brokered a deal to secure priority tickets for Scotland Supporters' Club (SSC) members - said pricing was a matter for Fifa.

World Cup ticket prices 'monumental betrayal' say fans' group

World Cup ticket ballot opens - here's all you need to know

BBC Scotland has asked football's world governing body for comment.

Fans' group Football Supporters Europe have condemned the ""extortionate"" pricing strategy as have supporters' groups on both sides of the Scotland-England border.

Politicians also united on the BBC's Question Time to voice their concerns.

Steve Clarke's Scotland side qualified for the finals last month after a thrilling 4-2 Hampden victory over Denmark.

Following the draw in Washington DC, Scotland have been allocated 3,889 tickets for the Haiti match on 13 June and the same number for the Morocco game on 19 June.

Both fixtures will be played in the 63,815 capacity Boston Stadium.

For the match against Haiti, the prices will be £134, £298 or £372, while for the Morocco games tickets will cost £163, £320 or £447.

For the clash with five-time champions Brazil on 24 June Scotland have been granted 3,736 tickets.

It will be played in the Miami stadium which has a capacity of 64,091.

Tickets for that match will cost £198, £373 or £523.

Scotland fan Karen Gall criticised the ticket allocation and the fact group stage games are priced based on the perceived popularity of the teams involved, rather than at a flat rate.

She told the BBC's Radio Scotland Breakfast programme: ""They are just making it unaffordable for fans essentially.""

Karen, who lives in Glasgow, has decided not to enter the ballot.

She said: ""There is no point. We can't realistically afford it.

""We have thought about going. We do have friends in Boston we could potentially stay with.

""We could go and soak up the atmosphere but, by the same token, we could just stay here and have a great party at home.""

Daris Nesbitt will be in the US for the tournament after booking a £300 flight from Barcelona to Boston before last Friday's draw.

He has enough SSC loyalty points to guarantee the cheapest category 3 tickets for the group stages.

Daris, of Bishopton, Renfrewshire, also saved money by pre-booking 22 hotels in advance but he still faces a expensive trip.

The IT analyst said: ""I would say so far, totalling up, it has cost me about £4,000 - and that's before I even get a beer.""

Daris told the programme some members of the Tartan Army might travel to the US just to follow the action in a fan zone.

He said: ""The ticket pricing is absolutely ridiculous.

""I know there's people on third party websites paying £1,000 for games.""

Supporters have also voiced their concerns on social media.

Writing on X, Stephen Watson said: ""I've followed Scotland home and away for 27 years in the SSC. Have a decent enough regular income; and I'm sitting here contemplating if I can afford/justify paying for a R32 ticket at the World Cup having already decided just to take in 2 group games.

""It shouldn't be like this.""

The Scottish Football Supporters' Association (SFSA) said national football associations across the globe should ""hold Fifa to account for the excessive ticket prices"".

SPSA chief executive John MacLean also criticised the ""poor level"" of ticket allocations and what he described as the ""unacceptable"" dynamic pricing model.

Mr McLean said: ""The SFA president Mike Mulraney, who has recently been appointed chair of The Fifa Finance Committee, is ideally placed to express the widespread disappointment of Scottish fans and indeed fans all around the world at ticket prices that are, in some cases, five times the cost in Qatar.

""We hope the opportunity is not lost to represent the views of ordinary football supporters.""

Meanwhile, the Football Supporters' Association's England Fans' Embassy said the ticket prices were a ""slap in the face"" for supporters.

The issue even made it on to the BBC's Question Time programme on Thursday.

A member of the audience in Paisley asked: ""Are Scotland fans being priced out of the World Cup by the greed of Fifa?""

The SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn, who is a member of the Tartan Army, branded the ticketing arrangements ""a complete scam"".

The Aberdeen South MP also highlighted the fact supporters need to buy tickets in advance for the knock-out stages.

He said: ""Fifa take your money, stick it in their back pocket for a game you might never go to and then give it back to you less an administration fee.

""That's the worst bank you have ever heard of.""

Flynn told the programme that supporters were being ""fleeced"" and called on football bodies to get together and ""demand an end to this"".

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the pricing structure was ""utterly shameful"".

He added: ""We all have to gang up with confederations and nations across the globe and say to Fifa: 'Not a chance'.""

Scottish Conservatives leader Russell Findlay, who travelled to France for Scotland's last World Cup appearance in 1998, said: ""The ticket prices are completely outrageous.""

He added: ""Without fans at football it is sterile, it is dead, it is not worth it.

""We need to get this fixed.""

Findlay added that the Scottish government could help supporters at home by ensuring pubs are open ""in the wee small hours"" for Scotland's matches which kick off at 02:00 and 23:00.

Former Conservative business and Scotland Office minister, Lord Malcolm Offord, who last week defected to Reform UK, plans to attend the Brazil match.

He told the programme: ""It is a commercial venture. You are not going to get Fifa to change their mind.""

But Lord Offord agreed with fellow panellist, journalist Angela Haggerty.

He added: ""The best parties will actually be at home.""

The 2026 World Cup will feature 48 teams and be played from 11 June to 19 July in 16 cities across the US, Canada and Mexico.

The Fifa ticket application window runs until 13 January and fans will be charged for successful ticket applications in February.

On Monday, SSC members will be sent an access code to apply for Scotland's three group stage matches and potential knock-out matches.

For each match that is oversubscribed, a ballot using a loyalty points system will be used to determine who is successful in receiving their chosen category ticket.

An SFA spokesman said: ""The ticket pricing policy for the World Cup is a matter for FIFA as the tournament organisers.

""Nonetheless, we made the strongest possible representation that those members with the highest points from our Scotland Supporters' Club loyalty scheme should be given first access to the official ticket allocation.

""We are glad that this has been achieved and are preparing for the Participating Member Association sales window opening next week.""

Once again, Mauricio Pochettino was in tears.

The 53-year-old Argentine is, by his own admission, emotional. It's something fans of the U.S. men's national team came to learn after a narrow loss to rival Mexico in the Gold Cup final in July, when Pochettino broke down while addressing his players. 

But this time, his vulnerability wasn't public. It occurred last month in Tampa after Pochettino sparred with reporters — full disclosure, I was one of them — about the idea of the U.S. team having ""regular"" players following a resounding 5-1 win over two-time world champion Uruguay. 

It was when Scott Goodwin pulled him aside.

The post-match episode reminded Goodwin, one of the deep-pocketed donors who helped U.S. Soccer underwrite the former Chelsea, Paris Saint Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager's reported $6 million salary, of one of the most iconic tales in American sports. And one that was made into a Disney movie. 

The 2004 film ""Miracle"" recounts the true story of the triumphant 1980 U.S. men's Olympic hockey team. At those Games, a team comprised of amateur college players somehow defeated the fully professional four-time defending champion Soviet Union en route to the gold medal. Five decades later, the ""Miracle on Ice"" team and its story is still considered one of the greatest upsets in global sports history.

That squad was coached by Herb Brooks, a no-nonsense taskmaster who despised entitlement above all else and who demanded total sacrifice and buy-in from his players. He kept them guessing about who would make the final roster all the way until the eve of those Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, lest anyone took their spot on the squad for granted.

In the film, Brooks was deftly portrayed by actor Kurt Russell, who delivered on those great movie scenes that make you want to run through a wall. 

Pochettino, for all his obvious charm and warmth in social settings or in front of the cameras, is every bit as demanding on the training field — and, if necessary, as ruthless — as Brooks was on the ice.

""When Mauricio was mad at your question after the Uruguay game, he said something like, ‘These are the players today. It's not the A players or the B players' — that was a repeat of a scene from the film,"" Goodwin told me when I spoke to him this week.  ""I said, ‘Watch this movie on the flight home.' 

""Well, he watched it.  And right away he sent me back the quote, 'I'm not looking for the best players. I'm looking for the right players.'  He picked up on that immediately."" 

Since he was hired to replace Gregg Berhalter almost 15 months ago, Pochettino has tried to remake the U.S. team in his own image. The Americans were coming off a historically poor performance at the 2024 Copa América, where they became the first host nation not to reach the knockout stage in that tournament's century-plus-long history. With the all-important 2026 FIFA World Cup looming, the need for a world-class coach who could hold a group that had become far too comfortable to account and get the best out of them was obvious.

Having successfully managed the egos of bona fide superstars like Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar over a 15-year European club career, Pochettino would not tolerate even the most decorated U.S. veterans putting themselves ahead of the greater good. He called in hungry newcomers, some of whom have risen to the challenge to become mainstays. 

After losing to Panama and Canada in March, the U.S. ended the year on a five-game unbeaten streak (with four wins) — all against nations who have qualified for the World Cup next summer. It took some time, but Pochettino's message has clearly gotten through. The goal, he said again after last week's World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., is to win the World Cup — nothing less.

Previous U.S. coaches didn't dare set the bar so high publicly. Jürgen Klinsmann, a World Cup-winning player with Germany who helmed the Americans at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, famously said flat out it was impossible beforehand. Bruce Arena did the same 12 years earlier despite repeatedly telling his players in private they'd beat a stacked Portugal in their 2002 opener in South Korea. They did, and Arena's U.S. went on to reach the quarterfinals, still the country's best finish on the men's side since the inaugural 1930 event.

Although it might engender increased pressure and expectations — just eight countries have ever hoisted the World Cup — there's a good reason Pochettino and his staff aren't setting any limits on what the U.S. can accomplish on home soil. The current odds for the Americans lifting the trophy next July 19 in New Jersey are about 80-1. In just his second full season coaching in England's Premier League, Leicester City overcame 5000–1 odds to win the title. Greece won the Euros in 2004 as a 150-1 underdog. (The 1980 Olympic hockey team's chances of beating the Russians were as high as 1000-1, based on some estimates.)

There's even a precedent with the U.S. team, which stunned pre-tournament favorite England 1-0 at the 1950 World Cup in Brazil — a result so unlikely some news outlets reported it as a 10-1 victory for the Three Lions, assuming the wire services were in error.

But to ""do the impossible,"" as the coach likes to say, all of Pochettino's charges have to believe that they can achieve what most clear-eyed outsiders are convinced they can't.

""If we don't have this synergy and that energy in between 26 players, we can win one game,"" Pochettino told reporters last week after the U.S. drew Paraguay, Australia and a yet-to-be-determined European side as their World Cup opponents.  ""But [to win] a competition like the World Cup, it's impossible.""

Which is why he needs the right collective group of players — not necessarily the best individual ones. 

""Good and right is completely different,"" he said, yet another reference to ""Miracle.""

Speaking at U.S. Soccer's Beyond the 90 Summit in New York City a few days earlier before the World Cup draw, it was clear the story had greatly influenced Pochettino.

""I'm in love with this movie,"" he told FOX Sports colleague Jenny Taft, who moderated the discussion. ""I was watching, and I was nearly crying.""

""Nearly?,"" Taft joked.

""OK, I was crying,"" Pochettino said. ""We identified with so many things in the movie, how a group of 20 players who really believed in an idea [made it come true]. It's an amazing story.  I think it represents very well the culture of the USA — your culture.""

That was Goodwin's idea when he made the recommendation.

""It's an American story about grit,"" he said. ""At Mauricio's first press conference, he talked about grit and confidence and belief, and that's what he's tried to instill in this team.

""I thought the movie would allow him to connect with American culture more and understand a little bit more about our sports culture,"" Goodwin added. ""Because in this country, sports is a lot of the culture. Some of the most patriotic moments in this country have been sports moments. 

""So for him to get to see that, and know that this kind of thing happened in this country, it made him believe a bit more that the kind of passion and belief and grit that he says the Argentinian national team has also exists here.""

Pochettino has tapped into that notion even more in the days since the draw. An avid consumer of American pop culture — music, TV shows — the country's can-do spirit is one of the things that attracted him to the job. He's talked openly about his desire to leave a legacy behind whenever he leaves. For him, the opportunity to try to make history with an underdog that also happens to be the home team at the biggest World Cup ever staged was too seductive to pass up.

Which is why Pochettino even attended a New York Rangers hockey game at Madison Square Garden – coincidentally, the team that Brooks coached from 1981-85. 

""This is an unbelievable country, unbelievable people,"" said Pochettino during an appearance on the Pat McAfee Show on Monday, a day after the Rangers game. ""When you are [invested], it's possible that you can achieve everything that you want. You arrived on the moon, you were the first. It's the most powerful country in every single area. Why not in soccer?""

He has the same question for those who doubt that the U.S. can orchestrate its own miracle next summer: ""Why not us?""

Palme d'Or winner Julia Ducournau showed how deftly she could employ genre and metaphor with her first two features, 2016's cannibal-themed “Raw” and the 2021 automotive body horror “Titane.” But based on early reactions, the French filmmaker's third feature, “Alpha,” proved an even higher concept.

“Alpha” stars newcomer Mélissa Boros as the film's titular 13-year-old protagonist, who is coming of age in a world plagued by a mysterious blood-borne virus that turns people into hardened, statue-like figures coughing up clay sand. Despite seemingly being aware of the risks, Alpha participates in needle-sharing one night, getting a large “A” tattooed on her arm at a house party where Portishead thumps in the background.

But the gravity of the situation only sets in when Alpha's single mother (Golshifteh Farahani) — a doctor at the local hospital who dedicates her days to treating people infected with the virus — finds out about the tattoo and forces her daughter to get tested.  

 










As the pair wait to find out if Alpha is destined to become another petrified victim of the virus, her estranged uncle Amin (Tahar Rahim) comes back into the picture, plagued by the symptoms of heroin withdrawal. This pushes Alpha further into a state of unrest over her fate, and adds a more literal element to Ducournau's AIDS allegory, while the film flashes back to happier times from the girl's childhood. 

Neon has released the trailer for “Alpha,” which premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival and also stars Emma Mackey, Finnegan Oldfield, and Louai El Amrousy. Set to “The Mercy Seat” by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, the somber montage of scenes underscores what some critics have described as an uncharacteristically self-serious quality about the film.

That quality, however, seems to be by design. In an interview with Vanity Fair back in March, Ducournau said that, upon reflection, she'd been annoyed with herself for staying in her “comfort zone” with her first two films and was looking to tap into something new with her next work.  

“I realized that I was saying something I'd already said in my two previous films. I got bored with it — and annoyed with myself for allowing myself to stay in that comfort zone. From film to film, I always feel like I can go further in the way I expose myself, which is incredibly hard to do,” Ducournau said. 

 










“With each film, I'm thinking that I can put myself in a more vulnerable place, in order to relate to the audience more and more,” she added. “And I'm not done digging. It's an eternal path: How can I be more sincere? How can I get closer to my emotions? How can I show them in a more precise way, with more generosity? To me, that is the only path. That's why I make films.” 

Fans of the French director — who, up until now, has been known for a different sort of body horror — will be able to see her charting a different path when Neon releases “Alpha” in U.S. theaters on March 27, 2026.

Charlie Puth sent a public plea to Elon Musk to stop launching rockets near his home in Santa Barbara in the middle of the night. The singer, whose wife is currently pregnant, reached out to the X owner on social media yesterday. 


	“Hi @elonmusk…these sonic booms have gotten progressively louder since they started launching the rockets in Santa Barbara,” Puth wrote. “This one at 3am today felt like 150-160 dB, violently shook our whole house, and really frightened my pregnant wife. I hope they do not get louder.” 

Hi @elonmusk …these sonic booms have gotten progressively louder since they started launching the rockets in Santa Barbara. This one at 3am today felt like 150-160 dB, violently shook our whole house, and really frightened my pregnant wife. I hope they do not get louder :/


	So far Musk has yet to respond. As SpaceX CEO, Musk maintains rocket testing bases in California, Florida, and Texas. The California launches take place at the Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara. According to the SpaceX website, a Falcon 9 rocket was launched Wednesday morning at 3:40 a.m. It warned that “there was a possibility that residents of Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura counties may have heard one or more sonic booms during the launch, but what residents experienced depended on weather and other conditions.”

	











	In October, Puth appeared on The Tonight Show to perform his single “Changes.” He also sat down with host Jimmy Fallon to discuss the album and announcing becoming a father in the “Changes” music video.

	“We're expecting a baby in March,” he told Fallon. “I'm gonna be a dad. I was told not to reveal the gender.” He added, “I hope baby likes music, because it's the only thing I'm good at.”

	











	Puth will perform the national anthem at the 2026 Super Bowl, as announced last month. “I can't believe I'm saying this… I will be performing the National Anthem at Super Bowl LX,” Puth captioned a silly post celebrating the news. In the clip, he broke down the difficulty of singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” to a group of football players using game-day terminology — a nod to his social videos where he overexplains music.
