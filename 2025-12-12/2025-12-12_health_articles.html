                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mass General Brigham is announcing the spinout of AIwithCare, a company founded by researchers from the health system who developed an artificial intelligence (AI) screening tool that significantly outperformed manual screening for determining a patient's eligibility and enrolling them in a clinical trial. The tool, RECTIFIER (RAG-Enabled Clinical Trial Infrastructure for Inclusion Exclusion Review), was first developed and studied by researchers at Mass General Brigham's Accelerator for Clinical Transformation. RECTIFIER represents the first new company spun out by Mass General Brigham involving a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI application developed by researchers within the health system. Now that this work is complete, it will be much easier for others to deploy and benefit from the capabilities." Jane Moran, Chief Information and Data Officer, Mass General Brigham RECTIFIER leverages generative AI to screen a patient's electronic health record for information that can determine their eligibility for a clinical trial such as diagnoses, key health indicators and current or past medications. The tool assesses unstructured data available in notes and reports, which are often crucial for determining trial eligibility but are typically inaccessible without a laborious manual review process from research coordinators and clinical staff. In a 2024 study in NEJM AI, RECTIFIER was found to more accurately identify eligible patients that met a heart failure trial's eligibility criteria when compared to manual screening, and at a far lower cost than traditional methods. "Licensing RECTIFIER is a major milestone in our goal of delivering AI-powered solutions that improve operational workflows, enhance clinical trial efficiency and optimize care delivery pathways," said RECTIFIER research co-senior author and AIwithCare CEO and co-founder Alexander "A.J." Blood, MD, MSc, associate director of the Accelerator for Clinical Transformation and cardiologist in the Heart and Vascular Institute at Mass General Brigham. "The tool's demonstrated ability to rapidly and accurately identify patients for studies can be a game-changer for research teams and especially for the patients who deserve timely access to clinical trials of cutting-edge therapies," added Sandy Aronson, president and Chief AI Officer, AIwithCare, former executive director of IT and AI at Mass General Brigham Personalized Medicine, and current digital research principal architect for the health system. In addition to clinical trials, groups at Mass General Brigham are using RECTIFIER to accelerate patient identification and reduce the burden of manual chart review in clinical and population health use cases. Pediatric gastroenterologists are using RECTIFIER to perform patient referral triage with demonstrated 94.7% accuracy, identifying urgent labs and symptoms buried within clinical notes with 98% accuracy. Mass General Brigham Innovation, which facilitated the new company spinout, works with researchers throughout the healthcare system to manage tech transfer commercialization and coordinate industrial relationships such as licensing agreements, formation of new companies and other contracts, in addition to intellectual property (IP) management and general advising, with an ultimate goal of translating novel research advances and innovations from bench to bedside. In the past year alone, Mass General Brigham Innovation had more than 1,400 active licenses, more than 600 new inventions disclosed, and nearly 200 issued U.S. patents. Advancing AI that can streamline matching patients with clinical trials reflects our commitment to practical innovation that strengthens patient care and expands access to promising therapies. Deploying such technology more broadly could help reduce significant barriers in care delivery and ultimately accelerate clinical research."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in women with inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, according to the results of a matched prospective analysis presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), held December 9-12, 2025. Women who inherit a pathogenic mutation in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are advised to follow the recommended guidance to have their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed (a procedure known as bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) at relatively early ages to safeguard against their elevated risk of ovarian and/or fallopian tube cancer, said study presenter Joanne Kotsopoulos, PhD, a scientist at the Women's College Hospital Research and Innovation Institute and a professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto in Canada. Although MHT can treat the symptoms of menopause, many patients might not want to take MHT if they perceive MHT to be unsafe and instead suffer unnecessarily with the symptoms, Kotsopoulos explained. "We cannot simply recommend a drastic surgery like oophorectomy for young women without offering a way for them to manage the well-established short- and long-term outcomes of surgical menopause," she said. "I believe we should educate patients and their health care providers on how we can safely balance the risks and benefits of MHT use to ensure longevity and improve quality of life. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of reluctance and misinformation regarding MHT, which is mostly attributable to findings from studies conducted in the general population (those without BRCA mutations) showing an association between MHT use and an increased risk of breast cancer. To help manage the side effects of oophorectomy safely in women with BRCA mutations, we need data from well-designed observational studies of MHT use in this specific population who, due to their genetics, face elevated risks of breast cancer." Joanne Kotsopoulos, PhD, scientist at the Women's College Hospital Research and Innovation Institute and professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto Kotsopoulos and colleagues conducted a matched prospective analysis-a type of observational study-in which they tried to recreate the conditions of a clinical trial by analyzing data from women with menopause (mostly induced by surgery) and whether they used MHT. The researchers created 676 matched pairs of women who did and did not use MHT after menopause, with pair-matching based on whether they carried BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, birth year, and age at menopause. However, two formulations were associated with decreased risk of breast cancer. Women who received estrogen-only MHT were 63% less likely to develop breast cancer than their MHT-naïve counterparts. "Although based on smaller numbers, this is definitely an exciting and interesting area for future research," Kotsopoulos said. "Hypothetically, conjugated estrogen and bazedoxifene could be used to mitigate breast cancer risk by avoiding progesterone, which is thought to be the breast cancer risk-associated component of MHT. Future trials will be necessary to test this hypothesis." There were no significant differences in the results whether patients carried a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant, an indication that underscores MHT's safety for carriers of BRCA mutations, according to Kotsopoulos. "Our findings suggest that clinicians should take a personalized approach to menopause management for women with BRCA mutations who are suffering from the impact of surgical (or natural) menopause, if there are no contraindications for them," said Kotsopoulos.

It establishes the basis for product yield, quality, and long-term process stability. However, despite significant breakthroughs in host engineering, vector systems, and culture conditions, early-stage clone selection is still one of the least analytically supported stages of development.1 Therapeutic proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, enzymes, and fusion proteins, are becoming increasingly essential components of current treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and genetic disorders. Each of these modalities requires a well-characterized and scalable manufacturing cell line.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this interview, industry expert Dr. Raj Singh discusses the PathoVerse, a pioneering global digital ecosystem designed to transform pathology through connectivity, AI integration, and collaborative innovation across research and clinical practice. As a practicing pathologist, I saw how fragmented our field had become. Different vendors, systems, and formats made true collaboration almost impossible. With PathPresenter, our goal was to simplify one of the biggest challenges in pathology: managing images at scale. We built a platform that pathologists could use daily without worrying about interoperability. Over time, as our community grew to more than 70,000 users across 180 countries, we realized we had the foundation to create something even larger: a vendor-agnostic global ecosystem where clinicians, researchers, and technology partners could unite. Our biggest differentiators are deep domain knowledge and absolute interoperability. PathPresenter is compatible with any scanner, LIS, AI module, or storage architecture. It is not a static product but a living, evolving platform shaped by constant feedback from thousands of users worldwide. It is used in over 60 institutions, including major names like MSKCC, Cincinnati Children's, and Dr. Lal PathLabs. We integrate AI directly into PathPresenter, allowing it to be used by pathologists, oncologists, researchers, and even patients to interpret results. By embedding validated AI tools into a secure, scalable infrastructure, we ensure that breakthroughs from leading AI companies reach real-world clinical practice. The PathoVerse is a collaborative digital ecosystem that connects pathology data, technology, AI, and human expertise to enable real-world innovation. Pathology is evolving rapidly with advances in 3D imaging, virtual staining, digital twins, and AI diagnostics, yet many of these tools exist in isolation. The PathoVerse bridges these silos, offering a unified infrastructure where technologies, datasets, and workflows can come together seamlessly, enabling shared progress across research, diagnostics, and education. It is all about turning silos into integrated systems. ConsultConnect is the fastest and easiest way for organizations to implement digital pathology, as it removes the logistical bottlenecks that make consultations slow and expensive. When we talk about consultations, there is often friction at every step. Cases may come from sister hospitals or external labs, yet most systems still cannot communicate with each other. In some places, even departments within the same hospital remain disconnected. Traditionally, a consultation can take between five and 14 days, but the problem has never been a lack of expertise; pathologists are more than ready to provide their insights. It is almost unbelievable that in an age where we can stream data from Mars, we still ship glass slides in boxes. Slides can break or get lost, and patient information is often re-entered manually, adding even more delays. Through AWS, we can set up secure web portals for institutions in a matter of days. Hospitals can upload digital slides and case data, and our HL7 middleware transfers the information directly into the recipient's LIS or dashboard. With partners like Grundium, we also provide pathways to easier scanner accessibility at referring sites. Institutions using ConsultConnect pay only per consultation once the service starts. This approach enables hospitals to launch a digital consultation network rapidly, demonstrate revenue potential, and prove that digital pathology can serve as a growth engine rather than an expense. For patients, ConsultConnect means faster access to expert opinions and better continuity of care. It transforms a once slow and fragmented process into a connected, efficient workflow that embodies the true purpose of the PathoVerse: collaboration without barriers. For patients, it provides faster, more accurate access to specialized diagnostics regardless of location. Ultimately, it accelerates how ideas move from concept to real-world clinical solutions. Digital pathology should no longer be seen as a cost. When implemented strategically, it becomes a growth engine. Departments can offer consults or even AI analysis as a service, generating revenue while improving diagnostic efficiency. Institutions that adopt this model are already seeing measurable operational and financial benefits. Our goal is to connect hospitals, researchers, and technology companies across every region of the world. The PathoVerse will continue expanding throughout the Middle East, Asia, and South America, building a federated network that supports seamless access, consultation, and data sharing. By working together, we can truly transform how pathology contributes to precision medicine and global healthcare. The PathoVerse is evolving into a global collaboration engine for pathology. Institutions are moving beyond the question of why to go digital and are now asking how to expand it across diagnosis, education, and AI research. Future growth will include AI-as-a-service offerings, broader consult networks, and deeper integration with partners such as AWS, Grundium, Imagenomix, and MSKCC. Our mission remains clear: to connect every pathologist, laboratory, and data system worldwide, making pathology a connected, insight-driven cornerstone of precision medicine. Since its founding in 2017, PathPresenter's secure and scalable enterprise software has been adopted by over 30 top-tier medical institutions for clinical care, education, and research. PathPresenter has fostered a vibrant community of more than 45,000 users across 172 countries, enabling seamless viewing, sharing, and collaboration on digital pathology images, fostering global knowledge exchange, and advancing the field of pathology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New analysis from a WHO global expert committee on vaccine safety has found that, based on available evidence, no causal link exists between vaccines and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The conclusion reaffirms WHO's position that childhood vaccines do not cause autism. The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), established in 1999, brings together international experts to provide independent and authoritative scientific advice to WHO on global vaccine safety related priorities. Evidence based on 31 primary research studies, published between January 2010 and August 2025, including data from multiple countries, strongly supports the positive safety profile of vaccines used during childhood and pregnancy, and confirms the absence of a causal link with ASD. The Committee also assessed the review of potential health risks associated with vaccines with aluminum adjuvants, drawing on studies conducted from 1999 through March 2023. In addition, it reviewed a recent large cohort study analyzing nationwide registry data of children born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018. Following its review, GACVS reaffirms its previous conclusions from 2002, 2004 and 2012: vaccines, including those with thiomersal and/or aluminum, do not cause autism. WHO advises all national authorities to rely on the latest science and ensure vaccine policies are grounded in the strongest available evidence. During the past 50 years, childhood immunization has saved at least 154 million lives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He's now a political science professor at the University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, where he analyzes the ability of healthcare lobbyists to wield influence and shape policy reforms, and how that ends up increasing prices for everyone. Garlick's research on the topic and his own experience in Congress served as the foundation to write a new book, “Pre-existing Conditions: How Lobbying Makes American Health Care More Expensive,” which was published in October. Garlick talked to Medscape Medical News for a Q&A about his book and what his research tells us about how special interest spending can block wide-scale changes in the healthcare system and what can be done to combat lobbying efforts and reduce healthcare costs. Answers have been lightly edited for length and clarity. I worked in Congress in 2017, when the effort to repeal and replace the ACA was going on, so that was really like a front-row seat to see just how many interests and lobbyists were involved in the issue. But when I look at healthcare finance policy in particular, I think that this is an issue where lobbyists are particularly influential in their ability to stop cost containment policies from being put into effect. Now that the country is seemingly having a cost of living or affordability crisis, it's getting more attention. And I think the influence of lobbyists is more important to understand now than ever. So how much do the people living in each state pay for healthcare? And what we see is that when more healthcare industry lobbyists are in each state, year over year, there tends to be less healthcare legislation that's introduced, and the costs tend to rise more. I see that as a function of the fact that many efforts at regulating the healthcare industry are going to make things more affordable for patients and consumers. And when legislators or bureaucrats are putting less effort into regulating their healthcare market, costs tend to inflate higher, and that's why we see each individual lobbyist associated with higher spending in each state. So then how does health lobbying shape what reforms are even viable for state legislatures to take on? Moving to the federal level, are there any examples in Congress right now that show how lobbyists have been effective in shaping healthcare policy? The $50 billion rural hospital transformation fund [included in the domestic tax bill passed earlier this year] is an acknowledgment that the future cuts that are going to come to Medicaid are going to disproportionately affect rural hospitals that rely on Medicaid reimbursements to keep the lights on. Zooming back to Vermont — because that's where you work and do research — what can other states learn from Vermont in terms of trying to lower healthcare prices? First of all, healthcare is not very affordable in Vermont, and I think there are kind of two lessons that can be learned from that. I think the first lesson is you don't want to let a hospital monopoly dominate your market the way that it does in Vermont. In terms of a positive lesson for Vermont, Vermont has a regulator with the ability to approve or reject upcoming price changes year over year. In recent years, the Green Mountain Care Board has had showdowns with the University of Vermont Medical Center, which kind of shows the ability of a powerful regulator to make things slightly more affordable for residents. Last year, the Green Mountain Care Board rejected a hospital-projected price increase. What are some other policy ideas that you might have for healthcare cost containment? I think the tool that legislators and bureaucrats should be eager to look for is ways to increase the supply of healthcare providers, particularly in hard-to-reach areas such as rural areas. Because in some ways, healthcare is like other parts of the marketplace. When supply is restricted, prices go up because healthcare demand does not seem to be going down anywhere….When personnel is lacking, hospitals end up paying exorbitant prices for travel nurses or having to patch things up on a short-term basis. The other thing I think that legislators should be thinking about is how to address prices directly. Wholesale administrative price controls have been attempted before in the country. Preventing the emergence of vertical or horizontal monopolies is another way to protect patients. If healthcare is going to be provided in the open market, at least give patients a chance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New evidence reveals how everyday processed foods may disrupt gut barriers and amplify inflammation, while targeted dietary strategies offer promising ways to improve outcomes in Crohn's disease. Conceptual framework linking ultra-processed foods (UPFs) to mechanistic pathways, inflammatory cascade, clinical outcomes, and dietary interventions in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, a group of researchers synthesized evidence linking ultra-processed foods (UPFs) to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk, activity, mechanisms, and therapeutic dietary strategies. More than half of calories in many nations now come from UPFs, paralleling rising IBD, which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), disorders that disrupt school, work, and family life. The NOVA classification defines UPFs as industrial formulations rich in refined substrates and additives. Large cohorts link higher UPF intake with CD more than UC. Further research is needed to standardize exposure, test mechanisms, and personalize nutrition, while also recognizing that prospective cohorts remain vulnerable to unmeasured confounding and early disease-driven dietary change. This narrative review was conducted with a structured approach to summarize epidemiological, mechanistic, and therapeutic evidence. Additional mechanistic evidence on non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS), titanium dioxide (E171), and high salt derived from supplementary targeted searches rather than the core predefined strategy. Reference lists of key studies and reviews were hand-searched. Human studies were eligible if they defined exposure by NOVA or additive doses and reported incident IBD, disease activity, relapse, or surgery. Mechanistic models in animals or intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were included when doses approximated dietary exposure, although many experiments still used concentrations higher than typical human intake. Extraction captured exposure assessments (for example, food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)), outcome measures, and effect estimates including hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR), and relative risk (RR). Study quality, potential confounding by socioeconomic status (SES), and risks of reverse causation were qualitatively considered. Given heterogeneity across designs, populations, and outcomes, quantitative pooling was not attempted. Instead, evidence was synthesized narratively across three domains: epidemiology, mechanisms, and therapeutic implications, emphasizing recency, biological plausibility, and clinical relevance. Outcomes were cross-checked for consistency in cohorts, while noting that NOVA classification inconsistency contributes to exposure misclassification. Across multinational cohorts, higher UPF intake was consistently associated with greater CD risk, with weaker or null findings for UC. In the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology cohort, five or more daily UPF servings were linked to incident IBD versus fewer than one (HR approximately 1.8). Three large United States cohorts showed a dose-response association with CD, not UC. The NutriNet-Santé cohort reported no significant association, likely limited by few events and short follow-up. In the UK Biobank, the highest UPF intake predicted about a twofold higher CD risk (HR approximately 2.0) and a greater likelihood of IBD-related surgery. Among patients, higher UPF intake correlated with active disease (OR approximately 3.8), and a remission cohort had more relapses over one year with the highest intake (HR approximately 3.9). However, the authors emphasize that these associations do not establish causality and require cautious interpretation, particularly because UPF consumption may correlate with broader lifestyle patterns that are difficult to fully adjust for. Emulsifiers such as CMC and P80 thin mucus, promote bacterial encroachment, reduce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and shift the microbiota toward proinflammatory profiles, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), CMC altered the microbiota, lowered fecal SCFAs, and increased abdominal discomfort. MDX enhances adherence and biofilm formation by adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), impairs antimicrobial defenses, and worsens colitis in interleukin-10, deficient mice. NNS can impair human glucose tolerance via microbiome-dependent mechanisms. In models, E171 interacts with mucus and immune pathways; the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) no longer considers E171 safe as a food additive. High-salt diets, common with UPFs, reduce Lactobacillus species, deplete SCFAs, and promote T helper 17 cell (Th17) inflammation. Therapeutic evidence converges on reducing UPFs and selected additives. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) remains first-line induction for pediatric CD and likely works partly by removing habitual exposures. Partial enteral nutrition (PEN) is more acceptable but requires careful food selection. The Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED) plus PEN was non-inferior to EEN for induction and improved maintenance. Minimally processed patterns such as a Mediterranean-style diet or the Specific Carbohydrate Diet improve symptoms for some patients, though adherence and adult data vary. Evidence from cohorts, mechanistic models, and trials indicates that UPF consumption is associated with higher CD risk and may worsen outcomes across IBD, with weaker signals for UC. Clinically, EEN, the CDED, and minimally processed patterns offer benefit. Patients and families can prioritize meals while clinicians personalize plans, standardize tools, and support trials, but the authors note that professional guidelines currently prioritize whole-food dietary patterns rather than categorical UPF elimination because causal evidence is still emerging.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new randomized trial reveals how simple food choices before and after fasted HIIT can shift the body's oxidative stress and recovery patterns, offering practical guidance for tailoring nutrient timing to support training goals. Study: Acute Impact of Polyphenol-Rich vs. Carbohydrate-Rich Foods and Beverages on Exercise-Induced ROS and FRAP in Healthy Sedentary Female Adults - A Randomized Controlled Trial. University of Vienna researchers recently conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of polyphenol-rich foods and carbohydrate-rich foods in mitigating oxidative stress during exercise. The findings, published in the journal Antioxidants, highlighted the benefits of carbohydrates during exercise and of polyphenols during recovery under fasted, high-intensity conditions, and in a sedentary female population. Exercise-induced oxidative stress is a well-established condition in sports. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during exercise have both beneficial and detrimental effects, depending on their concentration and timing. Chronic exposure to ROS increases the risk of various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and age-related pathologies. Physiological levels of ROS, on the other hand, play vital roles in strengthening muscle and improving antioxidant defense mechanisms. Diet plays an essential role in modulating exercise-induced oxidative stress. Carbohydrates may attenuate oxidative stress by reducing physiological stress and inflammatory responses rather than directly scavenging ROS in vivo, although glucose and sucrose have shown radical-scavenging properties in vitro. Polyphenols, a diverse group of plant-derived compounds, have gained significant attention in medical science due to their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Polyphenol-enriched whole foods have shown significantly greater physiological relevance in mitigating oxidative stress than conventional high-dose vitamin supplements, as vitamins at higher concentrations have been found to suppress the body's internal antioxidant defense system. To provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of dietary interventions on exercise-induced oxidative stress, researchers at the University of Vienna designed a randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of carbohydrate- and polyphenol-rich foods in mitigating oxidative stress during resistance-circuit high-intensity interval training. This randomized controlled trial initially randomized 45 women, of whom 30 completed the full protocol, comprising healthy, sedentary females aged 19 to 33 years. The participants were randomly assigned to two study arms: one included blueberries, whole-grain bread, and bread rolls, and the other included pomegranate juice. Within each study arm, participants randomly consumed each of the included foods after a 12-hour fast, with a washout period of at least seven days between intervention days. In both study arms, water intake served as a control condition. The samples were analyzed to measure ROS (electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy) and total antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing ability of plasma assay, FRAP). The analysis of control group participants (water intake) revealed a clear induction in ROS levels and total antioxidant capacity following the training session. However, the magnitude of these changes was modest and subject to inter-individual variability, indicating a considerable physiological stress response. The analysis of intervention group participants revealed that intake of carbohydrate-rich foods significantly attenuated the training-induced elevation in total antioxidant capacity and showed a non-significant trend toward attenuating the training-induced elevation in ROS levels, compared with intake of polyphenol-rich foods or water. These observations highlight a protective role of carbohydrates against oxidative stress, primarily through effects on FRAP rather than consistent significant effects on ROS. Compared with carbohydrate intake, polyphenol intake significantly reduced ROS levels during the post-exercise recovery period, although no significant differences relative to water were observed. Regarding total antioxidant capacity, a continuous increase was observed during the recovery period, reflecting the impact of high-intensity training sessions, with no significant differences between the intervention foods during recovery and with changes reflecting redox-system kinetics rather than enhanced antioxidant capacity. The observed benefit of polyphenol intake is particularly significant, as chronic exposure to oxidative stress is associated with impaired recovery, reduced muscle function, and increased risk of tissue damage. The observed benefit of carbohydrate intake may reflect the fact that sufficient carbohydrate availability reduces exercise-induced oxidative stress by lowering reliance on fat oxidation and minimizing mitochondrial ROS production. These effects are particularly relevant during endurance exercise, where carbohydrates mitigate cumulative oxidative stress responses from repeated sessions and sustain performance. However, over-suppression of ROS production may impair training adaptations such as muscle strengthening, highlighting the importance of dosage in carbohydrate strategies. Overall, this study provides valuable information for both athletes and coaches to optimize their performance and training adaptations through nutrition, although the findings should be interpreted cautiously, given that the study population consisted of sedentary young women, the intervention assessed acute, single-session effects, and the fasted-state high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocol does not fully reflect typical training environments. Given the findings, researchers suggest integrating polyphenol-rich foods in meals consumed before and after training sessions. Regarding carbohydrate-rich foods, they emphasize personalized approaches based on training intensity, duration, and energy demands, while acknowledging that performance impacts were not directly measured in this trial.

However, it is increasingly difficult to treat as the bacteria that cause infection develop resistance to current antibiotics. This new medication has the potential to help slow the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and make gonorrhoea treatment more accessible worldwide.The international trial involved more than 900 people from five countries (USA, South Africa, Thailand, Belgium, and the Netherlands). Results showed that zoliflodacin cured over 90% of infections at genital sites. The medication was well tolerated, with side effects similar to those seen with current treatments, and no serious safety issues were reported.Zoliflodacin is currently awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If approved, the authors say it could greatly improve global efforts to control drug-resistant gonorrhea infections, support community-led care, and protect reproductive health for millions of people.

Meanwhile, a federal vaccine advisory panel handpicked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. voted last week to end the universal recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine dose at birth. It's just the start of what are expected to be major changes in childhood vaccine recommendations overall. Also this week, Rovner interviews Georgetown University professor Linda Blumberg about what the GOP's health plans have in common. Plus, for "extra credit" the panelists suggest health policy stories they read (or wrote) this week that they think you should read, too: Julie Rovner: The Washington Post's "Rural America Relies on Foreign Doctors. Trump's Visa Fee Shuts Them Out," by David Ovalle. Anna Edney: Bloomberg News' "Abbott Fired a Warning Shot on Baby Formula  -  Then Launched a Lobbying Blitz," by Anna Edney. Sheryl Gay Stolberg: The New York Times' "The Married Scientists Torn Apart by a Covid Bioweapon Theory," by Katie J.M. Maya Goldman: ProPublica's "These Health Centers Are Supposed to Make Care Affordable. Discover how real-time cell density monitoring boosts yield, lowers media costs, and improves viability in bioprocessing. Discover how electron microscopy advances plant and microbial research with expert insights from the John Innes Centre's bioimaging facility.
