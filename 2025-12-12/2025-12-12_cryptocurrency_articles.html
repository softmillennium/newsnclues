Bitcoin signage in Times Square in New York.

Bitcoin continues to drift toward the lower bound of its recent trading range with any increase in the price seen being met by selling from investors who purchased the largest cryptocurrency near the all-time high reached in early October. 

Crypto analytics firm Glassnode said various metrics point to a “mild bearish phase,” defined by modest capital inflows outweighed by steady selling pressure from larger holders.  With prices stuck in a “weak but bounded range,” the firm noted, time itself becomes a negative force as unrealized losses accumulate. Relative unrealized losses jumped to 4.4%, the highest in nearly two years after spending most of that period below 2%, signaling a transition from euphoria to “elevated stress and uncertainty.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Central bank digital currencies are a far safer option than stablecoins, which pose greater risks than their purported benefits, according to Reserve Bank of India deputy governor T. Rabi Sankar. It seems to me that they do not; at any rate, they do not serve a purpose that cannot be served better by fiat money,” Sankar said at the Mint Annual BFSI Conclave 2025. Stablecoins fail the fundamental tests that define modern money and pose risks far greater than the benefits their proponents claim, he said. Calling stablecoins inherently unstable, Sankar said that India's financial system already has fast, low-cost, and robust digital rails such as Unified Payments Interface (UPI), real-time gross settlement (RTGS) and national electronic funds transfer (NEFT), leaving “little justification” for integrating private digital currencies into the domestic ecosystem. While stablecoins are often promoted as tools for faster cross-border transfers or vehicles to expand financial inclusion, Sankar countered these claims, saying that in reality, stablecoins continue to be used predominantly within the crypto market as instruments for leverage and speculation, rather than as everyday transactional currency. “To sum up, many of these benefits are neither unique to stablecoins nor have stablecoins yet established any of the benefits their proponents claim,” he said. He also warned that widespread adoption of stablecoins, whether denominated in domestic or foreign currency, could trigger currency substitution, weaken India's monetary policy transmission, disrupt capital account management, disintermediate banks and increase systemic vulnerabilities. The risk of losing sovereign seigniorage to private issuers, particularly those operating offshore, is a leakage of public revenue with significant long-term implications. Sankar encouraged the usage of CBDCs, calling them a technologically advanced yet safe public alternative that preserves monetary sovereignty. CBDCs, he said, combine the advantages of tokenised digital money, programming capability, atomic settlement, lower cross-border frictions, while still retaining the essential attributes of sovereign currency with fiat backing, trust and singleness. Encouraging CBDC adoption domestically, he said, would require making digital rupee usage ‘functionally similar to cash,' including offering tiered anonymity for small-value transactions. On the international front, he also said that bilateral and multilateral CBDC corridors could deliver the same cross-border efficiency stablecoins promise, without destabilizing national financial systems. This fits alongside India's existing push to interlink fast payment systems such as Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with partner jurisdictions, a move he said reduces any need for private alternatives. Sankar, however, acknowledged privacy concerns associated with programmable CBDC use cases, particularly those linked to targeted benefits such as subsidies. A programmable CBDC is a digital form of a country's money with built-in rules, allowing it to be automatically controlled for specific uses, locations, merchants, or expiry dates, enabling smart contracts for targeted subsidies, programs, or automated escrow. For example, government funds could be programmed to only buy specific goods like fertilizer, ensuring they reach the intended purpose efficiently. However, achieving such anonymity in a digital framework remains challenging. But more importantly, we would require a legal backing. Even if it is possible to wipe out a transaction technologically, I think, at least most public institutions would not do that unless there is a legal backing to such anonymity,” Sankar said at the fireside chat. He called wholesale CBDC transactions helpful, especially in cross-border payments as they simply save the huge amount of capital that banks employ in managing the settlement risk. However, there is a need for other countries to adopt CBDCs as well. “I think it is very important for CBDCs to exist across countries and connected to each other, so that you can actually show a use case which is superior to stablecoins,” he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Five digital asset firms have received conditional approvals Friday to become federally chartered trust banks by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) in a major step to bring U.S. dollar stablecoin issuers under federal regulatory oversight. Blockchain firm Ripple and Circle's (CRCL) First National Digital Currency Bank are on the list, which also includes BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets and Paxos, each having previously operated under state charters that will be converted to conditional federal status. The OCC is the only federal agency that charters banks and trusts, and this surge in approvals potentially marks a major turning point in crypto banking. Since the arrival of President Donald Trump's administration, the regulator — run by his appointee, Jonathan Gould — has shifted from a crypto-resistant stance to a friendly approach. "The OCC will continue to provide a path for both traditional and innovative approaches to financial services to ensure the federal banking system keeps pace with the evolution of finance and supports a modern economy," Gould said in a statement. If the newly approved trust banks can meet agency expectations, they'll permanently join about 60 regulated institutions with such charters, which allow for fiduciary activities including custody. National trust banks — a category that includes the first chartered crypto bank, Anchorage Digital — have certain limits in their business activities, so they don't offer the same deposit and lending capabilities as the OCC's larger pool of national banks. Ripple chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse said in an X post that the OCC's move is "huge news," a "massive step" for the firm's $1.3 billion RLUSD$0.9999 stablecoin. He also slammed the bank lobby for their "anti-competitive tactics." The Trump administration has sought to reverse any policies and banking activity that adversely targeted crypto firms. The OCC issued a report on Thursday about debanking, arguing that all nine of the largest banks were involved and that those guilty of severing banking ties to legal business customers could face punishment. UPDATE (December 12, 2025, 16:59 UTC): Adds comments from two of the involved companies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Milk Mocha has grown beyond its familiar cartoon identity and is now shaping a community-owned digital ecosystem powered by the $HUGS token. What separates it from many best crypto presales is the role given to its supporters. They actively guide the project through on-chain governance. Many projects focus on selling tokens first and explaining governance later. It invites participants to help build from the start. The HugVotes system allows anyone who stakes $HUGS to submit ideas, discuss proposals, and vote on outcomes. This transforms the presale from a transaction into shared ownership. Supporters are not buying based on short-term movement. Decisions range from approving new utilities to shaping future NFT collections. This shift from observer to contributor is why Milk Mocha often appears in discussions around best crypto presales. Governance power within Milk Mocha follows a clear rule. Those who commit tokens for the long term carry more weight in decisions. This encourages alignment between governance and sustainability rather than quick exits. HugVotes allow the community to guide NFT themes, allocate event budgets, and approve partnerships. Voting power scales with staked tokens, which rewards consistency and belief in the project. Instead of relying on promises, Milk Mocha offers direct participation, reinforcing its position among best crypto presales built on accountability. Milk Mocha extends governance beyond the ecosystem itself. Through the Charity Pool, token holders vote on how funds are donated to real-world causes. They are proposed, debated, and approved through HugVotes, with all transactions recorded on-chain. Whether the cause supports animal welfare, education, or emergency relief, every donation requires community approval. This structure adds transparency rarely seen in digital fundraising. The emotional connection many already have with Milk and Mocha strengthens participation here. This blend of financial utility and social impact is another reason Milk Mocha is frequently listed among best crypto presales with substance behind the narrative. Presale buyers are not joining simply to accumulate tokens. Early supporters understand that staking $HUGS now increases their say in future decisions. This desire for involvement is a key driver behind Milk Mocha's presale activity. This model turns early participation into a strategic advantage. Instead of waiting for outcomes, buyers help shape them. Milk Mocha shows that digital ownership can extend beyond holding tokens. Through staking, HugVotes, and community-led governance, it delivers real control to its supporters. This is why it continues to rank among meaningful best crypto presales, not just for potential upside, but for shared responsibility. The DAO plays an active role in decisions that matter, from spending and NFTs to charitable giving. In a space where trust is often requested, Milk Mocha places that trust directly in the hands of its community and allows them to lead.

Coinbase's application and that of Stripe subsidiary Bridge were not among those approved Friday. Gould and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Acting Chair Travis Hill have vocally advocated for new bank charters. Anchorage Digital, previously the only other crypto firm to receive OCC approval for a national trust bank, lauded its new contemporaries. This is long overdue,” CEO Nathan McCauley said in a release seen by Banking Dive. “With a nearly five-year head start — and immense investment in compliance along the way — Anchorage Digital Bank has pioneered a path for others to follow.” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse decried “anti-innovation bank lobbyists” in his statement Friday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As blockchain technology continues to evolve, speed and scalability remain its biggest challenges. To understand what makes Sei Giga different, CCN spoke to Jayendra Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs, who shared insights into how this new version reimagines blockchain performance from the ground up. 🏆 CCN's Top 101 in Crypto and Blockchain 2026 | Submit Your Nomination Before 23rd December Sei Giga is the next major upgrade  of the Sei blockchain, a layer-1 blockchain built to handle huge numbers of transactions extremely quickly while still being compatible with Ethereum's smart contracts. It's designed to solve the biggest performance limits of traditional blockchains by rethinking how blocks are created, ordered, and executed. Next generation blockchains like Sei Giga will create types of MEV that are completely new, and poorly understood. Today, we share the first ever paper exploring MEV in next-generation blockchains. Traditional blockchains like Ethereum are secure and decentralized, but they struggle with: By upgrading these, Sei Giga aims to match Web2-like performance while keeping decentralization and security intact. “With +200k TPS, 400-ms finality, and an MEV-resistant architecture, Sei Giga will mark the next quantum leap in how blocks are built,” Jog noted. In other words, Sei Giga isn't just a faster version of Sei, it's a full architectural overhaul aimed at matching the performance of traditional internet applications. “There are essentially two ways Sei Giga achieves this,” Jog explained. This separation between ordering and execution allows Sei to handle vast numbers of transactions in parallel. When asked whether Sei's lightning-fast 400ms finality was already available on the main network, Jog confirmed: That means transactions confirm almost instantly, a massive advantage for financial apps, games, and trading platforms where every millisecond matters. Speed often comes at the cost of complexity, but Sei Giga avoids this trade-off. “The Giga upgrade has been designed to dramatically increase chain performance without increasing hardware requirements for validators,” Jog said. One common issue on blockchains is what happens when multiple users interact with the same smart contract at once. “Transactions requiring access to the same storage slots is an edge case that affects every EVM chain, causing slight performance degradation when it occurs,” he said. Sei Labs is also developing solutions like access lists and native compilation of hot contracts, which could further improve performance, not just for Sei, but for the broader Ethereum ecosystem. That means developers and users alike can expect a smooth transition without needing to rewrite or re-deploy their apps. “Bytecode compatibility is important because it means developers don't need to recompile or re-audit their code.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Bank of Canada has shelved plans for a central bank digital currency, likely under pressure from banking institutions worried about their profit margins.Keito Newman/The Globe and Mail Claude Lavoie is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. Ottawa's new framework for regulating stablecoins has cryptocurrency advocates celebrating. Tetra Digital, a financial services group, plans to launch one early next year. But Ottawa missed a much better opportunity: introducing a central bank digital currency that would make Canada's banking system more inclusive, stable and efficient. Yet the Bank of Canada has shelved plans for a CBDC, likely under pressure from banking institutions worried about their profit margins. Given that nearly 90 per cent of transactions already happen electronically through e-transfers, credit cards and debit cards, why bother with stablecoins? Ottawa's new stablecoin framework a key step toward monetary sovereignty, advocates say Stablecoin transactions don't need to pass through multiple domestic and foreign institutions before settlement, enabling faster processing, lower fees, greater privacy and easier international transfers. By pegging to the Canadian dollar, they avoid the wild volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which has fallen more than 30 per cent in recent months. A private stablecoin's value depends on the issuer's trustworthiness and ability to maintain adequate high-quality reserves. Users must also find someone willing to accept their stablecoin or convert it to traditional currency, which is particularly complex in cross-border transactions. Unlike credit cards and electronic banking, stablecoins offer no fraud detection or consumer protection. As legal tender issued by the Bank of Canada, a CBDC would be accepted anywhere Canadian dollars are currently accepted. BoC's Macklem lays out high-level vision for stablecoin regulation International agreements between central banks would facilitate fast, cheap conversion between countries' CBDCs, simplifying transfers to friends and family in Europe, Japan or elsewhere. Controlling illicit activities would be easier than with private digital currencies. Holding a CBDC would essentially equal holding deposits at the central bank (or at some kind of new national public deposit bank) accessible via card, computer or smartphone. One key factor emerging from these consultations is financial institutions' concerns about a CBDC's impact on their operations. A CBDC would remove incentives for holding money in banks' deposit accounts. Why keep money in accounts that earn virtually no interest – and charge fees – when you could hold it more securely at the central bank with no fees? Banks would lose a stable source of low-cost funding. But if Canadians moved from bank deposits into CBDCs, this would simply level the playing field between banks and other non-deposit-taking financial institutions. Most financial institutions lack access to bank deposits as funding (e.g. First National, Wealthsimple, Manulife) yet operate successfully. Moreover, the Bank of Canada has tools to address any financial stability problems that emerge. The real reasons for resistance are simple: a CBDC would hurt large deposit-taking institutions' bottom lines and would eliminate the market – and profits – for privately issued stablecoins. Although it is worrisome that some people trust private cryptocurrency issuers more than their public institutions, these challenges are manageable. With more than 130 countries exploring central bank digital currencies – many in pilot and development phases – shelving this idea may be a missed opportunity that future generations will regret.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oracle's earnings miss and $80B market cap wipeout show how tightly Bitcoin now tracks AI-driven tech risk, but the policy response to a credit crunch could recreate the liquidity conditions. Reports framed the move as fanning “AI bubble” fears, with investors questioning whether the payoff from building massive data-center capacity is arriving fast enough to justify those costs. The correlation between Bitcoin and Nvidia reached approximately 0.96 over a rolling three-month window leading into Nvidia's November earnings, according to analysis from 24/7 Wall St. This suggests that when tech stocks crash, Bitcoin tanks harder. Reuters reported in late November that AI-linked valuations and macro gauges such as the Buffett Indicator have pushed overall US equity valuations beyond dot-com-era extremes, while AI-heavy indices show sharp pullbacks and rising volatility even as enthusiasm remains high. Besides, big tech companies have raised hundreds of billions of dollars in bonds this year to finance data centers and hardware. Morgan Stanley estimated a funding gap of around $1.5 trillion for the AI infrastructure build-out, and Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi warned that AI-related borrowing now exceeds tech's run-up before the dot-com crash. If the AI bubble bursts, the damage to Bitcoin will go beyond simple correlation, as AI capex increasingly becomes a credit story. Estimates indicated that AI-related data center and infrastructure financing deals jumped from about $15 billion in 2024 to roughly $125 billion in 2025, driven by bond issuance, private credit, and asset-backed securities. Analysts in a Reuters piece compare some of the structures and opacity to pre-2008 patterns and warn of “untested risks” if tenants or cash flows disappoint. Central banks now treat this as a financial-stability problem. The Bank of England's recent stability update explicitly highlights stretched valuations in AI-focused firms. It also warns that a sharp correction in AI-linked equities could threaten broader markets via leveraged players and private-credit exposures. The ECB's November 2025 Financial Stability Review makes a similar point: the AI investment boom is increasingly funded through bond markets and private capital, making it more exposed to swings in risk sentiment and credit spreads. Its $50 billion capex plan for AI data centers, alongside a roughly 45% jump in long-term debt and record credit-default-swap spreads, represents exactly the sort of over-extended balance sheet regulators worry about. If an AI bubble pops, those spreads widen, refinancing costs jump, and leveraged funds that were long AI-themed debt and equities are forced to cut gross exposure. Chinese researchers' analysis of Bitcoin versus global liquidity finds a strong positive relationship between Bitcoin prices and global M2 or broad liquidity indices. Their paper called BTC a “liquidity barometer” that performs well when global liquidity is high and poorly when it contracts. Bitcoin is one of the first things macro and growth funds sell when margin calls come in, and its outsized sensitivity to liquidity makes the drawdown worse. If over-levered AI and credit markets wobble hard enough to threaten growth, central banks will re-ease financial conditions. The IMF's latest Global Financial Stability Report warns that AI-driven equity concentration and stretched risk asset valuations make a “disorderly correction” more likely and stresses the need for careful, but ultimately supportive, monetary policy to avoid amplifying shocks. A recent Seeking Alpha report mapped Bitcoin against global liquidity and the dollar index shows that, once easing starts in earnest and the dollar weakens, BTC tends to put in large upside moves over the following quarters. If AI equities go through a classic post-bubble hangover, with lower multiples, negative headlines, and political backlash over wasted capex, some portion of speculative and macro capital could rotate into a different “future of money” or “anti-system” bet. Recent market stress has already seen capital concentrate back into BTC rather than alts. As liquidity thinned and volatility rose recently, Bitcoin's dominance has climbed to around 57%, with ETFs serving as the institutional on-ramp. Additionally, although Bitcoin has recently shown a correlation with tech stocks, decentralization and scarcity remain the core of the “hedge” narrative. Bitcoin's structural problem is that it cannot decouple from the AI trade in the short term, but it depends on policy responses to an AI bust for its medium-term upside. In the immediate aftermath of an AI credit crunch, Bitcoin bleeds because it is the high-beta tail of macro risk, and global liquidity contracts faster than most assets can adjust. In the months that follow, if central banks respond with renewed easing and the dollar weakens, Bitcoin historically has captured outsized gains as liquidity flows back into risk assets and speculative narratives reset. The answer depends on how violent the AI correction is, how quickly policy pivots, and whether institutional flows through ETFs and other vehicles hold or break under stress. Oracle's Dec. 11 earnings miss is a preview: Bitcoin dropped below $90,000 in the same tape that wiped $80 billion off Oracle's market cap, showing that the correlation is live and the sensitivity is real. Whether it emerges stronger depends on what central banks do next. However, one short term positive indicator revealed itself later in yesterday's trading session. Nvidia recovered 1.5% from its intraday low, while Bitcoin followed suit but gained over 3%, reclaiming $92,000.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthony Scaramucci showed up to Solana Breakpoint in Abu Dhabi wearing a tie — a small act of rebellion in a sea of hoodies — and then proceeded to make a much bigger one on stage: Solana is going to “flip” Ethereum. Not in the Twitter-war, zero-sum, “ETH is dead” kind of way. More like: same league, different growth curve, and Solana ends up with the bigger market cap. “I think it will flip Ethereum, but that doesn't mean Ethereum's going down or anything like that. I think there's going to be market share for Ethereum. This time it came with a prop: his new book, Solana Rising, which dropped Dec. 9 and — according to Scaramucci — quickly hit the top of Amazon's “new releases” list for investment management/investment strategy. The pitch is familiar if you've been anywhere near crypto conferences this year, but Scaramucci's version is unusually blunt: Solana is the fastest-growing chain, it's stacked with activity, it's cheap to use, and it's easy to build on. “Full disclosure,” he said, “I have a large personal holding in Solana. I have it on the firm's balance sheet.” How large? On SkyBridge's balance sheet, he put it at “probably 60%,” with the firm sitting on “north of a nine figure balance sheet.” His personal portfolio allocation, he estimated, is around “6% 7%.” Big, but not “I sold the house for SOL” big. “In fact, who is chain monogamous?” he joked. The Skybridge Capital founder added: “It's not an amorous thing. It just has to do with the realities of investing. It's like owning a lot of stocks in your portfolio. But to me, I just think that it is the fastest growing chain. It's easy to develop on and it's very low fees to transact on and it's got great tokenomics if you want to stake your Solana like I do.” He also pointed to the debut of the first spot Solana ETF in the United States — “first staking ETF,” in his words — as another signal that we're still early. Then came the price talk, because of course it did. Could SOL hit $300–$400 by the end of next year? “Sure,” he said, tying it to a more constructive US regulatory backdrop — specifically his hope that the CLARITY Act gets passed and unlocks “the full utilization of tokenization.” Longer term, he went bigger: “Is Solana go to $1,000 over the next five years? “I've been right about Bitcoin, but I've been wrong about timing,” Scaramucci said, sticking with a $150,000–$200,000 target, and arguing a friendlier rate environment next year could help.
