                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Love Island USA” fan-favorite Chelley Bissainthe is officially single — and she broke the news exclusively on SiriusXM's Page Six Radio on Friday. During an emotional conversation, the Season 7 star revealed for the first time that she and fellow Islander Ace Greene — whom she fell for and coupled up with on the hit Peacock reality dating series — have ended their relationship. “Ace and I actually decided to part ways,” Bissainthe shared, explaining that the choice was far from easy. “It really was a tough decision, like, for the both of us and very hard to decide. So I think we just got to a decision that was best.” Bissainthe, 24, and Greene, 23, became one of the standout couples of Season 7, quickly forming a deep bond that viewers rallied behind. Their chemistry carried them through challenges, recouplings and Casa Amor turbulence — ultimately solidifying them as one of the season's most beloved pairings even after cameras stopped rolling. But behind the scenes, Bissainthe says the pair faced real-world pressures that tested them in ways villa life never did. “[There was] a mutual level of respect and understanding that we wanted this to work. “Couples go through things that are very challenging and sometimes the best thing to do is make a decision that needs to be made.” The reality star explained that the breakup didn't happen overnight — and that both she and Greene were committed to communicating openly before choosing to part ways.

Bissainthe chose not to disclose specifics about what led to the split, saying both she and Greene deserve grace and privacy. I think that we can be peaceful and understand that we're good with being able to be on the same page.” But challenges happen in relationships and sometimes, like I said, you just want to be able to say, ‘You know what, let's leave it right here before it turns into something it never needs to be.' Like, we can leave off with light and love.” Now, the Los Angeles-based beauty says she's embracing a new chapter — one focused entirely on herself. “So I would just love that privacy and be able to focus on myself going forward.” Still, she holds nothing but gratitude for Greene and the time they shared. “We are put on this earth to experience people,” she reflected. This story was featured on a recent episode of Page Six Radio, a daily morning show serving up the hottest celebrity headlines, exclusives, and behind-the-scenes buzz. Catch Danny, Evan and Ian chat with celebrity guests every weekday on SiriusXM from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. As for whether that “next” could include another appearance on “Love Island USA,” Bissainthe laughed. “Maybe if they want me to guest-host or something, I would love that.

Palme d'Or winner Julia Ducournau showed how deftly she could employ genre and metaphor with her first two features, 2016's cannibal-themed “Raw” and the 2021 automotive body horror “Titane.” But based on early reactions, the French filmmaker's third feature, “Alpha,” proved an even higher concept. “Alpha” stars newcomer Mélissa Boros as the film's titular 13-year-old protagonist, who is coming of age in a world plagued by a mysterious blood-borne virus that turns people into hardened, statue-like figures coughing up clay sand. Despite seemingly being aware of the risks, Alpha participates in needle-sharing one night, getting a large “A” tattooed on her arm at a house party where Portishead thumps in the background.

Neon has released the trailer for “Alpha,” which premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival and also stars Emma Mackey, Finnegan Oldfield, and Louai El Amrousy. That quality, however, seems to be by design. In an interview with Vanity Fair back in March, Ducournau said that, upon reflection, she'd been annoyed with herself for staying in her “comfort zone” with her first two films and was looking to tap into something new with her next work. I got bored with it — and annoyed with myself for allowing myself to stay in that comfort zone. “With each film, I'm thinking that I can put myself in a more vulnerable place, in order to relate to the audience more and more,” she added. It's an eternal path: How can I be more sincere? How can I get closer to my emotions? To me, that is the only path. Fans of the French director — who, up until now, has been known for a different sort of body horror — will be able to see her charting a different path when Neon releases “Alpha” in U.S. theaters on March 27, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Television's steamiest Heated Rivalry is just getting started. We can reveal Canadian streamer Crave has greenlighted a second season of LGBTQ+ ice hockey drama, with HBO Max again boarding for rights in the U.S. and Australia and now striking deals with program distributor Sphere Abacus for more territories. The HBO Max agreement is Asia spans Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, Macau, Sri Lanka and Nepal. RELATED: ‘Heated Rivalry's François Arnaud Unpacks Scott's “Cautionary” Rom-Com Episode, Jokes It's “A Different Porn Category” Heated Rivalry, about a pair of top professional hockey players who secretly develop a romantic relationship that lasts over the years, quickly established itself as a flagship show for Crave and has been hailed by several reviewers as among the most significant LGBTQ+ shows on television. We've been tracking it closely since it was announced at the Crave Upfront this year and named it a show to watch at MIPCOM Cannes in October, where Sphere Abacus introduced the show to international buyers. The steamy drama is now Crave's biggest original series on record, growing its viewership by nearly 400% in initial seven-day streams following its debut two weeks ago on Friday, November 28, per mParticle and Amazon Channels internal data. RELATED: ‘Heated Rivalry' Season 1 Release Schedule: Dates When Episodes Premiere On HBO Max The buzz began early, with Heated Rivalry a top three trending topic on X in hockey-mad Canada during its premiere weekend. The final episode is due to drop on Friday, December 26. More international deals are expected soon, as buzz continues even in territories where the show isn't yet available. We understand several buyers in the UK have been chasing Heated Rivalry, with a deal looking imminent. Created by Canadian writer-director-producer Jacob Tierney (Letterkenny, Shoresy) and based on Rachel Reid best-selling book series Game Changers, the six-episode, one-hour romantic drama tells the story of rival hockey players Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie). RELATED: ‘Heated Rivalry': First Look At Crave's Steamy Canadian Ice Hockey Drama They are two of the biggest stars in Major League Hockey, tied together by their ambition, rivalry and a magnetic pull neither of them understands. They begin a secret fling as rookies that morphs into a long journey of love, denial and self-discovery over the next eight years. They're forced to decide if there is room for love in their fiercely competitive world. “Heated Rivalry represents the very best of what Canadian creators can deliver: rich characters, compelling drama and a world audiences want to live in,” said Justin Stockman, VP Content and Programming at Crave parent Bell Media. In a statement, show creator Tierney and executive producer Brendan Brady added: “Watching our show become an international phenomenon has been extraordinary. We're profoundly grateful to everyone that has been on this journey with us. Being renewed for a second season so early is a true honor, and we can't wait to bring you even more of what you love.” The series is distributed internationally by Sphere Abacus, which is owned by Canadian producer Sphere Media and the primary distributor of programming from Bell, which is also a stakeholder in the UK-based company.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kehlani's ‘Folded' reigned over a standout year for R&B Styling by Scot Louie & Marissa Pelly for The Only Agency. his year, Kehlani turned 30 after spending more than a decade flying — and at times flailing — in the public eye as one of R&B's modern torchbearers. The singer-songwriter (who uses she/they pronouns) has mastered a lot in that time. Not too long ago, she took up surfing, a hobby that helped further tether her to her late father and inspired her third studio album, Blue Water Road. She's been a faithful gym rat as of late, too, as evidenced by abs so enviable some onlookers were convinced she had etched them. Then, after a career spanning four studio albums, four mixtapes, and five Grammy nominations, she found the perfect balance of nostalgia and innovation in “Folded” — an addictive song on romantic reconciliation that became her highest charting hit. It's earned her two more nominations at the 2026 Grammys. Both categories — Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance — are packed with excellent music, representing a banner year for the genre she's been a faithful student of her whole life. In the Best R&B Performance race, in particular, the singer is up against two good friends — Justin Bieber, for “Yukon,” and Leon Thomas, for his rendition of “Mutt” on NPR's Tiny Desk. Those are my family members.” When Kehlani was new to Los Angeles from Oakland and dropping songs on SoundCloud, Thomas was one half of the formidable production duo the Rascals alongside Khris Riddick-Tynes. Today, Riddick-Tynes is executive producing the forthcoming album Kehlani's hard at work on and was part of the team that brought “Folded” to life. “My first sessions in L.A. were with them,” she says of the duo. “I've been working with Leon and Khris since the beginning of time. Leon is secretly doing background vocals on a lot of my music. He texted us that morning and was like ‘My Grammy Award-nominated family!' The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time It's undeniably been a song for the real vocalists — think Whitney Houston's canonical bite in telling an interviewer, “I listen to singers.… I very rarely listen to people who cannot sing,” and citing greats like Anita Baker and Luther Vandross. “Folded” exploded, in part, as netizens across social media tried their hand at covers. Slowly but surely, R&B veterans joined in. First, there was Mario, of “Let Me Love You” fame, in August. Then, Brandy — often called the “Vocal Bible” by other singers and who Kehlani has fiercely defended as one of the genre's most seminal voices — shared a cover with runs stacked to the high heavens in September. Later that month, all five artists, plus Ne-Yo, appeared on an official EP of “Folded” remixes. It shows how difficult a song like “Folded” is to body, even for Kehlani and especially live. A seasoned stage performer, the only vocal tracks she uses are background parts and dance breaks. “It's traveling through a lot of my range. When I ask Kehlani what most prepared her for the monster of a song, her answer veers slightly from the heuristic. “There's an actual technical factor, and then there's a super spiritual factor that's happening in my life.” As for the latter: “I don't think at any point in my career I was ready to hold the level of pressure and success that I have right now. The way that this song is changing my realm and my world and my trajectory, I don't think that I could have held it any other time. I'm spiritually grounded enough to be given a task like this or a season like this,' to be honest.” Listen to Kehlani's EP of ‘Folded' Remixes by Brandy, Toni Braxton, JoJo, and More Cardi B Is Back and Out For Blood on ‘Am I the Drama?' These New York City Lawmakers Want Kehlani and Noname's Shows Uncanceled Released in June, “Folded” came as Kehlani was finally finding some peace living with bipolar II disorder, which she shared publicly in April, on her birthday. After months of struggling to find a psychiatrist accepting clients, she says, “I got diagnosed mid-crisis. Kehlani has been outspoken against the Israeli government since it began retaliating against Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped 251 hostages. The death toll in Gaza now tops 70,000. Kehlani, a United Nations commission, and the International Association of Genocide Scholars say Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians. Israel's Foreign Ministry has rejected that assertion, specifically calling a report commissioned by the United Nations' Human Rights Council “distorted and false.” The star has since been joined in her outcry by hundreds of musicians and labels who have supported initiatives like No Music for Genocide, including Hayley Williams, Japanese Breakfast, Muna, Clairo, Lucy Dacus, Nao, Faye Webster, MIKE, redveil, and more. Yet, back in October 2023, via Instagram, Kehlani broadly criticized her peers for being unengaged. The psychiatric episodes, she says, heightened her very real anger and made her less strategic than she's learned to be since. “I'm just as mind-blown that people can sit around and be silent about this,” she tells me now. While many fans commended Kehlani's advocacy, the backlash was swift and harsh elsewhere. In the spring, Cornell University's president canceled a concert she was set to play, citing Kehlani's “antisemitic, anti-Israel sentiments in performances, videos, and on social media.” She rebuked the notion that she was antisemitic, saying at the time, “I am anti-genocide, I am anti the actions of the Israeli government, I am anti an extermination of an entire people, I'm anti the bombing of innocent children, men women … that's what I'm anti.” Then, under pressure from New York City mayor Eric Adam's office, the popular SummerStage concert series canceled her appearance set to celebrate Pride. Today, Kehlani says, she couldn't even count the total number of paid opportunities she's lost: “It was coming from every angle.” This says nothing of the “massive amounts of death threats” the singer says she's received. Yet, for Kehlani — who has been no stranger to condemnation in the past, for everything from her love life to her tattoos — the most consequential controversy of her career has overlapped with the height of her mainstream success. “I also think that it was necessary because I think that it's imperative that people see me thrive after this, so that they can know that they can speak and they can stand up for things they believe in, in light of being told their career will end because of it.” All this thriving means Kehlani is working through Thanksgiving. She typically doesn't commemorate the actual holiday, she says, but had a “Soulful Sunday” with friends that week. Her daughter Adeya appears off camera the moment Kehlani details that her routines these days revolve around the first-grader, of whom she has full custody after a legal battle with Adeya's father. She's hosting some of Adeya's pals for the break from school. “She doesn't have a clue if anything is going on with me.”) Tomorrow, though, she's set to finalize the vocals for her album. And today, after our call, she has to run and meet the Usher to finalize their song on the LP (more on that below, too). “I really just homed in on making records,” says Kehlani. “If I think of the difference between bops, little songs here and there — records were things that took time and took effort from multiple people and took thinking of each individual song as a piece of art, versus I just came and doodled the song and spit it out and put it out, which I did for a long time. I'm not saying that there were a million, trillion steps or people involved in it, but I'm saying we treated these songs with the same amount of care.” Here, Kehlani goes deep on making an album indebted to classic R&B, the genre's recent queer awakening, what ethical fandom looks like, and how she's learned to live with bipolar disorder. What is the latter an acronym for?That's borderline personality disorder. But honestly, I need to get diagnosed by at least two more people because I think that BPD might be misdiagnosed. I might just be in some sort of remission for the BPD, but I've been episode-free and kooky-free for almost a year now. The episodes don't necessarily go away, but you can apply thought to them and you can acknowledge when they're happening, like, “Oh, OK, I woke up this morning feeling like a superhero and I need to do 872 things and maybe leave the country and maybe rethink my life. I must be manic.” Or you're like, “Everybody hates me. I must be in a low.” You can go into these parameters of “Here's my steps, here's all the options I can choose to help myself through this right now.” I've been just in that world for the last year, and it's been really nice. What did that look like for you pre-diagnosis, and how did it affect your career?What's interesting is I got diagnosed mid-crisis. Actually year one of the genocide, I'm sitting online having full-blown screaming fests with the phone, and I chop all my hair off. [The tattoo artist] finishes one leg apparently, and she's like, “OK, I'm done.” And apparently I was like, “Just keep going,” but through an entire bottle of tequila. Leaving my house was difficult, thinking everybody is out to get me. All the while, people are having very real conversations with me about my activism: “This is what can happen to your career and this is what can happen to you as a person and your safety.” I also was receiving massive amounts of death threats. So pairing all of the very real issues like that with a disorder like this, I flew off the handles. I had been asking for a psychiatrist for six months, and every single person wasn't taking clients. I think there's been a lot of moments that people may have not noticed as an expression of my bipolar disorder. It looks like, on paper, you're having your most successful year ever while bravely saying that there has been a genocide happening. How do you hold all of that? Before I got medicated, I sat down at lunch with my friend who's also medicated, [and they were] like, “Oh, just so you know, by day two, three on medication, you're going to wake up and look around and want to change everything. You're going to get ideas, new ideas about your regimen, just take your time with it.” Literally on day three, I was like, “Oh, I was tweaking.” I also have a hard time calling this brave in general. I think [in mania], you get hyper-confident. I'm just as mind-blown that people can sit around and be silent about this. I'm not an organizer, but something I really learned in the last year and two years of moving through all of this and having really patient people teach me is their strategy, the way that they call people in and teach people. Can you give me an example of an encounter or a conversation that felt more aligned with these principles of organizing that you've learned, versus what felt a little more crash-out-y to you?Like Aja Monet — incredible person, incredible poet, incredible activist — hosted a bunch of us who were all aligned on this topic at her house. Artists, organizers, just people who needed a place to sit and imagine what a new world would look like. “How can we call more people in? Is there any information you're maybe lacking on this subject? Let's talk about the history of it.” I'm sitting in the living room with people who have actually been to Palestine, who have been going back and forth to Palestine since maybe I was even in middle school. Now, you have to take step two, and realize that this is a really long battle.” It's a really long fight. Even post ceasefire, the journey to the entirety of freeing Palestine itself is going to be a really long battle and you have to have some type of self-preservation so you don't burn out. I think if everybody that was passionate was equipped with these thoughts and these processes, things would go differently. But then the crash-out is that I put everybody that worked for me in a group chat and was like, “If you don't fucking say something, you're fired.” Does it come from a great place? Versus [asking], “How can I sit my team down and call them in and say, ‘Hey, you guys may have valid fears about speaking about this. Or you may feel like you don't actually know what's going on'?” Am I here to pacify that? Just all of these more thoughtful processes. That's honestly why I'm so consistent with my art. I'm going to post about the song. I'm not afraid to talk to my fans and be in conversation with them because you can't disrupt that. That's just where I've given my focus after the fact. Are you reassured that if you continue to build that relationship that you can keep your life intact?I mean, these are some people that I have had to pass out my physical copy of my CD to when I was 19. A lot of people have their opinions and you're not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but I think that people that really can grasp me as a whole human, they love me in a different way, and I definitely attribute [that to] my ability to keep floating and keep thriving too. My interactions with them aren't ever normal. Have you spoken to your biological mom?” They care about me as a person. What does responsible, respectful fandom actually look like to you? I just base it off of “In a perfect world, what do I wish being a fan of someone would look like? In a perfect world, what do the boundaries of still being a person that's ever-changing and growing just like everyone else look like? How would I want to be received?” I've had to correct my fan base a lot over the years. I remember when I first came out [as queer] and they were being awful to the men that were also my fans. Then I had to correct the men from being weird and gross. I've had to [deal with] a lot of them being weird to any partner they've seen me with. I'm like, “Yo, bro, I get that you have a fixation on me, but you can't be awful to the person that I've chosen to share with you.” Also, half the time, I've only chosen to share this with people because I'm tired of sneaking around. It's not a fun feeling in love to know you're going on a date and then you walk into a restaurant and everybody's like [mimics someone recording her on their phone beneath an imaginary table], or you just had a couple drinks with the person that you love and you stumbled out of a club and now there's some video that everybody's like, “Gotcha, bitch!” Also, being aware that you're not going to be able to ever be in control of the reception. But as far as my ethical fan base goes, I think it's guiding them when I can, correcting them when I can, not letting them bully other people or other artists, other fan bases. To your point of not wanting to sneak around, I'm a huge Kwn fan [the British, lesbian R&B singer with whom Kehlani has collaborated and starred on social media]. The public has seen that you guys have some sort of relationship — I don't know what kind, that's your business. I'm interested in how you reconcile those moments where you want to be more private in love — platonic or not — with the moments that you don't want to hide.I'm just going to speak broadly. And just like any other girl, any normal person gets excited about anyone and wants to be able to have those moments where they're like, “I'm proud of them,” or, “I care about them, and I want to share,” I don't think celebrities are exempt from that. It's a very strange feeling to come home and be like, “Oh, my God, so-and-so, did we get caught?” That's not pertaining to any relationship I've ever been in or any relationship I ever will be in or am in or not. It's just a rule of thumb that it's damned if you do, damned if you don't, in my position. I am just learning and loving in front of everyone. There are two things happening in R&B that I'm really excited about. How do you make music and videos that are an homage to a previous era without cosplaying it?Everything that I'm doing is because it includes the ingredients and the recipe of [an] era. I think most of my [music] has been alternative R&B, but I said I really wanted to make [music that] has the recipe of classic R&B. I think that there's a thin line between the cosplay-homage thing and this [thing] that has the ingredients. If you can name eight people when you're looking at my video or listening to my song and say, “OK, so I'm seeing Aaliyah, Janet, Usher, hearing Brandy, seeing Omarion” all at the same time, it just means that I'm doing justice to the era and I'm doing justice to the genre. I saw you were recording with producer and artist Ryan Leslie. Is whatever you guys worked on going to be on this album?Me, Ryan Leslie, and James Fauntleroy have a song that I think is dope. What is the vibe of that song?It's very James-y. What does James-y mean to you?James has this incredible way of writing these whimsical melodies with these dirty, edgy lyrics that tell stories and paint a picture, but vocally, it's like there's so much traveling in it. I think he has such a sonic thing. You'll press play on a song and be like, “Oh, you went to the school of James Fauntleroy.” Just like I can hear so much Frank [Ocean] in a lot of the new generations, they're not realizing that even a lot of Frank-y stuff is James-y stuff. You can just really hear the schools that people graduated from in their music. I don't like when people say that's a bad thing. I think that these conversations were also had in the Nineties. They were also paying homage to what came before them, and also being disruptive at the same time. Is that going to be on this album?Yeah, that's going to be on this. I actually have to go after this interview and finish the final vocals with him. Did you guys make the bulk of this song in person?No, actually, we've been going back and forth multiple times to get the song right. It's just trying to find the right song. But honestly, I just really appreciated how much of a person he's been to me. I had a show in Atlanta where my voice was completely gone when I got there because I was shooting a video until the late wee hours outside. Quick aside, I don't want you to lose your story, but why did that get stopped?Too many variables. Everything was just seeming to go wrong, and we were missing a lot of footage and a lot didn't get shot, and it was just like, “Damn.” I got sick. I was actually outside in the middle of downtown L.A. I got sick as hell, and so when I got to Atlanta, I put on my [Instagram] story or on my notes “I'm so sick,” and he somehow saw that and called me and was like, “I'm about to bring you everything, and I'm about to put you on with my voice coach.” This man came to my hotel room, did vocal lessons with me, brought me 72 million remedies, and literally brought my voice back. I was only able to do One Music Fest because Usher Raymond saved my guts. Who are the other dream collaborators you got to work with on this album?Oh, man, so many. I cut a song from Johntá Austin. I did Jermaine Dupri and Brian Michael Cox. Man, that was one of the coolest moments of my life, and it's probably my favorite song on the album. What are you most excited about in bringing this album to life?Honestly, I just want people to have an experience. I want people to just love singing and dancing again. It's such a personal moment for me right now to be proving myself. I feel so personally just motivated to rewrite my story, and I hope that trickles into the experience that people have. What is the log line of the story that's being rewritten?I contributed a lot to R&B in the last 10 years, and I think it gets overlooked. I'm one of the few that are still remaining from my coming-out time [as an artist], and I think that's important. You've been nominated for Best R&B Song at the Grammys back to back, last year for “After Hours.” How do you compare the experience?Last year, I was genuinely shocked. I'm going back to sleep.” I woke up to seven missed calls and eight texts, and he was like, “They clearly worried about you. Wake up.” And I was like, “What the fuck?” Especially because “After Hours” and Crash in general had gotten such a polarizing reception. This year everybody, from week five of “Folded” coming out, was like, “You're getting a nomination.” So I had this opposite pressure, like, if we don't get nominated after everybody's saying this, then all I'm going to have to hear for the next months is how I was snubbed. I don't need that sitting on my back. I just need to be focused on creating, honestly. How would your ideal Grammy week look? I honestly just want to be not-anxious. I want to be feeling very settled. I want to spend time with my family. I want to wear a matching outfit with Destin [Conrad, nominated for Best Progressive R&B album for Love on Digital, which features Kehlani]. That's really what I want to do. I think most importantly, I just want to be sitting in gratitude that week and that day. I don't want any other feelings. I don't really have those feelings. You mentioned Destin; Durand Benarr earned three grammy nominations as well. It really feels like we're in a special moment for queer R&B between you guys and others, similar to the sapphic moment in pop last year. I think that it was very taboo in the beginning for people to be able to use the pronouns they actually talk to in the actual songs that they sing. I don't know how to say anything that isn't obvious, like duh, people that are growing up need to be able to have their sexuality represented. It's a trip to be able to watch VH1's Behind the Music from old-ass shit and see how many people were in the closet. You hear these industry stories about how so-and-so was a little queer, and now we just don't have to do that. It's beautiful, and I consider us lucky. Do you think that it could have broken through like this if it wasn't?Honestly, I don't know. So many people who are new to me because of “Folded” think its about a man to the point where they got mad at me in the video because I wasn't having a man pick up his clothes from my house. If I would've did a video where I would've been having a woman come pick up her clothes and [been] kissing on a girl, they would've been mad regardless. [There are] songs that I want people to, when they're singing the song, either feel like they are me in the song or feel like I am talking directly to them. Taylor Swift's Last Album Sparked Bizarre Accusations of Nazism. Raul Malo, Golden-Voiced ‘Maestro' of the Mavericks, Dead at 60 So the pronouns are mostly like “me” and “you”? All these songs we wrote with that perspective. Is there anything that we didn't talk about that you would like to, especially with the album coming out?I just want to drill the point home that this was just my time to go this route and hit the nail on the head in a conscious choice to break through this ceiling that I've been [under] for a while. I think it took a lot of polarization in my art. Going this direction doesn't mean this is the direction for the rest of my life either. I'm just glad that people are receiving it right now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The podcaster noted that her husband Jason's silence during Trav's comments said it all. Well, every couple except Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, apparently. A week after the Kansas City Chiefs tight end claimed on his New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce that he and Swift have “never once” fought in their two and a half years together, Jason's wife, Kylie, has weighed in. During Thursday's (Dec. 11) episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, Kylie responded to fan questions about how she feels about her soon to be sister-in-law's apparently argument-free relationship. “Notice how my husband was oddly quiet during this segment,” Kylie said. “He did ask a couple of clarifying questions. But for the most part, his ass knew that he could not say that after almost eight years married… We absolutely argue.” Gorillaz Prepare to Climb 'The Mountain' With New Cut 'Damascus': Stream It Now 'Zootopia 2' Soundtrack Roars Into Top 10 on Kid Albums Chart 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' Skates Back to Top 10 on Billboard 200 After spilling the truth, Kylie — who shares four daughters with the retired NFL great — clarified that the couple don't argue that often, “but we've definitely argued, for sure.” She then tried to parse whether Travis and that episode's guest, George Clooney, were talking argument or, like, argument argument. “To be fair, I'm not a yelling arguer. So the arguments in our house, they're not a yelling situation,” Kylie said. Travis' comments came after Clooney said he'd never clashed with his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, in the 10 years they've been a couple. I would be right behind her like, ‘Yeah.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The footage includes Combs launching into a tirade against former Danity Kane and Diddy-Dirty Money artist Dawn Richard after learning of her sexual harassment lawsuit against him and strategizing with his attorneys days before his September 2024 arrest. “We have to find somebody that'll work with us,” Combs says in the footage. “That has dealt in the dirtiest of dirty business. Asked how he got the footage, executive producer Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson declined to answer, explaining, “I figured most journalists would not disclose their sources.” (Side note: Some federal appellate judges could learn a thing or two about journalist-source confidentiality from Jackson.) In any event, series director Alexandra Stapleton says her team obtained the footage lawfully. Assuming Stapleton is telling the truth, Combs' argument that Netflix is responsible for her source's alleged misconduct shouldn't fare well. Combs, of course, thinks the rules don't apply to him — hence his current address in federal prison. And he's got a history of trying to erase incriminating footage, like the hotel surveillance video of him beating then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura that he allegedly bribed security guards to bury. But the same reasoning that protected a Pennsylvania radio host reporting on illegally recorded conversations about school union negotiations in the Bartnicki case also protects streaming giants airing docuseries about alleged predatory celebrities. Unless Netflix hacked Combs' computer, broke into his home, or otherwise stole the footage, the Supreme Court says Combs, to quote his debut album title, has “no way out.” Combs' legal team may think that's “unfair,” given that he didn't intend for the footage to go public. (For similar reasons, any copyright claim Combs could bring against Netflix should fail under the “fair use” doctrine allowing excerpts of copyrightable materials to be used for journalism and commentary, among other purposes.) Some of the most consequential reporting in history relied on records unlawfully obtained by others. It argued the documents threatened national security — a theory the court rightly rejected as far too speculative to justify a “prior restraint” on publication. How Did 50 Cent Get That Sean Combs Footage? Sean Combs' Mother Slams ‘Inaccuracies' in ‘Reckoning' Doc, Calls Abusive Parent Claims ‘Untrue' 's Funeral Back to Rapper's Estate, Bad Boy Co-Founder Says Aubrey O'Day Shares Explicit Sean Combs Email in New Doc Years later, even Nixon officials admitted the government was never really concerned about national security, just embarrassment and reputational harm. In other words, his arguments are so flimsy that even the Nixon administration knew better than to rely on them. But the Pentagon Papers case was over 50 years ago, and Bartnicki is already older than many of Combs' alleged victims were when he met them. The once-ironclad principle that journalists can publish documents stolen by their sources is under unprecedented attack. In response, the department launched a secret criminal investigation of Lau for “knowingly receiving stolen property.” Lau is now suing, and rightly so. The Biden administration's prosecutors went after right-wing outlet Project Veritas for possessing and transporting Ashley Biden's diary, which it purchased from someone who stole it. The Trump administration dropped that case, but its reasons appear to have been political, not constitutional. It's currently pursuing charges against Daniel “Des” Sanchez for transporting anarchist literature, claiming he was concealing evidence that would incriminate his wife, who had attended a protest at which a police officer was shot. There's no evidence his wife had anything to do with the shooting, though, and possession of literature isn't incriminating. It's against this backdrop that the Trump administration threatens to do what was once unthinkable — prosecute reporters for obtaining and reporting leaks. But the Biden administration's extraction of a guilty plea from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (in a case initiated by the first Trump administration) for obtaining and publishing documents from sources opened the door to similar theories against more conventional journalists. As Rolling Stone reported in June, Trump is eager to barge through that door. His Pentagon's ridiculous requirement for journalists to pledge not to publish “unauthorized” information — even if they obtain it lawfully from willing sources — makes clear how the administration sees the press's role. How Did 50 Cent Get That Sean Combs Footage? Taylor Swift's Last Album Sparked Bizarre Accusations of Nazism. That's why it's so important that the courts don't allow those with the “Benjamins” — whether Combs or his former “good friend,” Trump — to chip away at Bartnicki's principles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are few bigger names in horror filmmaking than John Carpenter, and for good reason: from Illinois suburbs to Antarctic research bases, his films can make just about any place or premise instill dread, tension, and often disgust (ie, that part in The Thing where Copper gets his arms bitten off as he very unsuccessfully delivers CPR). Beyond his career in filmmaking, Carpenter has also expressed an interest in video games, and while this has mostly been limited to admiration from afar, he's contributed to soundtracks and consulted on games like F.E.A.R. Carpenter is credited as both the game's writer and composer. So this begs the question: just how much John Carpenter is in here? The short answer is that outside of its synth-laden soundtrack and pulpy action-horror premise, not much. At least through the first few hours of Toxic Commando (which we went hands-on with via a preview), the game works as a great reminder for how auteur theory mostly doesn't apply to bigger-budget video games. The complex, interdisciplinary process of making one (alongside other factors like large budgets that discourage creative risks) ultimately makes it unlikely that one person can single-handedly guide the creative process from the director's chair. And while this FPS has a few distinguishing elements in its own right that slightly separate it from the many other four-person co-op games about blasting zombies, Carpenter's singular direction isn't one of them—honestly, how could it be in this kind of online-focused affair where the expectation is that you'll be bantering with buddies instead of paying attention to dialogue and cutscenes? Before long, they find out why this area was sealed off when they're suddenly accosted by waves of shrieking former humans infected by a black goo. They hold them off for a bit, but ultimately come down with this plague and are given a week to live, tops. All of that sounds perfectly Carpenter, whether it's commandos being deployed into a walled-off nightmare zone to complete a job (Escape from New York), human-consuming organisms (The Thing), or critiques of callous corporate elites (They Live), but the reality is that this serviceable spin on a Left 4 Dead-style co-op shooter doesn't quite bring enough new to the table to entirely stand out. It's pretty standard stuff, but thankfully, there are a few differences from Valve's influential duology and its imitators. Another major distinction from most other zombie shooters is that this one truly, genuinely loves trucks. Then you're encouraged to pilot this bad boy through crowds of bodies, some of which will dive onto the windshield or grab hold of a door until you're able to give them a good shake (or a double tap). The levels are designed around these vehicles, whether it's navigating the elements, like thick mud that puts engines to the test, or how you need to chart pit stops for resources like gasoline and bullets to keep your ride running. These vehicles have a solid weight to them, and the way they interact with environmental obstacles like thick muck, uphill slopes, and, most of all, freaky undead monsters adds a physical, tactile quality to being behind the wheel. Making good use of these vehicles is particularly important because if you don't, it's easy to become overwhelmed: another area where Toxic Commandos goes a bit past the co-op shooters of yesteryear is that new tech lets it throw even more zombies at you at once. In the opening setpiece, you drive through a sea of undead, as untold thousands of bodies churn in the background before trickling into an abyss like a putrid waterfall. While this segment slightly oversells how many attackers you'll be dealing with during dedicated gameplay sections, even outside of this showy intro, there are times when there will be an uncomfortable number of creepy guys running at you full tilt. Related to this, the highlight of the entire preview was a defense mission that involved holding out against a seemingly endless assault, as the sheer volume of these foes inevitably results in some slipping through the cracks and piling up on the bolted doors you're supposed to be protecting—the scale can be quite impressive, and it's helped by mechanics, like the ability to set up barbed wire and electric traps ahead of time, that make this feel like a last stand. But while a few aspects here are at least slightly different than its predecessors, the game still can't quite escape a fundamental sense of déjà vu. The weapons you choose from are a variety of barely distinguishable assault rifles that would feel at home in any given military shooter (granted, these aren't real ones licensed from gun manufacturers that intentionally or not advertise AR-15s to teenagers, so that's an improvement). At least so far in the preview, there weren't any wacky contraptions that would feel fittingly pulpy for a game with both “John Carpenter” and “Toxic Commando” in the title. And while the script was apparently written by Carpenter, it feels barely distinguishable from any number of multiplayer-focused action games with forgettable characters and only the thinnest possible pretense to get out and start blasting, something not helped by unremarkable cutscene direction. To be specific, it takes a strangely long time for your character to aim down the sights—Call of Duty may be jingoistic propaganda, but damn, the original Modern Warfare really changed this genre forever with its absurdly snappy aiming. The feedback on weapons feels decent (as in, it's satisfying when zombie heads blow up like watermelons), and there's a real tension as your bullets fail to break the next incoming wave, but hopefully, this area improves before the game launches next year. Regardless, it's easy to imagine at least a few Carpenter-heads will be disappointed that this game isn't something a bit more in his wheelhouse: a survival horror title, an Until Dawn-style choose-your-own-adventure, or really any form of exclusively single-player experience that could build some real ambiance (you can play this one solo, but it's abundantly clear it's meant for co-op). I'm sure just as many have grown cynical about X person's name being on a thing, but considering Carpenter's name is in the credits, it's not unreasonable to have expected a bit more of his style. Judged (perhaps more fairly) by its own merits, the game is a competent enough cooperative zombie shooter with a few unique hooks, like your magic sludge powers and (more literally) your big dumb truck's hook-harpoon gun. Unfortunately, like its B-movie premise, Toxic Commando seems like the kind of game that may have been best saved for a Blockbuster rental.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jon Bernthal and Tessa Thompson try to uncover the truth in the new trailer for Netflix‘s psychological thriller, His & Hers. Released on Thursday, the upcoming six-episode limited series sees Detective Jack Harper (Bernthal) and Anna (Thompson) investigate a murder — but also accuse each other of murder. Additional castmembers include Pablo Schreiber, Crystal Fox, Sunita Mani, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Marin Ireland and Poppy Liu. Anna responds, “I didn't do it, if that's what you're asking.” Here's What You Really Need to Know About the Disney-OpenAI Deal Anna later says, “There are two sides to every story. Here is the official synopsis: “Set in the sweltering heat of Atlanta, Anna lives in haunting reclusivity, fading away from her friends and career as a news anchor. But when she overhears about a murder in Dahlonega — the sleepy town where she grew up — Anna is snapped back to life, pouncing on the case and searching for answers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chef Gordon Ramsay has partnered with Dr. Dre and Stewart's bestie, Snoop Dogg, on a new HexClad cocktail shaker developed with the rappers' Still G.I.N. Ramsay started the year collaborating with Pete Davidson on a HexClad Super Bowl ad. In the ad, Ramsay raps along to “Gin and Juice,” the hit Dre produced for Snoop's 1993 debut album, “Doggystyle.” Laid back,” Ramsay raps in his British accent. Everyone was cracking up, especially Dr. Dre,” a source said of the British chef's rapping skills. Insiders revealed Dre and Ramsay met at a private Holmby Hills estate the night before the shoot, and bonded over swimming? “It was their first time meeting in person and Ramsay brought Dre smart goggles to track his laps,” a source told Page Six. In exchange, Dre gifted Ramsay's daughter a signed copy of his debut album “The Chronic.” (Coincidentally, Ramsay opened his first restaurant within a year of the album's release). Snoop is heard, but not seen in their new promo.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here's something to consider: All we ever really know about television characters is what their creators choose to show and tell us. So maybe it's not fair of us to make snooty judgments about the choices they make—even though it's only natural to do so. In Pluribus, for example, we know a little bit about Carol Sturka's tough childhood; but we also know that, as a successful author, she's led a life of relative privilege. Conversely, we know almost nothing about Manousos Oviedo, except for where he's from (Paraguay), what he did for a living (storage-unit manager), and his general attitude toward the alien takeover of humanity (extremely hostile). It's fair to say that we are being led to assume that Carol has had an easier ride in life—and in her post-apocalypse—than Manousos has. I only know what I've been shown and told, which is just enough to find the contrast between their experiences incredibly funny—at least as they're presented in this week's perfectly titled episode, “The Gap.” It's funny, that is, until—inevitably—a gloom descends. Manousos repeats phrases in English that he's heard on language-lesson tapes. Otherwise, their stories are told almost entirely in images. That stretch of land is infamously impassable. In what amounts to an extended montage, we see him driving up through picturesque South America, siphoning gas along the way (and always leaving money behind to pay for it) and trying to ignore the occasional smiling hive-mind pods. He talks only to one guy, who is trying to warn him away from crossing the Darién, offering instead to transport him—and his car—to New Mexico quickly and safely. He considers them all to be thieves. But, unsurprisingly, he eventually loses his footing on a loose rock, before falling backward into a spiky, bacteria-laden chunga palm. The Joined have to send in a rescue helicopter. We get a real sense of how long and how arduous this journey is for someone who stridently refuses the collective's help. Watching Manousos do his thing for the 20 or so minutes he's onscreen this week is like watching a gripping survival drama compressed into a mini-epic. Because Vince Gilligan has never been big on cutting restlessly back and forth between storylines and characters, the Manousos sequence is seen in full, flanked by two Carol sequences. In the first, beginning on Day 12, Carol drives back from Vegas and starts taking a new approach to bossing around the Joined—not desperately or indignantly, but instead kind of snottily. She goes on golf outings, visits a hot-springs resort, tours the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, and demands gourmet meals. She never sees the collective, who still steer well clear of her. But they're definitely helping to facilitate her self-indulgent spree. She calls for a Gatorade (“the red kind… ice cold… real sugar”) and scratches off some lottery tickets while waiting for the telltale buzz of the delivery drone. She then calls back to complain that the Gatorade's “tepid.” The other endures a disappointing sports drink. After the Manousos sequence, we return to Carol on Day 48. Initially, she seems to be living the same life of solitary slackerhood. Before, we saw her drinking beer and setting off fireworks. She's still doing all of that, and still working on her golf swing, too, rocketing balls from downtown rooftops into office building windows. (The wanton destruction, I have to admit, looks very cool.) But in the gap—the gap!—in Carol's life immediately post-Vegas and 36 days later, something has changed. She's stopped singing, instead relying on a boom box and mix CDs for her soundtrack. In a scene legitimately as alarming as Manousos's chunga wound, Carol notices that one of her firework tubes has toppled in such a way that it's pointed directly at her. But the incident seems to jar something within Carol. The next day she picks up a bucket of paint and writes “come back” in big white letters on her cul-de-sac's pavement. This sets up the moving conclusion to a wild episode, as Zosia drives up to Carol's house and Carol collapses into her arms, sobbing. What struck me about this ending is how it turns the usually fun Pluribus game of “think along with Carol” on its head. It's hard to know what's going through her mind as she heads off to the hardware store. And because we don't see her painted message until the very end, it's hard to predict what she's going to do when Zosia arrives. I keep thinking about the O'Keeffe painting, Bella Donna, that Carol takes from the museum to replace the poster she has on her wall of that same piece. While she waits for Zosia, we see her staring at Bella Donna impassively. It's easy to imagine her returning to that painting, day after day, using it as a kind of tether as the weight of loneliness begins to tug at her sanity. Noel Murray is a contributor to The A.V.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One year after taking one final bow on the Eras tour stage, Taylor Swift is pulling the curtain back. And while The End of an Era could have existed as pure fan service — and that is certainly an aspect of the opening episodes, with slow-motion shots of an unstoppable Swift and adoring supporters — the heart of the series is a documentation of singular pop spectacle, unpacking the personalities behind the tour and how they came together to producer something so massive. Just as there were no half-measures in the three-hour-plus show, Swift does not hold back in The End of an Era, and you finish each episode with a greater understanding of her intent. The Eras tour will forever be a special experience for countless attendees, and The End of an Era honors that indispensability — while also tossing out new tidbits that even the super-fans will appreciate. That inspiration is common knowledge among fans, but the footage of Swift hatching the first Eras ideas — beat by beat, moment by moment, unpacking her approach to a crew of future tour mates — is fresh, and thrilling to witness. Yet The End of an Era also digs deep into their pathways toward the biggest stage show of their lives, with their backstories — from the bassist who's been alongside Swift since her teens, to the fan-favorite dancer who was always told ‘no' until Swift told him ‘absolutely' — providing levity at some points, and producing tears at others. The first two episodes of the docuseries features one guest star each, which we won't spoil here — and their appearances are not treated as an enviable co-sign by Swift on her biggest stage yet, but as a means of support, elevating the tour's artistic value and contributing to its overall vision. Aside from the onstage fireworks, the behind-the-scenes interactions between Swift and her fellow artists are gentle and authentic, with A-list personalities rendered as old friends bouncing ideas off of each other. If you're a pop nerd, with a curiosity for how something with the scale of the Eras Tour is orchestrated, the docuseries illustrates several elaborate processes that help a mega-tour come together (and evolve) seamlessly. From on-the-fly staging ideas to custom choreography to top-secret rehearsal requirements to stripped-down vocal arrangements, The End of an Era painstakingly explains how it all comes together, and some of the best moments of the first two episodes play out like a step-by-step guide to something that's never been accomplished before. Yes, we get to hear some conversations between Swift and Travis Kelce. More than anything, though, those moments ground Swift in the middle of a whirlwind, a larger-than-life idol for millions of concertgoers with the same hopes, fears, need for reassurance and desire to revel in good news as the rest of us.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Palestine benefit single from an ensemble including Brian Eno, Neneh Cherry, and Nadine Shah is out today. Credited to Together for Palestine—the British-based operation that put on a major benefit concert in September—“Lullaby” is a cover of the traditional Palestinian song “Yamma Mweel El Hawa,” which Peter Gabriel has adapted from an English translation. Upon the song's announcement, Eno said in a press release that they were aiming for the United Kingdom's coveted No. “After a year defined by unimaginable loss, grief and injustice, we want to end with an act of love for Palestine's children,” he said. 1—and turning that moment into vital life-saving support for Gaza's families.” Barghouti added, “This lullaby from our Palestinian musical heritage has been with me since early childhood. Today, it returns at a much-needed time as a reminder of what Palestinians will never lose: hope, defiance, beauty, and dignity.” Kieran Brunt, Benji B, and Henri Davies produced “Lullaby,” which also features Amena, Lana Lubany, Leigh-Anne, London Community Gospel Choir, Sura Abdo, Tyson, Yasmeen Ayyashi, and Ysee.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“If we want the public to trust what they see, we must have guardrails on digital replicas and synthetic creations,” said SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. Kathy Hochul signed two bills Thursday to boost AI transparency in the film industry. Kathy Hochul described these as “first in the nation” policies and committed to continuing protecting performers. Here's What You Really Need to Know About the Disney-OpenAI Deal The Future of Hollywood Is Arriving Faster Than Ever “We will have responsible AI policies in the state of New York,” Hochul said at a press conference at the SAG-AFTRA offices in New York City Thursday. “It's a time where we do want to embrace innovation,” she continued. That has to be the dividing line right there.” She went on to call the use of AI actors in advertisements “fake entertainment.” The Governor hosted a signing at the SAG-AFTRA offices in New York, surrounded by union executives as well as former president Fran Drescher, national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Linda Powell, executive vice president of SAG-AFTRA. The bill signing came the same day Disney announced a partnership with OpenAI in which users of its AI video creation platform Sora will be able to create clips using iconic characters from Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars franchises. Disney CEO Bob Iger said Thursday that the Sora deal will not include voices, potentially delaying a fight over using actor's voices. “If we want the public to trust what they see, we must have guardrails on digital replicas and synthetic creations,” Crabtree-Ireland said, adding that the union refers to them as “synthethic figures” rather than “synthetic performers.” The union later issued a statement saying it will “closely monitor the deal” to “ensure compliance with our contracts and with applicable laws protecting image, voice and likeness.” This policy must be durable and I thank all of the stakeholders, including OpenAI for working together to have the appropriate protections enshrined in law.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The mother of seven, 33, took to Instagram on Wednesday, December 10, and revealed that her dog, Buddha, was diagnosed with cancer. The MTV personality revealed that she got Buddha while pregnant with her fourth child, Creed. Despite Buddha being an older dog, Lowry still treats him like a puppy. “I know sometimes bigger dogs will get, like, fatty lumps,” she continued. “[He] personally has never experienced the fatty lumps. However, at Buddha's follow-up check-up, Lowry pointed out that one of the fatty lumps attached to his wrist was very tight and close to the bone. Lowry revealed that surgery isn't the best option, noting that it'd be incredibly difficult for Buddha to recover from it. Lowry gushed about how Buddha is “such a good dog” and that “everyone loves [him].” Right now, Lowry focuses on making sure that Buddha is “super comfortable” before his time comes. She also asked fans for comfort tips in adult dog life care. Another commented, “My friend's Pit Bull got diagnosed with Cancer, and they opted not to do the surgery, and he lived another 5+ years.

When the teaser for “Chrome Alone 2: Lost in New Jersey,” a new short film starring the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, was released, an early complaint on the internet was a brief moment where tech-savvy Donatello consults with ChatGPT on what to get father-figure Master Splinter for Christmas. Cries of character assassination that the super smart Donnie would have to ask an AI algorithm for advice could be found all over Twitter. As it turns out, Donnie's flirtation with ChatGPT isn't just a throwaway; it's the whole plot of the delightful short, which pits the Turtles against Chrome Dome (voiced by Zach Woods), an AI menace using generative AI to rip off the Turtles' likeness and sell ripoff toy versions of them for profit. Like a lot of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” media, the short has its tongue firmly planted in cheek, but it also sends a strong message that AI isn't capable of what human creativity can manage.

Seki, a longtime fan of the characters who collected their comics as a kid, said he initially joined the first film Ramsey Naito, former head of Nickelodeon Animation, connected him with the director Jeff Rowe. Seki had met Naito when he worked on “Boss Baby” in 2017, and told her he wanted to eventually direct; she kept that in mind, and offered him the chance to take on the short soon after “Mutant Mayhem” production wrapped. “I've been trying to direct since 2007,” Seki told IndieWire in an interview. Below, Seki talks with IndieWire about making the short, tackling the topic of AI through “TMNT,” and how films like “Uncut Gems” and “Panic Room” influenced his directing process. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. IndieWire: This film explores the intersection of generative artificial intelligence and art. Seki: For the last three to four years, we've been hearing and seeing the rise of generative AI, like it's all around us. And for anyone that works in a creative industry, it creates a lot of anxiety about what this means for us? You see these tools and they are impressive, at the same time, you see some of their limitations and their downfalls. And there's a lot of hyperbole about what it's going to do, so it ended up being a case that doing a film around AI allowed us to channel and funnel all of that anxiety into the film itself. We were afraid, actually, a year ago, we were like, “well, this doesn't come out for a year. Maybe this discussion will be over by then.” If anything, it's become even more topical. The notion was that everything's off by a little bit, there was this feeling that we wanted to be everything to be a little bit odd, right? We went through and treated the footage to make it look like it was shot off of a videotape. Even in the scoring, I went to our composer Disasterpeace and said “Imagine this is a piece of diegetic music that the turtles are hearing, that everyone in the movie can actually hear, and that Chrome Dome has created because he believes his own backstory.” The fundamental thing about a liar, is they believe their own lie, and he would have listened to all these amazing Hans Zimmer scores and then made his own version like that, but worse. In the sound design from Mark Mangini, he went through and found sound effects from the actual IP that we were riffing on and parodying and peppered that in. Every department was adding to that storytelling and using AI as the punching bag for our feelings about it. We originally had them going into the store and handling the toys themselves, but story artist John Jackson said, “you could have a commercial in the window that we would watch.” And I thought that's a great idea, but we can't afford to do that, and we couldn't afford to do that in CG. But we hired this great company, the Brothers Chaps in Atlanta, and basically we contracted them out to make it. We had to be hands off on it. The turtles have a long tradition of toys, right? That's a lot of people come to that this franchise through the toys, and to use it as a meta narrative, to say something about AI at the same time the franchise itself and the corporatization of an indie comic, we thought was a very clever way of, sort of taking making a nod to all of these different things that the film has in it. The short begins with Donnie asking ChatGPT a question about gifts to get Splinter. Why did that make sense for his character. I know it was controversial that Donnie used ChatGPT [Laughs]. I think what it comes down to is the turtles created by Jeff Rowe and Seth Rogen are authentically teenage. Teenagers are naturally curious, and they experiment with all these things. It was in contrast to the ceramic mug that Mikey made. If you're a parent, you've received that mug in some shape or form and loved it, even though it has many flaws. And sometimes I would say the flaws make it lovable. Having Donnie learned that lesson throughout the short doesn't mean he rejects technology, but that he can leave with this healthy skepticism of technology. How did you think of making the short visually distinct from “Mutant Mayhem”? That was driven by our Art Director, Garrett Lee, who was really interested in sort of finding a new a new look in it that expanded upon what we did in Mutant Mayhem. One thing we did was we shot with two frames of a focal length longer to try and stack the frame, stack the image with as much New York as possible, so that the Turtles, who ended Mutant Mayhem being accepted into society, would now be part of society. We took a lot of inspiration from the Safdie Brothers and “Uncut Gems,” if you can believe it for that opening bit. I think that the physical comedy definitely has roots in “Home Alone.” There was a moment in which we were trying to figure out what the title of the movie should be. And there was concern if we want to have Christmas in the title, and we're like, “I don't know if that feels right for this” but it should evoke feelings that people have of Christmas. And I think it was, I think it was Woodrow White, the character designer, or Garrett Lee, the art director. There's a sequel to “Mutant Mayhem” scheduled for 2027. Yes, right now, I am working on the sequel as the head of cinematography, and I'm excited about it. Jeff is a master director to work with, and it's really fun. And I can't wait for people to see it. Hopefully this short film tides you over a bit. “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Chrome Alone 2 — Lost In New Jersey” will premiere in theaters with “The Spongebob Movie: Search for SquarePants” on December 19.
