Crypto ETFs:

Vanguard Group may now allow clients to trade spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, but one of the firm's senior investment leaders says its underlying view of crypto remains unchanged.

Bitcoin is better understood as a speculative collectible — akin to a popular plush toy — than as a productive asset, according to John Ameriks, Vanguard's global head of quantitative equity, who said the token lacks the income, compounding and cash-flow properties the firm looks for in long-term investments.</p>

Starting December 17, the computer maker is set to hike prices across its commercial product lines, according to an internal list of upcoming price changes sent to staff on December 9 and seen by Business Insider. The list outlines price hikes for Dell's commercial business — meaning its sales to corporate clients rather than individual consumers. The company is one of the leading providers of computer hardware to US companies, and prices aren't just rising at Dell. An industry-wide shortage of memory and storage chips is driving up costs across the PC industry, affecting competitors like Lenovo and HP as well. The soaring demand for AI infrastructure has tech companies snapping up enormous quantities of memory and storage chips, increasing competition for consumer devices. A Dell spokesperson told Business Insider that "like others in the industry, Dell takes targeted pricing action, when necessary, while maintaining supply continuity and its commitment to customer value." How much more expensive a laptop at Dell will be next week depends on how much memory and storage you require. The global shortages are hitting two key types of chips that are essential components in most user devices: DRAM and NAND. NAND — non-volatile flash memory — is used for SSD storage, typically around 512GB or 1TB. Selecting a laptop with 1 TB of storage will add to the overall cost by between $55 and $135. They asked to remain anonymous as they are not permitted to speak publicly, but Business Insider has verified their employment. For example, a Dell Pro 55 Plus 4K Monitor, currently listed on Dell's website at $1,349.99, will be $150 more expensive, according to the price list. AI laptops containing an Nvidia RTX PRO 500 Blackwell GPU with 6GB will become $66 more expensive, and a 24GB GPU will cost $530 more, the pricing chart shows. "It's impacting everyone, and there's no way around it currently, so customers will just have to pay more if they want the products," the sales employee said. Dell sent an email to its "go-to-market" (GTM) sales staff on November 25, which Business Insider has seen, outlining the "critical next steps" sellers should take to prepare ahead of the increase. "Global memory and storage supply are tightening fast," Dell warned GTM team members. The company told its sellers to "move decisively" ahead of the price increases to "protect value for our customers and for Dell." "Ordering today for future delivery DOES NOT lock in current pricing," Dell warned, but said that acting now would help customers stay ahead of "significant anticipated memory increase." The Dell sales employee said that there had been an initial rush to help customers buy remaining inventory, but now the situation is largely viewed as "out of our control." The employee said Dell was also absorbing some of the costs internally, through hits to margins and limiting discounts that sales staff can offer. In the company's third-quarter earnings call on November 25, Jeff Clarke, Dell's COO and vice chairman, said the market's price increases were "unprecedented." Tech companies are buying massive amounts of DRAM and NAND to power AI models and cloud services, leaving fewer chips for consumer devices. DRAM prices are expected to rise 30% in the final quarter of 2025, having already increased by 50% so far this year, according to Counterpoint, a global technology market research firm. "The entire supply chain simply can't meet the demand that is now required and that inevitably leads to these kinds of challenges," Bob O'Donnell, the president and chief analyst at Technalysis Research, told Business Insider. These price increases will "likely have a noticeable impact for all types of PCs from every PC vendor," said O'Donnell, adding that the supply shortage is expected to continue throughout 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly 100,000 photos obtained by House Democrats from the estate of notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein include images of President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, film director Woody Allen, and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon and others in social settings. Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as they made the photos public, urged the Department of Justice to release investigative files it has related to Epstein ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to do so to comply with a newly passed law. One image among a batch of photos released Friday morning shows Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release. Some of the women are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks. Trump is shown in another photo standing behind Epstein at what appears to be a social event. Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein before the two men had a falling out sometime in the early 2000s. CNBC has requested comment from the White House. Clinton is shown in one photo standing with Epstein, his now-convicted procurer Ghislaine Maxwell, and another man and woman. Other photos show former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was previously known as Prince Andrew of Britain, and Epstein's one-time lawyer Alan Dershowitz. This story will be updated with their responses. "This latest production contains over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein," a statement from Democrats on the Oversight Committee said. Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee, in a statement said, "It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends." "These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. Trump and top law enforcement officials in his administration for months resisted the idea of releasing investigative files related to Epstein and Maxwell before Congress in November overwhelmingly passed a law mandating their release by the Department of Justice. Those files, which are separate from the ones released by the Democrats on Friday, have yet to be made publicly available. "There's an enormous amount of photos we have not gone through," Garcia said. "It will take days and weeks to ensure that we got those photos and that a redaction is done in the appropriate way." "Obviously there are photos of powerful men, and folks that we want to have an opportunity to speak with and ask questions of," Garcia said. He noted that the photos were in the estate's possession, and that Epstein took some of them himself, while others may have been sent to him. "Some of the other photos that we did not put out today are incredibly disturbing," Garcia added. Republicans on the Oversight Committee, in their own statement, said, "Once again, Oversight Democrats are chasing headlines by releasing a handful of selectively censored and cherry-picked photos from the Epstein Estate." "Democrats' hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. "Ranking Member Robert Garcia and Oversight Democrats should be ashamed of this disgusting behavior of putting politics above justice for the survivors." Epstein died from a jailhouse suicide in August 2019, weeks after he was arrested on child sex trafficking charges filed by the DOJ during Trump's first term in office. Maxwell is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for her 2021 conviction of crimes related to procuring underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Angel Urena, a spokesperson for Clinton, had said in a July 2019 statement, "President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York." "In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation. Staff, supporters of the Foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip," Urena said. "He had one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein's New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail. He's not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein's ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida."

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, in a statement to CNBC, accused House Democrats of "selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative." Jackson called the Democrats' focus on the president's connection to Epstein a "hoax," and argued that the Trump administration "has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have" by releasing documents and calling for transparency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Friday explained why he voted against this week's interest rate cut, telling CNBC that policymakers should have waited until they had more information before easing further. "I'm pretty optimistic that for 2026 rates will will be able to be a fair bit lower than they are today," the central banker said during a "Squawk Box" interview. "But I've just been uncomfortable front-loading too many rate cuts and assuming that what we've seen in inflation will be transitory." Goolsbee was one of three Federal Open Market Committee members to vote against the quarter percentage point reduction, the third consecutive easing measure. While he has said in the past he sees room for rates to come down further, Goolsbee said a lack of progress on inflation argued against moving now. "There's no way around we've been four and a half years above the inflation target, and the last six months have shown no progress," Goolsbee said. "Right before the lights went out [for the government shutdown], you saw a couple of relatively disturbing readings on services inflation. I just want to make sure that if we believe that this is transitory, let's not just put all our eggs in." "While I voted to lower rates at the September and October meetings, I believe we should have waited to get more data, especially about inflation, before lowering rates further," the policymaker said in a post on the Chicago Fed's website. "Given that inflation has been above our target for four and a half years, further progress on it has been stalled for several months, and almost all the businesspeople and consumers we have spoken to in the district lately identify prices as a main concern, I felt the more prudent course would have been to wait for more information." he wrote in a post on the Chicago Fed website. In the CNBC interview, he elaborated on his misgivings about cutting. While other Fed officials have expressed concern about the weakening labor market, Goolsbee said data has shown conditions to be "pretty stable." But I've just been uncomfortable front loading too many rate cuts," he said in the interview. "We don't take a lot of extra risk, in my view, to just wait to Q1 2026, and make sure that we're back on path at 2% inflation." In his post-meeting news conference, Chair Jerome Powell expressed worry that the labor market looks weaker than the headline numbers suggest, saying he expects official nonfarm payroll counts to be lowered and show losses in recent months. For his part, Goolsbee said he is "one of the most optimistic people" that rates will be lower in the year ahead. Schmid also released a statement Friday explaining his dissent. He also voted against a rate cut in October. "I view the current stance of monetary policy as being only modestly, if at all, restrictive. Earlier Friday morning, Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson, who will vote in 2026, said she views policy as "somewhat restrictive" and is more worried about unemployment than inflation. Also, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said she would prefer policy "on a slightly more restrictive stance" to guard against higher inflation, according to Reuters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia has told Chinese clients it is evaluating adding production capacity for its powerful H200 AI chips after orders exceeded its current output level, according to two sources briefed on the matter. The move comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the U.S. government would allow Nvidia to export H200 processors, its second-fastest AI chips, to China and collect a 25% fee on such sales. Demand for the chip from Chinese companies is so strong that Nvidia is leaning toward adding new capacity, one of the sources said. They declined to be named as the discussions are private. Nvidia did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. Major Chinese companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have already reached out to Nvidia this week about purchasing the H200 and are keen to place large orders, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Chinese officials convened emergency meetings on Wednesday to discuss the matter and will decide whether to allow it to be shipped into China, said one of the two sources and a third source. Very limited quantities of H200 chips are currently in production, Reuters reported on Wednesday, as the U.S. AI chip leader is focused on producing its most advanced Blackwell and upcoming Rubin lines. Supply of H200 chips has been a major concern for Chinese clients and they have reached out to Nvidia seeking clarity on this, sources said. As part of the briefing provided by Nvidia, the company has also given them guidance on current supply levels, said one of the first two people, without providing a specific number. The H200 went into mass deployment last year and is the fastest AI chip in Nvidia's previous Hopper generation. TSMC and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) did not immediately reply to requests for comment. It is about six times more powerful than the H20, a downgraded chip from Nvidia tailored for the Chinese market that was released in late 2023. Trump's decision on the H200 comes at a time when China is pushing to promote its own domestic AI chip industry. "Its (H200) compute performance is approximately 2-3 times that of the most advanced domestically produced accelerators," said Nori Chiou, investment director at White Oak Capital Partners. "I'm already observing many CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) and enterprise customers aggressively placing large orders and lobbying the government to relax restrictions on a conditional basis," he said, adding Chinese AI demand exceeds the capacity of local production. During the emergency meetings, there was a proposal to require each H200 purchase to be bundled with a certain ratio of domestic chips, one of the first two sources and a third source said. For Nvidia, adding new capacity is also challenging at a time when it is not only transitioning to Rubin but also competing with companies, including Alphabet's Google, for limited advanced chipmaking capacity from TSMC.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to new closing highs yesterday as investors dove into old-economy and blue-chip stocks. Another day, another CEO departure: Lululemon announced yesterday that CEO Calvin McDonald will step down at the end of January. He will be replaced in the interim by two executives while the Canadian retailer searches for a permanent successor. Lululemon reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter, but, as CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge notes, the company has been underperforming for more than a year. Shares of the athleisure retailer are up more than 9% this morning. Costco also surpassed Wall Street's forecasts for its first quarter, boosted in part by e-commerce growth. The warehouse club said Black Friday was a record-breaking day for its digital business. Disney announced a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI yesterday. Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC that the deal gives the company "a way in" to AI and will help it further reach younger consumers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said there will be limits on how Disney characters can be used in Sora videos. CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos takes you through the company's transformation from a small, nonprofit research lab to the booming business it is today. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. After the U.S. seized a tanker off Venezuela's coast, a White House official told CNBC yesterday that Trump is willing to do it again. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also said that the tanker will be taken to a U.S. port where the oil it carried will be seized. CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco found that the tanker in question, identified as the "Skipper," had hid its location on multiple occasions since last year. Data suggests it has carried sanctioned oil from Iran and Venezuela since 2022. Fiber is increasingly stealing the spotlight as shoppers focus on their gut health. Data shows 22% of consumers listed high fiber content as a top-three factor when shopping, compared with 17% four years ago. On social media, the kids are calling it "fibermaxxing." PepsiCo also told CNBC that it's planning to launch high-fiber versions of Smartfood and SunChips next year.

For 16 hours, an AI agent crawled Stanford's public and private computer science networks, digging up security flaws across thousands of devices. A study published Wednesday by Stanford researchers found that their AI agent, ARTERMIS, placed second in an experiment with 10 selected cybersecurity professionals. Running ARTEMIS costs about $18 an hour, far below the average salary of about $125,000 a year for a "professional penetration tester," the study said. The study was led by three Stanford researchers — Justin Lin, Eliot Jones, and Donovan Jasper — whose work focuses on AI agents, cybersecurity, and machine-learning safety. The team created ARTEMIS after finding that existing AI tools struggled with long, complex security tasks. Some of the flaws had gone unnoticed by humans, including a weakness on an older server that testers could not access because their browsers refused to load it. ARTEMIS bypassed the issue and broke in using a command-line request. Whenever ARTEMIS spotted something "noteworthy" in a scan, it spun up additional "sub-agents" to investigate in the background, allowing it to examine multiple targets simultaneously. Human testers had to do this work one step at a time. ARTEMIS struggled with tasks that required clicking through graphical screens, causing it to overlook a critical vulnerability. It is also more prone to false alarms, mistaking harmless network messages for signs of a successful break-in. "Because ARTEMIS parses code-like input and output well, it performs better when graphical user interfaces are unavailable," the researchers said. In September, a North Korean hacking group used ChatGPT to generate fake military IDs for phishing emails. A report from Anthropic in August found that North Korean operatives used its Claude model to obtain fraudulent remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies — a tactic that gave them insider access to corporate systems. The same report also said a Chinese threat actor used Claude to run cyberattacks on Vietnamese telecom, agricultural, and government systems. "We are seeing many, many attacks," Yuval Fernbach, the chief technology officer of machine learning operations at software supply chain company JFrog, told Business Insider in a report published in April.</p>

British Airways passengers spent more than nine hours on a transatlantic flight that ended up back where it started. Wednesday's Flight 243 took off from London Heathrow Airport at 1:22 p.m. and was supposed to land in Mexico City around 11 hours later. It had already passed Greenland and was only about 150 miles off the coast of Canada's Nunavut territory, according to data from Flightradar24. We've apologised to our customers for the delay, and our teams are working to get their journeys back on track," the statement said. It can be frustrating for passengers when they're diverted to their origin — a so-called flight to nowhere — but often it's the best course of action. Returning to Heathrow, BA's main hub, makes it easier for the airline to rebook passengers on alternative flights and fix any problems with the aircraft. When BA Flight 243 turned around, its closest airport was Iqaluit in northern Canada, less than 300 miles away. Some flights have diverted to this remote town in the past, but it can ultimately be more disruptive. Last year, an Air France flight diverted to Iqaluit after a burning smell was detected in the cabin. It was originally scheduled for another flight, so that had to be canceled. Passengers were then taken to New York, where they were rebooked onto other flights to reach their intended destination of Seattle.</p>

Uber is preparing for a robotaxi surge, and its CEO says one market will drive it. Dara Khosrowshahi said in an interview with Bloomberg Television published Friday that robotaxis are a "trillion-dollar-plus" opportunity and Asia is a huge growth market for the ride-hailing giant. "I expect to be in 10-plus markets by next year. And we want those markets to be in the Asia-Pacific region as well," Khosrowshahi said. In 2023, McKinsey estimated that if robotaxis and roboshuttles scale, the shared-mobility market could reach $1 trillion by 2030. Khosrowshahi said Japan has "great potential" for its robotaxi push, despite being behind in regulation. "With an aging population, there's a real need for transportation, not just in the large cities but in the rural areas," he added. He also pointed to Hong Kong and Australia as potential key markets for its robotaxi services. "We will have access to autonomous technologies in the large cities and markets that really count," he added. "It's an exciting technology, but there are many players getting to the finish line," he said. During its third-quarter earnings call in November, Khosrowshahi said the company is already seeing signs that robotaxis can boost demand. "The biggest scale operations that we've got are with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta," Khosrowshahi said. Other industry leaders have also been hyping the sector. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly said that robotaxis will power the company's growth. HSBC analysts warned in July that the robotaxi market has been "widely overestimated," and said it could be years before fleets make real money. The cost of an autonomous driving vehicle is steep. Analysts estimate that each Waymo vehicle costs about $150,000 to produce.</p>
