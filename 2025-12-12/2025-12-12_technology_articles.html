According to Michigan's attorney general, the hacker stole personal data collected from dealers between May and October 2025. The company said it was now sending letters by mail to individuals whose information had been stolen in the data breach, which offers credit monitoring services. “If you get a letter from 700Credit, don't ignore it,” said Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel. A credit freeze or monitoring services can go a long way in preventing fraud, and I encourage Michiganders to use the tools available to keep their identity safe.” Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch's coverage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google is rolling out a beta experience that lets you hear real-time translations in your headphones, the company announced on Friday. The new real-time headphone translations experience keeps each speaker's tone, emphasis, and cadence intact, so it's easier to follow the conversation and tell who's saying what, Google says. The new capability essentially turns any pair of headphones into a real-time, one-way translation device. The feature works with any pair of headphones and supports more than 70 languages. As for the advanced Gemini capabilities coming to Translate, Google says they will enable smarter, more natural, and accurate text translations. They'll also enable improved translations of phrases with more nuanced meanings, like slang, idioms, or local expressions. For example, if you're trying to translate an English idiom like “stealing my thunder,” you'll now get a more accurate translation instead of a literal word-for-word translation, as Gemini will parse the context to capture what the idiom really means. Google is also expanding its language learning tools to almost 20 new countries, including Germany, India, Sweden, and Taiwan. The tech giant is also adding improved feedback so you can get helpful tips based on your speaking practice. Additionally, Google is adding a feature that tracks how many days in a row you've been learning, making it easier to see your progress and stay consistent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That led Muench and his wife, Sanja, to launch Hyviva in 2023 to build modular, hydrogen-powered energy storage units that essentially produce electricity from water. This month, the business is shipping its first devices to customers. Hyviva is initially targeting residential solar installations, a potentially ripe market as long-standing policies allowing homeowners to sell unused solar power back to utilities are being phased out in many places. “That's the catalyst for storage,” said Paul Owen, chief marketing officer. “You've got this opportunity that's going to waste right now.” Stored solar power can also reduce a home's reliance on utility-provided electricity — which is getting more expensive — and keep the lights on and fridge running during power outages. The startup can also do manufacturing in Redmond for U.S. customers. Hyviva's biggest U.S. rival is the Tesla Powerwall system that uses conventional lithium-ion batteries to hold power. The company reported $7.4 billion in revenue last year from energy generation, and that number has continued to climb. Hyviva touts its product's competitive features across performance, safety and longevity. The startup's basic system holds more power — 33.6 kilowatt hours to Tesla's 13.5 kWh. While blazes are uncommon, lithium ion batteries pose a fire risk that's greater than the hydrogen present in a Hyviva device for short periods. And conventional batteries lose capacity over time, while the metal hydride retains its hydrogen storage capabilities for decades. The startup, however, faces big hurdles when it comes to costs. To put the capacity in perspective, a U.S. single-family household consumes around 80 kilowatt hours of power per day on average. As power demand keeps expanding globally, experts estimate that $1.2 trillion worth of battery energy storage will be needed through 2034. And energy storage is being paired with data centers to reduce their power grid impacts, including at an Oregon campus that's installing 31 megawatts of batteries. But the startup is attracting interest, said Chief Operations Officer John Traynor. It has funding from an angel investor and reports having dozens of potential customers, with commercial sites and utilities reaching out as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>My understanding, at least several years ago, that Netflix was paying as much to Apple in subscription fees, as they did for their AWS hosting.I also noticed when upgrading my Spotify account, I couldn't do that through the iphone app itself - I assumed this was because it would break TOS, or they didn't want to pay a massive chunck of the monthly subscription cost to Apple. I also noticed when upgrading my Spotify account, I couldn't do that through the iphone app itself - I assumed this was because it would break TOS, or they didn't want to pay a massive chunck of the monthly subscription cost to Apple. I would think making sure outside payment links aren't scams will be more expensive than that because checking that once isn't sufficient. Scammers will update the target of such links, so you can't just check this at app submission time. You also will have to check from around the world, from different IP address ranges, outside California business hours, etc, because scammer are smart enough to use such info to decide whether to show their scammy page.Also, even if it becomes ‘only' hundreds of dollars, I guess only large companies will be able to afford providing an option for outside payments.

Not that they'd ever do the review to begin with, so the hashing won't be done either, but it's something that could be done on iOS/ipados.And if you consider that infeasible, you might want to check out current CSP best practices, you might be surprised According to the ruling on page 42, "(c) Apple should receive no commission for the security and privacy features it offers to external links, and its calculation of its necessary costs for external links should not include the cost associated with the security and privacy features it offers with its IAP" Google are doing exactly the same as Apple previously were doing, mandatory from end of next month - January 28, 2026.Their new requirements: https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answ...

Epic Games doesn't allow them for IAP. Epic knows exactly how predatory that is, betting some kids will find ways to spend thousands and the parents will be helpless. Ideally you'd have a law mandating refunds, but without that, there should be mandatory disclosure on the IAP screen, at least for microtransaction games. You can't have fair "competition" when you have an information asymmetry, and if these rulings don't mandate that, you'll open the floodgate for these gaming companies to screw over parents.

You simply own a license to view the content at your leisure, and Amazon can revoke the license for whatever reason it chooses. However, there's a small spot of hope for people who want to own the things they buy. Amazon will allow users to download some books starting in 2026, though only if a publisher offers its own approval. You can read more about Kindle's policy change on its DRM (digital rights management) support page. Starting on Jan. 20 next year, “verified purchasers can download the EPUB or PDF files of your confirmed DRM-free books.” That acronym is a catch-all term for any software limitation that restricts users from reselling or otherwise manipulating copyrighted works. Good e-Reader (via Android Police) first spotted the change in policy. This “Download & transfer via USB” feature in tandem with older e-book formats allowed some users to then hack the files, changing their format to make them accessible on other devices. Sure, the tool was certainly used for book piracy, though other users simply wanted to access books they already—ostensibly—owned on their choice of device. Now, Amazon is putting the onus on book publishers to decide whether users should be able to own their e-books, at least in the traditional sense of the word “own.” Starting early next year, users can download either EPUB or PDF via the Manage Your Content and Devices page on Amazon's website. This won't work if you're reading these e-books via a Kindle Unlimited subscription. The new DRM rules state that if you download an e-book and the publisher changes its mind, you'll still maintain control of that copy even if you can't download it anymore. This will be a positive change for any lingering Kindle readers with big libraries. Amazon's latest devices, like the $280 Kindle Colorsoft and the $630 Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, are more expensive than some other e-reader alternatives, so this is a win for smaller e-reader brands as well. If you consider how fast the publishing industry went after the Internet Archive for daring to create a public online repository of books and journals, there may be few authors and publishers willing to enable free digital downloads. AAP wrote after the case settled late last year, “The public interest… is served best when authors and their publisher licensees can decide the terms on which they make their works available.” Gizmodo reached out to several of the major publishing houses for comment on plans for book downloads, and we'll update this post if we hear back. Even if Amazon is pushing responsibility onto the publishers, at least it may mean we can finally feel some small, incremental sense of ownership.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a lawsuit filed with Australia's top court, Reddit argues the law, which came into force on December 10, limits free political discourse by preventing children from airing their views online, and should be overturned. Critics argue that the law infringes on children's rights, and companies have sought to raise questions about what “social media” even defines. Indeed, calling itself a “collection of public fora arranged by subject,” Reddit brought up definitions of the word “social” in its filing to make the case that “it is not the sole or a significant purpose of Reddit to enable persons to interact ‘in a social manner'.” It facilitates knowledge sharing from one user to other users. It is not a significant purpose of the site to enable interactions engaged in because of a particular user's relationship with or interest in another user as a person […] Reddit is significantly different from other sites that allow for users to become ‘friends' with one another, or to post photos about themselves, or to organise events,” the filing reads. “While we agree with the importance of protecting people under 16, this law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't,” the post reads. Reddit also points out that a significant portion of content on social media platforms is accessible without an account, and kids under 16 years old would be more easily protected if they were allowed to have accounts that could then be restricted.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I'm bringing this up because it's the perfect litmus test to show whether you really care about age verification, or if you want personal trackability for all internet behavior.I'd be okay with this for certain situations (e.g. a forum that doesn't want to foreign agitators to pretend they are US voters), but the whole porn thing is a ridiculous farce because there are still going to always be millions of non-us porn sites that don't enforce US laws.

As a not super tech savvy parent I find it impossible to keep my son off screens. So I'm a fan of age verification especially after reading The Anxious Generation, despite all the hate it gets from hacker news. But it sounds like your wish is to keep people of screens in general, which I don't think age verification would accomplish. My bigger concern would be who gets to issue these tokens. And making the internet not global (blocking adults from accessing foreign websites that don't adhere to your scheme) is kinda authoritarian IMO.If we're going to do age verification and blocking of adult sites, it needs to be local to the user's device (and thus under the control of parents, not governments).E.g. Instead of mandating sites verify users, we mandate internet-capable devices sold to kids have certain content restrictions, the same way we mandate you can't sell  alcohol to kids. This way the rights, freedoms, and privacy of adults using adult devices is unaffected.

We also have pi-hole running that blocks a lot of things, and can turn on and off certain domains (so they can play roblox etc for a short while, then its blocked again) and their devices are pretty locked down The key is to be open about it and “more” than reasonable; allow things when requested that aren't harmful.If we're too perfect at protecting them from the world they'll have no tools to deal with the world, which they will have to do eventually.

Exactly the behavior that isn't working, so please continue - I'm sure it'll work now. You keep trying to remove yourself from the responsibilities of parenting in the modern world as shown in the examples you put forth and your initial post asking that parents not shoulder the blame for what is happening under their nose. Surely they have some level of culpability.I believe that it would be good for Parental Controls on devices to have a toggle to say that the phone is being used by someone in under 13, or someone 14-18 (whatever bands you want). When enabled, this flag should be available to locally installed apps and remote connections. Laws can be passed that tell remote connections how they must act when receiving this flag.

My argument is that the real entities that need legislation are the ones who can most afford to do so - in both time, resources, and ownership of the platforms that we are all beholden to.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Instagram, Ross Duffer revealed a tiny bit more about the next drop of Stranger Things season five episodes coming to Netflix this Christmas. “Chapters Five, Six and Seven: locked, mixed, scored, colored… Volume Two is DONE,” he wrote, and revealed a video of their titles. Chapter Five, is titled “Shock Jock.” It “picks up moments after the end of ‘Sorcerer.' Frank Darabont is back, but he flexes very different muscles on this one than he did on ‘Turnbow Trap'—it's far darker, and far scarier,”  Ross Duffer wrote. Darabont, a veteran director in the Stephen King universe, delivered one of the strongest episodes in Stranger Things 5‘s first batch. The Duffer Brothers' longtime collaborator, Shawn Levy, who is currently working on Star Wars: Starfighter, makes his franchise return with Chapter Six. It's gonna be a long six-day wait for the finale…” he teased. He also added, “Runtimes to come.” Stranger Things season 5, volume one, is now streaming on Netflix. Volume Two will be released on December 25, and the series finale will take its bow on December 31.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Learn the basics and improve your PowerShell skills When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. In this guide we will take a look at some simple command prompt commands and then delve into PowerShell and learn how it handles the same tasks, providing you a guide to the top ten powershell commands you need to know to get started. In the 1990s I had a 486 PC with just enough RAM to run Star Wars X-Wing or Windows 3.1. I learnt the MS-DOS prompt and I was soon navigating the filesystem and tweaking config files like a sys admin with a deadline. These days I spend more time in the Linux terminal than Windows Command Prompt, but it did have me wondering how the command prompt and its “successor” PowerShell behaved in 2025. Microsoft's PowerShell is a command line shell and scripting language that is more powerful than the command prompt, and offers automation and system administration tools for the Windows sys admin who wants to automate parts of their role. The scripting side of things has advanced logic such as loops, variables, functions etc and that makes it ideal for boring jobs like user creation, system configuration and software deployment. PowerShell uses cmdlets (command-lets) that are small, single-function commands and has a get and set syntax to get the information that we need, and then we can set the configuration to how we want things to work. Lists the contents of a directory, this can be the current working directory, or another location passed as an argument. Copy file(s) from one location to another. Moves a file from one location to another. Creates a new directory in the current working directory, or in another location if passed as an argument. Shows information on the currently active network connections. Lists all of the running processes by name or PID. Lets now take a look at how PowerShell does things with these ten commands. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. It can display information on cmdlets and their syntax. The help files can be updated by running this command. Not sure what commands you can run in PowerShell? This command lists all of the available commands and functions at your disposal. In the background on our Windows machines, services run to perform tasks and await user input. These services can range from DHCP for our network to Google Chrome updates to print services like Bonjour. We can list all running and stopped services with this command. We can then stop a running service by running this command and passing the name of the service. For example, here I am stopping the Bonjour print service. If I need to restart a service, I just use this command and pass the name of the service. Much like services, these commands can list the running processes on your PC. They could be the multiple Chrome processes that prevent all of your windows and tabs from disappearing when a crash occurs. Once we know which processes are running, we can stop a process that is consuming too much of our resources. We can also use get-childitem to perform the same task. Essentially, this is the same command as copy but in PowerShell. Of course, you can still use copy in PowerShell, it acts like an alias for this command. Here I am copying a file IMG_20251105_111626.jpg into the same directory, but I am changing the destination files name to testpic.jpg. I use dir, passing the directory as an argument. Here I change directory to extras, and then I use Get-ChildItem to list the contents of the directory. If you need or want to create a file in PowerShell, you can use this command to create a new file. Note that the command will interactively ask for input [value0[, [value1] etc. When you have entered all your text, press Enter on a blank line to signal to the command that you are done. This command will overwrite the contents of the file, so only use it on new files or if you are really sure. This is effectively the same command as ping. It contacts a remote host and checks that your machine, and the remote machine can communicate with each other. This is often used to check that your PC can get online, especially when trying to determine network connectivity issues. The command takes an IP address or URL as an argument, here I am using the IP address for Google's main DNS server. So there we go, we've taken our first steps into PowerShell commands, comparing them to command prompt commands and explaining how to use them. Some are useful, others are quirky, and their “DOS” aliases make much more sense for daily use, but there will come a time when we need to know these commands, say for a script or configuration file, so keep them in mind.

TSMC is mulling upgrading the capabilities of its yet-to-be-built Fab 23 phase 2 in Japan in a bid to make chips on its N4 process technology (4nm-class) there, according to Nikkei. Advancing fab capabilities is hardly something unexpected for foundries like TSMC, as they tend to follow demand with their offerings. What is perhaps more surprising is that TSMC has removed heavy machinery equipment from the site and has notified suppliers that it would not need new fab tools in Japan throughout the whole 2026. If the information from Nikkei is correct, then Fab 21 phase 2 will also add N4 and N5 capabilities to its list to make more advanced chips for Japanese customers. Truth to be told, although N5/N4 and N7/N6 families of manufacturing technologies have completely different design rules and the former are substantially more advanced than the latter as they use up to 14 EUV layers, the equipment that they use is generally similar. That said, upgrading Fab 23 phase 2 to N4 and N5 should not be a big challenge for TSMC, but might require some redesigns as the N4 production line requires more EUV lithography tools, and these are physically larger than DUV tools. One interesting thing to note about TSMC's Fab 23 phase 2 is that while it entered the early phase of physical build-out in late October (according to Nikkei), photos taken at the site in November showed cranes, excavators, and piledrivers on site. However, images captured in early December reveal that nearly all heavy equipment has since been removed. Furthermore, TSMC reportedly notified its tool suppliers that it would not need new equipment in Japan throughout 2026, which implies that it will not start equipping JASM phase 2 next year due to construction delay, which is barely news given all the information surrounding the facility.TSMC declined to comment on the report. “The construction of our second fab has begun, and the ramp schedule will be based on our customers' needs and market conditions.” Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.

Something's rotten in Mushroom Kingdom, and this time around it's not Bowser's fault. Nintendo's stock price took a 4.7% nosedive today, due to predictions that the Japanese console maker won't be able to keep its profit margins as high as expected. The latest dip wiped $14 billion off Nintendo's market cap and brought the stock roughly to its May price, eroding gains made since then. The production cost for the Switch 2 has risen substantially, given that it uses 12 GB RAM chips whose cost has reportedly risen by 41% in Q4 alone. Bloomberg notes that this rise in storage pricing will also reflect itself on storage cards, further cementing statements previously made by OEMs like Transcend and Adata, some of which are even unable to secure flash chips to begin with. The Reuters report also points out that microSD cards aren't really optional, as some titles chew up most of the Switch 2's capacity. Stockholders are right to be concerned, as reports from earlier in the year remark that Nintendo was apparently selling the Switch 2 at a very slim profit margin, with some outfits estimating that non-Japanese sales could be at a simple break-even point, or even at a loss. The U.S. tariff situation is only likely to complicate that matter further. Add to that the fact that Nintendo almost certainly makes the lion's share of its money from games rather than hardware, and maybe this situation is just a temporary concern.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GeekWire Gala: Last chance to grab tickets Teams who can architect systems, debug impossible bugs, and ship product under pressure suddenly hit a surprising moment of hesitation: It's the time of year when even the most capable engineers, founders, and operators pause in front of a benefits grid trying to make sense of deductibles, copays, networks, and plan names that seem to shift just enough each year to make the familiar unfamiliar again. And in a workplace where decisions are constant — from product roadmaps to sprint planning — the mental load of choosing health benefits hits differently. And it shows up right when the year is at its most demanding. What most people don't say out loud is this:Open Enrollment doesn't feel hard because the information is complex.It feels hard because the decision matters. But benefits aren't a problem to solve; they're a system to navigate — and one with moving parts. Medical plans saw adjustments, including a clearer design for the TechStarter 7000 plan where the deductible and out-of-pocket maximum now align. Dental plans added richer preventive coverage through the new Max Wellness 2500 option. Vision plans expanded LightCare benefits for screen-heavy work. Life insurance maximums increased to meet the needs of growing families. And mental health support transitioned fully to SupportLinc, bringing modernized EAP services with only a minor rate impact. These updates are meaningful — but for the average employee, they're also one more layer to interpret. How do I know which option is truly right for my family? It's decision fatigue, but with higher emotional stakes. Founders and HR leaders often tell us the same thing: It's a trust designed specifically for Washington tech companies, combining high-quality carriers with a curated experience that removes guesswork and makes decisions easier for both employer and employee. The goal isn't to overwhelm people with choices; it's to give them better ones, delivered in a way that makes sense for how tech teams work. Ask any engineer what makes a system great, and you'll hear the same themes: ALLtech approaches benefits with that same philosophy. Through partnerships with Regence BlueShield, Delta Dental of Washington, VSP Vision Care, The Standard, and SupportLinc, ALLtech offers tech employers a cohesive benefits experience instead of a fragmented one. Open Enrollment is often treated like a compliance moment: check the box, confirm your choices, move on. But for employees, it's something more personal — a reflection of how supported they feel at work. For 2026, ALLtech's updates are designed to help Washington tech teams enter Open Enrollment with confidence instead of hesitation. And everyone can make decisions with a little less weight on their shoulders. In a year where every company is thinking carefully about retention, culture, and long-term sustainability, that clarity matters. Your team won't remember every line item in the benefits guide. When you choose a system built for innovators, creators, and high-performance teams, you send a message: We designed this with you in mind.” And that message lands every time an employee books a doctor's visit, fills a prescription, gets new glasses, or seeks support in a stressful moment. Open Enrollment may come once a year.But the impact lasts all year long. Learn more about ALLtech's 2026 plans and updates at ALLtechBenefits.org.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tonight at the Game Awards, we finally got a first look at Capcom and Paramount Pictures' upcoming Street Fighter film, which wasted no time getting down to all the action. While there may have been some reservations about whether a live-action Street Fighter movie would have the juice to look the part without coming off as too goofy to be legitimately hype, we have to admit, it certainly shut us up a little bit. The trailer was a mile a minute, referencing while showing off its illustrious list of actors and wrestlers in full costumes, and dare we say they looked pretty decent for Hollywood cosplay of video game characters. The trailer itself was mostly a hodgepodge of action with very little hinting toward what its actual story might be, but it's really there for that at the moment. As far as the last Street Fighter film endeavors go, those being the Jean-Claude Van Damme one and that other one about Chun Li you likely forgot about, this film definitely leaned more heavily into embracing the camp of the games' nonstop action. Aesthetically, though, the game seems to be taking more pointers from its newest game, Street Fighter VI‘s more neon-drenched urban look. All the better to make Cody Rhode's Guile hair look just that much more pronounced. Time will tell whether the film will have a story mode as raucous as its trailer's unbridled arcade action. But from this first look, director Kitao Sakurai definitely left a good first impression of what's to come when the movie hits theaters in 2026. Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who. A live-action 'Mobile Suit Gundam' movie is still happening, and it might've found a co-lead for an apparent star-crossed lovers story. 'Magic: The Gathering' has been snatching up plenty of IP for Secret Lair, so it's latest catch is the hit 'Monster Hunter' games. The 'Monsterverse' spinoff will take us to Skull Island in February 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It also directs the Department of Commerce to craft guidelines that could make states ineligible for future broadband funding if they pass “onerous” AI laws. The push for sweeping federal preemption of state AI laws has largely been fueled by AI investors, conservative policy shops, and tech industry trade groups. These groups have argued that a patchwork approach to AI regulation could stunt Silicon Valley's AI boom and reduce America's competitiveness on the global stage. “The EO gives your administration tools to push back on the most onerous and excessive state regulations,” Sacks told Trump during Thursday's signing ceremony. “We're not going to push back on all of them. The order is similar in many respects to an earlier draft obtained by WIRED but with a few key differences. I think we probably have Democrat support too, because it's common sense,” Trump said during Thursday's signing ceremony. Trump's executive order specifically calls out certain state AI laws—such as Colorado's SB24-205, which aims to limit “algorithmic discrimination” in AI models—as an attempt to “embed ideological bias.” Several other state AI laws may also fall in the crosshairs of this executive order. California governor Gavin Newsom signed a law in September requiring large tech companies to publish safety frameworks around their AI models. That bill is currently sitting on New York governor Kathy Hochul's desk, awaiting her signature or veto—though she's reportedly considering amendments that could weaken the bill significantly. Shortly before the order was signed on Thursday, several state attorneys general were quick to criticize the Trump administration's attempt to curb state power. “Now is not the time to let this new technology progress unchecked. AI development and deployment are happening quickly, and state attorneys general are the most agile regulators we have historically,” New York attorney general Letitia James said in a briefing with reporters on Thursday. “It has always been collaboration, not conflict, between state legislatures and Congress that yielded some of the most critical federal legislation in our country's history.” While the order may set a national tone for AI regulation, Trump does not have the authority to bar states from continuing to pass their own laws.
