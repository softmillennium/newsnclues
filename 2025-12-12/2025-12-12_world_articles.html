Independent journalism at Truthout faces unprecedented authoritarian censorship. If you value progressive media, please make a year-end donation today. On Wednesday, December 10, Donald Trump announced that the United States had seized a tanker in the Caribbean carrying more than 1.6 million barrels of Venezuelan crude oil. Trump — without evidence — says Maduro is the head of an international terrorist group running drugs into the United States. Responding to news of the tanker seizure, Democratic Senator Chris Coons told NewsNation that he is “gravely concerned that [Trump] is sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela.” But a new document offers insight into the thought process behind Trump's threats and actions in the region. It lays out U.S. military goals and foreign policy strategies for the world. “This document is a roadmap to ensure that America remains the greatest and most successful nation in human history.” Countries or other actors sufficiently deterred from threatening American interests will not do so,” it reads. One detail in the document stands out more than any other — a reference to a new “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine. The term “corollary” may seem like an odd choice to describe Trump's embrace of the foreign policy position, but it is actually a clear historical nod to a moment when the Monroe Doctrine was used to justify widespread U.S. military actions in the region. Now, analysts believe this is the direction we are headed again. When U.S. President James Monroe issued his state of the union address on December 2, 1823, it included in it an articulation of a foreign policy position that would come to be known as the Monroe Doctrine. President Theodore Roosevelt's 1904 “Roosevelt Corollary” vastly reinterpreted the Monroe Doctrine, essentially turning it into a tool to justify U.S. intervention across the region. “Any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship,” read the Roosevelt Corollary. “Chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation. The United States would roll out exactly that police power — deploying marines, invading and occupying countries, intervening again and again across the Americas, under the guise of stability and security while advancing U.S. interests. “Teddy Roosevelt basically says, our goal is still to kind of keep the Europeans out. We're going to be unilateral,” Alan McPherson, a professor of Latin American history at Temple University, told Truthout. “We're going to be kind of a cop on the beat. And the beat is going to be our neighborhood. “We're going to patrol it, and walk softly, carry a big stick,” McPherson said. But sometimes you have to do it ahead of time.” Trump's use of the word “corollary” is not an accident. Though those goals still may seem unclear, the Trump Corollary reads as a veiled threat against countries who might be unwilling to bend to U.S. interests. “We will assert and enforce a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine,” the National Security Strategy document states. “We want to ensure that the Western Hemisphere remains reasonably stable and well-governed enough to prevent and discourage mass migration to the United States; we want a Hemisphere whose governments cooperate with us against narco-terrorists, cartels, and other transnational criminal organizations; we want a Hemisphere that remains free of hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets, and that supports critical supply chains; and we want to ensure our continued access to key strategic locations.” Arizona State University associate professor of Latin American history Alexander Aviña explains that, for him, the National Security Strategy is the “signal of a realistic assessment from Trump's people that they can't compete, or militarily or economically dominate China.” No more space or tolerance for an alternative government or ideas of governance as represented perhaps by a place like Venezuela or Brazil,” where left governments are unwilling to submit to U.S. demands, Aviña told Truthout. In July, Trump announced a 50 percent tariff on all Brazilian goods, citing a trial against Trump ally, former president Jair Bolsonaro, for attempting to carry out a coup d'état following the 2022 Brazilian elections. “It's just all about sheer U.S. power,” said Aviña. By the early 1980s, Central America was the top focus for U.S. foreign policy, with the United States spending billions of dollars a year in interventionist policies across the region — backing bloody authoritarian dictators and training and supporting paramilitary groups fighting left governments. Isolationism, for the United States, doesn't actually mean isolation. “The National Security Strategy that the Trump Administration just published is essentially saying, we're going to use our military to get more out of Latin America.” “What really comes out of the National Security Strategy, at least in terms of Latin America, is that the priority of the U.S. government is U.S. corporations,” said McPherson. “Venezuela, for the American oil companies, will be a field day,” Florida Republican Congresswoman Maria Salazar told Fox Business, in an interview in late November, where she called for increased U.S. pressure to overthrow president Maduro. Bolivia is home to one of the largest reserves on the planet for lithium, a key ingredient in Lithium-ion batteries, which power the electronic vehicles made by Elon Musk's Tesla. Deal with it,” Elon Musk tweeted in July 2020, in the wake of the 2019 coup against President Evo Morales. Gone are the past U.S. pretexts of spreading democracy, or standing for the good of humanity, or civilization building. “This guy [Trump] shows up and he says, ‘I'm not going to waste my time with that. “I think this is why it's difficult to define what a Trump corollary is other than ‘do what we tell you to do. There is another way some experts see the Trump foreign policy and the new National Security Strategy: A repudiation of the liberal international order set in place in the wake of World War II and a return to a 19th-century idea around sites of power. “Trump believes that these big powers [Russia, China and the United States] are entitled to have their own spheres of influence,” University of Denver Latin American History Professor Rafael Ioris told Truthout. “And in terms of the United States, that region is, of course, the Western hemisphere, which does not bode well for Latin America.” Professor Alexander Aviña says on a scale of 1 to 10, he is highly concerned about the increasing possibility of direct U.S. intervention in Latin America. “If you think about it, the U.S. hasn't directly gotten involved militarily in Latin America many times since the end of World War II.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canadian financier Mark Wiseman has officially been selected by Prime Minister Mark Carney to take up Canada's most important diplomatic role as ambassador to the United States as the country prepares for tough USMCA trade talks, two sources say. Mr. Wiseman, 55, replaces Kirsten Hillman who served in Washington since 2017, including the past six years as ambassador. President Donald Trump and key advisers, such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, would also respect Mr. Wiseman's financial background, the source said. Canada had been holding talks for months to remove tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump on Canadian goods such as steel, aluminum and softwood lumber, but those negotiations were stalled after Ontario ran anti-tariff ads. Mr. Wiseman has no diplomatic or government experience, but he is a seasoned institutional investment player. He is now chair of Lazard, a boutique financial advisory and asset management service. In March, the Prime Minister named Mr. Wiseman to his council of advisers on Canada-U.S. relations. Ms. Hillman told The Globe that the next ambassador must quickly build bridges with Mr. Trump's White House, senior cabinet secretaries and congressional leaders. The new ambassador must also reach out to Mr. Trump's business and political allies outside Washington, she said. Earlier this week, the Conservatives and Bloc Quebecois warned Mr. Carney against appointing his long-time friend to Washington. The non-profit organization advocates increasing Canada's population to 100 million by 2100 solely through immigration. Mr. Wiseman shared a social-media post in May, 2023, that said “100 million may not be federal policy, but it should be – even if it makes Quebec howl.” Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre told the House Wednesday that Mr. Wiseman “is someone who has shown contempt for Quebec and cannot negotiate for Quebec.” Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, said the Century Initiative's call for 100 million population “is not government policy and never will be.” The Conservatives also noted that Mr. Wiseman has been quoted as being opposed to supply management, arguing that it inhibits productivity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For six months, she managed the Journey Service Center, a “psilocybin service center” where adults 21 and older take supervised mushroom trips. She watched elderly clients with terminal illnesses able to enjoy life again. She saw one individual with obsessive compulsive disorder so severe they spent hours washing their hands who could casually eat food that fell on the floor. In 2020, Oregon made history by becoming the first US state to legalize the use of psilocybin in a supervised setting, paving the way for magic mushrooms to treat depression, PTSD and other mental health challenges. But five years later, the pioneering industry is grappling with growing pains. Kluwe recalled how early last year, her business partner abruptly told her the center was out of money and would close in March – the first in a wave of closures that set off alarms about the viability of Oregon's program. The state's total number of licensed service centers has dropped by nearly a third, to 24, since Oregon's psilocybin program launched in 2023. The state's 374 licensed facilitators, people who support clients during sessions, similarly fell. And just this week, Portland's largest “shroom room” – an 11,000 sq ft venue with views of Mt Hood offering guided trips in addition to corporate retreats – reportedly closed down. “The attrition is setting in, and a lot of people are not renewing their license because it is hard to make money,” said Gary Bracelin, the owner of Drop Thesis Psilocybin Service Center. Insurance typically doesn't cover sessions, meaning people have to pay out of pocket. Furthermore, the industry is struggling to reach a diverse group of clients: state data show that most people who've taken legal psilocybin in Oregon are white, over 44 and earn more than roughly $95,000 or more a year. Depending on who you ask, these are either signs of an experiment buckling under hefty rules and fees – or a landmark program finding its footing. “It's not totally shocking for a brand new program to have a higher price tag,” said Heidi Pendergast, Oregon director of advocacy group Healing Advocacy Fund. She added: “I think that any new industry would see this sort of opening and closing.” Some practitioners, however, say the state has a long way to go to realize the program's promises, while other centers are experimenting with new ways to keep costs down, broaden their clientele, and integrate with the mainstream medical system. Legal psilocybin seemed like a natural fit for Bracelin. The self-described serial entrepreneur previously founded a cannabis dispensary chain and did sales and marketing for outdoor products during snowboarding's early days. The center used private funders instead of banks, he said. State rules require centers to pay a $10,000 annual licensing fees, install surveillance cameras, alarm systems and securely store mushrooms in safes. Meanwhile, he said the black market is thriving and less-regulated companies sell products marketed as “magic mushroom edibles” that contain chemicals, some dangerous, instead of psilocybin. Angela Allbee, the manager of Oregon's psilocybin program, said in an emailed statement that the state became the first to enact regulations for a drug that's federally illegal, and those regulations were written with broad input that have proven safe. The drug's illegality at a national level also makes marketing difficult with social media companies banning content that mentions it, Pendergast said. After a wave of people trained to become facilitators, many dropped off because there weren't enough clients, said Max Kelemen, executive director of the Portland Psychedelic Society. “It's like a cart before the horse,” he said. A sign inside advises visitors to remove their shoes before entering an open area where mats are spread out on the floor. Here, the center hosts “microdosing” sessions, where participants take a fraction of the amount of psilocybin used for profound, day-long psychedelic experiences. Centers have turned to microdoses, which have been touted for their supposedly subtle cognitive benefits, to broaden their base of repeat clients with a less costly and time-consuming option. But he added that microdosing will never be the center's main source of income, and insurers covering longer macrodose sessions would be key to long-term sustainability. Drop Thesis also offers microdoses that are paired with black-light painting night or a 1920s-themed interactive murder mystery game. But Bracelin said potential microdose clients are still turned off by the requirements, especially how state regulations bar them from driving home. “You're over regulating us because there is this fear that people are going to freak out and run naked down the street,” Bracelin said. Early last year, Dr Eric Lee had cleared Oregon's bureaucratic hurdles and was on the verge of opening a psilocybin service center. But he hesitated – the only way to make it work financially was to charge clients the prohibitively high rate for a session. Three years ago, Lee found himself depressed after being sued and breaking up with a longtime partner. A friend convinced Lee to go to a music festival where he took mushrooms, felt supported by his group of friends and bounced back. But he acknowledged his model “isn't easily replicable”. Although psilocybin is associated with mental health concerns, the 2020 ballot initiative that created Oregon's program was designed to keep it outside of the medical system. Now, many supporters say it needs an outside source of cash, which could come from integration with the medical system. But it has kept doctors, counselors and other licensed professionals from discussing the legally gray drug with patients for fear of sanctions. A new bill that takes effect next year allows medical professionals to discuss psilocybin with patients, which could open the door to insurance covering part of the cost. Before a session, clients meet with facilitators for “preparation”, to discuss their goals, and again afterward for “integration”, to process the experience. Colorado and New Mexico have both passed psilocybin laws that integrate the drug into their medical systems. Erin Pappas, a facilitator at Drop Thesis and a doctoral student in psychiatric nursing, said she hopes psilocybin will be legally reclassified federally, allowing her to prescribe it to patients. “We're having a mental health crisis in this country right now,” she said. “I don't understand the negativity against something that is working so well.” She said insurers are not likely to cover psilocybin for grief because it isn't medically necessary. But after voters approved it, she began to have regrets. She heard critiques that the initiative would create an overly restrictive system that would cost too much and worsen existing disparities. She started worrying the system critics warned of was taking hold. Instead of stepping back, she went on to co-found the Alma Institute, a now defunct facilitator training school with a focus on diversifying the workforce. Located in a converted residential home on a busy Portland street, the center specializes in group sessions of six to eight participants. Group sessions mean lower costs because the cost of facilitators is split among multiple clients. “There's just something special that happens in groups,” Martinez said. The center welcomes everyone and its clients are mostly white. Prices are sliding scale, with group sessions ranging from $650 to $1,200. The Sheri Eckert Foundation, a psilocybin financial-aid nonprofit, also sponsors some groups. “I'm still hopeful that this model can work,” Martinez said. “But a lot of things would have to go right.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MOSCOW, December 12. The Bank of Russia has filed a lawsuit against the Euroclear depository in the Moscow Arbitration Court for damages caused to the Bank of Russia, the regulator's press service reported. The amount of the claim against the depository was not specified in the statement. "In connection with the illegal actions of the Euroclear depository, which are causing damages to the Bank of Russia, as well as in connection with the mechanisms officially reviewed by the European Commission for the direct or indirect use of Bank of Russia assets without the consent of the Bank of Russia, the Bank of Russia is filing a lawsuit in the Moscow Arbitration Court against the Euroclear depository for damages caused to the Bank of Russia," the statement reads. The regulator stressed that the actions of the Euroclear depository caused damage "due to the inability to manage cash and securities belonging to the Bank of Russia." The majority of Russia's sovereign assets frozen in Europe (over €200 billion) are blocked on Euroclear's platform in Belgium. The depository repeatedly opposed the expropriation of the assets, warning that it could lead to Russia seizing European or Belgian assets elsewhere in the world through legal action. Earlier Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the global financial and economic order would be destroyed, and economic separatism would only intensify, if the West stole Russia's frozen assets. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that Moscow would definitely respond to the theft of its assets in Europe. He stressed that the Kremlin intends to organize legal proceedings against those involved in this scheme.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The humiliation Washington is inflicting on Western Europe today will shape an entire generation of politicians who will eventually have to rediscover how to deal with Russia. The lessons they are absorbing now may prove as important as those learned by previous Western European leaders who built a dialogue with the USSR after 1945. Over the past year, we have grown accustomed to watching the US treat its European allies with increasing roughness. But it would be a mistake to simply enjoy the spectacle. Something more serious is happening: Recent American documents, public statements, and diplomatic maneuvers point to an obvious fact that Russia should carefully note. Its behavior is grounded in a deep cultural arrogance and an instinctive greed, and these are constants that will not change regardless of who sits in the White House. Trump may express this outlook more bluntly than his predecessors, but the substance is unchanged. Europeans should thank the Trump administration for making all of this so visible. Against this backdrop, Russia should not rule out the possibility that relations with our European neighbors could eventually be rebuilt. The half-continent is our neighbor, whether we like it or not. But that does not mean Russia wants to absorb or dominate it. Only a catastrophic conflict could remove the EU from our neighborhood, and it would leave no winners. For any future restoration of ties, at least three conditions matter. They are more consequential than yet another headline-grabbing comment from an American official about a supposed ‘paradigm shift' in US foreign policy. Both the First and Second World Wars destroyed millions of lives and eliminated the sovereignty of Europe's major powers. World War II consolidated American dominance over the half-continent. Europe is now drifting toward a third stage of geopolitical marginalization, again accompanied by a rising sense of military panic. European politicians and generals have become so eager to talk publicly about war with Russia that President Vladimir Putin was forced to address the matter a few days ago. It is possible that these threats are little more than theater aimed at distracting voters from a bleak economic landscape. Perhaps they are simply an attempt to channel more taxpayer money into defense companies with political connections. But as a responsible nuclear power, Russia cannot ignore this rhetoric. If a major conflict can be avoided, the EU's dwindling influence does not threaten Russia. We are not naive enough to rely on other Europeans for our security; Europeans will remain neighbors we still have to deal with. And frankly, weak neighbors are easier to manage than strong ones. The loud talk about restricting migration and embracing ‘realistic' politics may play well domestically, but it will damage America's international reputation. It signals a willingness to abandon unnecessary ideological dogmas. Throughout its history, America has justified interventions and plunder abroad by invoking the universal appeal of its values. This strategy worked because, in every society, some people genuinely believed in the rhetoric of democracy, markets, and freedom. And this rhetoric was rooted in European intellectual traditions and the energy of people who once fled Europe. This is a far weaker basis for sustaining global influence. Will the same number of people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America rally behind Washington's new ‘realism' as they once did behind its claims to defend ‘freedom and democracy'? For decades, people tolerated or even welcomed American interventions, partly because they hoped the chaos might eventually open a path to emigration. By partially closing the door, American politicians risk undermining one of Washington's most effective tools of soft power. Perhaps the US will eventually reverse course. For now, there is no sign of it. Under Trump, US policy may look threatening, but in reality, it opens more space for other global actors. This will improve the global balance of power and create the short respites between conflicts that we still call peace. The final condition relates to Europe's internal politics. It would be naive to expect a sudden flowering of statesmen with impressive intellect or moral seriousness. But perhaps, at a national level, the current crop of hopeless figures from the 1990s and 2000s will gradually be replaced by people slightly better suited to today's reality. The humiliation the US is inflicting on Europe today is not just an episode in transatlantic relations. The politicians who will one day negotiate with Russia are watching the US treat them not as partners, but as subordinates. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's Slavneft-YANOS oil refinery in Yaroslavl, one of the country's five largest, is reportedly on fire after being struck in an overnight drone attack on Dec. 12, officials and local Telegram channels said. Astra, an independent Telegram channel based in Russia, posted photos and video of an ongoing fire at the facility on the morning of Dec. 12. Multiple other regions were targeted throughout the night, including Tver, Smolensk, and Moscow. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said Russian air defenses intercepted eight drones approaching the capital. Ukraine repeatedly uses homegrown long-range drones to launch attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure. Russia's oil and gas production has continued to come under attack as Kyiv attempts to cripple Moscow's primary source of funding for its war in Ukraine. Sonya Bandouil is a North American news editor for The Kyiv Independent. Ukrainian Defense Forces have encircled Russian troops in Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, and cleared its northwestern outskirts, the open-source intelligence group DeepState reported on Dec. 12. Ukraine's Security Service said Friday that it detained three men suspected of planting two homemade bombs that killed a National Guard serviceman and wounded four other people in Kyiv a day earlier. "We must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents and great-grandparents endured," NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned. Russia's Slavneft-YANOS oil refinery in Yaroslavl, one of the country's five largest, is reportedly on fire after being struck in an overnight drone attack on Dec. 12, officials and local Telegram channels said. U.S. President Donald Trump is "extremely frustrated" with both Russia and Ukraine amid ongoing diplomatic efforts to end the war, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a Dec. 11 press briefing, as the United States weighs whether to join Ukraine and European partners for talks this weekend. A drone explosion damaged the lower floors of a residential building in the Russian city of Tver on Dec. 12, injuring at least seven people, according to regional officials and local Telegram channels. Polish authorities have detained Alexander Butyagin, a Russian archaeologist accused of causing extensive damage to historical sites in occupied Crimea, at the request of Ukraine's prosecutor general, Polish media reported Dec. 11.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. She is the author of Autocracy 2.0: How China's Rise Reinvented Tyranny. Why America and China Are the World's Only Great Powers Wars among great powers have killed millions of people; victorious great powers have also set up international orders whose norms and rules affect global peace and prosperity. Great powers also intervene in other countries' politics, covertly and overtly, sometimes violently. Freed from the constraining effects of a great-power rival, Washington deployed its forces around the world and conducted military actions in multiple countries, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Serbia. Multipolarity, meanwhile, in which three or more great powers are present, is said to be the most prone to war because alliances are precarious and the fluidity of alignments makes the balance of power harder to estimate. Although it matters how many great powers there are at a given time, no one agrees on how to define them (and thus count them). Yet all the time, relative power among countries is shifting. During the Cold War, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev vowed that his country would “bury” the United States, and many people feared it would. Widely divergent views about the balance of power are common because power, although foundational to international politics, remains an elusive concept. To reckon with this challenge, I developed a methodology for comparing national power—one that uses common metrics (GDP, for instance, or military expenditure) in modern and historical data to determine a threshold for great-power status. Great powers have often been far weaker than the leading state—the most powerful country in the global system—but nevertheless engaged in dangerous security competitions. This development explains rising tension in U.S.-Chinese relations and suggests that other countries will find it increasingly difficult to stay out of the crossfire of the rivalry. Bipolarity, for instance, helps explain the recent U.S. preoccupation with Latin America, where China has gained significant economic and political influence. As the dynamic between China and the United States grows only more competitive, Washington will find such encroachments intolerable—just as China may similarly refuse to accept U.S. political and military involvement in its own backyard. My methodology began with a list, generated with help from historians and political scientists, of great powers across different historical systems since 1820. Using historical data, I then evaluated which metrics most accurately re-created this list. Previous scholars have argued that the second metric captures two key dimensions of great power—a state's economic size versus its wealth. My metrics supported this argument by effectively distinguishing between great powers and other countries. GDP per capita, however, proved a poor indicator of power and failed to separate the great powers from the lesser powers. GDP per capita is also misleading because it risks obscuring regional heterogeneity. Because it takes the average, GDP per capita obscures this heterogeneity and might misdiagnose a country as middling rather than one with wealthy, technologically advanced regions—regions with latent power and potential geopolitical implications. Overall, this method provides a quantifiable threshold for identifying great powers. The GDP range for normal great powers is between 17 and 45 percent of the leading state's GDP, with a median of 27 percent. Thus, countries with more than roughly 27 percent of the leading state's GDP possess greater economic capabilities than the median great power across history. Whether or not a country can be considered an overall great power depends on how it performs in the other metrics, but this method can reveal whether a country is above or below the basic great-power threshold. It also identifies the dimensions in which a country is stronger or weaker. Such assessments contribute to studies of power transitions in world politics, and create a valuable means of assessing contemporary changes in the balance of power—the extent to which China is declining or India is rising, for example. Asking whether China can catch up to or overtake the United States economically is the wrong question, based on this analytical method. Historically, the leading state competed fiercely with other, far weaker great powers, which often possessed only a quarter or a third of the leader's GDP. China, in other words, does not need to match nor surpass the United States in order to be a great power and competitor. The Soviet Union was a prime example of this reality. But the Soviet Union had, at most, about 40 percent of U.S. GDP. Despite this large imbalance, the Soviets posed a threat of regional hegemony in Europe. China, which today vastly exceeds the Soviet Union in terms of economic power, has the capability to do all this and more. China today, at 36 percent, has a much higher composite score than normal great powers across history. China's score also exceeds that of the Soviet Union, which reached only 16 percent at its peak in 1970. China's relative strength is also captured by the GDP metric: China's score of 130 percent is far higher than the 27 percent median. Skeptics may rightly question China's dodgy economic statistics, but even if China's true GDP is much smaller than it reports, China's margin above the normal range for GDP is so large that it would still be a great power, and well above the Soviet score of 44 percent. China falls short of the Soviet Union in just one dimension—military expenditure. For the Soviets, however, generating such high military spending required devoting a huge share of the economy (as much as 14 percent of GDP) to defense, which ultimately proved unsustainable. China, by contrast, currently spends only about two percent of its GDP on defense, meaning it could ramp up defense spending and yet keep it at a manageable level overall. In short, my metrics suggest that China doesn't need to catch up to the United States but is already a great-power competitor both economically and militarily—one with power that far exceeds that of the United States' last bipolar competitor, the Soviet Union. Critics might doubt whether Beijing can in fact compete, arguing that China's growth is slowing, its economy is suffering from numerous problems, and increasingly repressive policies by Chinese leader Xi Jinping will harm future innovation. Such observations identify important challenges China's economy is facing but miss the mark in a few ways. Fast-growing economies always slow down at about the middle-income stage, and economies that manage to sustain growth typically settle into levels of about one to two percent per year. As has happened in the past with high-growth economies—in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, for instance—slowed growth can be caused by a number of factors, such as increasingly unfavorable demographics, rising wages, and financial crises caused by years of massive investment. Thus, China's success isn't a question of whether it can maintain its sky-high growth rates of the 1990s, but whether its economy can settle into mature and far lower rates of growth. In this transition, the Chinese economy indeed faces major challenges, including a troubled real estate sector, massive debt, and the problem of what scholars call “involution”—hypercompetition among firms over shrinking profit margins. Nobody can predict how effectively the CCP will handle these challenges, but declarations of “peak China” are premature. Previously, skeptics have argued that China's regime would be toppled, or its economic growth torpedoed, by a variety of maladies—public backlash in response to repressive COVID-19 policies, for example, or the costs of mitigating environmental devastation. Most important, assuming that one's competitor will collapse, particularly when that competitor has a leadership as adaptive and capable as China's, is a poor guide for policy. Other skeptics argue that Xi's policies—tightening controls on civil society, increasing oversight of the private sector (as seen in the tech industry crackdown after 2020), and pursuing a variety of other “neo-authoritarian” approaches—undermine China's innovative capabilities. Innovation is indeed vital for Chinese geopolitical competitiveness, and great powers must compete at the technological cutting edge. If Xi pursues policies that stymie innovation, China will struggle to keep up. But many of Beijing's policies seem to be working. Large government investment in key sectors such as green energy, robotics, and biotechnology has helped Chinese firms innovate and become more commercially competitive. Russia, after all, invaded neighboring Ukraine in 2022, and its alliance with China has powerful geopolitical consequences. The increasingly influential role of middle powers, however, should not be confused with multipolarity, because none of these middle powers exceeds the great-power threshold for economic and military power. Whether they follow through on pledges to increase defense spending and break the great-power threshold as a result remains uncertain. If Russia were a great power, it would have defeated Ukraine and threatened regional dominance over western Europe, as the Soviets did in the Cold War. India may someday reach great-power status if it continues to grow economically and increases its military expenditures, but it currently sits below the great-power bar. In these early years of the bipolar era, competition between China and the United States is growing across every domain: trade, finance, technology, global governance, and military power. The first rule of bipolarity, however, is secure your backyard. In East Asia, China will likely move to enforce its own version of the Monroe Doctrine. “Don't make us choose” has been the mantra of many East Asian countries, including some U.S. treaty allies. But under bipolarity, the luxury of choice is not one afforded to small countries in a superpower's backyard.

Tyler Robinson, the Utah man accused of killing conservative commentator Charlie Kirk earlier this year, appeared in court in person for the first time on Dec. 11 as the judge considers how much access the media will have in the prominent criminal case.

The state of Utah has charged Robinson, 22, with aggravated murder in the Sept. 10 shooting of Kirk during an event at the Utah Valley University campus in Orem. The school is located several miles away from the courthouse in Provo, where Robinson appeared on Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cookie Queens will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival next year in the Sussexes' latest media venture The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will produce a new documentary for the Sundance Film Festival about girl scouts selling cookies. Cookie Queens will be a “a coming-of-age story about the joys, pressures, and pain points woven into one of America's most cherished rituals: Girl Scout Cookie season,” according to the festival programme seen by Deadline. Sundance's programme says the documentary, directed by Alysa Nahmias, follows “four tenacious girls (who) strive to be a top-selling ‘Cookie Queen', navigating an $800 million (£598 million) business in which childhood and ambition collide”. It will premiere at the Rose Wagner Performing Arts Center in Salt Lake City on Jan 24. “As a former girl scout myself, with my mom as my troop leader, I have a personal affinity for this film and am proud that all our conversations and collaboration have led to Archewell Productions partnering with this award-winning team to executive produce this incredibly captivating documentary,” the duchess told Deadline. “When we first viewed the early footage of this documentary, it was immediately something we wanted to be involved in. Last April, the duchess shared photographs of herself as a child selling cookies in her uniform. It coincided with the launch of her podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, and her As Ever shortbread butter cookies. The duke and duchess said in August that they would be extending their creative partnership via Archewell to work on more TV and film projects.</p>
