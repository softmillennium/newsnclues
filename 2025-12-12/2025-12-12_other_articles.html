                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steven Spielberg's new UFO movie has reignited speculation within the alien conspiracy theory community, especially after cryptic billboards teasing the upcoming film popped up across the country this week. “All will be disclosed,” read billboards for the forthcoming flick in New York City and Los Angeles, alongside the “E.T. “A conspiracy theory that's so crazy it just might be brilliant!” Chris Ramsay, who has a YouTube channel devoted to UFO theories, wrote on X. “What if Spielberg has been granted unprecedented access to real UAP footage or better yet, an actual UFO?” The tinfoil hat wearer added that there is “no better way to get disclosure” than by the “very means which have conditioned us to believe in them in the first place. However, Ramsay also speculated that Spielberg's next project might be “another way to control the narrative” around extraterrestrial life. “Good luck searching ‘UFO Disclosure' after this movie hits the theatres…” he wrote. Last year, hundreds of residents reported seeing mysterious lights flying around the state. While several people thought they might be witnessing UFOs, the Trump Administration later confirmed that the mysterious aircraft were FAA-authorized drones. But this wouldn't be the first time one of Spielberg's movies has ignited alien conspiracy theories. Back in 2011, while discussing a special screening Ronald Reagan hosted for “E.T. “There are a number of people in this room who know that everything on that screen is absolutely true,” Reagan reportedly shared. Spielberg himself, meanwhile, believes in alien life and has shared his thoughts about the subject several times in the past. “I think that's totally impossible,” he added.</p>

Move aside, Bermuda Triangle: The newest North Atlantic mystery lies beneath this enigmatic archipelago. Scientists have discovered a strange, 12.4-mile-thick (20 kilometers) rock layer below the oceanic crust under Bermuda. This level of thickness has never been seen in any other similar layer worldwide. While the origin of this layer is not entirely clear, it may explain an ongoing mystery about Bermuda, Frazer told Live Science. But there is no evidence of any ongoing volcanic activity creating that swell — the island's last known volcanic eruption was 31 million years ago. Bermuda has long had a reputation for mystery, largely because of the Bermuda Triangle, an area between the archipelago, Florida and Puerto Rico where a supposedly unusual number of ships and aircraft have gone missing. Island chains such as Hawaii are thought to exist because of mantle hotspots, which are places in the mantle where hot material rises, creating volcanic activity. Bermuda's swell hasn't subsided, despite 31 million years of volcanic inactivity there, Frazer said. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Frazer and study co-author Jeffrey Park, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Yale University, used recordings from a seismic station on Bermuda of distant large earthquakes around the world to get an image of Earth down to about 31 miles (50 km) below Bermuda. They examined places where the seismic waves from these quakes suddenly changed. Their findings were published Nov. 28 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. "There is still this material that is left over from the days of active volcanism under Bermuda that is helping to potentially hold it up as this area of high relief in the Atlantic Ocean," Sarah Mazza, a geologist at Smith College in Massachusetts who was not involved in the work, told Live Science. Mazza's own research into Bermuda's volcanic history found that the types of lavas there are low in the mineral silica, which is a sign that they come from rock high in carbon. This difference may be because the Atlantic, which opened up when Pangea split apart, is a young ocean compared to the Pacific or Indian oceans, which were at Pangea's edges. —Scientists find hidden 'hotspot' that helped create the Great Lakes before North America even existed — Mysterious 'blobs' in Earth's mantle are not what we thought, study claims — Extreme 'paradise' volcano in Costa Rica is like a piece of ancient Mars on our doorstep "Understanding a place like Bermuda, which is an extreme location, is important to understand places that are less extreme," Frazer said, "and gives us a sense of what are the more normal processes that happen on Earth and what are the more extreme processes that happen."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We have officially entered the conspiracy theory phase of the Philadelphia Eagles season, and honestly, it was only a matter of time. When a team loses three straight games, all of them as favorites, the brain starts reaching for explanations that go beyond missed throws and bad turnovers. That is how we ended up here, with fans squinting at HBO's Hard Knocks like it is the Zapruder film. Is it convenient that Hard Knocks shows up right when the Eagles looked like they had the NFC East wrapped up and then everything immediately goes sideways? After the past few weeks, I understand why people are at least entertaining the thought. Angry fanbase, star quarterback struggling, offense sputtering, and a weekly primetime microscope courtesy of HBO. ESPN, HBO, and every rage bait outlet in existence is eating this up. What they fail to realize is that Birds fans are sports psychopaths in the most affectionate sense. That made a lot of people uncomfortable. For whatever reason, everyone outside Philadelphia hates the Eagles. Maybe it is Jalen Hurts being different than the traditional quarterback mold. The hate is real, and it always has been. People are watching because the Birds are struggling, not because the league is scripted. If the NFL were scripted, the Chiefs would have already three-peated and we would not even be having this conversation. Just when you thought it couldn't possibly get any worse, Spike Eskin proposes an ‘Eagles Positivity Pledge' against the Raiders on Sunday which includes standing ovations and no booing >> At some point, the conspiracy theories stop being fun and start becoming a distraction. The Eagles are not losing because of cameras, producers, or a hidden agenda. Win games and the noise dies down. Win games and Hard Knocks is forced to show the Eagles doing what they do best. Dan Orlovsky went on First Take and did what way… This is exactly the type of nonsense I was talking… Following Monday night's horrendous loss to the LA Chargers, an…</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In case you missed it, the demon-hunting siblings of Supernatural recently made their return a full 20 years after the debut of the hit series by way of a new comic series. Written by Greg Pak and illustrated by Eder Messias, the first issue hit shelves back in October with the third installment slated for an arrival on December 17. The latest to come from the folks at Dynamite, the Supernatural comic returns fans to that sweet spot and takes them along with Sam and Dean while they travel from one American town to the next in search of monsters. For those out there who are ready to reconnect with the Winchester brothers, but aren't quite sure they can do a 15-season rewatch, the first few issues are precisely what the doctor ordered. In the last five years since the fan-favorite series came to an end, fans have questioned whether this was truly the last time that we'd see Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki as Dean and Sam Winchester, respectively. In that time, the pair have joined with several other cast mates to travel around the world and meet fans at special Supernatural conventions, which has certainly kept the hope alive. Right now, both leading men are incredibly busy with their own projects and hustles, but there is still a chance that the gang will get back together again, it just might look a little bit different. I think a limited series would be great.” For now, audiences can continue the story by going back in time to the golden era of Supernatural with Dynamite's new comic series.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conservatives are more likely than liberals to believe conspiracy theories and share fake science news. That's the key finding from a large Swedish study that tracked how people across the political spectrum responded to different types of misinformation. Across three studies with samples of 1,005 (Sweden), 417 (U.K.), and 1,008 (Sweden) — with one Swedish sample analyzed in two separate papers — the research offers a more nuanced picture than the usual “one side is worse” narrative that dominates debates about fake news. Author Julia Aspernäs, from the Department of Behavioural Sciences and Learning at Linköping University in Sweden, found evidence of both symmetries and asymmetries in misinformation susceptibility. It all depends on what type of misinformation you're looking at. When researchers asked people about conspiracy theories, like whether the science behind global warming has been invented or distorted, or whether experiments with new drugs are routinely carried out on the public without their knowledge or consent, conservatives consistently believed them more often than liberals. This pattern held up even after accounting for other factors like education level and thinking styles. When participants encountered scientific results in a fictional social media scenario covering controversial topics like gender differences, organized crime, and unemployment, conservatives reported higher willingness to post misleading summaries that twisted the research to match their views. Aspernäs also tested whether people could spot flawed logic in political arguments. Both liberals and conservatives failed this test in the same way. Neither side was better at catching their own bias. This matters because it suggests that when people have skin in the game politically, they bend facts at similar rates regardless of ideology. One trait did protect people from some types of misinformation: taking time to think things through rather than going with gut instinct. Most people immediately think “10 kronor.” But if you pause and work it out, the answer is actually 5 kronor. People who caught these tricks were better at spotting logical flaws in political arguments, whether conservative or liberal. Slowing down and double-checking your instincts appeared to help people resist at least some forms of bias. It helped with logic puzzles but didn't stop people from believing conspiracy theories or sharing misleading science posts. Aspernäs uncovered another factor that has been almost completely neglected in misinformation research: what people believe about truth itself. Others lean toward thinking truth is personal or subjective. Someone with strong subjectivist beliefs might agree that “truth is nothing more than a person's subjective experience of the world.” People with stronger subjectivist beliefs about truth were more likely to fall for impressive-sounding nonsense, believe conspiracy theories, and report willingness to share fake science news. This finding points to a deeper vulnerability than political bias. If someone thinks truth depends on personal feelings rather than evidence, they may be more susceptible to misinformation that triggers the right emotions, regardless of facts. The study doesn't fully explain why conservatives show higher rates of conspiracy belief. It's not that they're worse at analytical thinking or more biased in general; the research found them similar to liberals on those dimensions. One possibility is that conservative ideology attracts people with certain personality traits, like stronger distrust of institutions, that also make conspiracy theories more appealing. Another is that right now, many popular conspiracy theories happen to align with conservative narratives, though this wouldn't explain why the pattern shows up even with politically neutral conspiracies. Aspernäs stresses that the findings describe group averages, not individuals. Both sides engage in motivated reasoning when their political identity is threatened. But conservatives show an additional vulnerability to conspiracy thinking and science misinformation that appears separate from this bias. Teaching people to check their logic might help with motivated reasoning. But conspiracy beliefs might require addressing deeper issues about trust in institutions. And if someone fundamentally believes truth is subjective, fact-checking might not work at all. American conservatives might show different patterns than Swedish or British ones. But the finding that misinformation susceptibility isn't one-dimensional — that people can be resistant to some types while vulnerable to others — likely applies across cultures. They just show up in different ways depending on what you're measuring. The research used online surveys where people reported their own beliefs and stated willingness rather than tracking actual behavior. People may not always accurately report what they believe, or their survey responses might not match how they'd act in real situations. The science misinformation measure used hypothetical social media scenarios rather than observing what people actually share online. One study asked participants to evaluate logical arguments but instructed them not to think too long before answering, which might have accidentally encouraged snap judgments over careful reasoning. An attempt to experimentally manipulate people's beliefs about truth was unsuccessful, preventing conclusions about whether believing truth is subjective actually causes greater susceptibility to misinformation. All participants came from Sweden or the United Kingdom. Patterns might differ in other countries with different political cultures and media environments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thanks to Dynamite, Dean and Sam Winchester have officially returned to Supernatural for a Season 1.5, and yes, this is a canonical return. With the brothers back to small-town monster hunting, the only Supernatural sequel worth making just became more likely: a spinoff that explores Adam's time in Hell. For those out of the loop, Sam and Dean have returned to the Golden Era of Supernatural in Greg Pak & Eder Messias' Supernatural comic series, set between Seasons 1 and 2 of the TV show. Two issues have been released so far, with Supernatural #3 hitting comic shelves on December 17, 2025. So why does this series make a sequel more likely than ever? The fact that the Supernatural franchise is once again dipping its toes into comics makes it more likely that this universe will continue to be explored in this format. With Dynamite's Supernatural taking place between Seasons 1 and 2, it's clear the publisher is interested in expanding lore directly connected to the TV series. Dynamite could truly capitalize on building a comic empire for the Supernatural franchise. For those needing a quick refresher, Adam Milligan was Sam and Dean Winchester's half-brother, introduced in Season 4, Episode 19, “Jump the Shark.” The brothers didn't know he existed until they investigated a case that ended with the discovery that Adam and his mother had been killed by a ghoul. Adam was eventually resurrected by angels to serve as a temporary vessel for the archangel Michael in the Season 5 finale after Dean refused. While Sam is rescued from Hell the following season, Adam remains trapped, and the fact that he was essentially forgotten has long been a running joke among fans. When Chuck kills Michael, Adam's soul survives, with the show implying that he finally finds peace, closing a wild chapter in the Winchester saga. While the show eventually tied up Adam's story, fans were never shown his time in Hell with Michael. With Supernatural returning for Season 1.5 through Dynamite, it would be beyond epic if a spin-off series explored Adam and Michael's full story in Hell, finally giving fans the long-awaited exploration of the “forgotten Winchester” brother's untold journey.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than seven decades after a mysterious series of light flashes were captured in California's night sky, scientists are still debating what they mean. Two new peer-reviewed papers suggest that thousands of unexplained bursts recorded by the historic Palomar telescope might be linked to Cold War nuclear tests and even UFO sightings — a claim that's igniting controversy in the scientific community. They also coincided with a sharp rise in reported UFO sightings. While random meteors, variable stars, or camera glitches could explain some flashes, several of the Palomar events display unusual traits — sharp, bright points seemingly aligned in straight lines — that don't match any known natural or technical causes. “We've ruled out some of the ordinary explanations, which means we have to at least consider that these might be artificial objects,” said co-author Bruehl, an anesthesiologist at Vanderbilt University with a keen interest in UFO research. Bruehl worked alongside Beatriz Villarroel, an astronomer at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in Sweden. “If these transients are reflective objects orbiting Earth — and they predate Sputnik — who put them there? And why do they seem connected to nuclear testing?” Bruehl asked. “Even the UFO, or UAP, reports from that era are anecdotal and haven't been verified for accuracy.” Modern observatories — from California's Zwicky Transient Facility to Hawaii's Pan-STARRS — regularly detect thousands of short-lived flashes in the sky. Most of these transients are tied to known cosmic events: eruptions from comets and asteroids, exploding stars, flickering black holes, or neutron star mergers that create brilliant kilonova bursts. For now, though, the Palomar flashes remain an open question — a relic of early astronomy that continues to intrigue scientists and fuel speculation about what might really be shining, and vanishing, above us. - We advocate for science as a source of learning and daily wonder</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The man who has staked his reputation—and billions of pounds—on turning humanity into an interplanetary species has a surprising secret: he doesn't believe in aliens. Elon Musk may be determined to colonise Mars, but when it comes to Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) buzzing Earth's atmosphere, the world's richest man is convinced they have nothing to do with little green men and everything to do with weapons programmes right here on our planet. This startling dichotomy—the audacious visionary versus the grounded sceptic—was laid bare during his recent appearance on Katie Miller's podcast, where he offered a definitive dismissal of extraterrestrial life visiting Earth. It's a claim that carries considerable weight, given that Musk is, arguably, the person most likely to be tipped off to any cosmic secrets, running the company responsible for more civilian space launches than anyone else. 'I have seen no evidence of aliens,' Musk told Miller, before addressing the notion that a major player like SpaceX might be withholding cosmic knowledge. 'No one on the SpaceX senior team has any evidence of aliens. This is a promise the fifty-four-year-old billionaire has made before, explicitly stating during a previous interview with Joe Rogan that he is not part of some global celestial cover-up. If any evidence of non-human intelligence were to cross his desk, the public, he insists, would be the first to know. I will come on your show, and I will reveal it on the show,' he had guaranteed the popular podcast host. Yet, his dismissal of aliens pivots directly into a far more worrying theory when discussing the prevalence of UFO sightings. For Musk, these mysterious objects aren't vehicles from another star system, but rather terrestrial prototypes developed by governments right here on Earth, likely the US government. His assessment is cold, cynical, and centred firmly on national security, suggesting these are not interstellar explorers but rather advanced military hardware. 'UFOs... it could be like a new weapons programme... or hypersonic missiles. While he is a sceptic of external threats, Musk remains committed to solving what he views as humanity's greatest existential weakness: having all our eggs in one planetary basket. Earlier this year, the entrepreneur claimed there would be a self-sustaining city on Mars in 20 years. He is targeting 2028 for the launch of an unmanned Starship mission, with a crewed flight likely to follow in 2030. 'Slight chance of Starship flight to Mars crewed by Optimus in Nov/Dec next year. A lot needs to go right for that. He later affirmed that Mars will have a 'self-sustaining city in 20 to 30 years.' Musk's vision for planetary redundancy, however, comes with a terrifying potential consequence for the first generation of true Martians—a consequence that has been scrutinised by the scientific community. Biologist Scott Solomon has previously argued that human colonisation of Mars could 'kill humanity,' suggesting the living conditions would be so 'brutal' that they would spark rapid, catastrophic evolutionary changes. In his book, Future Humans, the author predicted that children born to Mars settlers would endure drastic evolutionary changes, a process that could result in them developing 'brittle bones,' 'weaker muscles,' and a 'freakishly green colouring' due to the unforgiving combination of low gravity and high radiation. Other predicted mutations include an inevitable change in skin colour and a resulting loss of eyesight. The future, according to Elon Musk, holds no little green men, only the terrifying spectre of clandestine, hyper-advanced weaponry on Earth, or a biological mutation lottery on Mars. As humanity stands on the cusp of an interstellar jump, the real question is not if we will survive, but what we will become.</p>
