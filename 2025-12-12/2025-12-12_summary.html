The administration's National Security Strategy signals a return to more outwardly interventionist policies.

On Wednesday, December 10, Donald Trump announced that the United States had seized a tanker in the Caribbean carrying more than 1.6 million barrels of Venezuelan crude oil.

“Large tanker, very large, largest one ever, actually, and other things are happening,” Trump told the press.

The seizure is only the latest move in a long build-up of U.S. military action in the Caribbean and increasing U.S. threats against Venezuela and its President Nicolas Maduro.

Trump — without evidence — says Maduro is the head of an international terrorist group running drugs into the United States. He has called Maduro's days numbered.

Over the last three months, the United States has hit at least 22 alleged “drug boats” in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people. The campaign is the first unilateral lethal action the U.S. military has undertaken in Latin America since the 1980s.

The United States has now amassed the largest military buildup in the Caribbean in decades, including the world's largest warship, the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford. Fifteen thousand U.S. troops are stationed in the region, on the ready.

Responding to news of the tanker seizure, Democratic Senator Chris Coons told NewsNation that he is “gravely concerned that [Trump] is sleepwalking us into a war with Venezuela.”

Even Congress has been shocked by how the administration has conducted the boat strikes. But a new document offers insight into the thought process behind Trump's threats and actions in the region.

On December 4, the White House released a 33-page document titled the National Security Strategy. It lays out U.S. military goals and foreign policy strategies for the world.

“In everything we do, we are putting America First,” it reads on page two. “This document is a roadmap to ensure that America remains the greatest and most successful nation in human history.”

The National Security Strategy condemns U.S. foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. It champions the U.S. economy and military and says that the United States “must be preeminent” in the Americas and around the world. If there is one overarching principle it is the concept of “peace through strength.”

“Strength is the best deterrent. Countries or other actors sufficiently deterred from threatening American interests will not do so,” it reads. “The United States must maintain the strongest economy, develop the most advanced technologies, bolster our society's cultural health, and field the world's most capable military.”

Front and center is the Western Hemisphere. It's the first region mentioned in the document — China isn't mentioned until page 23. The priority and focus on the Americas clearly marks a shift away from U.S. attention elsewhere around the world.

One detail in the document stands out more than any other — a reference to a new “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine. This is made twice — first it's included top among the overall policy goals and then again in the section on the Western Hemisphere.

The term “corollary” may seem like an odd choice to describe Trump's embrace of the foreign policy position, but it is actually a clear historical nod to a moment when the Monroe Doctrine was used to justify widespread U.S. military actions in the region.

Now, analysts believe this is the direction we are headed again.

When U.S. President James Monroe issued his state of the union address on December 2, 1823, it included in it an articulation of a foreign policy position that would come to be known as the Monroe Doctrine.

Essentially, the doctrine was a message to European countries following the independence of most of the countries of the Americas: Foreign powers had no right to interfere in the politics of the newly independent nations of the Western Hemisphere.

The “doctrine” was applauded by many independence leaders in the Western Hemisphere, including Simon Bolivar.

But by the beginning of the 20th century, the United States had grown in prominence, power and ambition. President Theodore Roosevelt's 1904 “Roosevelt Corollary” vastly reinterpreted the Monroe Doctrine, essentially turning it into a tool to justify U.S. intervention across the region.

“Any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship,” read the Roosevelt Corollary. “Chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation. And in the Western Hemisphere, the adherence of the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power.”

The United States would roll out exactly that police power — deploying marines, invading and occupying countries, intervening again and again across the Americas, under the guise of stability and security while advancing U.S. interests.

“Teddy Roosevelt basically says, our goal is still to kind of keep the Europeans out. But in order to do that, we're going to be proactive. We're going to be unilateral,” Alan McPherson, a professor of Latin American history at Temple University, told Truthout. “We're going to be kind of a cop on the beat. And the beat is going to be our neighborhood. It's going to be the Caribbean.”

“We're going to patrol it, and walk softly, carry a big stick,” McPherson said. “And we're going to have this sort of international police power to keep foreigners out. But sometimes you have to do it ahead of time.”

In the subsequent years, the United States would invade and occupy the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and many more countries, under the pretext of the Monroe Doctrine.

The late distinguished historian of U.S. foreign policy Walter LaFeber wrote that it got “to the point where the United States Marines become known in the area as ‘State Department troops' because they are always moving in to protect State Department interests and State Department policy in the Caribbean.”

Trump's use of the word “corollary” is not an accident. It is a direct reassertion of a return to a Monroe Doctrine where the U.S. flexes military, political, and economic power to achieve its goals in the region. Though those goals still may seem unclear, the Trump Corollary reads as a veiled threat against countries who might be unwilling to bend to U.S. interests.

“We will assert and enforce a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine,” the National Security Strategy document states. “We want to ensure that the Western Hemisphere remains reasonably stable and well-governed enough to prevent and discourage mass migration to the United States; we want a Hemisphere whose governments cooperate with us against narco-terrorists, cartels, and other transnational criminal organizations; we want a Hemisphere that remains free of hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets, and that supports critical supply chains; and we want to ensure our continued access to key strategic locations.”

Analysts say the Trump administration's visible actions toward Latin America in recent months — the seizure of the oil tanker, the boat attacks, threats of war with Venezuela, intervention into Honduran elections, tariffs on Brazil — all fit into this rubric.

Arizona State University associate professor of Latin American history Alexander Aviña explains that, for him, the National Security Strategy is the “signal of a realistic assessment from Trump's people that they can't compete, or militarily or economically dominate China.”

“So the way to take on China is to retrench U.S. power and dominance in the Americas. No more space or tolerance for an alternative government or ideas of governance as represented perhaps by a place like Venezuela or Brazil,” where left governments are unwilling to submit to U.S. demands, Aviña told Truthout. In July, Trump announced a 50 percent tariff on all Brazilian goods, citing a trial against Trump ally, former president Jair Bolsonaro, for attempting to carry out a coup d'état following the 2022 Brazilian elections.

“It's just all about sheer U.S. power,” said Aviña.

In moments of defeat or weakness, the U.S. has often returned its focus to dominating the hemisphere. This happened in the wake of the Vietnam War. By the early 1980s, Central America was the top focus for U.S. foreign policy, with the United States spending billions of dollars a year in interventionist policies across the region — backing bloody authoritarian dictators and training and supporting paramilitary groups fighting left governments.

Isolationism, for the United States, doesn't actually mean isolation. It means the U.S. shifting its attention back onto its own hemisphere, and doubling down on the countries the United States has long considered its own backyard.

“If we think back historically, to the moment of so-called U.S. isolationism in Latin America,” said Aviña, “that was actually a period of constant U.S. military intervention to the tune of 34 invasions,” marked over a period from the end of the 19th century until the mid-1930s.

Like the Roosevelt Corollary, which, following 1904, would be used for years to justify intervention after intervention across the region, the new National Security Strategy is a means of justifying the policies, threats, and attacks Trump may unleash across the region.

“It's going to take a while to digest everything, but it's easy to think of this as a return to imperialism — sort of neo-imperialism — where the United States is using its military force to get what it wants,” McPherson told Truthout. “The National Security Strategy that the Trump Administration just published is essentially saying, we're going to use our military to get more out of Latin America.”

That includes raw resources and markets. It is not by accident that Venezuela is Trump's top target. Venezuela happens to be both one of the most antagonistic left governments to U.S. interests in the region and the country with the largest proven oil reserves on the planet, just across the Caribbean from the United States.

McPherson said that the goal of the corollary is more about an intensification of neoliberalism, rather than a simple return to the past. “What really comes out of the National Security Strategy, at least in terms of Latin America, is that the priority of the U.S. government is U.S. corporations,” said McPherson. “What this government is essentially saying is that governments are neoliberal puppets of corporations. And so we need to apply this to foreign policy.”

Trump allies are excited for a heyday for U.S. corporations if Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is removed. “Venezuela, for the American oil companies, will be a field day,” Florida Republican Congresswoman Maria Salazar told Fox Business, in an interview in late November, where she called for increased U.S. pressure to overthrow president Maduro. “This is a number 1 goal for this administration from the economic standpoint.”

“It's just pure extraction,” said Aviña. “It's like that Elon Musk tweet about how we will intervene in Bolivia to get all the lithium that we want whenever we want.”

Bolivia is home to one of the largest reserves on the planet for lithium, a key ingredient in Lithium-ion batteries, which power the electronic vehicles made by Elon Musk's Tesla.

“We will coup whoever we want! Deal with it,” Elon Musk tweeted in July 2020, in the wake of the 2019 coup against President Evo Morales.

Gone are the past U.S. pretexts of spreading democracy, or standing for the good of humanity, or civilization building.

“This guy [Trump] shows up and he says, ‘I'm not going to waste my time with that. This is about sheer revanchism and power. And if you don't do what we tell you to do, we're going to make you pay',” said Aviña. “I think this is why it's difficult to define what a Trump corollary is other than ‘do what we tell you to do.'”

There is another way some experts see the Trump foreign policy and the new National Security Strategy: A repudiation of the liberal international order set in place in the wake of World War II and a return to a 19th-century idea around sites of power.

“Trump believes that these big powers [Russia, China and the United States] are entitled to have their own spheres of influence,” University of Denver Latin American History Professor Rafael Ioris told Truthout. “And in terms of the United States, that region is, of course, the Western hemisphere, which does not bode well for Latin America.”

“It's not entirely surprising given the extreme right logic, but it's somewhat surprising because it hasn't really been seen in the 21st century.”

Professor Alexander Aviña says on a scale of 1 to 10, he is highly concerned about the increasing possibility of direct U.S. intervention in Latin America.

“It's seven or eight,” he told Truthout. “If you think about it, the U.S. hasn't directly gotten involved militarily in Latin America many times since the end of World War II. Dominican Republic in 1965. They invaded Grenada in 1983. Panama, 1989. So the fact that we are where we're at now … It's a really scary moment that hopefully we will somehow avoid.”

The bill passed with 20 Republicans joining all Democrats in voting “yes,” in a rare rebuke to Trump.

As we produce journalism that combats authoritarianism, censorship, injustice, and misinformation, your support is urgently needed. Please make a year-end gift to Truthout today.

The House has voted on a bipartisan basis to restore labor rights to 1 million federal workers after President Donald Trump yanked them away in an executive order earlier this year, in a rare show of defiance against the president by over a dozen GOP members.

In a 231 to 195 vote on Thursday afternoon, the House passed the Protect America's Workforce Act, which would nullify Trump's orders in March and August to exempt workers at dozens of agencies from collective bargaining rights.

The bill passed with 20 Republicans joining all Democrats in voting “yes.” The bill simply nullifies the order and says that collective bargaining agreements — known otherwise as union contracts — in effect before the order will be restored.

The legislation was forced onto the floor after a discharge petition surpassed the requisite 218 signatures in November. The bill now goes to the Senate, where it may face more difficult odds of passing the chamber's 60-vote threshold. A companion bill introduced in the Senate has 48 cosponsors, only one of them Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. 

Trump's orders have been slammed by labor advocates as the largest single act of union busting in U.S. history. They were especially disastrous for the labor movement since public sector workers are unionized at a far higher rate than those in the private sector. 

The affected unions had sued the Trump administration following the March order, but a federal appeals court had allowed it to stand, paving the way for Trump to issue his follow-up order in August to strip yet more workers of union rights.

Advocates had already decried restrictions on federal workers' labor rights that were in place before Trump's orders; those restrictions limit workers to bargaining solely on labor conditions, and not factors like wages or benefits.

Labor advocates celebrated the House vote.

“President Trump betrayed workers when he tried to rip away our collective bargaining rights. In these increasingly polarized times, working people delivered a rare bipartisan majority to stop the administration's unprecedented attacks on our freedoms,” said AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler in a statement. 

“Americans trust unions more than either political party. As we turn to the Senate — where the bill already has bipartisan support — working people are calling on the politicians we elected to stand with us, even if it means standing up to the union-busting boss in the White House,” Shuler said.

Indeed, approval of labor unions has reached highs, hovering around 70 percent in recent years as the labor movement and unionization surged.

The order threatens to withhold federal funding from states or sue states that implement AI regulations.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order aimed at preventing state-level regulation of the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry, a gift to tech corporations that bankrolled his inauguration and are currently funding his White House ballroom project.

Trump's order instructs the US Justice Department to establish an AI Litigation Task Force with a single mandate: sue states that enact AI laws that the administration deems “onerous and excessive.” The order also threatens to withhold federal funding from states that implement AI regulations.

Public Citizen, a watchdog group that has tracked increasingly aggressive AI influence-peddling in Congress and the administration, said Trump's order “grants his greedy Big Tech buddies' Christmas wish.”

“This reward to Big Tech is a disgraceful invitation to reckless behavior by the world's largest corporations and a complete override of the federalist principles that Trump and MAGA claim to venerate,” said Robert Weissman, Public Citizen's co-president. “Everyone should understand why this is happening: During and since the last election cycle, Big Tech has spent at least $1.1 billion on campaign contributions and lobby expenditures. Big Tech corporations poured money into Trump's inaugural committee and to pay for his garish White House ballroom. A major Big Tech and AI investor is serving as Trump's ‘AI czar' and driving administration policy.”

“While Trump has ensured the federal government is doing almost nothing to address the harms that AI is already causing, states are moving forward with sensible AI regulation,” Weissman added. “These include efforts to address political deepfakes, nonconsensual intimate deepfakes, algorithmic pricing manipulation, consumer protection measures, excessive data center electricity and water demand, and much more. Big Tech is whining about these modest measures, but there is zero evidence that these rules are impeding innovation; in fact, they are directing innovation in more positive directions.”

Jenna Sherman, a campaign director focused on tech and gender at Ultraviolet Action, said Trump's order “only has one group of winners: his wealthy donors in the tech sector.”

“Every other person loses from this wildly unpopular move. And not just in theory, as stripping away state AI regulations puts many — namely, women and children — at risk of real harm,” said Sherman. “These harms of AI — which the Trump and the tech sector are clearly happy to ignore — are already here: non-consensual deepfake porn sexualizing women and girls, children being led to suicidal ideation by AI chatbots, and AI-powered scams and crimes targeting older Americans, especially women, to name but a few.”

The US Chamber of Commerce and other corporate lobbying organizations representing tech giants such as Microsoft and Google celebrated the order, predictably characterizing it as a win for “small businesses.”

The leaders of California and other states that have proposed and finalized AI regulations were defiant in the face of Trump's threats of legal action and funding cuts.“

“President Trump and Davis Sacks aren't making policy — they're running a con,” said California Gov. Gavin Newsom, referring to the scandal-plagued White House AI czar. “Every day, they push the limits to see how far they can take it. California is working on behalf of Americans by building the strongest innovation economy in the nation while implementing commonsense safeguards and leading the way forward.”

Trump signed the order after the Republican-controlled Congress repeatedly rejected efforts to tuck a ban on state AI regulations into broader legislation.

“After months of failed lobbying and two defeats in Congress, Big Tech has finally received the return on its ample investment in Donald Trump,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said in a statement Thursday. “With this executive order, Trump is delivering exactly what his billionaire benefactors demanded — all at the expense of our kids, our communities, our workers, and our planet.”

“A broad, bipartisan coalition in Congress has rejected the AI moratorium again and again,” he added, “and I intend to keep that streak going. I will use every tool available to challenge this indefensible and irresponsible power grab. We will defeat it again.”

Prime Minister Mark Carney is expected to officially announce that he's chosen financier Mark Wiseman, pictured in 2017, to be Canada's ambassador to the U.S. this weekend or early next week.MIKE SEGAR/Reuters

Canadian financier Mark Wiseman has officially been selected by Prime Minister Mark Carney to take up Canada's most important diplomatic role as ambassador to the United States as the country prepares for tough USMCA trade talks, two sources say.

The appointment was approved by cabinet on Thursday, the sources said. The Prime Minister is to make the announcement in the coming days.

The Globe and Mail is not naming the sources who were not authorized to discuss cabinet discussions.

Mr. Wiseman, 55, replaces Kirsten Hillman who served in Washington since 2017, including the past six years as ambassador.

One of the sources said the Prime Minister chose Mr. Wiseman, a close friend, because of his extensive business connections in the United States. President Donald Trump and key advisers, such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, would also respect Mr. Wiseman's financial background, the source said.

Opposition parties warn PM not to appoint Mark Wiseman ambassador to U.S.

Mr. Wiseman has been heavily involved in institutional investments and mergers and acquisitions, including as chair at Lazard Canada, BlackRock and Boston Consulting Group.

Canada had been holding talks for months to remove tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump on Canadian goods such as steel, aluminum and softwood lumber, but those negotiations were stalled after Ontario ran anti-tariff ads.

The focus is now on the United States-Mexico-Canada free-trade deal, which requires all three countries to review the agreement in 2026. The U.S. is expected to seek to renegotiate sections of the pact.

The USMCA has been a vital shield for Canada during the trade war with the United States. Mr. Trump has imposed a 35-per-cent blanket tariffs for Canadian products that aren't compliant with the USMCA's rules of origin, but the carveout means most Canadian goods continue to enter the U.S. tariff-free.

Ms. Hillman said Tuesday she decided to leave the post to give the Prime Minister the ability to put “a team in place” as negotiations get under way on the review of the USMCA.

Mr. Wiseman has no diplomatic or government experience, but he is a seasoned institutional investment player. He was formerly chair of the Alberta Investment Management Corporation, CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and a top manager at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager.

Carney rejects idea Trump wants to exit USMCA

He was forced to leave his senior executive position at BlackRock in 2019 for failing to disclose a consensual relationship with a colleague, a violation of the company's policy.

He is now chair of Lazard, a boutique financial advisory and asset management service. In March, the Prime Minister named Mr. Wiseman to his council of advisers on Canada-U.S. relations.

Ms. Hillman told The Globe that the next ambassador must quickly build bridges with Mr. Trump's White House, senior cabinet secretaries and congressional leaders. The new ambassador must also reach out to Mr. Trump's business and political allies outside Washington, she said.

Above all, she said, it's important to listen to what Mr. Trump says and “to find a path forward that works for Canada.”

Earlier this week, the Conservatives and Bloc Quebecois warned Mr. Carney against appointing his long-time friend to Washington.

They seized on comments that Mr. Wiseman made as the co-founder of the Century Initiative. The non-profit organization advocates increasing Canada's population to 100 million by 2100 solely through immigration.

Mr. Wiseman shared a social-media post in May, 2023, that said “100 million may not be federal policy, but it should be – even if it makes Quebec howl.”

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre told the House Wednesday that Mr. Wiseman “is someone who has shown contempt for Quebec and cannot negotiate for Quebec.”

Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, said the Century Initiative's call for 100 million population “is not government policy and never will be.”

The Conservatives also noted that Mr. Wiseman has been quoted as being opposed to supply management, arguing that it inhibits productivity.

Mr. LeBlanc told the House that “we will not negotiate supply management with the Americans,” even though President Trump said he wants the Canadian market to be more open to imports from U.S. farmers.

Five years after legalizing psilocybin to treat a raft of health problems, practitioners worry the industry has become too costly, too white, and too regulated. Can the landmark program find its footing?

Jenna Kluwe remembers all the beautiful moments she saw in a converted dental clinic in east Portland.

For six months, she managed the Journey Service Center, a “psilocybin service center” where adults 21 and older take supervised mushroom trips. She watched elderly clients with terminal illnesses able to enjoy life again. She saw one individual with obsessive compulsive disorder so severe they spent hours washing their hands who could casually eat food that fell on the floor.

“It's like five years of therapy in five hours,” Kluwe, a former therapist from Michigan, said.

In 2020, Oregon made history by becoming the first US state to legalize the use of psilocybin in a supervised setting, paving the way for magic mushrooms to treat depression, PTSD and other mental health challenges. A flurry of facilities like the Journey Service Center, as well as training centers for facilitators to guide the sessions, sprung up across the state.

But five years later, the pioneering industry is grappling with growing pains. Kluwe recalled how early last year, her business partner abruptly told her the center was out of money and would close in March – the first in a wave of closures that set off alarms about the viability of Oregon's program.

The Journey Service Center isn't alone. The state's total number of licensed service centers has dropped by nearly a third, to 24, since Oregon's psilocybin program launched in 2023. The state's 374 licensed facilitators, people who support clients during sessions, similarly fell. And just this week, Portland's largest “shroom room” – an 11,000 sq ft venue with views of Mt Hood offering guided trips in addition to corporate retreats – reportedly closed down.

“The attrition is setting in, and a lot of people are not renewing their license because it is hard to make money,” said Gary Bracelin, the owner of Drop Thesis Psilocybin Service Center.

Many worry about how the program's rules and fees have pushed the cost of a psilocybin session as high as $3,000, putting it out of reach for many just as psychedelics are gaining mainstream acceptance as a mental health treatment. Insurance typically doesn't cover sessions, meaning people have to pay out of pocket.

Furthermore, the industry is struggling to reach a diverse group of clients: state data show that most people who've taken legal psilocybin in Oregon are white, over 44 and earn more than roughly $95,000 or more a year.

Depending on who you ask, these are either signs of an experiment buckling under hefty rules and fees – or a landmark program finding its footing.

“It's not totally shocking for a brand new program to have a higher price tag,” said Heidi Pendergast, Oregon director of advocacy group Healing Advocacy Fund. She added: “I think that any new industry would see this sort of opening and closing.”

Pendergast pointed to data showing the program is safe with severe reactions vanishingly rare among the estimated 14,000 people who have taken legal psilocybin in the state since mid-2023.

Some practitioners, however, say the state has a long way to go to realize the program's promises, while other centers are experimenting with new ways to keep costs down, broaden their clientele, and integrate with the mainstream medical system.

Legal psilocybin seemed like a natural fit for Bracelin. The self-described serial entrepreneur previously founded a cannabis dispensary chain and did sales and marketing for outdoor products during snowboarding's early days. When the program launched, he started jumping through the many hoops for Drop Thesis to start taking clients in January 2024.

The first obstacle, he said, was finding a property that met the state's requirements to be more than 1,000 feet from a school and not located in a residential area – with a landlord willing to rent for the center. Bracelin said more than a dozen landlords turned him down before he found a spot. Then there was the challenge of getting insurance for a business centered on a federally illegal drug. The center used private funders instead of banks, he said.

Drop Thesis charges $2,900 for a session, which can last up to six hours as well as before and after meetings with a facilitator, while offering discounts to veterans and during Pride Month as well as one monthly scholarship that covers the full price, Bracelin said.

Factored into the price of a session is the cost of a facilitator and a “licensee representative” who walks clients through paperwork and other requirements. State rules require centers to pay a $10,000 annual licensing fees, install surveillance cameras, alarm systems and securely store mushrooms in safes.

“Some [rules] are definitely justified,” Bracelin said. “And some of them are total overkill, out of fear from people who don't understand the product.”

Meanwhile, he said the black market is thriving and less-regulated companies sell products marketed as “magic mushroom edibles” that contain chemicals, some dangerous, instead of psilocybin.

Adding to regulatory hurdles is the fact that Oregon's local governments can ask voters to ban psilocybin businesses, creating a patchwork of bans in 25 of Oregon's 36 counties and in dozens of cities.

Angela Allbee, the manager of Oregon's psilocybin program, said in an emailed statement that the state became the first to enact regulations for a drug that's federally illegal, and those regulations were written with broad input that have proven safe. As more data and feedback come in, the state will consider adjusting the rules, she said.

The drug's illegality at a national level also makes marketing difficult with social media companies banning content that mentions it, Pendergast said. A survey conducted by her group last year found that 58% of Oregon adults had “some or little knowledge” of psilocybin therapy.

After a wave of people trained to become facilitators, many dropped off because there weren't enough clients, said Max Kelemen, executive director of the Portland Psychedelic Society.

“It's like a cart before the horse,” he said.

Tucked away in a drab building in south-east Portland, the Pacific Northwest Integrative Center feels more like a yoga studio than a psilocybin center.

A sign inside advises visitors to remove their shoes before entering an open area where mats are spread out on the floor. Here, the center hosts “microdosing” sessions, where participants take a fraction of the amount of psilocybin used for profound, day-long psychedelic experiences.

Centers have turned to microdoses, which have been touted for their supposedly subtle cognitive benefits, to broaden their base of repeat clients with a less costly and time-consuming option.

Rules still require microdose clients to fill out paperwork and stay at the center for 30 minutes for their first session and 15 minutes for sessions afterward. The center fills that wait time with yoga or meditation classes for up to 25 people, offering packages of 10 microdose sessions for $200 (plus $10 to $20 for the psilocybin).

“Most of our microdosing is basically like a yoga class, where you take a microdose at the beginning and fill out a whole bunch of paperwork,” said Mike Averill, the center's founder.

Averill said clients will benefit by moving away from doing just a single day-long session to multiple doses in a community. But he added that microdosing will never be the center's main source of income, and insurers covering longer macrodose sessions would be key to long-term sustainability.

Drop Thesis also offers microdoses that are paired with black-light painting night or a 1920s-themed interactive murder mystery game. But Bracelin said potential microdose clients are still turned off by the requirements, especially how state regulations bar them from driving home.

“You're over regulating us because there is this fear that people are going to freak out and run naked down the street,” Bracelin said.

Early last year, Dr Eric Lee had cleared Oregon's bureaucratic hurdles and was on the verge of opening a psilocybin service center. But he hesitated – the only way to make it work financially was to charge clients the prohibitively high rate for a session.

Three years ago, Lee found himself depressed after being sued and breaking up with a longtime partner. A friend convinced Lee to go to a music festival where he took mushrooms, felt supported by his group of friends and bounced back.

Lee said he didn't want others to face barriers to that kind of experience. So he paused the opening and reworked the business model for Space Psychedelic Center, which charges $900 for a session. He said he cut costs by owning the building and running the center himself – cleaning, bookkeeping, and handling other chores. His facilitators are independent contractors paid $560 per session. But he acknowledged his model “isn't easily replicable”.

Although psilocybin is associated with mental health concerns, the 2020 ballot initiative that created Oregon's program was designed to keep it outside of the medical system. Now, many supporters say it needs an outside source of cash, which could come from integration with the medical system.

Oregon lawmakers earlier this year took a first step toward making that a reality.

Any adult who clears an initial screening can take psilocybin for any purpose. That removed medical gatekeeping. But it has kept doctors, counselors and other licensed professionals from discussing the legally gray drug with patients for fear of sanctions.

A new bill that takes effect next year allows medical professionals to discuss psilocybin with patients, which could open the door to insurance covering part of the cost.

Before a session, clients meet with facilitators for “preparation”, to discuss their goals, and again afterward for “integration”, to process the experience. Both meetings often touch on mental health, so a therapist who is also a facilitator could potentially bill insurance for those portions, said Averill, owner of the Integrative Center and a licensed therapist.

Colorado and New Mexico have both passed psilocybin laws that integrate the drug into their medical systems.

Erin Pappas, a facilitator at Drop Thesis and a doctoral student in psychiatric nursing, said she hopes psilocybin will be legally reclassified federally, allowing her to prescribe it to patients.

“We're having a mental health crisis in this country right now,” she said. “I don't understand the negativity against something that is working so well.”

But Kluwe, the manager of the closed Journey Service Center, cautioned that insurance coverage might not be a panacea. She said insurers are not likely to cover psilocybin for grief because it isn't medically necessary.

“Why are we making this so hard for this program to work?” she said.

Rebecca Martinez worked as the volunteer coordinator for the 2020 ballot initiative that legalized psilocybin in Oregon. But after voters approved it, she began to have regrets.

She heard critiques that the initiative would create an overly restrictive system that would cost too much and worsen existing disparities. She started worrying the system critics warned of was taking hold.

Instead of stepping back, she went on to co-found the Alma Institute, a now defunct facilitator training school with a focus on diversifying the workforce. Last year, she co-founded the Cora Center, the first center with a majority of Bipoc and LGBTQ+ facilitators.

Located in a converted residential home on a busy Portland street, the center specializes in group sessions of six to eight participants. Group sessions mean lower costs because the cost of facilitators is split among multiple clients. Sessions take place in a hall-like room centered on an altar with a candle, traditional herbs, and a charango – a small Andean stringed instrument. The center's lead facilitators, both raised in the Andes, aim to blend Oregon's psilocybin framework with their ancestral traditions, Martinez said.

“There's just something special that happens in groups,” Martinez said. “Especially if they have a shared purpose, whether it's a grief group or people living with chronic pain, or if they share a lived experience or identity.”

The center welcomes everyone and its clients are mostly white. It also holds quarterly sessions for people of color and plans to add one for immigrants, Martinez said. Prices are sliding scale, with group sessions ranging from $650 to $1,200. The Sheri Eckert Foundation, a psilocybin financial-aid nonprofit, also sponsors some groups.

Still, Martinez said the state-required demographic data shows the center has more work to do to ensure psilocybin is accessible. Currently, the center is in a sprint to get enough partner organizations and programming to keep its doors open, she said. If not, it'll close in June.

“I'm still hopeful that this model can work,” Martinez said. “But a lot of things would have to go right. And it's possible.”

MOSCOW, December 12. /TASS/. The Bank of Russia has filed a lawsuit against the Euroclear depository in the Moscow Arbitration Court for damages caused to the Bank of Russia, the regulator's press service reported.

The amount of the claim against the depository was not specified in the statement.

"In connection with the illegal actions of the Euroclear depository, which are causing damages to the Bank of Russia, as well as in connection with the mechanisms officially reviewed by the European Commission for the direct or indirect use of Bank of Russia assets without the consent of the Bank of Russia, the Bank of Russia is filing a lawsuit in the Moscow Arbitration Court against the Euroclear depository for damages caused to the Bank of Russia," the statement reads.

The regulator stressed that the actions of the Euroclear depository caused damage "due to the inability to manage cash and securities belonging to the Bank of Russia."

The majority of Russia's sovereign assets frozen in Europe (over €200 billion) are blocked on Euroclear's platform in Belgium. The depository repeatedly opposed the expropriation of the assets, warning that it could lead to Russia seizing European or Belgian assets elsewhere in the world through legal action.

Earlier Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the global financial and economic order would be destroyed, and economic separatism would only intensify, if the West stole Russia's frozen assets. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that Moscow would definitely respond to the theft of its assets in Europe. He stressed that the Kremlin intends to organize legal proceedings against those involved in this scheme.

Exclusive: Congress members seek answers after Guardian revealed data to be shared for immigration enforcement

More than 20 members of Congress are demanding answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and homeland security officials after the Guardian revealed the VA is compiling a report on all non-US citizens “employed by or affiliated with” the government agency that will then be shared with other federal agencies, including immigration authorities.

The lawmakers, led by Illinois congresswoman Delia Ramirez – along with congressman Mark Takano of California and US senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, the top Democrats on the House and Senate veterans affairs committees – have written a group letter to be sent to the VA secretary, Doug Collins, and the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, on Friday.

The letter, shared with the Guardian, said the report, to be finalized this month, will “seed fear in noncitizens who perform duties in service to our nation's veterans” during a time when the Trump administration is aggressively arresting, detaining and deporting thousands of immigrants in communities nationwide.

Other co-signers of the letter include US senator Tammy Duckworth, of Illinois, California congressman Robert Garcia, the ranking member of the House oversight committee, Texas congressman Greg Casar, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, ranking member of the House judiciary subcommittee on immigration integrity, security, and enforcement.

The VA operates the nation's largest integrated healthcare system, serving 9 million veterans annually across 170 hospitals and more than 1,000 outpatient clinics. It employs 450,000 workers and enjoys relationships with most major medical schools.

“It is obvious that the VA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are conspiring to illegally intimidate, imprison, and deport individuals who perform duties at the VA in service to our nation's veterans,” the lawmakers wrote.

The VA has confirmed to the Guardian that the department intends to share some of the data it gathers with other federal agencies, including for immigration enforcement purposes. The report on the non-citizen individuals at the VA is due to be provided to Collins later this month.

The VA's leaked memo implies non-citizen doctors, nurses, researchers, medical students, contractors and more will be included in the report.

The Guardian sent the VA a detailed inquiry and request for comment.

VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz responded with the following statement: “VA is required by federal law to continuously vet all employees and affiliates, such as unpaid researchers and others who may have access to VA data or systems, to ensure they meet the federal government's trusted workforce standards.

“As part of this continuous process, VA on November 25 directed under secretaries, assistant secretaries and other key officials to provide a report on all non-United States citizens who are employed by or affiliated with VA. This will not affect veterans seeking care or services at VA, or the delivery of care and services.”

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to a request for comment.

In an appearance on Fox News last weekend, Collins called the Guardian's report “a nothing story”.

However, lawmakers, veterans and VA employees said the mere act of compiling this data, exclusively on non-citizens, could lead qualified workers to quit and exacerbate existing staffing shortages.

In August, the VA inspector general reported “severe” staffing shortages at all of its hospitals. An analysis of VA data by the Guardian shows the agency has lost thousands of “mission-critical” healthcare workers since Trump returned to office – including nearly 3,000 nurses and more than 1,000 doctors.

Heather Fallon, an emergency department nurse at the Captain James A Lovell Federal Health Care Center, a veterans hospital in North Chicago, said conditions there are worsening daily.

On Tuesday night, the emergency department, which is typically staffed with seven to eight nurses – had three or four on duty, she said. The VA declined to comment on staffing at the hospital. Fallon said the VA's decision to allow ICE activities at the facility had already put fear into the hearts of veteran patients and health care workers and that report being compiled will further terrify patients and staff.

Fallon spoke to the Guardian in her capacity as a member of the union, National Nurses United, which also released a statement opposing the VA's creation of a database of non-citizens.

In New York City, a doctor working at a VA hospital, who asked that their identity not be published for fear of retaliation said she worried the agency's increasingly tough-on-immigration stance could have an especially severe impact on veterans' access to specialists.

About 30% of psychiatrists and neurologists and more than 50% of gerontologists and kidney specialists in the United States graduated from medical schools outside the country, according to published data.

Because many VA hospitals are in rural areas with chronic doctor shortages, the agency has traditionally recruited many foreign workers, including facilitating the physicians' legal status through the use of National Interest Waivers. The DHS and state department have sought to impose limits on visas for some healthcare workers this year, a move opposed by professional, medical associations and immigrant rights groups.

In Michigan, retired air force master sergeant Rachel Youkey said she is already experiencing delays in care linked to the immigration crackdown.

A munitions expert who sustained a brain injury from an Afghanistan bomb blast while serving there from 2010 to 2011, Youkey receives care at the VA hospital in Ann Arbor, where many workers are medical residents from the nearby University of Michigan.

She said she used to love her primary care physician, a student from Korea. But after he graduated last year, he was not replaced. She has not had a regular doctor since. “I don't care if someone is a citizen,” she said. “I care that they know what they are doing. Are they competent? I'll take competency above citizenship every time.”

In his appearance on Fox News, Collins attempted to downplay the VA's efforts to collect data on non-citizens, saying the forthcoming report is “simply us going back through the process, making sure that we have updated our rolls, updated our background checks, updated the folks so that they're actually supposed to be here”.

In their letter, however, the Democratic lawmakers express alarm over the breadth of the VA's data collection efforts.

“Foreign-born individuals fill critical roles at VA as employees, contractors, and volunteers, including in research, healthcare, and benefits delivery,” the letter says, adding that the data collection “comes at a time when nationwide healthcare provider shortages are limiting access to care for all Americans, including veterans”.

“The broad, undefined nature of the phrase ‘or affiliated with VA' used throughout the memorandum cited in the Guardian leads us to worry that the data collection could sweep far beyond the walls of VA and our own borders,” the letter adds. “It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the database of all non-US citizens employed by or affiliated with VA will only lead to more illegal detentions and deportations of individuals who dedicate themselves to improving veterans' lives.”

Kristofer Goldsmith, an Iraq war veteran who heads Task Force Butler, an advocacy group that counters extremism, said: “It seems like the Trump administration is trying to reduce – not just the availability of healthcare for veterans, but for all Americans.”

He added: “There are tons of immigrants who come to the United States, dream of being citizens, become doctors, are straight-A students, are law-abiding people, who then train or work at the VA saving lives.”

The lawmakers warn that the report could also lead to increased immigration enforcement against military veterans themselves, some of whom have already been deported under Trump. Veterans make up over a quarter of the VA's workforce, and it is not a requirement to be a US citizen to serve in the military.

“Worst of all, the proposed data collection could lead to the unlawful imprisonment or deportation of veterans who served our country and continued their service at VA, but were denied US citizenship following their military service,” the lawmakers write.

The VA directive requires “all needed data” to be provided by 26 December. A full report on all non-United States citizens with a relationship with the agency is to be provided to Collins 30 December.

In their letter, the Democratic senators and House members request documents and data from the VA and DHS, giving them a deadline of 24 December. They also requested a congressional briefing by 19 December.

Latest batch includes photos of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and Richard Branson as top Democrat says ‘all we want is full transparency'

House Democrats release Epstein photos with Trump, Bannon, Clinton and others

In pictures: latest Epstein photos released

House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries has called on the Trump administration to “comply with the law” and release the full Epstein files, adding that his party would continue to pressure the justice department to release the files by the congressionally mandated 19 December deadline.

A reminder that the 19 images shared by the House oversight committee in today's drop are separate to the archive that the DoJ has been ordered to release, but they do add to the political momentum and pressure mounting on the Trump administration over the issue.

Jeffries told reporters earlier:

The so-called Department of Justice under the Trump administration needs to comply with the law.

These people who are part of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump and JD Vance himself, all said for years that they wanted to release the Epstein files.

Didn't they come into office and do the exact opposite, obstruct and obfuscate, hide stuff from the American people?

All we want is full transparency so that the American people can get the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. That's what the Epstein survivors deserve and have demanded and we are going to make sure that the Department of Justice complies.

Donald Trump said today that the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to a cease fire in their ongoing border conflict.

In a post on Truth Social, the president said he spoke to Thailand's Anutin Charnviraku and Cambodia's Hun Manet this morning. “They have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening, and go back to the original Peace Accord made with me, and them, with the help of the Great Prime Minister of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim,” Trump wrote.

A reminder that fighting erupted again on Sunday in the longstanding border dispute between the two countries. As my colleague Rebecca Ratcliffe notes, Thailand and Cambodia initially agreed to a ceasefire in July, and signed a formal agreement six weeks ago in Trump's presence. However, the ceasefire arrangements have been precarious, and both sides have accused the other of violations. Since the fighting broke out last week, at least 20 people have been killed, and almost 200 injured.

“Both Countries are ready for PEACE and continued Trade with the United States of America,” Trump added on social media today.

My colleagues have collated the 19 photographs from the Epstein estate, released today by Democrats on the House oversight committee.

You can see them all below. A warning that some contain sensitive material.

Earlier, I reported that Richard Branson and an unidentified man were pictured in a photograph with Epstein. That man is Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway.

According to the Boston Globe, Kamen did not respond to a request for comment after today's pictures were published. The Globe reports that Kamen – a New Hampshire based entrepreneur – is connected to Nadia Marcinko, a fashion model turned pilot, who was close with Epstein.

A quick note that the Trump condom appears to be part of the Smithsonian Institution's collection, where it is described as “political satire”.

The packaging was designed by Fishs Eddy, a housewares and novelty shop in New York, and launched in 2015. “It's been a runaway hit, that's for sure,” shop owner Julie Gaines said in November 2016, a few days before the presidential election that Trump went on to win. “People get the joke and that's why they buy it. They don't buy it because it's an homage to him.”

She said the inspiration for the package design came after Trump “started mouthing off [the word] ‘huge' every five minutes”. “We've always been political, but it's at a whole new level this year,” Gaines said. “We are very, very much for Hillary [Clinton] and we make that very clear. The only time we do Trump products is when we're trying to get our two cents in, not to promote him.”

In comments to reporters earlier, Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, said that just under 25,000 images had been examined out of the 95,000 photographs from the estate, and said that more photos from the Epstein estate would be released “in the days and weeks ahead”.

“Some of the other photos we did not put out today are incredibly disturbing,” he added.

So there's an enormous amount of photos that we have not gone through. It'll take days and weeks to make sure we have those photos and redaction is done in the appropriate way.

We will continue to put out more photos in the days and weeks ahead, but I caution folks at the redaction process, and ensuring we protect survivors and women abused by Epstein.

He accused the White House of a cover-up and implored the Trump administration to “release the files immediately”.

House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries has called on the Trump administration to “comply with the law” and release the full Epstein files, adding that his party would continue to pressure the justice department to release the files by the congressionally mandated 19 December deadline.

All we want is full transparency so that the American people can get the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. That's what the Epstein survivors deserve and have demanded and we are going to make sure that the Department of Justice complies.

Republicans who lead the House oversight committee lambasted Democrats for the images they released from the Epstein estate today, accusing them of “chasing headlines by releasing a handful of selectively censored and cherry-picked photos”.

They added:

Democrats' hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. Nothing in the documents we've received shows any wrongdoing. Ranking Member Robert Garcia and Oversight Democrats should be ashamed of this disgusting behavior of putting politics above justice for the survivors.

Also included in today's trove of pictures is British billionaire and co-founder of Virgin group, Richard Branson.

Branson is seen smiling on a beach, sitting next to an unidentified man and holding up a pad of paper with indiscernible writing, as Epstein walks behind them.

Upon releasing the most recent trove of photos from the Epstein estate, the oversight committee's top Democrat – Robert Garcia – said “it is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends”.

The California congressman added that the 19 photos published today “raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW.”

Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon appears in several of the pictures released by House Democrats on the oversight committee.

As I reported earlier, in one of the photos Bannon is seen having a conversation while sitting across a desk from Epstein.

In another, Epstein is taking a selfie of the pair in front of a full-length mirror. Bannon, who was Donald Trump's top White House strategist until he was fired less than a year into the president's first term in office, is also pictured speaking with film director Woody Allen in one photograph.

Included in this latest batch of pictures from the Epstein estate are explicit photos of sex toys. One appears to show a black latex glove with ridges on the fingers, and another features ropes, restraints and a book on “shibari” – a type of Japanese bondage.

Another picture features a bowl of “Trump condoms” selling for $4.50. On the parody packaging it makes fun of the president's style of speech, reading: “I'm HUUUUGE!”

Included in the latest batch of photos from House oversight Democrats today, are several pictures of high profile individuals at public events.

The picture of former prince Andrew and Microsoft founder Bill Gates appears to be from at a summit in London, where the former's brother – King Charles III – was in attendance. The image in the House oversight batch appears to be a cropped version of a picture available on the photo agency Getty.

Here's the image from the news wires:

Similarly, a picture of Epstein and his former lawyer Alan Dershowitz is included in the drop of photos, but appears to be an older photo of the pair back in 2004 that was already published.

Here is the news wire image:

In the new batch of photos released by House oversight Democrats, there is also a picture of Donald Trump surrounded by women, some of whom are wearing leis around their necks. All of their faces have been obscured, but the president appears in the middle holding the waists of two of the women.

Democrats on the House oversight committee have published 19 new photos from the 95,000 they have received from Jeffrey Epstein's estate today. In the latest drop, there are pictures of Bill Clinton alongside the late sex-offender and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. There are also pictures of Donald Trump and Epstein at social events, and even a picture of the president onboard a plane, sitting beside a woman whose face has been redacted.

There are several pictures in the drop which include billionaire Bill Gates.

Another notable face is former Trump adviser and noted ally, Steve Bannon, who appears in one picture sitting across a desk, engaged in conversation with Epstein.

It's worth noting that appearing in pictures from the estate doesn't imply any wrongdoing.

According to multiple outlets, the navy has sent a report to the Pentagon about Senator Mark Kelly's role in a video published to social media last month, where six Democratic members of Congress urged active service members to “refuse illegal orders”.

The video sparked fury from the president, who said the lawmakers were guilty of “seditious behavior” that was “punishable by death”. Defense secretary Pete Hegseth said he would launch an investigation into Kelly – a decorated former navy captain – for possible breaches of military law. This included a memorandum to John Phelan asking the navy secretary to review Kelly and a group of fellow Democrats' comments in the video.

According to the New York Times, the Pentagon's office of general counsel is “providing a legal review and input” of the navy's report, per a Department of Defense official, who spoke to the Times on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation.

In response, a spokesperson for Kelly told the Hill that “it defies belief that with all of the threats facing our country, Pete Hegseth initiated this ridiculous process to try to intimidate senator Kelly for saying something Pete Hegseth himself has said repeatedly.”

A reminder that footage from 2016, of the defense secretary repeatedly saying that service members should refuse “unlawful” orders from a potential president Trump on Fox News, was unearthed by CNN earlier this month.

Per our earlier post, a federal judge on Friday morning issued a temporary restraining order to prohibit immigration officials from detaining Kilmar Ábrego García just hours before he was scheduled to appear at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Baltimore.

His lawyers asked the judge to block authorities from detaining him again. The judge says officials cannot re-detain him until the court conducts a hearing on the motion for the temporary restraining order.

Ábrego had been freed from an immigration detention facility in Pennsylvania early on Thursday evening not long after a federal judge in Maryland ordered his release.

On Friday morning, Paula Xinis, a US district judge in Maryland, said that Ábrego cannot be re-detained and in her ruling she wrote that he was likely to succeed in further requests of “relief” from ICE detention, citing the merits of his case.

Donald Trump announced he would pardon former Colorado election clerk Tina Peters. In a post on Truth Social the president wrote that Peters – who is currently serving a nine-year state sentence for her attempts to overturn the 2020 election results – is a “Patriot who simply wanted to make sure that our Elections were Fair and Honest”.

Trump added that “Democrats have been relentless in their targeting” of Peters, who served as the clerk for Mesa county. She was found guilty on state charges of election interference, including four felony counts.

In response to Trump's announcement, several Democratic officials decried his efforts to overturn a state conviction. A reminder that the constitution grants the president pardon power for federal crimes.

“Tina Peters is rightfully in Colorado state prison,” said senator Michael Bennet. “Trump's corrupt and political attempts at a pardon won't work here. Once again, if you can't do the time, don't do the crime.”

Donald Trump is in Washington today. We'll see him at 3pm ET for a bill signing in the Oval Office. We'll make sure to bring you the latest lines.

Earlier, he'll take part in a swearing-in ceremony for Ben Black, the CEO of the US International Development Finance Corporation, and John Jovanovic, who serves as the chair of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM).

A reminder that Jovanovic is married to the daughter of Trump's administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz.

That ceremony is currently closed to the press, but we'll let you know if that changes.

S&P 500, Nasdaq open lower as Broadcom adds to AI bubble angst

There's been no shortage of the usual year-ahead forecasts for the S&P 500 in recent weeks from Street analysts. But FactSet is out today with a report that looks at Street forecasts using a unique “bottom-up” approach, instead of the usual “top-down”. 

This bottom-up target price for the index at year-end 2026 is calculated by aggregating the median target price estimates, based on the company-level target prices submitted by industry analysts, for all the stocks in the index.

The result of this unusual number crunching: a target price for the S&P 500 of 7,968.78, which is about 15 per cent higher than current levels. 

“At the sector level, the Information Technology (+19.8%) sector is expected to see the largest price increase, as this sector has the largest upside difference between the bottom-up target price and the closing price. On the other hand, the Financials (+8.3%) sector is expected to see the smallest price increase, as this sector has the smallest upside difference between the bottom-up target price and the closing price,” FactSet said in the report.

But how has this forecasting approach worked in the past?

“At the end of last year (December 31, 2024), the bottom-up target price for the S&P 500 was 6,728.40. Based on yesterday's closing price of 6,901.00, analysts underestimated the price of the index by 2.5% at the start of calendar year 2025 as of yesterday. However, it is important to note that industry analysts have historically overestimated the closing price of the index at the start of the year. Over the previous 20 years (2005 – 2024), the average difference between the bottom-up target price estimate at the beginning of the year (December 31) and the final price for the index for that same year has been 5.9 per cent.”

Most Wall Street analysts liked Broadcom's (AVGO-Q) earnings but markets really hated it, and sold the stock along with most of the AI-related market sector. Oracle didn't help, announcing that some of their data centres slated to open next year will have to wait until 2027. 

Citi analyst Christopher Danely applauded Broadcom's announcement of a new customer, Anthropic, and 13 per cent year over year gain in revenue. Next quarter revenue was guided higher by 6.0 per cent. A big negative, however: Broadcom guided gross margins lower by 1.0 per cent. 

The stock is trading sharply lower – down 11 per cent in midday trading. Oracle's announcement of data center delays has its stock down just over 5.0 per cent. 

Despite the fall on Friday, its stock is up nearly 70 per cent for the year.

It trades at about 32 times enterprise value to forward core earnings, compared with 19.6 times for AI chip giant Nvidia and 30.2 times for Advanced Micro Devices, according to Reuters. Nvidia shares are up 34 per cent this year, while AMD has gained 83 per cent.

More drops for superstars that had earlier soared in Wall Street's frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology are dragging the U.S. stock market off their records on Friday.

The S&P 500 fell 1.2% from its all-time high set the day before, and the weakness for tech stocks yanked the Nasdaq composite down a market-leading 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 266 points, or 0.5%, from its own record set the day before, as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern time.

Broadcom dragged the market lower and tumbled 10.5% even though the chip company reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. 

Broadcom's stumble came a day after Oracle plunged nearly 11% despite likewise reporting a bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

Doubts remain about whether all the spending that Oracle is doing on AI technology will end up being worth it, along with how it will pay for it. Such questions are dogging the AI industry broadly, even as many billions of dollars continue to flow in.

Broadcom was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 Friday, followed by Nvidia. The chip company that's become the poster child of the AI boom fell 2.5%.

The stock market was also broadly feeling pressure from the bond market, where the yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.19% from 4.14% late Thursday. The gains were biggest for yields of the longest-term Treasurys, which tend to track long-term expectations for economic growth and inflation.

The stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has much less of an emphasis on tech, are still up 1% for the week so far. That's much better than the Nasdaq composite's drop of 1.7%.

Shares of Rivian Automotive (RIVN-Q) surged 18% on Friday as analysts issued bullish commentary on the electric pickup truck and SUV maker's efforts to develop a custom chip for self-driving features and its integration of artificial intelligence.

The stock had closed about 6% lower on Thursday after the company's announcements at its first Autonomy and AI Day, where it said it would shift away from Nvidia's processors that power autonomous driving and had launched a paid package for self-driving features.

Rivian's shares rose 17.9% to $19.37, its highest in nearly two years. The stock had risen about 24% this year, as of Thursday's close.

The company's new R2 model cars, which are expected to roll out first half of 2026, will carry the new chips.

The self-driving and driver-assistance systems still require human oversight. The company expects to launch “eyes-off” functionality in 2026.

“The event exceeded our expectations and cements our view for Rivian to become the number 2 North America EV player, even leapfrogging Tesla right now in certain AI-integration areas,” James Picariello, senior analyst at BNP Paribas said.

Brokerage Needham and Co raised its price target by 64% to US $23 per share, citing increased confidence “in Rivian's positioning as software-defined vehicles increasingly become industry table stakes.”

Rivian's custom self-driving and AI chip, dubbed the Rivian Autonomy Processor, will be produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Canada's benchmark stock index dropped on Friday, ending a week filled with central bank meetings.

At 11:28 a.m. ET, The TSX index was was down 252.98 points, or 0.8 per cent, at 31,407.75. The commodity-heavy index is up 28 per cent for the year and has outperformed its Wall Street peers due to a stellar performance from its mining and materials shares.

“Global stocks are trading at record highs despite ongoing technology valuation doubts,” said Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY.

“The ongoing themes of equity sector rotation, a better 2026 outlook aided by Fed easing, and tame inflation leave hopes that doing nothing will keep the holiday rally intact.”

Information technology stocks lead declines, falling 4.3 per cent, with Celestica Inc. (CLS-T) dropping 12.1 per cent and Lightspeed Commerce Inc. (LSPD-T) losing 3.1 per cent.

Healthcare index gained the most on Friday at 5.4 per cent, with the shares of cannabis firm Curaleaf (CURA-T) soaring 26 per cent.

Shares of cannabis companies rose after a Washington Post report said U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to push the government to dramatically loosen federal restrictions on marijuana. Canada's Canopy Growth and Tilray Brands rose 22 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively.

The founder of Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU-Q) is calling for an overhaul of the company's board of directors, as the purveyor of athleisure searches for a new chief executive officer – accusing the leadership of “complacency” as the brand has lost its cachet.

Friday's statement from Chip Wilson followed the news of CEO Calvin McDonald's ouster on Thursday afternoon.

Mr. McDonald, who has led Lululemon since 2018, will step down at the end of January. While he presided over years of growth at the company, under his leadership Lululemon also experienced a significant slowdown in its U.S. business starting last year.

The company's stock price – which had dropped by more than 50 per cent this year prior to the news – jumped by roughly 10 per cent in Friday-morning trading.

The founder, Mr. Wilson, took credit for Mr. McDonald's departure in his statement on Friday, saying that he had been urging members of the company “publicly and privately” to spearhead a “revitalization and an infusion of new skills” to fix its lagging performance.

Silver often gets dismissed as gold's poor cousin. But that title hardly stands up to the reality of this past year. The precious metal has soared 120 per cent year to date, and the spot price reached a record US$64.09 per ounce this morning in London. That's about a 10-per-cent weekly gain. Not bad for a commodity that rarely comes up in dinner conversations.

Various reasons have been linked to the rally. Gold's surge (the two metals often trade in tandem) and the general decline in the U.S. dollar have surely played a role. Strong demand for physical silver from Indian consumers and from the solar industry – which is eager to help meet demand for the power needs of AI chips – has probably helped too. 

But Capital Economics is out Friday with a warning for those investors only now catching on to the powerful gains of the commodity this year. It thinks silver gains could rapidly go into reverse in the new year. 

The Bank for International Settlements argued this week that the surge in retail interest and the gold price rally is indicative of a bubble. Capital Economics thinks the same argument can be made for silver, too. It points out both gold- and silver-backed ETF holdings have increased by 15-20 per cent since the start of this year. 

“This pick-up in investment demand for precious metals, especially in the West where sentiment tends to be sensitive to changes in US monetary policy, could rapidly shift into reverse. A potential trigger could be if, as we expect, concerns about Fed independence prove to be overblown,” wrote Capital Economics climate and commodities economist Hamad Hussain in a note this week. 

“Admittedly, silver prices may rise further in the near term since the risk of US tariffs still looms. For context, the ongoing Section 232 trade investigation on critical minerals, which includes silver, has coincided with a hoarding of silver inventories on the COMEX and this appears to have caused stress in the broader silver market. But while we have no insight as to whether tariffs will be put in place, it is notable that Trump backed away from tariffing gold when similar dynamics in that market were playing out. In any case, the tariff uncertainty should end by mid-April at the latest when President Trump would be expected to make a decision.”

Mr. Hussain also notes the gold/silver price ratio – a commonly used valuation metric – has fallen sharply since ‘Liberation Day'. “Of course, price ratios are not perfect guides to the future since there is no fixed level that they should revert to. But for what it's worth, the gold/silver price ratio previously bottomed out around 65 on two occasions in the past decade or so – not far from its current level.”

He thinks both gold and silver prices will fall next year, with silver falling faster, reaching US$42 an ounce by the end of 2026. 

If true, it could be a rough year for Canadian precious metals producers that have a heavy exposure to silver.

The K-shaped economy meme – the economy improving for the wealthy while deteriorating for the lower wealth quintiles – might be going in reverse, according to BofA Securities investment strategist Michael Hartnett in his weekly report. 

Mr. Hartnett often needs to come with subtitles, but there's an important trend evident in his weekly Flow Show report. He writes, “Ferrari falling sharply vs General Motors; K-shape ‘rich vs poor' consumer all the rage in '25, but markets front-running ‘run-it-hot' in '26 via rotation to ‘Main St' (MDY MidCap, IYR Small-Cap, IWC Microcap) from ‘Wall St' (MGC Mega Cap)”

The relative returns for Ferrari and General Motors potentially indicates the reversal of the K-shaped “rich versus poor” economic trend. The “run-it-hot” idea is that fund managers are positioning for an inflationary environment that benefits less wealth cohorts. They are buying SPDR S&P Midcap 400 ETF (MDY-A), iShares U.S. Real Estate (IYR-A) and iShares Microcap (IWC-A) while reducing Vanguard Mega Cap Index ETF (MGC-A).

Oil prices inched lower on Friday and were on track for a weekly decline as investors focussed on a supply glut and potential Russia-Ukraine peace deal, which outweighed concerns over Venezuelan supply disruptions.

Brent crude futures were down 14 US cents, or 0.2 per cent, to US$61.14 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 3 US cents at US$57.57. Both benchmarks fell by about 1.5 per cent on Thursday.

While there might be sporadic support from hits to supply, the general market mood reflects supply exceeding demand, and any rallies are expected to be brief, said PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga.

Brent and WTI have lost more than 4 per cent this week. International Energy Agency forecasts published on Thursday indicated that global oil supply will exceed demand by 3.84 million barrels per day next year - a volume equal to almost 4% of world demand.

Canada's main stock index opened higher on Friday, with mining shares leading gains at the close of a week filled with highly anticipated central bank meetings.

At 9:30 a.m. ET, Toronto's S&P/TSX composite index was up 0.24 per cent at 31,737.44 points.

In New York, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq opened lower on Friday as Broadcom's latest results added to concerns about an AI-fueled bubble, dampening optimism stoked by the Federal Reserve's less-hawkish-than-expected signals on 2026 rate cuts.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 102.80 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 48,806.81, the S&P 500 lost 10.85 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 6,890.37 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 105.00 points, or 0.43 per cent, to 23,491.12. 

Broadcom (AVGO-Q) slid 7.9 per cent in early trade after the chipmaker warned of slimmer future margins on its AI system sales, despite projecting strong quarterly revenue. This sharpened worries about the profitability of surging AI investments.

Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica (LULU-Q) jumped 10.7 per cent after the apparel maker said that CEO Calvin McDonald was leaving the company and raised its annual profit forecast.

Shares of Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU-Q) are poised to soar after the late Thursday announcement chief executive officer Calvin McDonald will step down at the end of January.

Mr. McDonald, who has led the athleisure retailer since 2018, has been struggling to reassure investors amid a slowdown in its U.S. business and as its stock price plunged by 50 per cent since the beginning of the year.

Lululemon has hired an executive search firm and is looking for its next CEO, the company announced Thursday. Mr. McDonald will leave the role on Jan. 31, 2026, and will also step away from the company's board of directors but will continue as a senior adviser until March 31.

The announcement overshadowed the release of third-quarter financial results that exceeded the Street's expectations. That included earnings per share of US$2.59, topping the consensus projection of US$2.21, driven by higher gross profit dollars and share repurchases.

“Results were better than feared and FY25 revenue and guidance moves higher at the midpoint,” said Stifel analyst Peter McGoldrick in a client note. “We continue to believe the stock will remain range-bound until the core Americas business stabilizes; continued challenges (Americas negative 5-per-cent cc comp vs. negative 3 per cent cc in 2Q25) with concentration around shopping holidays and promotional seeking behavior points to uneven trends in demand, which we expect persist into CY26. We expect the forthcoming leadership change catalyzes investor interest in the stock, though believe the structural market conditions driving challenging results (scaling competition, loyal customer attrition) will take time to correct.”

The company's shares have halved in value this year as it lost ground to newer rivals including Alo Yoga and Vuori in the U.S., as well as to lower-priced styles from established players such as Nike and Gap.

Lululemon's forward price-to-earnings multiple, a common benchmark for valuing stocks, is 14.66, compared to 31.26 for Nike and Abercrombie & Fitch's ratio of 10.8, according to LSEG data.

BMO senior economist Robert Kavcic found that Canadian households are a lot more liquid than the heavy debt levels would suggest. 

My strong suspicion is that these assets are not distributed equally among the populace,

“Canadian households are flush with liquid assets, another strike against those deeply concerned about conditions going into 2026. Canadians now hold almost $260 in liquid financial assets (e.g., cash, bonds and stocks, excluding pension and insurance assets) for every $100 in financial liabilities (e.g., mortgage debt). The bull market in equities is obviously helping, but so have sturdy income growth and savings. Importantly, not only is there some wealth effect here, but it is also going to help cushion households renewing into higher-rate mortgages through 2026 (the peak of the renewal wave is around mid-year). Canadians can lean on these liquid assets to reduce outstanding balances or support higher monthly payments. There are a few sidebars to explore further. Wealth in liquid financial assets is arguably more accessible than a fixed asset like housing, which has stagnated for most. Also, the distribution of increases in financial assets has, of course, been skewed to the higher end of the income spectrum”

Futures tracking the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq slipped on Friday as Broadcom's latest results reignited fears of an AI-fueled bubble and tempered the optimism sparked by a less hawkish commentary than expected from the Federal Reserve on 2026 rate cuts.

At 7:00 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 59 points, or 0.12 per cent, S&P 500 E-minis were down 15.25 points, or 0.22 per cent, Nasdaq 100 E-minis were down 162.25 points, or 0.63 per cent.

Broadcom (AVGO-Q) shares fell nearly 6 per cent in premarket trading after the chipmaker warned of lower future margins on its AI system sales, despite forecasting strong quarterly revenue, deepening concerns about the profitability of investments in the technology.

Other chip stocks including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-Q) and Nvidia (NVDA-Q) lost 0.3 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, a day after Oracle (ORCL-N) unveiled a weak forecast.

Shares of the cloud company fell 1.2 per cent after logging its biggest daily drop since January in the previous session.

Despite the gloomy overhang, the S&P 500, the Dow and the Russell 2000 all closed at record highs on Thursday and were on track for weekly gains after the Fed trimmed borrowing costs and delivered a less hawkish outlook than investors had feared.

Among others, Vancouver's Lululemon Athletica (LULU-Q) jumped 9.8 per cent after the apparel maker said that CEO Calvin McDonald was leaving the company and raised its annual profit forecast.

Goldman Sachs' new chief U.S. equity strategist Ben Snider (the widely regarded David Kostin retired) published his S&P 500 targets for 2026. 

The details underscore the incredible dominance of the tech hyperscalers in terms of both size and profit generation,

“We forecast S&P 500 EPS growth of 12 per cent year/year in 2026 (to $305) and 10 per cent in 2027 (to $336). Our estimates incorporate GS macro forecasts for solid US GDP growth and a weaker US dollar alongside GS equity analyst forecasts for continued earnings strength among the largest technology stocks. Our 12-per-cent EPS growth forecast for 2026 combines revenue growth of 7 per cent with 70 bp of profit margin expansion. The seven largest stocks in the S&P 500 (NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, AVGO, META) account for 36 per cent of S&P 500 market cap and 26 per cent of earnings and should contribute 46 per cent of index EPS growth in 2026. This represents a decline from their 50-per-cent contribution in 2025 as earnings growth for the S&P 493 accelerates from 7 per cent in 2025 to 9 per cent in 2026. The mega-caps' above-average sales growth and profit margins provide a mechanical tailwind to margins for the aggregate S&P 500. For example, if NVDA sales grow by 50 per cent in 2026 and its margins remain flat, the S&P 500 profit margin would rise by 30 bp from that boost alone. We expect AI-driven productivity gains will lift S&P 500 EPS by 0.4 per cent in 2026 and 1.5 per cent in 2027”

CIBC Capital Markets bank analyst Paul Holden is struggling to see upside in major bank stocks,

“The banks reported another strong set of EPS beats with FQ4, making it four for four on the year. We remain positive on the outlook based on excess capital, conservative credit provisioning, an expectation for improving economic conditions into F2027 and potential for regulatory capital relief. However, we are increasingly challenged to paint significant upside for the group given valuation multiples and rising consensus estimates. Our two Outperformers are TD and BMO, where we believe consensus estimates remain low and where relative valuation multiples look reasonable … Key themes for F2026. F2025 results got a huge lift from capital markets, wealth management and NIM [net interest margin] expansion. We expect the primary drivers of F2026 EPS growth will be somewhat different: NIM expansion (again), expense efficiencies and capital deployment. We think our two Outperformers are well positioned across these drivers”

RBC Capital Markets head of global commodity strategy Helima Croft expects the U.S. to force a regime change in Venezuela that will eventually affect global crude markets,

“We are currently watching the U.S. military buildup off the coast of Venezuela and believe a U.S.-led regime change operation is likely in the cards in the coming weeks or Q1'26 … Even if President Maduro leaves Venezuela voluntarily, we think it will be a protracted process before the country sees significant production gains due to the decades -long decline of the sector. Removing all sanctions could in principle lead to a relatively swift increase of several hundred kb/d, but anything beyond that would require enormous investment and a stable operating environment. They also warned that the military could play the spoiler role in a contested power situation since it plays such a large role in the operations of PDVSA [state-owned crude and natural gas producer] —as well as the broader economy”

Analysts at TD Cowen think “2026 could be real estate's turn to outperform.”

“Following two years of wide underperformance comparable to 1998-1999 (which led to four years of subsequent outperformance), REITs increasingly appear ready to regain some market leadership,” said the firm's real estate equity team, led by Sam Damiani and Jonathan Kelcher. 

“Macro changes are hard to predict, but REITs offer attractive and stable yields and growth while biding time until the next catalyst for a bounce in valuations.”

Shares of cannabis companies jumped on Friday after the Washington Post reported U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to push the government to dramatically loosen federal restrictions on marijuana.

U.S.-listed shares of Tilray Brands (TLRY-Q, TLRY-T) gained 28 per cent, while SNDL (SNDL-Q), Canopy Growth (CGC-Q, WEED-T) and ETF AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis (MSOS-A) were up between 13.5 per cent and 32.5 per cent in premarket trading.

According to the report from Thursday, Mr. Trump plans to direct agencies to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug, reducing oversight of the plant and its derivatives to the same level as some common prescription painkillers and other drugs.

“We believe this would open the door for pharmaceutical companies to seek approval for more cannabis products, which could then be dispensed the same as other prescription drugs,” TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note.

Mr. Trump's administration has been looking to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a shift that could ease criminal penalties and reshape the industry through potentially lower taxes and by making it easier to secure funding.

Funding remains one of the biggest challenges for cannabis producers, as federal restrictions keep most banks and institutional investors out of the sector, forcing pot producers to turn to costly loans or alternative lenders.

Broadcom shares (AVGO-Q) fell nearly 6 per cent before the market open on Friday after the chipmaker said its margins would fall due to a higher mix of AI revenue, adding to worries about the payout from AI.

Investor optimism over the nascent technology has recently cooled amid bubble concerns, wiping out hundreds of billions in tech market value since late October. Adding to the worries, Oracle's massive spending and weak forecasts fanned doubts over how quickly the big bets on AI will pay off, sparking a tech selloff in the previous session.

“Right now, the spending intentions still seem so big by so many, hitting that panic button is premature,” said Ben Reitzes, analyst at Melius Research.

Broadcom's margins will be affected throughout the year by the revenue mix of infrastructure, software and semiconductors, while it has a US$73-billion backlog that it anticipates shipping over the next 18 months.

“We attribute the selloff to commentary on gross margin dilution from AI chips. We aren't concerned with this, given that these chips are operating-margin-accretive,” said analysts at Morningstar.

Broadcom has gained from strong demand for its custom chips amid a major data center buildout, securing a growing foothold in an industry led by Nvidia, with its stock rising nearly 75 per cent this year.

Global markets advanced following strength on Wall Street overnight, though a fresh decline in Oracle's share price sent jitters through the tech sector.

Wall Street futures were mixed as tech concerns continue to weigh on the Nasdaq.

TSX futures edged up after Canada's main stock market closed at another record high yesterday.

“Oracle announced disappointing earnings alongside further investment in data centres, triggering fresh concerns about AI-related spending, with investors questioning whether the high level of investment will ultimately deliver the required returns,” analysts from Westpac wrote in a research note.

Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.42 per cent in morning trading. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.3 per cent, Germany's DAX advanced 0.52 per cent and France's CAC 40 climbed 0.69 per cent.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed 1.37 per cent higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.75 per cent.

World shares rose on Friday, tracking Wall Street's climb to records despite a sell-off for Oracle as worries persisted about a potential bubble in artificial-intelligence technology.

The future for the S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1 per cent, while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent.

In early European trading, Germany's DAX added nearly 0.6 per cent to 24,427.67. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.4 per cent to 9,737.25, and the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.4 per cent to 8,141.66.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index climbed 1.4 per cent to 50,836.55, rebounding from the previous session's losses.

Investors remain cautious ahead of next week's policy meeting of the Bank of Japan, where it is expected to raise interest rates, but technology shares helped lead broad gains.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 inched up 0.2 per cent to 6,901.00 and eked past its prior all-time closing high, which was set in October. The Dow Jones Industrial leaped 1.3 per cent to 48,704.01, to top its own record set last month. The Nasdaq composite lagged behind and slipped 0.3 per cent to 23,593.86 because of weakness in AI stocks.

It's the latest return to records for the market following what had appeared to be a debilitating set of worries. Some of the most recent included concerns about what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates and whether all the dollars flowing into AI chips and data centers will produce profits and productivity as prolific as proponents are promising.

Oracle shares fell 10.8 per cent on Thursday in their biggest one-day drop since late January.Brian Snyder/Reuters

The S&P 500 and the Dow boasted record closing highs on Thursday after a U.S. Federal Reserve policy update that was less hawkish than expected, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq underperformed as Oracle Corp.'s ORCL-N financial update made investors wary of artificial-intelligence bets. The TSX also closed at another record.

Oracle shares tumbled 10.8 per cent in their biggest one-day drop since late January, and they were the top S&P 500 decliner after the company's quarterly forecasts fell short of analysts' estimates. It had also warned that annual spending would run US$15-billion higher than previously planned, stoking fears about its big push into AI. The cost of insuring Oracle debt against default surged as investors feared that the company's heavy reliance on debt financing could be part of an AI bubble similar to the dot-com bust of the early 2000s.

While Oracle helped drag other technology names lower, the Dow rallied along with the Russell 2000 small-cap index, which closed up 1.2 per cent and the S&P 500 value index, up 0.6 per cent, outperformed the growth index, which ended off 0.12 per cent.

Investors also continued to digest the U.S. central bank's update from Wednesday, when the Fed lowered borrowing costs by 25 basis points and chair Jerome Powell signalled a pause on further easing. However, investors were relieved that the Fed still had some rate cuts on its dot plot as it balanced still-elevated inflation with signs of labour market weakness.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 646.26 points, or 1.34 per cent, to 48,704.01, vaulting above its Nov. 12 closing record. The S&P 500 gained 14.32 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 6,901.00, breaching its Oct. 28 record close. The Nasdaq Composite lost 60.30 points, or 0.25 per cent, to 23,593.86.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index ended up 169.88 points, or 0.5 per cent, at 31,660.73, surpassing its record closing high on Wednesday.

S&P 500, Nasdaq open lower as Broadcom adds to AI bubble angst

 

 

 

- Darcy Keith

There's been no shortage of the usual year-ahead forecasts for the S&P 500 in recent weeks from Street analysts. But FactSet is out today with a report that looks at Street forecasts using a unique “bottom-up” approach, instead of the usual “top-down”. 

This bottom-up target price for the index at year-end 2026 is calculated by aggregating the median target price estimates, based on the company-level target prices submitted by industry analysts, for all the stocks in the index.

The result of this unusual number crunching: a target price for the S&P 500 of 7,968.78, which is about 15 per cent higher than current levels. 

“At the sector level, the Information Technology (+19.8%) sector is expected to see the largest price increase, as this sector has the largest upside difference between the bottom-up target price and the closing price. On the other hand, the Financials (+8.3%) sector is expected to see the smallest price increase, as this sector has the smallest upside difference between the bottom-up target price and the closing price,” FactSet said in the report.

But how has this forecasting approach worked in the past?

“At the end of last year (December 31, 2024), the bottom-up target price for the S&P 500 was 6,728.40. Based on yesterday's closing price of 6,901.00, analysts underestimated the price of the index by 2.5% at the start of calendar year 2025 as of yesterday. However, it is important to note that industry analysts have historically overestimated the closing price of the index at the start of the year. Over the previous 20 years (2005 – 2024), the average difference between the bottom-up target price estimate at the beginning of the year (December 31) and the final price for the index for that same year has been 5.9 per cent.”

Most Wall Street analysts liked Broadcom's (AVGO-Q) earnings but markets really hated it, and sold the stock along with most of the AI-related market sector. Oracle didn't help, announcing that some of their data centres slated to open next year will have to wait until 2027. 

Citi analyst Christopher Danely applauded Broadcom's announcement of a new customer, Anthropic, and 13 per cent year over year gain in revenue. Next quarter revenue was guided higher by 6.0 per cent. A big negative, however: Broadcom guided gross margins lower by 1.0 per cent. 

The stock is trading sharply lower – down 11 per cent in midday trading. Oracle's announcement of data center delays has its stock down just over 5.0 per cent. 

Despite the fall on Friday, its stock is up nearly 70 per cent for the year.

It trades at about 32 times enterprise value to forward core earnings, compared with 19.6 times for AI chip giant Nvidia and 30.2 times for Advanced Micro Devices, according to Reuters. Nvidia shares are up 34 per cent this year, while AMD has gained 83 per cent.

More drops for superstars that had earlier soared in Wall Street's frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology are dragging the U.S. stock market off their records on Friday.

The S&P 500 fell 1.2% from its all-time high set the day before, and the weakness for tech stocks yanked the Nasdaq composite down a market-leading 1.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 266 points, or 0.5%, from its own record set the day before, as of 11:30 a.m. Eastern time.

Broadcom dragged the market lower and tumbled 10.5% even though the chip company reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. 

Broadcom's stumble came a day after Oracle plunged nearly 11% despite likewise reporting a bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

Doubts remain about whether all the spending that Oracle is doing on AI technology will end up being worth it, along with how it will pay for it. Such questions are dogging the AI industry broadly, even as many billions of dollars continue to flow in.

Broadcom was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 Friday, followed by Nvidia. The chip company that's become the poster child of the AI boom fell 2.5%.

The stock market was also broadly feeling pressure from the bond market, where the yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.19% from 4.14% late Thursday. The gains were biggest for yields of the longest-term Treasurys, which tend to track long-term expectations for economic growth and inflation.

The stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has much less of an emphasis on tech, are still up 1% for the week so far. That's much better than the Nasdaq composite's drop of 1.7%.

Shares of Rivian Automotive (RIVN-Q) surged 18% on Friday as analysts issued bullish commentary on the electric pickup truck and SUV maker's efforts to develop a custom chip for self-driving features and its integration of artificial intelligence.

The stock had closed about 6% lower on Thursday after the company's announcements at its first Autonomy and AI Day, where it said it would shift away from Nvidia's processors that power autonomous driving and had launched a paid package for self-driving features.

Rivian's shares rose 17.9% to $19.37, its highest in nearly two years. The stock had risen about 24% this year, as of Thursday's close.

The company's new R2 model cars, which are expected to roll out first half of 2026, will carry the new chips.

The self-driving and driver-assistance systems still require human oversight. The company expects to launch “eyes-off” functionality in 2026.

“The event exceeded our expectations and cements our view for Rivian to become the number 2 North America EV player, even leapfrogging Tesla right now in certain AI-integration areas,” James Picariello, senior analyst at BNP Paribas said.

Brokerage Needham and Co raised its price target by 64% to US $23 per share, citing increased confidence “in Rivian's positioning as software-defined vehicles increasingly become industry table stakes.”

Rivian's custom self-driving and AI chip, dubbed the Rivian Autonomy Processor, will be produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Canada's benchmark stock index dropped on Friday, ending a week filled with central bank meetings.

At 11:28 a.m. ET, The TSX index was was down 252.98 points, or 0.8 per cent, at 31,407.75. The commodity-heavy index is up 28 per cent for the year and has outperformed its Wall Street peers due to a stellar performance from its mining and materials shares.

“Global stocks are trading at record highs despite ongoing technology valuation doubts,” said Bob Savage, head of markets macro strategy at BNY.

“The ongoing themes of equity sector rotation, a better 2026 outlook aided by Fed easing, and tame inflation leave hopes that doing nothing will keep the holiday rally intact.”

Information technology stocks lead declines, falling 4.3 per cent, with Celestica Inc. (CLS-T) dropping 12.1 per cent and Lightspeed Commerce Inc. (LSPD-T) losing 3.1 per cent.

Healthcare index gained the most on Friday at 5.4 per cent, with the shares of cannabis firm Curaleaf (CURA-T) soaring 26 per cent.

Shares of cannabis companies rose after a Washington Post report said U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to push the government to dramatically loosen federal restrictions on marijuana. Canada's Canopy Growth and Tilray Brands rose 22 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively.

The founder of Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU-Q) is calling for an overhaul of the company's board of directors, as the purveyor of athleisure searches for a new chief executive officer – accusing the leadership of “complacency” as the brand has lost its cachet.

Friday's statement from Chip Wilson followed the news of CEO Calvin McDonald's ouster on Thursday afternoon.

Mr. McDonald, who has led Lululemon since 2018, will step down at the end of January. While he presided over years of growth at the company, under his leadership Lululemon also experienced a significant slowdown in its U.S. business starting last year.

The company's stock price – which had dropped by more than 50 per cent this year prior to the news – jumped by roughly 10 per cent in Friday-morning trading.

The founder, Mr. Wilson, took credit for Mr. McDonald's departure in his statement on Friday, saying that he had been urging members of the company “publicly and privately” to spearhead a “revitalization and an infusion of new skills” to fix its lagging performance.

Silver often gets dismissed as gold's poor cousin. But that title hardly stands up to the reality of this past year. The precious metal has soared 120 per cent year to date, and the spot price reached a record US$64.09 per ounce this morning in London. That's about a 10-per-cent weekly gain. Not bad for a commodity that rarely comes up in dinner conversations.

Various reasons have been linked to the rally. Gold's surge (the two metals often trade in tandem) and the general decline in the U.S. dollar have surely played a role. Strong demand for physical silver from Indian consumers and from the solar industry – which is eager to help meet demand for the power needs of AI chips – has probably helped too. 

But Capital Economics is out Friday with a warning for those investors only now catching on to the powerful gains of the commodity this year. It thinks silver gains could rapidly go into reverse in the new year. 

The Bank for International Settlements argued this week that the surge in retail interest and the gold price rally is indicative of a bubble. Capital Economics thinks the same argument can be made for silver, too. It points out both gold- and silver-backed ETF holdings have increased by 15-20 per cent since the start of this year. 

“This pick-up in investment demand for precious metals, especially in the West where sentiment tends to be sensitive to changes in US monetary policy, could rapidly shift into reverse. A potential trigger could be if, as we expect, concerns about Fed independence prove to be overblown,” wrote Capital Economics climate and commodities economist Hamad Hussain in a note this week. 

“Admittedly, silver prices may rise further in the near term since the risk of US tariffs still looms. For context, the ongoing Section 232 trade investigation on critical minerals, which includes silver, has coincided with a hoarding of silver inventories on the COMEX and this appears to have caused stress in the broader silver market. But while we have no insight as to whether tariffs will be put in place, it is notable that Trump backed away from tariffing gold when similar dynamics in that market were playing out. In any case, the tariff uncertainty should end by mid-April at the latest when President Trump would be expected to make a decision.”

Mr. Hussain also notes the gold/silver price ratio – a commonly used valuation metric – has fallen sharply since ‘Liberation Day'. “Of course, price ratios are not perfect guides to the future since there is no fixed level that they should revert to. But for what it's worth, the gold/silver price ratio previously bottomed out around 65 on two occasions in the past decade or so – not far from its current level.”

He thinks both gold and silver prices will fall next year, with silver falling faster, reaching US$42 an ounce by the end of 2026. 

If true, it could be a rough year for Canadian precious metals producers that have a heavy exposure to silver.

The K-shaped economy meme – the economy improving for the wealthy while deteriorating for the lower wealth quintiles – might be going in reverse, according to BofA Securities investment strategist Michael Hartnett in his weekly report. 

Mr. Hartnett often needs to come with subtitles, but there's an important trend evident in his weekly Flow Show report. He writes, “Ferrari falling sharply vs General Motors; K-shape ‘rich vs poor' consumer all the rage in '25, but markets front-running ‘run-it-hot' in '26 via rotation to ‘Main St' (MDY MidCap, IYR Small-Cap, IWC Microcap) from ‘Wall St' (MGC Mega Cap)”

The relative returns for Ferrari and General Motors potentially indicates the reversal of the K-shaped “rich versus poor” economic trend. The “run-it-hot” idea is that fund managers are positioning for an inflationary environment that benefits less wealth cohorts. They are buying SPDR S&P Midcap 400 ETF (MDY-A), iShares U.S. Real Estate (IYR-A) and iShares Microcap (IWC-A) while reducing Vanguard Mega Cap Index ETF (MGC-A).

Oil prices inched lower on Friday and were on track for a weekly decline as investors focussed on a supply glut and potential Russia-Ukraine peace deal, which outweighed concerns over Venezuelan supply disruptions.

Brent crude futures were down 14 US cents, or 0.2 per cent, to US$61.14 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was down 3 US cents at US$57.57. Both benchmarks fell by about 1.5 per cent on Thursday.

While there might be sporadic support from hits to supply, the general market mood reflects supply exceeding demand, and any rallies are expected to be brief, said PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga.

Brent and WTI have lost more than 4 per cent this week. International Energy Agency forecasts published on Thursday indicated that global oil supply will exceed demand by 3.84 million barrels per day next year - a volume equal to almost 4% of world demand.

Canada's main stock index opened higher on Friday, with mining shares leading gains at the close of a week filled with highly anticipated central bank meetings.

At 9:30 a.m. ET, Toronto's S&P/TSX composite index was up 0.24 per cent at 31,737.44 points.

In New York, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq opened lower on Friday as Broadcom's latest results added to concerns about an AI-fueled bubble, dampening optimism stoked by the Federal Reserve's less-hawkish-than-expected signals on 2026 rate cuts.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 102.80 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 48,806.81, the S&P 500 lost 10.85 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 6,890.37 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 105.00 points, or 0.43 per cent, to 23,491.12. 

Broadcom (AVGO-Q) slid 7.9 per cent in early trade after the chipmaker warned of slimmer future margins on its AI system sales, despite projecting strong quarterly revenue. This sharpened worries about the profitability of surging AI investments.

Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica (LULU-Q) jumped 10.7 per cent after the apparel maker said that CEO Calvin McDonald was leaving the company and raised its annual profit forecast.

Shares of Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU-Q) are poised to soar after the late Thursday announcement chief executive officer Calvin McDonald will step down at the end of January.

Mr. McDonald, who has led the athleisure retailer since 2018, has been struggling to reassure investors amid a slowdown in its U.S. business and as its stock price plunged by 50 per cent since the beginning of the year.

Lululemon has hired an executive search firm and is looking for its next CEO, the company announced Thursday. Mr. McDonald will leave the role on Jan. 31, 2026, and will also step away from the company's board of directors but will continue as a senior adviser until March 31.

The announcement overshadowed the release of third-quarter financial results that exceeded the Street's expectations. That included earnings per share of US$2.59, topping the consensus projection of US$2.21, driven by higher gross profit dollars and share repurchases.

“Results were better than feared and FY25 revenue and guidance moves higher at the midpoint,” said Stifel analyst Peter McGoldrick in a client note. “We continue to believe the stock will remain range-bound until the core Americas business stabilizes; continued challenges (Americas negative 5-per-cent cc comp vs. negative 3 per cent cc in 2Q25) with concentration around shopping holidays and promotional seeking behavior points to uneven trends in demand, which we expect persist into CY26. We expect the forthcoming leadership change catalyzes investor interest in the stock, though believe the structural market conditions driving challenging results (scaling competition, loyal customer attrition) will take time to correct.”

The company's shares have halved in value this year as it lost ground to newer rivals including Alo Yoga and Vuori in the U.S., as well as to lower-priced styles from established players such as Nike and Gap.

Lululemon's forward price-to-earnings multiple, a common benchmark for valuing stocks, is 14.66, compared to 31.26 for Nike and Abercrombie & Fitch's ratio of 10.8, according to LSEG data.

BMO senior economist Robert Kavcic found that Canadian households are a lot more liquid than the heavy debt levels would suggest. 

My strong suspicion is that these assets are not distributed equally among the populace,

“Canadian households are flush with liquid assets, another strike against those deeply concerned about conditions going into 2026. Canadians now hold almost $260 in liquid financial assets (e.g., cash, bonds and stocks, excluding pension and insurance assets) for every $100 in financial liabilities (e.g., mortgage debt). The bull market in equities is obviously helping, but so have sturdy income growth and savings. Importantly, not only is there some wealth effect here, but it is also going to help cushion households renewing into higher-rate mortgages through 2026 (the peak of the renewal wave is around mid-year). Canadians can lean on these liquid assets to reduce outstanding balances or support higher monthly payments. There are a few sidebars to explore further. Wealth in liquid financial assets is arguably more accessible than a fixed asset like housing, which has stagnated for most. Also, the distribution of increases in financial assets has, of course, been skewed to the higher end of the income spectrum”

Futures tracking the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq slipped on Friday as Broadcom's latest results reignited fears of an AI-fueled bubble and tempered the optimism sparked by a less hawkish commentary than expected from the Federal Reserve on 2026 rate cuts.

At 7:00 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 59 points, or 0.12 per cent, S&P 500 E-minis were down 15.25 points, or 0.22 per cent, Nasdaq 100 E-minis were down 162.25 points, or 0.63 per cent.

Broadcom (AVGO-Q) shares fell nearly 6 per cent in premarket trading after the chipmaker warned of lower future margins on its AI system sales, despite forecasting strong quarterly revenue, deepening concerns about the profitability of investments in the technology.

Other chip stocks including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-Q) and Nvidia (NVDA-Q) lost 0.3 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, a day after Oracle (ORCL-N) unveiled a weak forecast.

Shares of the cloud company fell 1.2 per cent after logging its biggest daily drop since January in the previous session.

Despite the gloomy overhang, the S&P 500, the Dow and the Russell 2000 all closed at record highs on Thursday and were on track for weekly gains after the Fed trimmed borrowing costs and delivered a less hawkish outlook than investors had feared.

Among others, Vancouver's Lululemon Athletica (LULU-Q) jumped 9.8 per cent after the apparel maker said that CEO Calvin McDonald was leaving the company and raised its annual profit forecast.

Goldman Sachs' new chief U.S. equity strategist Ben Snider (the widely regarded David Kostin retired) published his S&P 500 targets for 2026. 

The details underscore the incredible dominance of the tech hyperscalers in terms of both size and profit generation,

“We forecast S&P 500 EPS growth of 12 per cent year/year in 2026 (to $305) and 10 per cent in 2027 (to $336). Our estimates incorporate GS macro forecasts for solid US GDP growth and a weaker US dollar alongside GS equity analyst forecasts for continued earnings strength among the largest technology stocks. Our 12-per-cent EPS growth forecast for 2026 combines revenue growth of 7 per cent with 70 bp of profit margin expansion. The seven largest stocks in the S&P 500 (NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, AVGO, META) account for 36 per cent of S&P 500 market cap and 26 per cent of earnings and should contribute 46 per cent of index EPS growth in 2026. This represents a decline from their 50-per-cent contribution in 2025 as earnings growth for the S&P 493 accelerates from 7 per cent in 2025 to 9 per cent in 2026. The mega-caps' above-average sales growth and profit margins provide a mechanical tailwind to margins for the aggregate S&P 500. For example, if NVDA sales grow by 50 per cent in 2026 and its margins remain flat, the S&P 500 profit margin would rise by 30 bp from that boost alone. We expect AI-driven productivity gains will lift S&P 500 EPS by 0.4 per cent in 2026 and 1.5 per cent in 2027”

CIBC Capital Markets bank analyst Paul Holden is struggling to see upside in major bank stocks,

“The banks reported another strong set of EPS beats with FQ4, making it four for four on the year. We remain positive on the outlook based on excess capital, conservative credit provisioning, an expectation for improving economic conditions into F2027 and potential for regulatory capital relief. However, we are increasingly challenged to paint significant upside for the group given valuation multiples and rising consensus estimates. Our two Outperformers are TD and BMO, where we believe consensus estimates remain low and where relative valuation multiples look reasonable … Key themes for F2026. F2025 results got a huge lift from capital markets, wealth management and NIM [net interest margin] expansion. We expect the primary drivers of F2026 EPS growth will be somewhat different: NIM expansion (again), expense efficiencies and capital deployment. We think our two Outperformers are well positioned across these drivers”

RBC Capital Markets head of global commodity strategy Helima Croft expects the U.S. to force a regime change in Venezuela that will eventually affect global crude markets,

“We are currently watching the U.S. military buildup off the coast of Venezuela and believe a U.S.-led regime change operation is likely in the cards in the coming weeks or Q1'26 … Even if President Maduro leaves Venezuela voluntarily, we think it will be a protracted process before the country sees significant production gains due to the decades -long decline of the sector. Removing all sanctions could in principle lead to a relatively swift increase of several hundred kb/d, but anything beyond that would require enormous investment and a stable operating environment. They also warned that the military could play the spoiler role in a contested power situation since it plays such a large role in the operations of PDVSA [state-owned crude and natural gas producer] —as well as the broader economy”

Analysts at TD Cowen think “2026 could be real estate's turn to outperform.”

“Following two years of wide underperformance comparable to 1998-1999 (which led to four years of subsequent outperformance), REITs increasingly appear ready to regain some market leadership,” said the firm's real estate equity team, led by Sam Damiani and Jonathan Kelcher. 

“Macro changes are hard to predict, but REITs offer attractive and stable yields and growth while biding time until the next catalyst for a bounce in valuations.”

Shares of cannabis companies jumped on Friday after the Washington Post reported U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to push the government to dramatically loosen federal restrictions on marijuana.

U.S.-listed shares of Tilray Brands (TLRY-Q, TLRY-T) gained 28 per cent, while SNDL (SNDL-Q), Canopy Growth (CGC-Q, WEED-T) and ETF AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis (MSOS-A) were up between 13.5 per cent and 32.5 per cent in premarket trading.

According to the report from Thursday, Mr. Trump plans to direct agencies to reclassify marijuana as a Schedule III drug, reducing oversight of the plant and its derivatives to the same level as some common prescription painkillers and other drugs.

“We believe this would open the door for pharmaceutical companies to seek approval for more cannabis products, which could then be dispensed the same as other prescription drugs,” TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note.

Mr. Trump's administration has been looking to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a shift that could ease criminal penalties and reshape the industry through potentially lower taxes and by making it easier to secure funding.

Funding remains one of the biggest challenges for cannabis producers, as federal restrictions keep most banks and institutional investors out of the sector, forcing pot producers to turn to costly loans or alternative lenders.

Broadcom shares (AVGO-Q) fell nearly 6 per cent before the market open on Friday after the chipmaker said its margins would fall due to a higher mix of AI revenue, adding to worries about the payout from AI.

Investor optimism over the nascent technology has recently cooled amid bubble concerns, wiping out hundreds of billions in tech market value since late October. Adding to the worries, Oracle's massive spending and weak forecasts fanned doubts over how quickly the big bets on AI will pay off, sparking a tech selloff in the previous session.

“Right now, the spending intentions still seem so big by so many, hitting that panic button is premature,” said Ben Reitzes, analyst at Melius Research.

Broadcom's margins will be affected throughout the year by the revenue mix of infrastructure, software and semiconductors, while it has a US$73-billion backlog that it anticipates shipping over the next 18 months.

“We attribute the selloff to commentary on gross margin dilution from AI chips. We aren't concerned with this, given that these chips are operating-margin-accretive,” said analysts at Morningstar.

Broadcom has gained from strong demand for its custom chips amid a major data center buildout, securing a growing foothold in an industry led by Nvidia, with its stock rising nearly 75 per cent this year.

Global markets advanced following strength on Wall Street overnight, though a fresh decline in Oracle's share price sent jitters through the tech sector.

Wall Street futures were mixed as tech concerns continue to weigh on the Nasdaq.

TSX futures edged up after Canada's main stock market closed at another record high yesterday.

“Oracle announced disappointing earnings alongside further investment in data centres, triggering fresh concerns about AI-related spending, with investors questioning whether the high level of investment will ultimately deliver the required returns,” analysts from Westpac wrote in a research note.

Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.42 per cent in morning trading. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.3 per cent, Germany's DAX advanced 0.52 per cent and France's CAC 40 climbed 0.69 per cent.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei closed 1.37 per cent higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.75 per cent.

World shares rose on Friday, tracking Wall Street's climb to records despite a sell-off for Oracle as worries persisted about a potential bubble in artificial-intelligence technology.

The future for the S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1 per cent, while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.3 per cent.

In early European trading, Germany's DAX added nearly 0.6 per cent to 24,427.67. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.4 per cent to 9,737.25, and the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.4 per cent to 8,141.66.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index climbed 1.4 per cent to 50,836.55, rebounding from the previous session's losses.

Investors remain cautious ahead of next week's policy meeting of the Bank of Japan, where it is expected to raise interest rates, but technology shares helped lead broad gains.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 inched up 0.2 per cent to 6,901.00 and eked past its prior all-time closing high, which was set in October. The Dow Jones Industrial leaped 1.3 per cent to 48,704.01, to top its own record set last month. The Nasdaq composite lagged behind and slipped 0.3 per cent to 23,593.86 because of weakness in AI stocks.

It's the latest return to records for the market following what had appeared to be a debilitating set of worries. Some of the most recent included concerns about what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates and whether all the dollars flowing into AI chips and data centers will produce profits and productivity as prolific as proponents are promising.

Oracle shares fell 10.8 per cent on Thursday in their biggest one-day drop since late January.Brian Snyder/Reuters

The S&P 500 and the Dow boasted record closing highs on Thursday after a U.S. Federal Reserve policy update that was less hawkish than expected, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq underperformed as Oracle Corp.'s ORCL-N financial update made investors wary of artificial-intelligence bets. The TSX also closed at another record.

Oracle shares tumbled 10.8 per cent in their biggest one-day drop since late January, and they were the top S&P 500 decliner after the company's quarterly forecasts fell short of analysts' estimates. It had also warned that annual spending would run US$15-billion higher than previously planned, stoking fears about its big push into AI. The cost of insuring Oracle debt against default surged as investors feared that the company's heavy reliance on debt financing could be part of an AI bubble similar to the dot-com bust of the early 2000s.

While Oracle helped drag other technology names lower, the Dow rallied along with the Russell 2000 small-cap index, which closed up 1.2 per cent and the S&P 500 value index, up 0.6 per cent, outperformed the growth index, which ended off 0.12 per cent.

Investors also continued to digest the U.S. central bank's update from Wednesday, when the Fed lowered borrowing costs by 25 basis points and chair Jerome Powell signalled a pause on further easing. However, investors were relieved that the Fed still had some rate cuts on its dot plot as it balanced still-elevated inflation with signs of labour market weakness.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 646.26 points, or 1.34 per cent, to 48,704.01, vaulting above its Nov. 12 closing record. The S&P 500 gained 14.32 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 6,901.00, breaching its Oct. 28 record close. The Nasdaq Composite lost 60.30 points, or 0.25 per cent, to 23,593.86.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index ended up 169.88 points, or 0.5 per cent, at 31,660.73, surpassing its record closing high on Wednesday.

The humiliation Washington is inflicting on Western Europe today will shape an entire generation of politicians who will eventually have to rediscover how to deal with Russia. The lessons they are absorbing now may prove as important as those learned by previous Western European leaders who built a dialogue with the USSR after 1945.

Over the past year, we have grown accustomed to watching the US treat its European allies with increasing roughness. But it would be a mistake to simply enjoy the spectacle. Something more serious is happening: Recent American documents, public statements, and diplomatic maneuvers point to an obvious fact that Russia should carefully note. The US is not the EU's friend. It is not even a reliable ally. Its behavior is grounded in a deep cultural arrogance and an instinctive greed, and these are constants that will not change regardless of who sits in the White House.

Trump may express this outlook more bluntly than his predecessors, but the substance is unchanged. Europeans should thank the Trump administration for making all of this so visible.

Against this backdrop, Russia should not rule out the possibility that relations with our European neighbors could eventually be rebuilt. The half-continent is our neighbor, whether we like it or not. But that does not mean Russia wants to absorb or dominate it. Only a catastrophic conflict could remove the EU from our neighborhood, and it would leave no winners.

For any future restoration of ties, at least three conditions matter. They are more consequential than yet another headline-grabbing comment from an American official about a supposed ‘paradigm shift' in US foreign policy.

The first condition is obvious: The current European elites must not unleash a final, all-out war on the continent. They have already done so twice. Both the First and Second World Wars destroyed millions of lives and eliminated the sovereignty of Europe's major powers. World War I destroyed Europe's global empires. World War II consolidated American dominance over the half-continent. Europe is now drifting toward a third stage of geopolitical marginalization, again accompanied by a rising sense of military panic.

European politicians and generals have become so eager to talk publicly about war with Russia that President Vladimir Putin was forced to address the matter a few days ago. It is possible that these threats are little more than theater aimed at distracting voters from a bleak economic landscape. Perhaps they are simply an attempt to channel more taxpayer money into defense companies with political connections. But as a responsible nuclear power, Russia cannot ignore this rhetoric.

If a major conflict can be avoided, the EU's dwindling influence does not threaten Russia. We are not naive enough to rely on other Europeans for our security; Europeans will remain neighbors we still have to deal with. And frankly, weak neighbors are easier to manage than strong ones.

A second condition concerns the US itself. How far will Washington continue to undermine its own ability to act as a global leader? Right now, the trend is accelerating. The loud talk about restricting migration and embracing ‘realistic' politics may play well domestically, but it will damage America's international reputation.

Realism is not inherently negative. It signals a willingness to abandon unnecessary ideological dogmas. But there is a price. Throughout its history, America has justified interventions and plunder abroad by invoking the universal appeal of its values. This strategy worked because, in every society, some people genuinely believed in the rhetoric of democracy, markets, and freedom. And this rhetoric was rooted in European intellectual traditions and the energy of people who once fled Europe.

Trumpism is different. Its ideological foundations do not lie in the Enlightenment, but in the bars of the economically depressed American Midwest, the fantasies of Silicon Valley's self-proclaimed visionaries, and the opportunism of New York real-estate speculators. This is a far weaker basis for sustaining global influence.

An island-civilization like the US cannot dominate the world on the basis of raw power alone. It requires willing supporters. Will the same number of people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America rally behind Washington's new ‘realism' as they once did behind its claims to defend ‘freedom and democracy'? It is unclear.

Migration is another factor. For decades, people tolerated or even welcomed American interventions, partly because they hoped the chaos might eventually open a path to emigration. Few people admire US foreign policy, but many dream of living in the US. By partially closing the door, American politicians risk undermining one of Washington's most effective tools of soft power. Perhaps the US will eventually reverse course. For now, there is no sign of it.

Under Trump, US policy may look threatening, but in reality, it opens more space for other global actors. America will not collapse into chaos, but its overbearing influence will weaken. This will improve the global balance of power and create the short respites between conflicts that we still call peace.

The final condition relates to Europe's internal politics. The continent desperately needs new leaders. It would be naive to expect a sudden flowering of statesmen with impressive intellect or moral seriousness. But perhaps, at a national level, the current crop of hopeless figures from the 1990s and 2000s will gradually be replaced by people slightly better suited to today's reality.

For Russia, this shift would be useful. For the EU, it is essential.

The humiliation the US is inflicting on Europe today is not just an episode in transatlantic relations. It is a formative event. The politicians who will one day negotiate with Russia are watching the US treat them not as partners, but as subordinates. The more openly the Americans behave like demanding overseers rather than allies, the more enduring the lesson will be.

And that is ultimately good for Russia's long-term interests and for stability across the continent.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Russia's Slavneft-YANOS oil refinery in Yaroslavl, one of the country's five largest, is reportedly on fire after being struck in an overnight drone attack on Dec. 12, officials and local Telegram channels said.

Residents reported at least seven explosions over the city, followed by reports of a fire at the Slavneft-YANOS refinery, located more than 700 kilometers (435 miles) from the Ukrainian border.

Open-source intelligence (OSINT) said the facility was struck, while Yaroslavl Governor Mikhail Yevrayev had earlier warned of a drone threat in the region.

Astra, an independent Telegram channel based in Russia, posted photos and video of an ongoing fire at the facility on the morning of Dec. 12. 

The Slavneft-YANOS plant is a major producer of fuels including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, with a processing capacity of about 15 million tons of crude per year.

Multiple other regions were targeted throughout the night, including Tver, Smolensk, and Moscow. In Tver, a drone explosion damaged the lower floors of a residential building and injured seven people, according to local authorities.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said Russian air defenses intercepted eight drones approaching the capital.

The extent of the damage remains unclear, and Ukraine has not commented on the reported strike.

Ukraine repeatedly uses homegrown long-range drones to launch attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure. Russia's oil and gas production has continued to come under attack as Kyiv attempts to cripple Moscow's primary source of funding for its war in Ukraine.

Ukrainian Defense Forces have encircled Russian troops in Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, and cleared its northwestern outskirts, the open-source intelligence group DeepState reported on Dec. 12.



Ukraine's Security Service said Friday that it detained three men suspected of planting two homemade bombs that killed a National Guard serviceman and wounded four other people in Kyiv a day earlier.





President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised troops in the Kupiansk direction and said battlefield gains strengthen Ukraine's diplomatic position, as the National Guard's 2nd Khartiia Corps reported a counterattack north of the city.




"We must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents and great-grandparents endured," NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned.

A Russian airstrike on Odesa on Dec. 12 damaged infrastructure and left parts of the city without electricity and water, head of the Odesa Military Administration, Serhiy Lysak, reported.

“Odesa has suffered another hostile attack” Lysak said on Telegram, adding that information about potential casualties was still being verified.

He later added that a residential building was also damaged during the attack.

Emergency and utility services have been deployed to the site of the strike and are working to assess and repair the damage, he said.

Russia has continued targeting civilian energy and utility systems across Ukraine as part of its broader campaign against critical infrastructure.

On Dec. 8, Sumy was left without power after more than a dozen Russian drones hit sites across the city within the span of half an hour. 

Overnight on Dec. 6, a Russian mass missile and drone attack hammered Ukraine's energy infrastructure, hitting substations, generation facilities, and disconnecting one of the power lines that supplies the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

 Why America and China Are the World's Only Great Powers

 Jennifer Lind

The churn of great-power politics shapes the world and touches, for good or ill, the lives of people everywhere. Wars among great powers have killed millions of people; victorious great powers have also set up international orders whose norms and rules affect global peace and prosperity. Great powers also intervene in other countries' politics, covertly and overtly, sometimes violently. In other words, great powers matter.

Polarity—how many great powers there are—matters, too. Consider the past three decades of U.S.-led unipolarity. Freed from the constraining effects of a great-power rival, Washington deployed its forces around the world and conducted military actions in multiple countries, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Serbia. The dangers of bipolarity, however, are different. Superpowers in a bipolar structure compete obsessively, creating spheres and buffers by cultivating protégés and installing puppets. Multipolarity, meanwhile, in which three or more great powers are present, is said to be the most prone to war because alliances are precarious and the fluidity of alignments makes the balance of power harder to estimate.

Although it matters how many great powers there are at a given time, no one agrees on how to define them (and thus count them). People also disagree about the requirements—what a country must do or possess—to be considered a great power. Yet all the time, relative power among countries is shifting. During the Cold War, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev vowed that his country would “bury” the United States, and many people feared it would. And in the 1980s, Americans watching Japan's economic boom worried that the United States would be overtaken by the “rising sun.” Today, scholars and policymakers debate whether China will rival the United States as a superpower or is already in decline. The rise of India and the resurgence of Russia, meanwhile, have led many to proclaim the arrival of multipolarity. Widely divergent views about the balance of power are common because power, although foundational to international politics, remains an elusive concept.

To reckon with this challenge, I developed a methodology for comparing national power—one that uses common metrics (GDP, for instance, or military expenditure) in modern and historical data to determine a threshold for great-power status. My study found that arguing about whether China is catching up to the United States misses the point. Great powers have often been far weaker than the leading state—the most powerful country in the global system—but nevertheless engaged in dangerous security competitions. Moreover, my methodology revealed that China today is already more powerful than the Soviet Union was during the Cold War. Modern China, then, is not just a great power but a superpower.

The world, in short, is bipolar. Many middle powers are influential actors within their regions, but only the United States and China exceed the great-power threshold. This development explains rising tension in U.S.-Chinese relations and suggests that other countries will find it increasingly difficult to stay out of the crossfire of the rivalry. Bipolarity, for instance, helps explain the recent U.S. preoccupation with Latin America, where China has gained significant economic and political influence. As the dynamic between China and the United States grows only more competitive, Washington will find such encroachments intolerable—just as China may similarly refuse to accept U.S. political and military involvement in its own backyard.

My methodology began with a list, generated with help from historians and political scientists, of great powers across different historical systems since 1820. Although scholars often debate definitions of “power” and “great power,” the list reflected a consensus, and established a “ground truth,” about the balance of power over time. Using historical data, I then evaluated which metrics most accurately re-created this list. Each country's metrics were assessed as a ratio—the country's power in that metric compared with the power of the leading state during the period being analyzed. For example, the metrics show that the United States was not yet a great power in the early nineteenth century; it still lagged behind the United Kingdom on economic as well as military metrics. These same metrics, however, then illustrate how the United States overtook the United Kingdom to become a great power in the late nineteenth century.

The methodology shows that two economic metrics successfully identify great powers: GDP, as well as a composite metric that multiplied GDP by GDP per capita. Previous scholars have argued that the second metric captures two key dimensions of great power—a state's economic size versus its wealth. My metrics supported this argument by effectively distinguishing between great powers and other countries. That is, lesser powers scored low on both of these economic metrics, whereas great powers scored high, and there was a large gap between the metrics of great powers and lesser powers. GDP per capita, however, proved a poor indicator of power and failed to separate the great powers from the lesser powers. Many lesser powers have high GDP per capita. GDP per capita is also misleading because it risks obscuring regional heterogeneity. China and India, for instance, have millions of people generating high-incomes as well as regions with very low-incomes. Because it takes the average, GDP per capita obscures this heterogeneity and might misdiagnose a country as middling rather than one with wealthy, technologically advanced regions—regions with latent power and potential geopolitical implications.

Overall, this method provides a quantifiable threshold for identifying great powers. I define “normal” great powers as those falling in the middle 50 percent of the distribution of historical great powers (thereby excluding the strongest and weakest countries). The GDP range for normal great powers is between 17 and 45 percent of the leading state's GDP, with a median of 27 percent. Thus, countries with more than roughly 27 percent of the leading state's GDP possess greater economic capabilities than the median great power across history. Whether or not a country can be considered an overall great power depends on how it performs in the other metrics, but this method can reveal whether a country is above or below the basic great-power threshold. It also identifies the dimensions in which a country is stronger or weaker. Such assessments contribute to studies of power transitions in world politics, and create a valuable means of assessing contemporary changes in the balance of power—the extent to which China is declining or India is rising, for example.

Asking whether China can catch up to or overtake the United States economically is the wrong question, based on this analytical method. Historically, the leading state competed fiercely with other, far weaker great powers, which often possessed only a quarter or a third of the leader's GDP. China, in other words, does not need to match nor surpass the United States in order to be a great power and competitor. The Soviet Union was a prime example of this reality.

During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was widely deemed a superpower and major geopolitical competitor to the United States. But the Soviet Union had, at most, about 40 percent of U.S. GDP. Despite this large imbalance, the Soviets posed a threat of regional hegemony in Europe. Moscow managed complex global intelligence operations, supplied arms to insurgents across the globe, quashed national liberation movements in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, and spread communist ideology around the world. Although it trailed the United States economically, the Soviet Union preoccupied U.S. national security policy for more than three decades. The United States and the Soviet Union built massive armies, competed in a nuclear arms race, and, during numerous crises, moved the world dangerously close to nuclear war.



China, which today vastly exceeds the Soviet Union in terms of economic power, has the capability to do all this and more. In the composite metric (GDP multiplied by GDP per capita), the normal range for great powers is between eight and 28 percent of the leader's score, with a median of 15. China today, at 36 percent, has a much higher composite score than normal great powers across history. China's score also exceeds that of the Soviet Union, which reached only 16 percent at its peak in 1970. China's relative strength is also captured by the GDP metric: China's score of 130 percent is far higher than the 27 percent median. Skeptics may rightly question China's dodgy economic statistics, but even if China's true GDP is much smaller than it reports, China's margin above the normal range for GDP is so large that it would still be a great power, and well above the Soviet score of 44 percent.

China falls short of the Soviet Union in just one dimension—military expenditure. The Soviets spent 100 percent of the United States' military expenditure, whereas China today spends 32 percent. For the Soviets, however, generating such high military spending required devoting a huge share of the economy (as much as 14 percent of GDP) to defense, which ultimately proved unsustainable. China, by contrast, currently spends only about two percent of its GDP on defense, meaning it could ramp up defense spending and yet keep it at a manageable level overall. In short, my metrics suggest that China doesn't need to catch up to the United States but is already a great-power competitor both economically and militarily—one with power that far exceeds that of the United States' last bipolar competitor, the Soviet Union.

Critics might doubt whether Beijing can in fact compete, arguing that China's growth is slowing, its economy is suffering from numerous problems, and increasingly repressive policies by Chinese leader Xi Jinping will harm future innovation. Such observations identify important challenges China's economy is facing but miss the mark in a few ways.

First, China's growth plateau was a predictable outcome. Fast-growing economies always slow down at about the middle-income stage, and economies that manage to sustain growth typically settle into levels of about one to two percent per year. As has happened in the past with high-growth economies—in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, for instance—slowed growth can be caused by a number of factors, such as increasingly unfavorable demographics, rising wages, and financial crises caused by years of massive investment. Thus, China's success isn't a question of whether it can maintain its sky-high growth rates of the 1990s, but whether its economy can settle into mature and far lower rates of growth.

In this transition, the Chinese economy indeed faces major challenges, including a troubled real estate sector, massive debt, and the problem of what scholars call “involution”—hypercompetition among firms over shrinking profit margins. Nobody can predict how effectively the CCP will handle these challenges, but declarations of “peak China” are premature. Previously, skeptics have argued that China's regime would be toppled, or its economic growth torpedoed, by a variety of maladies—public backlash in response to repressive COVID-19 policies, for example, or the costs of mitigating environmental devastation. These predictions were not borne out. Most important, assuming that one's competitor will collapse, particularly when that competitor has a leadership as adaptive and capable as China's, is a poor guide for policy.



Other skeptics argue that Xi's policies—tightening controls on civil society, increasing oversight of the private sector (as seen in the tech industry crackdown after 2020), and pursuing a variety of other “neo-authoritarian” approaches—undermine China's innovative capabilities. Innovation is indeed vital for Chinese geopolitical competitiveness, and great powers must compete at the technological cutting edge. If Xi pursues policies that stymie innovation, China will struggle to keep up. But many of Beijing's policies seem to be working. Heavy investment in highly-skilled human capital, as well as research and development, has created an advanced workforce. Large government investment in key sectors such as green energy, robotics, and biotechnology has helped Chinese firms innovate and become more commercially competitive. And Xi's neo-authoritarianism has not prevented China's success in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and communications, supercomputing, and other technology arenas. In fact, in many sectors, China is not merely competitive with the United States but is vying for dominance.

Critics of the bipolar assessment might also argue that the world is actually multipolar. Russia, after all, invaded neighboring Ukraine in 2022, and its alliance with China has powerful geopolitical consequences. Germany and Japan are prominent economically, technologically, and diplomatically, and there is a growing group of influential middle powers that includes Brazil, India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey. Indeed, in 1990, middle powers produced about 15 percent of global GDP, whereas in 2022 they produced about 30 percent. Militarily, too, they are more capable. Whereas in 1990, middle powers accounted for about seven percent of global military spending, the 2022 figure was about 15 percent.

The increasingly influential role of middle powers, however, should not be confused with multipolarity, because none of these middle powers exceeds the great-power threshold for economic and military power. Germany's and Japan's low rates of military mobilization have kept them out of the great-power ranks. Whether they follow through on pledges to increase defense spending and break the great-power threshold as a result remains uncertain. Russia sits below the threshold, too. If Russia were a great power, it would have defeated Ukraine and threatened regional dominance over western Europe, as the Soviets did in the Cold War. India may someday reach great-power status if it continues to grow economically and increases its military expenditures, but it currently sits below the great-power bar. Only China and the United States currently exceed both the economic and military thresholds for great-power status.

In these early years of the bipolar era, competition between China and the United States is growing across every domain: trade, finance, technology, global governance, and military power. The reverberations of this rivalry are being felt all over the world, proving the political scientist Barry Posen's assertion that in a bipolar order, “peripheries disappear.” The United States, for example, is worrying about China's gains in the Middle East, where Beijing is increasingly becoming an important economic, technological, and security partner despite the United States' many long-standing relationships there.

The first rule of bipolarity, however, is secure your backyard. Nicolás Maduro's government in Venezuela has pursued close economic ties with China, and recent U.S. military pressure in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific is in part a warning to Caracas and other governments in the region about the consequences of cozying up to Beijing. Earlier this year, the Trump administration similarly signaled to Panama that continuing to allow Chinese firms to control strategic infrastructure at the Panama Canal would prompt U.S. military action. Latin America felt the sting of bipolarity during the Cold War, and, in the emerging superpower competition between China and the United States, it is starting to feel it again.

In East Asia, China will likely move to enforce its own version of the Monroe Doctrine. Beijing will continue to use incremental tactics and economic coercion against neighbors to pressure them to decouple or distance themselves from Washington. In coming years, the extent to which Beijing attempts to eject the United States from its region politically and militarily will likely define the principal arena of U.S.-Chinese strategic rivalry. “Don't make us choose” has been the mantra of many East Asian countries, including some U.S. treaty allies. But under bipolarity, the luxury of choice is not one afforded to small countries in a superpower's backyard. Countries will be forced to choose, and choose correctly according to their neighbor, or risk the consequences. The return of bipolarity means it's time to remember—with regret and trepidation—the nature, intensity, and global reach of superpower competition.

MOSCOW, December 12. /TASS/. It is absolutely impossible to negotiate on the new version of the US peace plan on Ukraine, drafted by Vladimir Zelensky and European leaders, former Ukrainian Prime Minister (2010-2014) Nikolay Azarov has told TASS.

"In fact, it is absolutely impossible to negotiate on the project they have just forwarded to [US President Donald] Trump, although I have no idea of what the reaction will be," Azarov said. "Therefore, I don't think that [the conflict] can be settled before Christmas."

He added that there was no chances of resolving the conflict by Christmas "first of all because of the stance taken by Western countries and Zelensky."

Washington had previously proposed a 28-point plan for settling the conflict in Ukraine. The document caused discontent among Kiev and its European partners, who tried to significantly revise it. Later, Trump said that the initial plan had been revised to address the concerns of both Moscow and Kiev, leaving only a few contentious issues. US representatives held talks with the Ukrainian delegation in Florida and with the Russian side in Moscow.

On December 8, Vladimir Zelensky promised to submit a 20-point peace plan to the US, developed during his meeting with European leaders. On December 10, they presented Trump with a proposal for Ukraine to make territorial concessions as part of a plan to settle the conflict. On December 11, ABC news reported, citing a Ukrainian official, that Ukraine has sent to the US another variant of a peace plan, consisting of 20 points.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

A drone explosion damaged the lower floors of a residential building in the Russian city of Tver on Dec. 12, injuring at least seven people, according to regional officials and local Telegram channels.

Residents reported several loud blasts and saw a plume of smoke rising over the area, eyewitness videos showed. Nearby buildings and parked cars were also damaged in the explosion, according to the independent Russian Telegram channel Astra.

Acting Governor Vitaly Korolev said all the injured were taken to hospitals and that emergency services, medics, and rescue crews were working at the scene.

Korolev added that the evacuation of residents was underway and that temporary shelters were being prepared for those displaced.

Ukraine has not commented on the incident, and the Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.

As Russia intensifies aerial attacks on Ukraine and the civilian death toll climbs, Ukraine has stepped up its drone attacks on Russian territory.

Ukrainian Defense Forces have encircled Russian troops in Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast, and cleared its northwestern outskirts, the open-source intelligence group DeepState reported on Dec. 12.



Ukraine's Security Service said Friday that it detained three men suspected of planting two homemade bombs that killed a National Guard serviceman and wounded four other people in Kyiv a day earlier.





President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised troops in the Kupiansk direction and said battlefield gains strengthen Ukraine's diplomatic position, as the National Guard's 2nd Khartiia Corps reported a counterattack north of the city.




"We must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents and great-grandparents endured," NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned.

Russia's Slavneft-YANOS oil refinery in Yaroslavl, one of the country's five largest, is reportedly on fire after being struck in an overnight drone attack on Dec. 12, officials and local Telegram channels said.

U.S. President Donald Trump is "extremely frustrated" with both Russia and Ukraine amid ongoing diplomatic efforts to end the war, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a Dec. 11 press briefing, as the United States weighs whether to join Ukraine and European partners for talks this weekend.

A Russian airstrike on Odesa on Dec. 12 damaged infrastructure and left parts of the city without electricity and water, the head of the Odesa Military Administration, Serhiy Lysak, reported.

A drone explosion damaged the lower floors of a residential building in the Russian city of Tver on Dec. 12, injuring at least seven people, according to regional officials and local Telegram channels.



Polish authorities have detained Alexander Butyagin, a Russian archaeologist accused of causing extensive damage to historical sites in occupied Crimea, at the request of Ukraine's prosecutor general, Polish media reported Dec. 11.

Tyler Robinson, the Utah man accused of killing conservative commentator Charlie Kirk earlier this year, appeared in court in person for the first time on Dec. 11 as the judge considers how much access the media will have in the prominent criminal case.

The state of Utah has charged Robinson, 22, with aggravated murder in the Sept. 10 shooting of Kirk during an event at the Utah Valley University campus in Orem. The school is located several miles away from the courthouse in Provo, where Robinson appeared on Thursday.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will produce a new documentary for the Sundance Film Festival about girl scouts selling cookies.

Cookie Queens will be a “a coming-of-age story about the joys, pressures, and pain points woven into one of America's most cherished rituals: Girl Scout Cookie season,” according to the festival programme seen by Deadline.

The Sussexes will executive produce the film through Archewell Productions, their media company, which is due to be released at the iconic US film festival next year.

Sundance's programme says the documentary, directed by Alysa Nahmias, follows “four tenacious girls (who) strive to be a top-selling ‘Cookie Queen', navigating an $800 million (£598 million) business in which childhood and ambition collide”.

It will premiere at the Rose Wagner Performing Arts Center in Salt Lake City on Jan 24. 

The Duchess of Sussex said the chance to work on the film was “absolutely irresistible”.

“As a former girl scout myself, with my mom as my troop leader, I have a personal affinity for this film and am proud that all our conversations and collaboration have led to Archewell Productions partnering with this award-winning team to executive produce this incredibly captivating documentary,” the duchess told Deadline.

“When we first viewed the early footage of this documentary, it was immediately something we wanted to be involved in.

“The creative point of view, the edgy yet humanising tone and tenor of the directing, and the glimpse behind-the-scenes into such a nostalgic and also modern tradition of girl scout cookie season are absolutely irresistible.”

Last April, the duchess shared photographs of herself as a child selling cookies in her uniform.

It coincided with the launch of her podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, and her As Ever shortbread butter cookies.

The duke and duchess said in August that they would be extending their creative partnership via Archewell to work on more TV and film projects.

It comes after they signed a deal with Netflix in 2020 for a reported $100 million.

The pair are also reported be working on a film adaptation of Meet Me At The Lake, the bestselling romantic novel by Carley Fortune.

DORAL, Fla. (AP) — A U.S. Navy admiral who oversees military operations in Latin America handed off command responsibilities Friday as scrutiny increases over the Trump administration's deadly strikes on alleged drug boats in the region.

Adm. Alvin Holsey has retired one year into a posting that typically lasts three to four years and transferred leadership duties to his top military deputy, Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Pettus, during a ceremony at U.S. Southern Command headquarters near Miami. 

In farewell remarks, Holsey did not mention the military operations or the reasons for his early retirement. But he urged his successor to uphold longstanding partnerships in the region by standing firmly behind the shared values of democracy and support for the rule of law.

“To be a trusted partner, we must be credible, present and engaged,” Holsey said.

Holsey's shock retirement was announced by the Pentagon in October, over a month into the Trump administration's strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 87 people. With the campaign facing growing scrutiny by Congress, Holsey briefed key lawmakers earlier this week.




The ceremony Friday was more subdued than past retirements, held outdoors amid a small crowd of mostly Southern Command staff and without Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, because President Donald Trump has yet to nominate Holsey's replacement. 

Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made no mention of the military operations in Latin America as he thanked Holsey for his 37 years of service. Caine referred to Holsey as a “stoic” leader and “quiet professional” who always leads with his heart and head.

“It's never been about you, it's been about people, it's been about others,” Caine said. “You've never said ‘I' in all the conversations we've had. You've always said ‘we.' … The impact you've had will last for a long time.”

Holsey is departing as Congress is scrutinizing the boat attacks, including one that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of an initial strike. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Hegseth and other top officials have given classified briefings on Capitol Hill this week. 

Holsey also spoke this week to key lawmakers overseeing the U.S. military by classified video call. Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said afterward that Holsey answered senators' questions but that “there are still many questions to be answered.” Reed later added that Holsey did not give a reason for his retirement other than saying it was a personal decision.

Experts in the rules of warfare, human rights groups and even some of Trump's allies in Congress have questioned the legality of the attacks on those accused of ferrying drugs. For decades, they were arrested at sea by the Coast Guard and brought to the U.S. for criminal prosecution.

The 22 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels are being supported by a giant flotilla of U.S. warships, attack helicopters, thousands of troops and even the nation's most advanced aircraft carrier.

Trump's Republican administration has defended its aggressive tactics, designating several drug cartels in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations and declaring that the U.S. is in armed conflict with those criminal organizations, relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

The campaign has ramped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. In a sharp escalation Wednesday, U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration has accused of smuggling illicit crude. Sale of that oil on global energy markets is critical to Maduro's grip on power.

Maduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.

Holsey's departure is the latest in a long line of sudden retirements and firings that have befallen the military's top ranks since Hegseth took charge of the Pentagon.

A native of rural Fort Valley, Georgia, whose father and several uncles served in Vietnam, Holsey relinquished his command to Pettus to a soulful rendition of “Midnight Train to Georgia.”

Pettus, a fighter jet pilot with combat experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, had been serving as Holsey's top deputy since late 2024. However, it's unclear how long the Arkansas native will remain in the job. Whomever Trump nominates must be confirmed by the Senate.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has arrested Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, her supporters said Friday.

A foundation in her name said she was detained in Mashhad, some 680 kilometers (420 miles) northeast of the capital, Tehran, while attending a memorial for a human rights lawyer recently found dead under unclear circumstances.

A local official reportedly acknowledged arrests had been made, but did not directly name Mohammadi, 53. It wasn't clear if authorities would immediately return her to prison, where she had been serving a sentence until her temporary release in December 2024 for medical purposes.

However, her detention comes as Iran has been cracking down on intellectuals and others as Tehran struggles with sanctions, an ailing economy and the fear of a renewed war with Israel. Arresting Mohammadi may spark increased pressure from the West at a time when Iran repeatedly signals it wants new negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program — something that has yet to happen. 




Her supporters on Friday described her as having been “violently detained earlier today by security and police forces.” They said other activists had been arrested as well at a ceremony honoring Khosrow Alikordi, a 46-year-old Iranian lawyer and human rights advocate who had been based in Mashhad. 

“The Narges Foundation calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all detained individuals who were attending a memorial ceremony to pay their respects and demonstrate solidarity,” a statement read. “Their arrest constitutes a serious violation of fundamental freedoms.”

Alikordi was found dead earlier this month in his office, with provincial officials in describing his death as a heart attack. However, a tightening security crackdown coincided with his death, raising questions. Over 80 lawyers signed a statement demanding more information. 

“What we witnessed today is the Islamic Republic's latest assault on the most basic human freedoms — where even mourning a slain lawyer becomes a punishable act,” said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran.

“When peaceful citizens cannot mourn without being beaten and dragged away, it reveals a government terrified of truth and accountability. It also reveals the extraordinary bravery of Iranians who refuse to surrender their dignity.”

Footage purportedly of the ceremony showed Mohammadi with a microphone, calling out to the crowd gathered without wearing a hijab, or headscarf. She started the crowd chanting the name Majidreza Rahnavard, a man whom authorities hanged from a crane in a public execution in 2022. 

Footage published by her foundation also showed her without a hijab, surrounded by a large crowd.

Hasan Hosseini, the city governor of Mashhad, said prosecutors ordered security officials to temporarily detain a number of participants at the ceremony after the chanting of “norm-breaking” slogans, Iranian state television reported. 

Hosseini described the detentions as preventive to protect those there from others in the crowd, but did not address claims that security forces used violence in making the arrests. 

Other anti-government chants could be heard in purported video footage of the event. 

Supporters had warned for months that Mohammadi was at risk of being put back into prison after she received a furlough in December 2024 over medical concerns.

While that was to be only three weeks, Mohammadi's time out of prison lengthened, possibly as activists and Western powers pushed Iran to keep her free. She remained out even during the 12-day war in June between Iran and Israel.

Mohammadi still kept up her activism with public protests and international media appearances, including even demonstrating at one point in front of Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where she had been held.

Mohammadi had been serving 13 years and nine months on charges of collusion against state security and propaganda against Iran's government. She also had backed the nationwide protests sparked by the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, which have seen women openly defy the government by not wearing the hijab.

Mohammadi suffered multiple heart attacks while imprisoned before undergoing emergency surgery in 2022, her supporters say. Her lawyer in late 2024 revealed doctors had found a bone lesion that they feared could be cancerous that later was removed.

“Mohammadi's doctors recently prescribed an extension of her medical leave for at least six more months to conduct thorough and regular medical examinations, including monitoring the bone lesion which was removed from her leg in November, physiotherapy sessions to recover from the surgery and specialized cardiac care,” the Free Narges Coalition said in late February 2025. 

“The medical team overseeing Mohammadi's health has warned that her return to prison — especially under stressful conditions of detention and without adequate medical facilities — could severely worsen her physical well-being.”

An engineer by training, Mohammadi has been imprisoned 13 times and convicted five. In total, she has been sentenced to over 30 years in prison. Her last incarceration began when she was detained in 2021 after attending a memorial for a person killed in nationwide protests.

            The nation's top historic preservation group is suing the Trump administration to block construction of President Donald Trump's plans for a massive new White House ballroom until review boards weigh in on the project.
    


            The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a congressionally chartered non-profit tasked with preserving historic buildings, said it was bringing the suit because its previous letter urging a pause on the project had gone unheeded.
    


            The group, which alleges the construction project is “unlawful,” is asking the US District Court for the District of Columbia to halt further activity until the administration complies with review processes, including a public comment period.
    


            “The White House is arguably the most evocative building in our country and a globally recognized symbol of our powerful American ideals. As the organization charged with protecting places where our history happened, the National Trust was compelled to file this case,” said Carol Quillen, the group's president and CEO.
    


The White House's East Wing is now demolished. Here's what was lost



            The suit names Trump as a defendant, along with the National Park Service, the Department of Interior, and the General Services Administration, along with officials who work in those agencies. The case is assigned to District Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee.
    


            “President Trump has full legal authority to modernize, renovate, and beautify the White House – just like all of his predecessors did,” White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement to CNN.
    


            While Trump announced months ago his plans to replace the East Wing with the new ballroom — a necessary addition, he says, to accommodate large events — the demolition proceeded without an extensive public review process.
    


            “No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Joe Biden, and not anyone else,” the complaint from the trust says.
    


            In October, the group addressed a letter to the administration  “respectfully” urging it to “pause demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes, including consultation and review by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, and to invite comment from the public.”
    


            The two commissions the letter was addressed to — the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts — have in the past reviewed proposed additions to the White House. That includes changes to the perimeter fence and the construction of a new tennis pavilion within the past decade.
    


            The current chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, Will Scharf, who also serves as Trump's staff secretary, said during a meeting of the commission last month that its jurisdiction covers construction, but not demolition — suggesting the body would eventually be involved in the project, but not until after the East Wing was demolished.
    


            At an early December NCPC meeting, Scharf said he has been told by colleagues at the White House that the ballroom plans will be submitted to the agency this month.

Harvard medical student Nick Norwitz reveals the science behind his food experiment, in which he consumed 133,000 mg of dietary cholesterol

Millions of Americans battle chronic anxiety — but new research claiming a missing brain nutrient may be partly to blame is already drawing skepticism from experts who say the findings are far from conclusive.

Using a non-invasive MRI-based technique that measures brain chemicals, researchers at UC Davis Health in California looked at data from 25 previous studies, comparing 370 people with anxiety disorders to 342 without anxiety. 

They found that, across the combined studies, individuals with certain anxiety disorders showed an average of about 8% lower choline levels in brain regions that help regulate thinking and emotions. 

BITE OF DARK CHOCOLATE COULD SHARPEN YOUR MEMORY WITHIN AN HOUR, STUDY SUGGESTS

"An 8% lower amount doesn't sound like that much, but in the brain, it's significant," said senior study author Richard Maddock, a medical doctor and research professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, Davis.

Choline — found in foods such as eggs, beef, chicken, fish and soybeans — plays a key role in memory, mood and cell health, according to experts.

The study authors propose that heightened stress responses in anxiety disorders may increase the brain's demand for choline, gradually lowering levels of the nutrient — especially in regions that help regulate stress and reduce the threat response, according to the published research.

The findings don't prove that low choline causes anxiety. The researchers also emphasized that it's too early to recommend eating more choline or taking large doses of it in supplement form.

The research does, however, reveal a pattern across three major anxiety disorders that could shape future research into how nutrition and brain chemistry interact with anxiety disorders, they said.

"It suggests nutritional approaches — like appropriate choline supplementation — may help restore brain chemistry and improve outcomes for patients," study co-author Jason Smucny said in a statement.

Anxiety disorders affect nearly 30% of U.S. adults, according to experts. (iStock)

But several clinicians and nutrition experts told Fox News Digital the results should be interpreted cautiously and warned Americans against assuming anxiety is caused by a nutrient deficiency.

Maddock said more research is needed to learn if increasing choline will reduce anxiety. He warned that heavy choline supplements can cause side effects.

Experts note that people may benefit from reviewing their choline intake as part of routine nutritional guidance and recommend discussing any changes — especially for those with anxiety — with a healthcare provider.

Choline is considered "essential" because the body makes only a small amount of it, and the rest has to come from food, research has shown. Studies have found that most Americans, including children, don't get the recommended daily amount of the nutrient.

Some omega-3 fats found in fish, such as salmon, may be "especially good" at delivering choline to the brain, Maddock noted.

Experts say a balanced, choline-rich diet may support brain health but is not a replacement for anxiety treatment. (iStock)

"Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting about 30% of adults," Maddock said. 

"They can be debilitating for people, and many people do not receive adequate treatment."

Nona Kocher, a board-certified psychiatrist in Miami Beach, agreed that an 8% drop is not "trivial." 

Kocher, who was not involved in the study, described the pattern as potentially indicating stress on metabolic processes.

"One big misunderstanding is thinking that a nutrient deficiency is the main cause of anxiety." 

"We know from the clinic that this kind of burden is associated with feeling easily overwhelmed, feeling less resilient under stress and being mentally tired earlier in the day," she told Fox News Digital.

Nonetheless, the data suggest a consequence more than a cause, she noted.

The researchers emphasized that the new findings do not mean choline is the cause of anxiety — or that people should ditch treatment plans in favor of diet tweaks. The MRI technique they used captures chemical stress signals in the brain, so low choline may reflect metabolic strain and not simply a nutrient deficiency.

"One big misunderstanding is thinking that a nutrient deficiency is the main cause of anxiety," said Lauren Manaker, a registered dietitian nutritionist in South Carolina. 

Researchers say lower choline levels in brain regions are responsible for emotion regulation and stress response. (iStock)

"Anxiety is complicated and usually involves a mix of factors, like genetics, life experiences and brain chemistry," Manaker, who was not involved in the research, told Fox News Digital. 

"While low choline might have an association, it's not the whole story."

Mood and anxiety disorders have been tied to other nutrient deficiencies, including vitamin D, Manaker said. 

A balanced diet that includes foods like dairy milk and eggs — which provide choline, vitamin D, B12 and other brain-supporting nutrients — may help address those gaps, but nutrition is only one piece of managing anxiety, she emphasized.

Experts caution that more research is needed before recommending choline supplementation. (iStock)

Kocher agreed choline is just "one of many pieces of a larger stress biology puzzle, not the sole driver."

Manaker said a choline-rich diet is important for overall brain health, regardless of whether someone has anxiety.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts break down the latest legal clashes over President Donald Trump's deportations of illegal immigrants.

Lawyers for the Trump administration are seeking to shut down a revived contempt inquiry led by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, arguing in new filings that the court should cancel two scheduled witness examinations next week or allow the administration to block testimony on grounds of "executive privilege."

In filings earlier this week, Justice Department lawyers argued the court is exceeding its authority. "At the outset, the Court's inquiry exceeds its authority and is now intruding on the prerogatives of a co-equal branch," they wrote, adding that criminal contempt falls within the executive branch's power.

"Criminal contempt is a criminal offense, and the investigation and prosecution of crimes is [a] core executive power reserved to the Executive Branch," they added. 

The filings are part of a revived contempt inquiry that will bring to the fore longtime tensions between the Trump administration and the chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., who sparked Trump's ire earlier this year after he attempted to temporarily block the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in March.

NOEM GREENLIT DEPORTATION FLIGHTS AFTER JUDGE'S EMERGENCY ORDER, DOJ REVEALS — FUELING CONTEMPT FIGHT

Boasberg this week requested testimony from two current and former Justice Department officials who played a key role in the Trump administration's use of the 18th century wartime law to quickly deport the migrants to El Salvador in March, despite his temporary restraining order and subsequent oral order that attempted to block — for 14 days — the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to immediately deport the migrants. 

He is now weighing whether senior Trump officials willfully defied that order. To wit, he ordered Drew Ensign, the Justice Department's deputy assistant attorney general, to appear in court Monday for questioning and for cross-examination from lawyers representing the class of deported Venezuelan migrants.

He also ordered testimony and cross-examination the following day from former Justice Department lawyer Erez Reuveni, who since parting ways with the Justice Department has publicly accused the administration of ignoring court orders — including in this case.

"The Court thus believes that it is necessary to hear witness testimony to better understand the basis of the decision to transfer the deportees out of United States custody in the context of the hearing on March 15, 2025," Boasberg wrote in scheduling the appearances.

"The events surrounding this decision should shed light on this question," he said.

The inquiry was revived after the D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, vacated an earlier ruling and returned the matter to Boasberg. New details about the government's handling of the March flights have already emerged, with additional disclosures expected in the coming days.

Still, court filings revealed that the Trump administration plans to fight those efforts at every turn. 

"If the Court does proceed with testimony, it should grant a protective order with respect to privileged information or provide Defendants with an opportunity to seek appellate relief in advance of any testimony; and the Court should also limit the scope of the testimony and preclude Plaintiffs from participating," they told Boasberg.

Last month, DOJ officials identified DHS Secretary Kristi Noem as the official who authorized the transfer of the Venezuelan migrants after being briefed on Boasberg's emergency order by lawyers for the Justice Department and acting general counsel for DHS.

Boasberg said earlier this week that it would be "premature" to refer anyone for prosecution under the revived contempt probe, and declined to immediately compel testimony from Noem at this stage in the process.

Noem said in a declaration of her own that she made that call based on legal advice from lawyers for the Justice Department, as well as the acting general counsel for DHS.

The fresh action on the contempt issue is almost certain to spark the ire of some Republicans in Congress and from Trump himself, who has repeatedly excoriated Boasberg as an "activist judge" for his role in the Alien Enemies Act case and resulting inquiry.

Boasberg, for his part, has appeared unfazed. 

"This has been sitting for a long time," Boasberg said late last month of the contempt inquiry, "and I believe justice requires me to move promptly on this."

The government, he added, "can assist me to whatever degree it wishes."

The Trump administration is arguing that requiring real-time American Sign Language interpretation of events like White House press briefings “would severely intrude on the President's prerogative to control the image he presents to the public,” part of a lawsuit seeking to require the White House to provide the services.

Department of Justice attorneys haven't elaborated on how doing so might hamper the portrayal President Donald Trump seeks to present to the public. But overturning policies encompassing diversity, equity and inclusion have become a hallmark of his second administration, starting with his very first week back in the White House.

The National Association for the Deaf sued the Trump administration in May, arguing that the cessation of American Sign Language interpretation — which the Biden administration had used regularly — represented “denying hundreds of thousands of deaf Americans meaningful access to the White House's real-time communications on various issues of national and international import.” The group also sued during Trump's first administration, seeking ASL interpretation for briefings related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a June court filing opposing the association's request for a preliminary injunction, reported Thursday by Politico, attorneys for the Justice Department argued that being required to provide sign language interpretation for news conferences “would severely intrude on the President's prerogative to control the image he presents to the public,” also writing that the president has “the prerogative to shape his Administration's image and messaging as he sees fit.”

Government attorneys also argued that it provides the hard of hearing or Deaf community with other ways to access the president's statements, like online transcripts of events, or closed captioning. The administration has also argued that it would be difficult to wrangle such services in the event that Trump spontaneously took questions from the press, rather than at a formal briefing.




A White House spokesperson did not immediately comment Friday on the ongoing lawsuit or answer questions about the administration's argument regarding the damage of interpretation services to Trump's “image.”

In their June filing, government attorneys questioned if other branches of government were being held to a similar standard if they didn't provide the same interpretative services as sought by the association. 

As home to Gallaudet University, the world's premier college for the deaf and hard of hearing, Washington likely has an ample pool of trained ASL interpreters into which the White House could tap. Mayor Muriel Bowser has made ASL interpretation a mainstay of her appearances, including a pair of interpreters who swap in and out.

Last month, a federal judge rejected that and other objections from the government, issuing an order requiring the White House to provide American Sign Language interpreting for Trump and Leavitt's remarks in real time. The White House has appealed the ruling, and while the administration has begun providing American Sign Language interpreting at some events, there's disagreement over what services it has to supply.

On his first week back in office, Trump signed a sweeping executive order putting a stop to diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government. In putting his own imprint on the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in January issued an order stating that DEI policies were “incompatible” with the department's mission, 

This week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered diplomatic correspondence to return to the more traditional Times New Roman font, arguing that the Biden administration's 2023 shift to the sans serif Calibri font had emerged from misguided diversity, equity and inclusion policies pursued by his predecessor.

Fox News Digital spoke to John Nagel, who is running against Rep. Ilhan Omar in Minnesota's 5th Congressional District, about the unfolding fraud scandal in his home state.

MINNEAPOLIS, MN – Republican John Nagel, who is running against Dem. Rep. Ilhan Omar in her Minneapolis district, spoke to Fox News Digital about the responsibility she holds in the unfolding massive fraud scandal that has garnered national headlines.

"Where did this actually start?" Nagel told Fox News Digital. "She passed legislation. Her legislation actually started and it allowed people to get into Feeding Our Future. If you look at where the fraud is, it's primarily her [5th Congressional District], the district that I'm running in against her. And it's really odd to think that you know all the fraud just happened in a particular area, and it was a bill that she, you know, particularly put together."

Nagel is referring to allegations that the free meals at the center of the massive fraud scandal were made possible by the 2020 MEALS Act, introduced by Omar and passed with bipartisan support. He told Fox News Digital the public deserves to know who helped her craft that legislation.

Members of Omar's inner circle personally profited from the $1 billion welfare fraud scandal in her district that has placed her Somali constituency under a White House microscope, Nagel said. He also said that Omar held events at one of the restaurants, Safari Land, which was named in the fraud case, knew one of its now-convicted owners and had a staffer who was also convicted.

"If you look at the Safari Land restaurant, if you're gonna be in politics, you need to go through the people at the Safari Land restaurant," Nagel said. "They kind of control the politics. She had all of her fundraising things. I mean, that was sort of her hangout. That's where she spent money, got donations."

Guhaad Hashi Said, sometimes referred to as an "enforcer" for Omar's campaign, is one of the over 70 people who have been indicted for his role in the Feeding Our Future scandal. Nagel told Fox News Digital the public deserves answers on that relationship and what Omar knew about the fraud.

"There's a lot of really deep, deep ties," Nagel said.

"I think time will tell with the investigation. But again, there's just too much circumstantial evidence to look at this and say, she had to have known something, or what staff member knew something?"

The Small Business Administration is investigating a network of Somali groups in Minnesota that it says is tied to the scandal, and a House Oversight Committee has opened an investigation into Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's role.

President Donald Trump last week criticized Omar and blamed the Somali community for the scope of fraud occurring in Minnesota. 

Nagel also asserted that there was a money trail potentially funneled to Omar from her associates tied to the Feeding Our Future fraud scandal, and he said that she has returned some of the money but not all of it.

"A whole lot of people that were convicted donated a whole lot of money. Omar says that she gave the money back," Nagel said. "Well, if you go into public records, she gave some money back, but there's a whole lot more money there that she didn't report. And I think if people were just to go through the everyday records that are out there, you'll find out that her involvement in the money that she has is questionable."

Nagel told Fox News Digital, "If she truly cared about the fraud, her name wouldn't be attached all over to these other people. She came on and she made a statement about how terrible it is to basically steal food from children. Yeah, okay, that's a really nice thing to say, but you have way too many people that you're associated with that actually did that. Now she yells racism anytime somebody puts any pressure on her."

Fox News Digital asked Nagel what can be done to fix the fraud issues. He said, first and foremost, Minnesota must elect a new governor.

"The things that we can do to fix this is you get yourself a new competent, honest governor, you get yourself a new honest, competent AG," Nagel said. "We get rid of Ilhan Omar, and we put people in the state of Minnesota that actually want to do the right thing. They're not in it for the money, they're in it because they're great state employees and they're serving the public. That's what we're gonna have to do. You're gonna have to entirely root the Democratic Party, and then anybody that's been appointed to a position, we're gonna have to root them out too, to find out if you know they've been letting things slide."

Nagel described the fraud situation in Minnesota as a "cancer" that will continue to "spread" unless "you cut the entire cancer out."

Fox News Digital reached out to Omar's office for comment. 

"I think what happened is that, you know, when you have these kind of new programs that are, um, designed to help people, you're oftentimes relying on third parties to be able to facilitate. And I just think that a lot of the COVID programs that were set up — they were set up so quickly that a lot of the guardrails did not get created," Omar said last week.

President Donald Trump was sued on Friday by preservationists asking a federal court to halt his White House ballroom project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and wins approval from Congress. 

The National Trust for Historic Preservation is asking the U.S. District Court to block Trump's White House ballroom project, which already has involved razing the East Wing, until it goes through comprehensive design reviews, environmental assessments, public comments and congressional debate and ratification. 

The National Trust, a privately funded organization, argues that Trump, by fast-tracking the project, has committed multiple violations of the Administrative Procedures Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, while also exceeding his constitutional authority by not seeking congressional approval for a project of such scale.

“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the lawsuit states. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.”

No more work should be done, the Trust argues, until administration officials “complete the required reviews — reviews that should have taken place before the Defendants demolished the East Wing, and before they began construction of the Ballroom — and secure the necessary approvals.”




White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not immediately respond to Associated Press questions about the lawsuit and the project, including whether the president had any intention of consulting Congress. Trump has emphasized since announcing his plans that he's doing it with private funding, including his own money. But that would not necessarily change how federal laws and procedures apply to what is still a U.S. government project.

Trump, a Republican, already has bypassed the federal government's usual building practices and historical reviews with the East Wing demolition. He recently added another architectural firm for a ballroom that itself would be nearly twice the size of the White House before the East Wing's demolition.

Trump has said a ballroom is overdue for the White House, previously complaining that events were held outside under a tent because the East Room and the State Dining Room could not accommodate bigger crowds. Trump, among other complaints, said guests get their feet wet if it rains during such events.

The White House is expected to submit plans for Trump's new ballroom to a federal planning commission before the year ends, about three months after construction began.

Will Scharf, who was named by Trump as chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, said at the panel's monthly meeting last week that he was told by colleagues at the White House that the long-awaited plans would be filed in December.

“Once plans are submitted, that's really when the role of this commission, and its professional staff, will begin,” said Scharf, who also is one of the Republican president's top White House aides.

He said the review process would happen at a “normal and deliberative pace.”

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, discusses the subpoena of former special counsel Jack Smith on ‘Hannity.' 

House Democrats plan to urge a federal judge in Florida to unseal former special counsel Jack Smith's final report, escalating their push to obtain the document ahead of Smith's deposition with Congress next week.

The 19 Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said, according to an amicus brief reviewed by Fox News Digital on Friday, that Judge Aileen Cannon's longstanding order blocking the release of the report, which details Smith's investigation and prosecution of President Donald Trump related to classified documents, had no basis and unconstitutionally hindered Congress from performing its duties.

"The continued suppression of [Volume II of Smith's report] now serves only to obstruct the constitutional processes by which the political branches oversee one another and report to the American people," the brief reads.

The Democrats, led by ranking member Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., also sent a demand letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, the latest of several letters they have sent to her on the matter, saying she had no justification for withholding the report.

They said the decision to keep it from the public was "baffling" and that Cannon's order did not bar the DOJ from handing the document over to House lawmakers. They also said Bondi could easily ask Cannon to unseal it, but she has not done so.

"This Administration has repeatedly boasted that President Trump is ‘the most transparent and accessible president in American history.' Your campaign to bury Mr. Smith's report makes a joke out of that claim," the Democrats wrote. "You are permitting prosecutors to be hauled before Congress to defend their work while denying Congress and the American public the written record that would explain it."

Fox News Digital reached out to the DOJ for comment.

House Judiciary Committee Republicans subpoenaed Smith to testify next week behind closed doors as part of their investigation into his special counsel work, despite Smith asking to testify at a public hearing.

Democrats have been pushing as part of that probe for the second portion of Smith's final special counsel report, which likely contains Smith's deeply detailed account of how he went about investigating and charging Trump for allegedly retaining classified documents. The first volume was released last year under the Biden administration.

House Judiciary Republicans noted in a statement to Fox News Digital that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ordered Cannon to decide on whether to unseal the report by next month.

"Judge Cannon will decide by January 2026 whether Volume II should be released. Jack Smith will be questioned about his entire investigation next week before the Judiciary Committee," a committee spokesman said. "Of course, Ranking Member Raskin knows all of this, but despises President Trump so much that he would rather mislead the American people than get the facts straight."

Cannon, a Trump appointee, blocked the release of the report in January, saying it would interfere with the classified documents case against Trump's two co-defendants. Smith dropped Trump's charges alleging he mishandled national defense information after Trump won the election, citing a policy discouraging the DOJ from prosecuting sitting presidents.

The DOJ this year then dropped the charges against the co-defendants, but the U.S. attorney in southern Florida maintained in a recent court filing that the release of the special counsel report detailing the classified documents case would still cause "extraordinary prejudice" against the two former defendants.

Closing arguments expected in murder trial of Brian Walshe over wife's disappearance.

Brian Walshe, who declined to testify at his murder trial, tried to take control of his late father's estate soon after he was indicted on art fraud charges in 2018, according to a report.

Brian and Thomas Walshe had been estranged for years, but the only child argued that his dad didn't leave a will and convinced the Plymouth County Probate Court in Massachusetts to name him as personal representative for the estate that December, according to The Boston Globe.

Brian's claim to Thomas' estate was later challenged by his father's family and friends, arguing the only child had actually destroyed the will, sold off his belongings and wiped out his father's bank account. Brian allegedly took and sold off a total of over $500,000 after the late Walshe stripped his son from the will.

Fred Pescatore, a longtime friend of Thomas, reportedly said in a signed statement to the court that Brian stole from his father.

"Brian and Tom's estrangement had everything to do with money," Pescatore said. "Brian stole money from Tom and swindled him out of almost one million dollars…"

Pescatore added that Brian had a violent streak and said he was "very angry" and a "sociopath."

"I saw Brian attempt to smuggle out antiquities from China," Pescatore added. "When Brian was confronted, he picked up a stanchion and literally attempted to kill four or five guards that had come to talk to him about his crime."

When Thomas died, Brian "almost had zero" contact with him for over a decade, friends and family wrote to the probate court.

BRIAN WALSHE DEFENSE SAYS HE FOUND WIFE DEAD IN BED, DENIES UNCOVERING AFFAIR AS MURDER TRIAL BEGINS

Walshe is accused of killing his wife, Ana, in January 2023 after learning she was having an affair. Ana disappeared on New Year's Day and was never seen again. Jurors will begin deliberations on Friday. The defense unexpectedly rested its case on Thursday morning without calling any witnesses and did not put Brian on the stand.

On Tuesday, a forensic scientist testified that DNA consistent with Ana's profile was found on a hatchet and hacksaw recovered from the trash.

Saman Saleem, a DNA unit supervisor at the state police crime lab, also said that several items found at a Peabody, Massachusetts, trash collection site also had Ana's DNA on it, which included pieces of a rug, a Tyvek suit, unknown tissue and slippers.

Brian's wife had a $2.7 million life insurance policy which he was the beneficiary of, court records show. He owed nearly $500,000 in restitution for his federal case.

Another one of Thomas' longtime friends, Jeffrey Ornstein, said in a signed statement to the probate court that he had proof Brian was taken out of the will. Ornstein said Brian reached out to him following Thomas' death and asked if he had the keys to his father's house in Hull, Massachusetts. Brian claimed he "needed some paperwork."

When Ornstein entered the house, he saw Thomas' will in the office.

"I reviewed the Will and left it where we found it, however, I took some pictures," Ornstein wrote. "I noticed a list of beneficiaries, but as Tom had told me many times over the years, he had expressly disinherited Brian."

Thomas' nephew, Andrew Walshe, was named as the executor of the will, Ornstein said. 

"I still felt bad," Ornstein continued, "so when I texted Brian later that day to tell him that I had left him a set of keys under the mat, I did not tell him about being disinherited."

Brian and Thomas' dispute stems from the acquisition of a home in Lenox, Massachusetts, according to the report. Brian bought the house, with his father reportedly agreeing to fund renovations with the stipulation that he'd be paid back, which never happened.

Andrew eventually asked the court in July 2019 to remove Brian as the estate's personal representative.

"It is clear that Brian destroyed the Last Will and Testament which excluded him from any inheritance, when he gained access to the Hull property," Andrew wrote in a statement to the court. "Brian R Walshe had estranged himself from all Walshe family members due to their knowledge of the theft he had committed to his father."

"I hereby bequeath to Brian R. Walshe my best wishes but nothing else from my estate," Thomas wrote in the will.

Andrew unsuccessfully pressured Brian to account for what happened to the estate and alleged that the only child drained at least $250,000 from Thomas' bank account and sold his possessions, worth about $250,000.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that the federal government will yank tens of millions of dollars from New York state if they do not "come into compliance" with rules pertaining to the granting of commercial driver's licenses.

Duffy indicated that the state has 30 days to get in line.

"Fifty-three percent of New York's non-domiciled CDLs were issued unlawfully or illegally," he said during a press conference on Friday.

He asserted in a post on X, "We're holding New York accountable for issuing non-domicile commercial driver's licenses to truckers illegally. FULL STOP. We're giving New York 30 days to comply or we'll withhold $73 MILLION! The safety of the American people comes first."

Duffy blamed the prior presidential administration during the press conference.

"We have this problem because Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg did not enforce the law. And millions of people came into the country during their tenure and then when they were here, these rules were still there," he said, accusing them of turning "a blind eye."

New York State Department of Motor Vehicles spokesperson Walter McClure has accused Duffy of lying about the Empire State.

"Secretary Duffy is lying about New York State once again in a desperate attempt to distract from the failing, chaotic administration he represents. Here is the truth: Commercial Drivers Licenses are regulated by the Federal Government, and New York State DMV has, and will continue to, comply with federal rules," McClure said in a statement.

"Every CDL we issue is subject to verification of an applicant's lawful status through federally-issued documents reviewed in accordance with federal regulations. This is just another stunt from Secretary Duffy, and it does nothing to keep our roads safer. We will review USDOT's letter and respond accordingly."

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats released a selection of photos from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, including some of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and the former Prince Andrew.

The 19 photos released by Democratic lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee were a small part of more than 95,000 they received from the estate of Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting sex trafficking charges. The photos released Friday were separate from the case files that the Department of Justice is now compelled to release, but anticipation is growing as the Trump administration faces a deadline next week to produce the highly anticipated Epstein files.

The photos were released without captions or context and included a black-and-white image of Trump alongside six women whose faces were blacked out.

Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, did not say whether any of the women in the photos was a victim of abuse, but he added, “Our commitment from day one has been to redact any photo, any information that could lead to any sort of harm to any of the victims.”

A spokesperson for the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee accused Garcia and Democratic lawmakers of “cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump,” adding that nothing in the documents the committee has received shows “any wrongdoing” by the president.

Many of the photos have already circulated in the public. Democrats pledged to continue to release photos in the days and weeks ahead, as they look to pressure Trump over his Republican administration's earlier refusal to release documents in the Epstein probe. Garcia said that his staff had looked through about a quarter of the images it had received from Epstein's estate, which included photos that were sent to him or that he had in his possession.




“Donald Trump right now needs to release the files to the American public so that the truth can come out and we can actually get some sense of justice for the survivors,” Garcia added.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the photos.

Trump, once a close friend of Epstein, has said that he parted ways with him long before he faced the sex trafficking charges. Clinton, too, has minimized his relationship with Epstein, acknowledging that he traveled on Epstein's private jet but saying through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes. Clinton also has never been accused of misconduct by Epstein's known victims. However, Republicans on the House committee are pushing him and Hillary Clinton to testify in their investigation.

Andrew lost his royal titles and privileges this year amid new revelations of his ties to Epstein, though he has denied wrongdoing.

The photo release also included images of the right-wing political operative Steven Bannon, billionaires Richard Branson and Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and law professor Alan Dershowitz. The men have denied any wrongdoing in their associations with Epstein, who kept many high-profile figures in his circle of friends.

Amid a release of emails between Summers and Epstein, Summers stepped away from his teaching position at Harvard University and faced other fallout to his standing in academic circles.

Allen has faced allegations from his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, of molesting her as a child. He has denied the allegations.

Some lawmakers, however, believe that other high-powered figures could be implicated in Epstein's abuse if the full case files from the Justice Department are released.

Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who was instrumental in passing a bill to require the public release of the files, said it was a good sign that the Department of Justice has sought to have grand jury material released from several courts.

“The grand jury material is just a small fraction of what the DOJ needs to release, because the FBI and DOJ probably has evidence that they chose not to take to the grand jury because the evidence they're in possession of would implicate other people, not Epstein or Maxwell,” he said.

A woman was stabbed multiple times inside New York City's iconic Macy's Herald Square on Thursday, Fox News Digital has learned.

The victim was a 38-year-old from California who was shopping with her husband when the attack occurred, according to the New York Post. 

The NYPD told Fox News Digital that the 39-year-old victim had multiple stab wounds on her back and a laceration to her left arm. The victim was transported to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition.

The Post reported that the attack took place in the seventh-floor bathroom of the store.

Law enforcement sources told the Post that the victim, who was reportedly visiting from Jurupa Valley, works as a civilian in the sheriff's office where her husband serves as a sheriff.

The NYPD identified the individual who was arrested and charged in connection with the attack as 43-year-old Kerri Aheme of Tewksbury, Mass. Aheme has been charged with attempted murder, two counts of assault, criminal possession of a weapon and endangering the welfare of a child, according to the NYPD. The Post reported that Aheme was homeless.

Speaking in Kyiv via video-link at a virtual meeting of the Coalition of the Willing, Zelenskyy said there is belief in Ukraine “that America should speak to the Russian side about this.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A senior Kremlin official said Friday that Russian police and National Guard will stay on in eastern Ukraine's Donbas and oversee the industry-rich region, even if a peace settlement ends Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine. 

The remarks by Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov underscore Moscow's ambition to maintain its presence in Donbas post-war. Ukraine is likely to reject such a stance as U.S.-led negotiations drag on. 

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian units have recaptured several settlements and neighborhoods near the city of Kupiansk in the northeastern Kharkiv region, following a monthslong operation aimed at reversing Russian advances there. 

Kupiansk has in recent months been one of the most closely contested sectors of the around 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, and the claimed Ukrainian progress of around 40 sq. km. (15 sq. miles) would be a setback for Russia.

Less than two months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Ukrainian troops in Kupiansk were surrounded and offered to negotiate their surrender. He said a media visit to the area would prove it. Putin has sought to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of strength in the war. 




German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's office said he would host Zelenskyy on Monday for talks as peace efforts gain momentum and European leaders seek to steer negotiations. Afterward, numerous European heads of state and government, as well as the leaders of the European Union and NATO, will join the meeting, a statement said.

Moscow will give its blessing to a ceasefire only after Ukraine's forces have withdrawn from the front line, Ushakov also said in comments published Friday in Russian business daily Kommersant. 

He told Kommersant “it's entirely possible that there won't be any troops (in the Donbas), either Russian or Ukrainian” in a postwar scenario. But he said that “there will be the National Guard, our police, everything necessary to maintain order and organize life.”

For months, American negotiators have tried to navigate the demands of each side as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for a swift end to Russia's war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into a major obstacle over who keeps Ukrainian territory that Russian forces have occupied so far.

Since Moscow's 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea and the seizure of territory in the east by Russia-backed separatists later that year, as well as land taken after the full-blown invasion was launched on Feb. 24, 2022, Russia has captured about 20% of its neighbor.

Ukraine says its constitution doesn't allow it to surrender land. Russia, which illegally annexed Donetsk and three other regions illegally in 2022, says the same. Ushakov said that “no matter what the outcome (of peace talks), this territory (the Donbas) is Russian Federation territory.”

On Thursday, Trump compared the negotiations to a very complex real estate deal. He said that he wants to see more progress in talks before sending envoys to possible meetings with European leaders over the weekend.

In October, Trump said the Donbas region will have to be “cut up” to end the war.

In recent months, Russia's army has made a determined push to gain control of all parts of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, which together make up the valuable Donbas region.

Its slow slog across the Ukrainian countryside, using its significant advantage in troop numbers in a corrosive war of attrition, has been costly in terms of casualties and losses of armor. Although outnumbered, Ukrainian defenders have held firm in many areas and counterattacked in others.

Ukrainian forces said Friday that they had advanced around Kupiansk. They gradually cut off Russian supply routes into the city, starting on Sept. 22, and regained control of the villages of Kindrashivka and Radkivka, as well as several northern districts of the city, according to a statement by Ukrainian National Guard's Khartia Corps posted on Facebook.

Fighting is ongoing in central Kupiansk, where more than 200 Russian soldiers are encircled, the statement said.

Zelenskyy posted a video of himself standing on the road into Kupiansk on Friday. Explosions could be heard in the background as he spoke.

“Today, it is critically important to achieve results on the battlefield so that Ukraine can achieve results in diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said in the video, praising his troops on Ukraine's Ground Forces Day.

Russian officials made no immediate comment, and the Ukrainians statements couldn't be independently verified.

Ukraine also has developed its long-range strike capabilities using domestically produced weapons to disrupt Russia's war machine.

Its Special Operations Forces, or SSO, said Friday that an operation in the Caspian Sea struck two Russian vessels carrying military equipment and arms.

The ships named Kompozitor Rakhmaninov and Askar-Saridzha are under U.S. sanctions for transporting arms between Russia and Iran, the SSO said in a statement on social media. It didn't say what weapons it used in its attack.

A Ukrainian drone attack wounded seven people, including a child, in the Russian city of Tver, acting Gov. Vitaly Korolev said Friday. Falling drone debris struck an apartment building in the city, which lies northwest of Moscow, Korolev said.

Russia's air defenses destroyed 90 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia's Defense Ministry said.

Russian drones struck a residential area of Pavlohrad, in Ukraine's central Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one person and wounding four others, the head of the local military administration, Vladyslav Haivanenko, wrote on the Telegram messaging channel on Friday.

Ukraine's southern Odesa region came under a large-scale drone attack overnight, according to regional chief Oleh Kiper. The attack damaged energy infrastructure, he said. More than 90,000 people were without electricity on Friday morning, Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said.

Ukraine's air force said that Russia launched 80 drones across the country during the night.

Sleep disorder specialist Dr. Qanta Ahmed discusses concerns about learning and longevity in the age of social media on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Insufficient sleep is one of the strongest predictors of shorter life expectancy in the U.S., surpassed only by smoking.

That's according to a new nationwide analysis published in the journal SLEEP Advances, led by senior author Andrew McHill, Ph.D., associate professor with Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU).

To explore how sleep habits relate to lifespan, the researchers examined data from surveys conducted by the CDC between 2019 and 2025 across more than 3,000 U.S. counties, according to a press release.

COMMON SLEEP PROBLEM TIED TO SERIOUS NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER IN MAJOR NEW STUDY

Sufficient sleep was defined as at least seven hours per night, consistent with guidelines from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.

The researchers compared average life expectancy in each county with the proportion of residents reporting sufficient sleep, controlling for traditional predictors of mortality such as smoking, diet, physical inactivity and loneliness.

Counties where more people reported insufficient sleep tended to have lower life expectancy. This pattern held across most states and years studied, even when accounting for other lifestyle factors.

"I didn't expect it to be so strongly correlated to life expectancy," McHill said in the press release, noting that although sleep's importance to health is well-established, its association with lifespan exceeded expectations.

"We've always thought sleep is important, but this research really drives that point home: People really should strive to get seven to nine hours of sleep if at all possible."

The research builds on a broad body of evidence linking sleep duration to health outcomes, including mortality risk, heart health, immune strength and brain function.

However, this is the first analysis to map the relationship between sleep duration and life expectancy at a detailed, county-by-county level across multiple years, establishing a consistent association across diverse communities, the release states.

The study did have some limitations, including its reliance on self-reported survey data, which can be subject to reporting bias. It also cannot establish causation and does not explain the biological factors behind the results, the researchers noted.

Although the statistical models controlled for several lifestyle factors, other unmeasured variables could influence both sleep patterns and life expectancy.

Sleep duration alone does not capture other dimensions of sleep health, such as quality or regularity, which may also affect long-term outcomes, according to the study.

The authors emphasized that these findings highlight the importance of prioritizing sleep as a core pillar of health, on par with diet and exercise.

"This research shows that we need to prioritize sleep at least as much as what we eat or how we exercise," McHill said. "Getting a good night's sleep will improve how you feel, but also how long you live."

The research was funded in part by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health, along with institutional support from OHSU.

With the Supreme Court set to hear the Little vs. Hecox case, Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador will have a big decision to make in the national movement to keep trans athletes out of women's and girls' sports.

Super Bowl-winning head coach Barry Switzer and 31 Olympians have signed an amicus brief in support of the legal defense to "save women's sports" ahead of two upcoming Supreme Court cases over trans athletes. The signees also include 12 Olympic medalists, including eight gold medalists. 

Switzer, women's tennis legend Martina Navratilova, Olympic gold medalists Kerri Walsh-Jennings, Summer Sanders, Donna de Varona, Nancy Hogshead, Laura Wilkinson, Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson, Monique Lamoureux-Morando, and Rhi Jeffrey, and former NFL quarterback Steve Stenstrom are among the top sports figures who signed the brief. 

The signees also include multiple female athletes who have had to compete against biological male trans athletes, including fencer Stephanie Turner, former NCAA volleyball player Macy Petty, former University of Pennsylvania women's swimmer Monika Burzynska, and U.S. Masters swimmers Wendy Enderle, Cissy Cochran and Angie Griffin.

The brief has a total of 124 signatures, which also includes the family members of athletes who signed.

The brief argues that state laws in Idaho and West Virginia that protect women's sports from trans athletes also protect women and girls from mental and physical harm. 

"By ruling in favor of West Virginia's and Idaho's laws, this Court can reaffirm that women should not lose their equal opportunity to compete in sports on a level playing field. By affirming the states' right to stand with women and girls, this Court can ensure that females' basic right to be treated equally is still the legal norm in the United States," the brief reads. 

"It is hard to express the pain, humiliation, frustration, and shame women experience when they are forced to compete against males in sport. It is public shaming and suffering, an exclusion from women's own category – a place that uniquely belongs to them… The shame does not disappear after competition is over. It stays forever as a memory of sanctioned public ridicule… The psychological, tangible, and long-term harm suffered by females forced to compete against males is irreversible."

On the other side, 130 congressional Democrats signed an amicus brief supporting the trans athlete plaintiffs in the two cases. 

The coalition, which includes nine senators and 121 House members, is led by Congressional Equality Caucus Co-Chair Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., Democratic Women's Caucus Chair Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, D-N.M., and Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii.

The list of signees features prominent figures on the party's left wing, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. The list also includes House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Nancy Pelosi. The list does not include noted moderate Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

The Little vs. Hecox and West Virginia vs. BPJ cases were each initially legal wins that enabled biological males to bypass their state's laws to compete against females. But now that the cases will be heard by the Supreme Court, a decision could have a wide-ranging impact on the legality of trans athletes in women's sports going forward. 

The cases are set for oral arguments on Jan. 13 in Washington, D.C. 

The Little vs. Hecox lawsuit was initially filed by trans athlete Lindsay Hecox in 2020, when the athlete wanted to join the women's cross-country team at Boise State and had the state's law to prevent trans athletes from competing in women's sports blocked.

Hecox was joined by an anonymous biological female student, Jane Doe, who was concerned about the potential of being subjected to the sex dispute verification process. The challenge was successful when a federal judge blocked Idaho's state law. 

A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld an injunction blocking the state law in 2023, before the Supreme Court agreed in July to hear the case. Hecox then asked the court last month to drop the challenge, claiming the athlete "has therefore decided to permanently withdraw and refrain from playing any women's sports at BSU or in Idaho."

Hecox tried to have the case dismissed in September after the Supreme Court agreed in July to hear the case, but U.S. District Judge David Nye, appointed by President Donald Trump in 2017, rejected Hecox's motion to dismiss the case.

The West Virginia vs. B.P.J. lawsuit was brought against the state of West Virginia by trans athlete Becky Pepper-Jackson, who was initially granted a preliminary injunction allowing the athlete to participate on the school's sports teams. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the law violated Title IX and the equal protection clause. Now the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the state's appeal.

In a response brief, the athlete's mother, Heather Jackson, argued West Virginia's law that prohibits transgender athletes from competing in women's sports violates Title IX.

However, Title IX does not explicitly protect the right of biologically male transgender people to identify as women. The Trump administration and West Virginia state government do not interpret Title IX as protective of that right.

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australian accident investigators on Thursday released dramatic images of a skydiver's parachute becoming entangled on an airplane's tail, leaving him dangling at 4,500 meters (15,000 feet.)

The skydiver, Adrian Ferguson, used a hook knife to cut himself free and sustained minor leg injuries during the incident on Sept. 20 that began at Tully Airport in Queensland state. The pilot and 16 other parachutists on board the Cessna Caravan that day were not hurt.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau released the video with its report on its investigation into the mishap.

The plane had reached the desired altitude where the skydivers were planning to execute a 16-way formation jump. A 17th parachutist was at an open door waiting to record video as the others jumped.

Ferguson was leaving the plane when the ripcord of his reserve chute became snagged on a wing flap, the report said.

The chute released and immediately jerked Fergson backward. He knocked the camera operator clear from the plane and into a free fall. Ferguson's legs then struck the trail's horizontal stabilizer before the chute tangled around it and left him dangling.

Ferguson used a knife to cut 11 lines that enabled him to fall from the plane with part of the torn chute.

He released his main chute, which fully inflated despite becoming entangled with remnants of the reserve chute, and he landed safely.




Meanwhile, most of the other skydivers had jumped. The pilot was left with two skydivers aboard battling to control the plane with part of the chute still tangled around the tail.

The pilot made a mayday call and was prepared to bail out wearing an emergency chute. But Brisbane air traffic authorities decided he had enough control of the plane to land safely at Tully. It landed without incident.

“Carrying a hook knife — although it is not a regulatory requirement — could be lifesaving in the event of a premature reserve parachute deployment,” the bureau's chief commissioner Angus Mitchell said.

            Nothing on the surface of this scrubby expanse of western Nevada desert, overlooked by towering, craggy mountains, gives even a hint of what lies beneath. But a few thousand feet underground is a hidden source of abundant clean energy — and it was discovered in an unusual way.
    


            Utah-headquartered startup Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals announced last week it had used artificial intelligence to locate a 250-degree Fahrenheit geothermal reservoir under this stretch of land. They named it “Big Blind,” because this kind of site — which has no visual indication of its existence, no hot springs or geysers above ground, and no history of geothermal exploration — is known as a “blind” system.
    


            It's the first industry-discovered blind site in more than three decades, said Carl Hoiland, co-founder and CEO of Zanskar. “The idea that geothermal is tapped out has been the narrative for decades,” but that's far from the case, he told CNN. He believes there are many more hidden sites across the Western US.
    


            Geothermal energy is a potential gamechanger. It offers the tantalizing prospect of a huge source of clean energy to meet burgeoning demand. It's near limitless, produces scarcely any climate pollution, and is constantly available, unlike wind and solar, which are cheap but rely on the sun shining and the wind blowing.
    


            The problem, however, has been how to find and scale it.
    


            It requires a specific geology: underground reservoirs of hot water or steam, along with porous rocks that allow the water to move through them, heat up, and be brought to the surface where it can power turbines.
    


            In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were high levels of excitement around geothermal, with oil and gas giants spending huge amounts drilling to find hidden systems, Hoiland said. By the mid-80s, however, many had started to give up, put off by high costs and low success rates.
    


            It's a “classic needle in the haystack problem,” said Joel Edwards, co-founder and CTO of Zanskar. “There's no one type of data that tells you that a system is below you, even if you're right on top of it.” Instead, there are multiple indicators which are really hard for humans to put together to figure out if a system exists.
    


            That's where AI comes in.
    


            The AI models Zanskar uses are fed information on where blind systems already exist. This data is plentiful as, over the last century and more, humans have accidentally stumbled on many around the world while drilling for other resources such as oil and gas.
    


            The models then scour huge amounts of data — everything from rock composition to magnetic fields — to find patterns that point to the existence of geothermal reserves. AI models have “gotten really good over the last 10 years at being able to pull those types of signals out of noise,” Hoiland said.
    


            Once a potential location has been found, the next step for the company is to drill down to confirm the reserve exists and is hot enough to produce utility-scale power.
    


            That's exactly what they did at Big Blind over the summer, drilling wells to depths of around 2,700 feet where they found porous rock at 250 degrees Fahrenheit. They know the site is at least the minimum size needed to support a power plant, but don't yet have a sense of how big it could be.
    


             There is also work to be done to navigate permitting processes and grid interconnection, but the company estimates the first electricity could be produced here in three to five years' time.
    


            Zanskar's discovery “is very significant,” said James Faulds, a professor of geosciences at Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology. (Faulds does not work with the company, but two of his former graduate students do.)
    


            Estimates suggest over three-quarters of US geothermal resources are blind, Faulds told CNN. “Refining methods to find such systems has the potential to unleash many tens and perhaps hundreds of gigawatts in the western US alone,” he said.
    


            An oft-cited government analysis from 2008 estimated undiscovered geothermal reserves in the US could provide around 30 gigawatts of power, enough to power around 25 million homes. Hoiland thinks the real figure could be at least 10 times higher.
    


            Over the last three years of scouring the Western US, Zanskar has identified many “hotspots” with the same characteristics as Big Blind, Hoiland said.
    


            Big Blind is the company's first blind site discovery, but it's the third site it has drilled and hit commercial resources. “We expect dozens, to eventually hundreds, of new sites to be coming to market,” Hoiland said.
    


A new volcanic era



            If Zanskar can keep its costs down, “that will go a long way in attracting investment,” said Sophia Bauer, geothermal project manager at Global Energy Monitor, a non-profit. Geothermal has a big advantage because it can harness drilling techniques already fine-tuned by the oil and gas industry, she told CNN.
    


            Another advantage is political. “In the United States right now, the atmosphere is quite friendly to geothermal,” Bauer said. While the Trump administration has taken an ax to solar and wind, geothermal has gone under the radar and is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years, according to a March report from Global Energy Monitor, authored by Bauer.
    


            There's plenty of scope to grow. The US leads the world in geothermal energy, accounting for about 24% of global installed capacity, but geothermal accounts for only 0.4% of the country's electricity mix.
    


            Some experts hope geothermal will help fulfill the soaring electricity demand from data centers, many of which are used for AI. “Perhaps we have a close future of AI powered by geothermal discovering more geothermal!” Bauer said.
    


            Zanskar's discovery is the latest development in what some are calling a geothermal renaissance. Much of the recent buzz has been around next-gen geothermal techniques, which use advanced tools of the oil and gas industry — including fracking — to drill very deep wells and artificially create the conditions needed to harness geothermal energy.
    


            But Hoiland says Zanskar's work shows conventional geothermal still has huge untapped potential.
    


            Joseph Moore, a University of Utah geologist, said AI could be a “gamechanger” for the industry, provided its success at finding hidden geothermal systems can be replicated multiple times.
    


             “It's the latest advancement for this benign, renewable energy source,” he told CNN. “Frankly, it's all very exciting to see.”

House Democrats are weighing up whether to take special measures to force a vote on extending Obamacare subsidies.

They are considering discharge petitions, which allow members to force a bill out of committee and allow a vote, circumventing House leadership, provided they get signatures from the majority of the House (currently 218 votes are needed). 

Democrats are mulling either a bipartisan discharge petition led by Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) and Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) over a similar proposal from Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) to extend the Affordable Care Act‘s enhanced tax credits. Democratic leadership has yet to throw its support behind either measure.

Both discharge petitions seek to extend the Obamacare subsidies, though each bill has a different approach to reforming the program.

House Republican leadership has all but refused to entertain an extension of the tax credits, as conservatives have long been opposed to Obamacare. The leaders said they would put healthcare bills up for a vote next week, but they are expected to be more messaging-based than actual policy changes.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) told the Washington Examiner that leadership is “not in favor” of either petition. But that's not stopping rank-and-file GOP members from pushing their policy priorities.

“You try to do things through the normal course,” Fitzpatrick said. “You try to do things through regular order. All those remedies are exhausted. Then you got to go this route, unfortunately.”

Though a majority of Democratic lawmakers haven't made a decision on whether to sign one or both, as of now, several in the party are leaning much more in favor of Gottheimer and Kiggans's bill. 

The legislation would include a one-year extension of the credits that includes new income caps and guardrails to crack down on fraud. The bill would also require a vote by July 2026 on other policies that would reduce Americans' health insurance premiums, as well as create new rules expediting floor time for the consideration of future “enhanced premium tax credit reform bills.”

Fitzpatrick and Golden's bill would extend the credits to 2027 and seeks to give families more tools to manage their healthcare costs, such as expanding health savings accounts.

A source familiar with both pieces of legislation told the Washington Examiner they are “very similar to the many other efforts” to provide an extension of the COVID-era subsidies. 

The bipartisan group for Golden and Fitzpatrick's bill said they did not seek support from the leadership of either party when bringing this measure forward, with Fitzpatrick telling the Washington Examiner they have still not had conversations with Democratic leadership as of Thursday evening. 

Support from Democratic leadership remains up in the air, and they have not offered guidance to their members on whether to vote for one or the other, per sources. In a caucus meeting earlier this morning, both House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone (D-NJ) had raised concerns that both discharge petitions only extend the subsidies for a short period of time. 

Ways and Means Committee Richard Neal (D-MA) said he does not support either petition so far, noting his staff is still going through details. 

A discharge petition filed by Jeffries would extend the ACA subsidies for three years, similar to the proposal that got voted down in the Senate earlier on Thursday. The petition has received every Democrat's signature, but Republicans are all but assured not to join because the minority leader's proposal does not enact any reforms.

Rep. Brittany Petterson (D-CO) told the Washington Examiner on her way to sign the Kiggans-Gottheimer petition that her concerns about the bill are that the timeline is too short and it needs clarity on details, but she is “grateful people are trying to find a path.”

The leaders of these petitions would ultimately need Democratic leadership's support to get the petition to the 218 required signatures. But neither the Democratic nor the Republican sponsors sought their approval before introducing their petitions. 

“Those conversations can start now,” Golden told reporters, acknowledging the bill doesn't have full support yet. “Yeah, I don't seek permission to act first.”

One House Democrat told the Washington Examiner that the caucus would prefer to see something more permanent so we “don't have a crisis every year.”

“If [Republicans] support the tax credits, they should just make them permanent or extend them three years,” the lawmaker said.” Extending it less than that just looks like political cover for themselves.”

As of Thursday evening, Gottheimer and Kiggans's petition has 35 signatures while Fitzpatrick and Golden's has 18. Both have attracted bipartisan support, although Gottheimer's has been seemingly more widely supported by both parties.

But Fitzpatrick said he and Kiggans introduced two bills and two discharge petitions “intentionally” to give members options.

“I signed hers, she signed mine, I cosponsored hers, she consponsored mine,” he said. “Both are two-party solutions.” 

From a policy standpoint, Democrats may be more likely to gravitate toward Kiggans's and Gottheimer's bill, given that it pushes for higher subsidies and no health savings account options. The party has long argued that HSAs do not actually lower premium costs, given that the accounts can't be used to pay for premiums under current law. Republicans, however, have eyed an expansion or reform to HSAs as a counter to Obamacare to put money in the hands of patients rather than insurance companies.

When asked if he was pushing for his or Kiggans's to be considered for a vote by the speaker, Fitzpatrick said “either or.” He acknowledged that some members might be in favor of one or the other based on the details, but providing two options is their effort to try and “find a home for everybody where their most comfortable parking their positions.”

JOHNSON GIVES 10 OPTIONS TO ADDRESS HEALTHCARE COSTS, NONE OF WHICH INVOLVE OBAMACARE SUBSIDIES

“It's all part of a joint effort. Everyone seems to be, like, keeping score. That's not how we're viewing it,” the Pennsylvania congressman said.

The Pennsylvania congressman said, “We'll see” when asked if Johnson would put a bill extending the subsidies on the floor next week, saying that was a goal of his and his allies. He said there are “further conversations” to be had about a plan, but he didn't want to get ahead of the speaker.

            The Justice Department's mortgage fraud investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James is on life support after a grand jury, for the second time, rejected an indictment that would have revived charges against her.
    


Lindsey Halligan, appointed by President Donald Trump to run the office, now faces the decision on whether to try again next week or pull the plug and risk the wrath of the president who wants James indicted.
    


            The rejection is an embarrassing setback for the Justice department — which had sought to revive the criminal case after a federal judge ruled Halligan was appointed unlawfully — and for the administration, who had positioned James' case as a centerpiece in its retribution campaign.
    


            But this latest setback may not necessarily be the end of the story. Prosecutors could go back to a grand jury again and continue their efforts to re-indict James over the same allegations in the hopes that one will approve charges.
    


            Continuing to pursue indictments is “exceedingly rare” in federal cases, according to former federal prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky. The Trump Justice Department, however, has shown a proclivity to try the strategy in some other immigration-related cases earlier this year.
    


            “One no true bill is a point. Two points make a line. That line points to an acquittal at trial,” Zelinsky said. “The Government should hang it up at strike two rather than go down swinging.”
    


            The Justice Department declined to comment on the grand jury's declination.
    


            In the original indictment, prosecutors said James had claimed on mortgage paperwork that a home she purchased in Norfolk, Virginia, would be her second residence, allowing her to get a favorable mortgage rate. Prosecutors said that James didn't use the house and rented it instead.
    


            James had pleaded not guilty to one count of making false statements to a financial institution and one count of bank fraud before the case was dismissed.
    


            In a statement to CNN, James' attorney Abbe Lowell said this “unprecedented rejection makes even clearer that this case should never have seen the light of day.”
    


            Legal experts told CNN that such repeated efforts to revive the case could raise policy and constitutional concerns.
    


            “The prosecutor, as a matter of policy, shouldn't be presenting charges before a grand jury unless they have a reasonable belief that they could win before a jury,” said retired federal Judge Nancy Gertner. “Losing before the grand jury once is one of the best indications that there's no there there — that they don't have a case.”
    


            But such repeated attempts — if eventually successful — may help fuel James' allegation that she's being unfairly targeted for prosecution.
    


            “The evidence of vindictiveness is to go back and back before the grand jury, notwithstanding their inability to secure an indictment,” Gertner said. “That's one classic measure of vindictiveness — meaning that you're doing this not because you actually have a case, but you simply want to get her.”

            Less than six months after President Donald Trump deployed the National Guard to Washington, DC, the mission is becoming more perilous and complex — and perhaps more permanent.
    


            After last month's shooting near the White House left one National Guard member dead and another critically wounded, some troops are now conducting joint patrols with local police, a move intended to provide more security to the very people sent to make the city safer.
    


            Yet, even as the price tag is mounting – officials estimate the DC mission costs roughly $1.5 million per day – and the impact on reducing overall crime is mixed, officials say expectations are rising that the deployment of troops will continue.
    


            In a win for the Trump administration, a US appeals court last week froze a judge's previous ruling that the deployment was unlawful — potentially paving the way for a mission that is likely months, if not years longer.
    


            National Guard leaders are recruiting for a smaller full-time unit that will include military police deployed to DC as part of a two-year plan, according to a federal military official. Another source familiar with the planning compared a potential long-term guard presence in DC to the New York National Guard's anti-terrorism task force, stationed at transit hubs since the September 11 terror attacks.
    


            While the DC Guard has already been extended to February, officials expect additional states will also be directed to keep their troops in place. Conversations have already started about keeping troops in Washington for the America 250th anniversary celebration next year — a major priority for the White House.
    


            This all comes as guard members and their families have grown increasingly uneasy since the November 26 shooting.
    


            One mother of a Mississippi guardsman, who has been in Washington since November, said she had initially taken comfort in knowing her son would be serving on US soil, which she figured would be safer.
    


            Then she saw a news alert about the shooting near the White House.
    


            “My nerves went haywire and I immediately texted [my son's] phone just to get a response to see was he okay,” she said. He texted back quickly.
    


            Her son is one of more than 2,200 troops from multiple states deployed to DC as part of Trump's anti-crime crackdown. Even before the shooting, he'd felt conflicted about the mission, his mother said, particularly about the cost and whether those resources could be better used to bolster an already-strapped local police force.
    


            Meanwhile, a second death of a guardsmen two weeks before Thanksgiving garnered less attention. Staff Sgt. Jacob Hill from Alabama died on November 13 while on the DC mission after what officials said was a medical emergency from an off-duty incident. A source familiar with the mission said Hill was found unresponsive in his room.
    


            The DC mission has taken an emotional toll, several service members said. While some who spoke to CNN said the shooting renewed many troops' sense of purpose for the mission, others said morale had been slumping because of mundane orders, like just standing around a metro station. Several service members expressed feeling their presence was resented by local residents.
    


            CNN is not naming the guard members or their family interviewed for this story because they're not authorized to speak to the media and feared reprisal.
    


            “It was hard to be around people that were anti-military or didn't like or appreciate you because of the orders that we were on, but you know, we were just doing our job,” said one guard member who had been deployed from Louisiana until recently.
    


With no end in sight, National Guard troops deployed to DC grow weary



            “Unfortunately, we lost a soldier from it, and it breaks my heart,” the member said. “Doing our job is being at risk in that way, especially serving our country. But dying in our country is too close to home.”
    


            DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb argued in a court filing last week that allowing the troops to remain in the city any longer “requires the diversion of scarce police resources and exposes both the public and Guard members to substantial public safety risks,” especially in the wake of the shooting.
    


            Schwalb noted that DC police officers have had to “coordinate with and escort” guardsmen in the city to minimize threats, a task Schwalb said has “redoubled” following last month's shooting.
    


            Since then, Trump has requested 500 more soldiers to be deployed to DC, and new units from Florida, Oklahoma and Arkansas have already joined the mission or are preparing to do so.
    


            The Trump administration has repeatedly declined to place a firm price on the ongoing deployment, but officials familiar with the finances estimate the mission costs up to $1.5 million a day — which would tally up to more than $172 million since August. That's roughly one-third of the Metropolitan Police Department's annual budget.
    


            Democratic Sen. Gary Peters from Michigan said in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday that ongoing National Guard deployments to US cities around the country have so far cost $410 million
    


            “There is nothing conservative about this,” a federal military official told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid being perceived as criticizing the National Guard. “A fraction of this money could be far better spent directly on crime-prevention measures.”
    


            Some officials privately question the financial logic of the mission. A far smaller sum, they note, could have gone toward addressing chronic short-staffing at the DC police department, which is about 800 officers below its recommended staffing level of 4,000.
    


            Trump officials had said the purpose of the National Guard in DC was to establish a presence at various locations – mostly federal monuments and metro stations – and act as a crime deterrent. The intention was to free up law enforcement agents to address crime elsewhere in the city, but new joint patrols with guard members and police would seem to contradict that.
    


            Federal and local agencies scrambled in the wake of the shooting to determine how to protect National Guard troops. DC's police force was initially tasked with increasing check-ins and patrols with officers in the city.
    


            No official plan, however, has been established for how to keep National Guardsmen safe from random attacks, according to one source familiar with the mission.
    


            City officials are also unclear how long the Trump administration intends to keep the National Guard deployed in the city, speculating earlier this year that Trump might have the officers remain until next summer.
    


            A source familiar with the mission said officials are regularly doing assessments and making plans if the mission continues getting extended – looking at things like what would be needed for tourism season in DC and weather patterns in the spring. But lingering uncertainty about how long the mission will last also comes at a price, as officials are unable to make long-term arrangements that might be more cost-effective.
    


            Housing for out-of-state troops is among the biggest cost expenditures, with most out-of-town troops assigned to stay in suburban Virginia hotels. Housing allowances are also given to DC National Guard members, in some cases effectively paying them to stay in their own homes.
    


            In the summer months, the guard spent $5 million on a tent city, according to a CNN review of contracts, plus more than $1 million on renting air conditioning units and land mobile radios.
    


            Rumors of an extended deployment until next summer are already spreading through the ranks.
    


            A senior Republican official from a state that contributed troops said last month's shooting has made it harder for governors to publicly question the deployment. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it is a frequent conversation among governors, but none of whom are willing to raise it publicly to avoid alienating the White House.
    


            The DC Guard is currently working to recruit a potentially permanent, full-time security-focused unit, the source said, adding that it would be available for any need within the DC Guard and will be a separate group from the quick-reaction forces Trump has ordered for each state. The challenge right now, the source said, is that there isn't any official guarantee of mission continuity, making it hard to recruit people away from civilian careers. But the person said “more than enough people” are already interested.
    


            “We are committed to treating every member of the community with dignity and respect,” said a Joint Task Force-DC spokesperson. “Our strong partnership with local and federal agencies ensures a coordinated and professional response as we work together to keep our capital safe.”
    


            The actual impact on crime in DC has so far been inconclusive. Though Trump justified the troop surge to Washington by saying that crime was “out of control” in the city, violent crime declined in 2024 and has declined again so far in 2025.
    


            There has been a sustained decrease in reports of motor vehicle theft, according to DC crime data, every month since Trump announced his federal takeover of Washington's police department and surged National Guard and other federal law enforcement to the city in September. Theft from vehicles has also been on the decline compared to months before the National Guard deployment.
    


            But other crimes, such as homicide, robbery, burglary and assault with a deadly weapon, which dropped initially at the start of the takeover, have risen at least a little since then.
    


            At the start of the mission, the DC Guard sent a letter around to each of the city's neighborhood commission, offering to help clean trash from their local park or other “beautification tasks” if they needed it. While some of the commissions accepted and were happy to see guard members then come through, others felt uneasy inviting the troops into their communities.
    


            “Some of us worried that the presence of the National Guard wouldn't actually make our neighborhood safer and it could actually present risks,” said Peter Wood, the commissioner in DC's Adams Morgan neighborhood.
    


            An amicus brief filed last week and signed by more than 30 retired former senior military officials argues against deploying the National Guard “in a highly politicized context,” as the administration has done in DC. The brief also says that most National Guard “have only limited law enforcement training,” which could put both them and civilians at risk.
    


            “If crime on the streets in Washington, D.C., is an issue, that's something for law enforcement to deal with,” retired Brig. Gen. Paul “Greg” Smith, who had a three-decade career in the Massachusetts National Guard and is one of the signatories to the amicus brief, told CNN.
    


            “I would think that a reasonable chain of command would say, ‘We need to fortify, we need to strengthen a civilian law enforcement capability within the city of Washington, D.C.,'” said Smith. “National Guardsmen are war fighters. No one in the National Guard is trained to be a police officer.”
    


            He added that while public sentiment has typically been supportive of the guard as a presence available to help in emergencies, that image could “become tarnished” if the troops are used “as a political pawn.”
    


            “And yes, some people may target National Guardsmen” as a result, Smith said. “That is a concern.”
    


            Just days after the two members from their state were shot, a group of guardsmen from West Virginia were back on duty in Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood.
    


            “Of course we're sad, but we've got to keep doing our job,” one said.
    


            Asked if he was concerned about still being in DC, he responded, “No comment.”
    


            A service member from a different state said the shooting had been “a wake-up call,” and others echoed that it had taken an emotional toll.
    


            Within the DC Guard, several dozen service members have requested to be taken off this deployment for various reasons ranging from needing to get back to their civilian job or school to just not wanting to be a part of it, said a source familiar with the mission, adding that officials are working to help them come off the mission.
    


            A trio of guardsmen from a southern state walking near the White House on a recent afternoon said they had enjoyed their time, particularly as the hot summer days turned to a far more pleasant fall. They said they were happy to serve, but wished they had more concrete duties, as boredom has set in after being deployed for more than four months.
    


            The Louisiana guardsman who had been deployed to DC for several months before coming off the mission several weeks ago said soldiers “accomplished a lot, even if it didn't seem like a lot.”
    


            “I feel like we kept crime off the streets a little bit more,” the person said.
    


            The guardsman said the reception to them varied, with about half of the people they encountered thanking them for their service. The other half weren't as friendly.
    


            “Morale seemed to heighten when people were ready to go home because morale was kind of low when we were there, when people were just getting treated like scum or just treated like they didn't matter, especially when we signed up to serve our country and provide help where it's needed,” the guardsman said.
    


            A mother of an Oklahoma National Guard member said she'd been fully supportive of the mission as other states sent their troops to Washington. But when she heard that her son would be deploying there just after Thanksgiving, she was scared for him, she said.
    


            “We're terrified, that's all I can really say,” the mother said.
    


            “He's just going to be a little bit more extra with his head on a swivel now,” she said.

            The US Food and Drug Administration intends to put a “black box” warning on Covid-19 vaccines, according to two people familiar with the agency's plans, the latest move by President Donald Trump's health officials to undermine a vaccine that was a standout victory of his first term. The plan shocked outside experts, who said there was no basis for the warning.
    


            A boxed warning, which appears at the top of prescribing information for medicines, is the agency's most serious, designed to warn about risks such as death or life-threatening or disabling reactions that should be weighed against the intervention's benefits. They can also be used when a risk might be lowered by using a medicine in a targeted way, such as only in certain groups.
    


            Boxed warnings on opioids, for example, warn about risks of abuse, addiction, overdose and death. The acne medication Accutane carried a warning about the risks of birth defects when used during pregnancy. ACAM2000, a smallpox and mpox vaccine, has a warning about complications such as heart inflammation and encephalitis.
    


            The plan to install the warnings for Covid-19 vaccines is being orchestrated by Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's chief medical and scientific officer and director of the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, according to one person, who declined to be named because they weren't authorized to share the information publicly.
    


            The plan has not been finalized and may still change. It wasn't immediately clear whether the plans for the warnings, expected to be unveiled by the end of the year, would be applied only to mRNA vaccines or to all Covid-19 vaccines, or whether they would apply to all age groups. Three vaccines are approved by the FDA for use in the US, and two of them — from Pfizer and Moderna – use mRNA technology, which has been a key focus of the administration.
    


            “Unless the FDA announces it, any claim about what it will do is pure speculation,” US Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said Thursday.
    


Recommending Covid-19 vaccines for everyone in the US could save thousands more lives than limiting to high-risk groups



            In response to CNN's inquiry about the FDA's plans, Moderna pointed to a statement it issued in September about the safety of its Covid-19 vaccine, SpikeVax. It notes that the safety of its vaccine is “rigorously monitored by Moderna, the US FDA, and regulators in more than 90 countries,” and that, with more than a billion doses distributed worldwide, those systems “have not reported any new or undisclosed safety concerns in children or pregnant women.”
    


            Pfizer too issued a statement in September supporting the safety and efficacy of its Covid-19 vaccine. The statements from both companies came after reports that federal health officials might seek to tie the vaccines to safety risks in pregnant women and children. Pfizer declined to provide further comment Thursday.
    


            One study estimated that in their first year of use, Covid-19 vaccinations averted almost 20 million deaths around the world.
    


            Children who received Covid-19 vaccines in the 2024-25 respiratory virus season also had a “substantially lower risk” of emergency department and urgent care visits related to the virus, according to a CDC report published Thursday. The vaccines were about 76% effective in preventing these outcomes among healthy children ages 9 months to 4 years and about 56% effective among children ages 5 to 17 compared with those who did not receive an updated vaccine for the 2024-25 season.
    


            The record-speed development of Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic, under the project dubbed Operation Warp Speed, was a crowning achievement of President Donald Trump's first term, one that several Republican lawmakers have recently said should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But Trump installed as his Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who has faced criticism from public health experts and lawmakers for his efforts to impose his personal views despite the science.
    


            Kennedy and his allies have long questioned the safety and effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccines, which were studied in placebo-controlled trials in about 75,000 people and given to millions of people in the US and around the world during the pandemic.
    


            Prasad has been a controversial figure, both in his role at the FDA and previously, as a podcaster and professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California at San Francisco. A critic of the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccine policy, he was named CBER director under FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary in May before resigning in July under pressure from the White House and right-wing activist Laura Loomer. Prasad then returned to the job weeks later.
    


            In late November, Prasad sent a memo to staff within CBER, the division at the FDA that oversees vaccines, claiming that staff in the agency's Office of Biostatistics and Pharmacovigilance had “found that at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving Covid-19 vaccination.” He did not provide additional information but promised “swift action” in response.
    


            “The FDA takes very seriously any death that is attributed to a regulated medical product,” Nixon, of HHS, said Thursday.
    


            Prasad focused on myocarditis, or heart inflammation, a very rare side effect after administration of the mRNA vaccines. It was detected with early use of those shots, when the first and second doses were recommended to be spaced as closely as three weeks apart, and was predominantly seen in boys and young men.
    


            A presentation from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in June said most adolescents and young adults recovered from myocarditis after vaccination, and it found no known deaths or heart transplants. Rates have declined significantly in more recent years as the recommended interval between the first and second doses in the initial series has been lengthened for the mRNA vaccines.
    


            Still, the FDA said in May that it was requiring safety warnings in the prescribing information for Pfizer and Moderna's Covid-19 vaccines about the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, or inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart, to be expanded to a broader age range. The labels now say, “the observed risk has been highest in males 12 years through 24 years of age.”
    


            On Tuesday, Children's Health Defense, the nonprofit led by Kennedy before his presidential bid, filed a citizen petition saying the agency should revoke the licenses for the vaccines. It argues that the mRNA vaccines are misbranded because they were initially approved under the standards of emergency use authorizations.
    


            HHS also said this week that the FDA was looking into whether deaths “across multiple age groups” might be related to Covid-19 vaccines.
    


            Prasad's memo, which promised an overhaul of how the FDA regulates vaccines more broadly, drew alarm from outside public health experts, many of whom demanded to see the data supporting Prasad's claims. A dozen former FDA commissioners wrote an open letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine expressing concern around “sweeping new FDA assertions about vaccine safety.”
    


            “What's happening now is death by a thousand cuts,” said a former federal health official who declined to be named because they were not authorized to share information with a reporter.
    


            Recent messaging by the administration that goes against established scientific evidence – saying, for example, that vaccines are riskier when given together and that kids get too many vaccines that have potentially dangerous ingredients – is working to weaken the public's confidence in lifesaving shots, the person said.
    


            “What we're watching is misinformation and lies in aggregate that will discourage the population from vaccination. It will lead us to, ultimately, to having loss of life unnecessarily, and it's very disturbing,” the former official added.
    


Covid-19 vaccination substantially lowered risks for children last season, CDC report says



            Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, who runs the Program on Regulation, Therapeutics and Law at Harvard University, said these kinds of warnings can be initiated by the manufacturer or the FDA, but typically, the agency notifies the public that it's looking into a safety question around a drug or vaccine. It may also convene an advisory committee — a panel of independent outside experts – to publicly vet the safety data and give advice.
    


            None of these steps seems to have been taken so far.
    


            “I guess my concern is that in this case, there's not a process,” said Kesselheim, who has studied the impact of black box warnings on drug labels. “There isn't that same opportunity for discussion and good-faith review of the data on which this decision is being made.
    


            “My concern is that this will be seen as yet another in the long line of decisions that this FDA is making based on its own political goals, rather than after a dutiful and thoughtful and public review of the science.”
    


            Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, said, “Any questions regarding potential safety issues are being thoroughly reviewed by the FDA's established scientific and regulatory processes, ensuring that all decisions are based on rigorous, independent evaluation of the data.”
    


            Others say they're disturbed by the lack of transparency around whether deaths can be directly linked to the vaccine.
    


            “The FDA has not released any data on how they determined that the Covid vaccines were linked to these pediatric deaths,” said Dr. Fiona Havers, a medical epidemiologist who resigned from the CDC in June over the administration's interference in the agency's vaccine programs.
    


            “Very rare adverse events with vaccines can occur. I don't know if they did in this case, because, again, they haven't released any information,” she said. “But to only talk about potential harms for vaccines, without talking about the thousands of hospitalizations and the many pediatric deaths that these vaccines prevented, is irresponsible and not how our government should be messaging about vaccines to the public.”
    


How RFK Jr.'s misguided science on mRNA vaccines is shaping policy − a vaccine expert examines the false claims



            Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan and co-editor-in-chief of the journal Vaccine, said the basis for a black-box warning was hard to understand.
    


            “Scientifically, I don't think it makes any sense at all, because we haven't seen any of this data,” she said. “Presumably it's going to say something like ‘this vaccine is dangerous.' The FDA puts those on things when there are serious safety risks associated with them. And so it doesn't make sense from an evidence-based perspective, at least based on any of the data that anybody's seen.”
    


            Still, the move doesn't surprise her. Rasmussen said Prasad has a longstanding and well-documented antipathy toward the Covid-19 vaccine, as do other administration officials.
    


            “Everything that they've done so far kind of signals to me that they're very opposed to the Covid vaccines, and they're really trying to manufacture evidence to justify something like that,” she said. “That's been clear for a long time.”
    


            Nixon said it's “irresponsible for outside commentators to speculate about secondhand information they have not seen directly. We categorically reject the suggestion that anyone on our team is attempting to ‘manufacture evidence.'”

            President Donald Trump's Gaza ceasefire plan is set to enter a new phase within weeks, but crucial pieces of the agreement remain undefined as Israel tightens its military grip on the battered enclave.
    


            With the return of all but one of the deceased hostages held by militants – and questions about whether Hamas will even be able to locate the last set of remains – the first phase of the 20-point plan is verging on completion.
    


            Now, amid international concern that the two-month-old ceasefire is at risk of collapse, Trump is determined to move to the far more complicated second phase of the agreement, which includes Hamas' disarmament, the beginning of reconstruction, and the establishment of post-war governance. At the center of the new plan for administering Gaza is the creation of a “Board of Peace” to be led by Trump and other world leaders.
    


            “It'll be one of the most legendary boards ever. Everybody wants to be on it,” Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.
    


            Despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's public embrace of the deal in September, significant gaps remain between the US and Israel. The US is pushing to move quickly into the next phase, but Israel is conditioning major steps on the return of the final deceased hostage and has been resisting US efforts to resolve a standoff with a pocket of isolated Hamas militants in the Israeli-occupied parts of southern Gaza.
    


            “Much (of the second phase) is left open to interpretation, which, in the Middle East is both the best and the worst thing,” an Israeli official told CNN.
    


            Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, along with Egypt and Norway, warned over the weekend that the ceasefire is at a “critical moment,” at risk of collapse as mediators try to make progress. “It's not yet there, so what we have just done is a pause,” al-Thani said at the Doha Forum on Saturday.
    


            While the Trump administration is ready to begin rehabilitation and reconstruction of the enclave, Israel remains focused on disarming Hamas and the demilitarization of Gaza – a key component of the agreement, but one that has no clear path forward.
    


            “The question is whether, in the meantime, Hamas remains there, and that's it – we just get used to it and accept it,” a second Israeli official told CNN. Trump, the official said, wants to see progress before Netanyahu visits Mar-a-Lago, the president's private estate in Florida, at the end of the month.
    


            The US is also still working to finalize key details ahead of a potential phase two announcement, including the makeup of the international security force called for by the plan and the Board of Peace that would oversee Gaza's governance, a US official said.
    


            Two months in, the ceasefire has been tested repeatedly, with both Hamas and Israel accusing each other of violating the agreement. Nearly 400 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military since it went into effect in October, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The Israeli military says three of its soldiers were killed by Hamas militants in that same period. And human rights groups have accused Israel of failing to uphold its commitments regarding the flow of humanitarian aid and blocking essential supplies, like tents, from entering the strip.
    


            On Sunday, Israeli military chief Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said Israeli forces will remain on the so-called yellow line inside Gaza, to which they retreated as part of the truce, referring to the frontier as a “new border line – serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity.”
    


            The Israeli military occupies more than half of Gaza but is required to withdraw completely in subsequent phases of the agreement. According to the deal, Israel is prohibited from permanently occupying or annexing the enclave.
    


            Meanwhile, the US has pressed Israel to open the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, which was supposed to restart operations as part of the ceasefire agreement. But Israel said in October it would remain closed “until further notice.” Earlier this month, Israel announced it would open the crossing only in one direction, for Palestinians to leave Gaza, but none would be allowed to enter, sparking outrage from Arab and Muslim nations who called the move an attempt “to displace the Palestinian people from their land.” Ministers in Netanyahu's right-wing government have repeatedly advocated for the “voluntary” emigration of Gaza's residents and the settlement of Jews in their place.
    


            The US has been working to resolve the dispute, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to raise the issue with his Israeli counterpart on Wednesday, a US official said ahead of the meeting.
    


            An Egyptian official attributed the lack of progress on the next phase to the chasm of distrust between Israel and Hamas. “Every point in it is tied to internal calculations on both sides,” the official told CNN. Political divisions – both within the Israeli government and amongst Palestinian factions – restrict the mediators' ability to take meaningful steps on a series of issues, they added.
    


            “Phase two is not frozen because of one point,” the official said. “It is frozen because every step affects Gaza's future, and the parties are not yet willing to pay the political cost of making a final decision.”
    


            The foremost demand for Israel is the demilitarization of Gaza. The agreement calls for the decommissioning of Hamas' weapons and the destruction of militant infrastructure.
    


            On Sunday, a senior Hamas official said the militant group was “very open-minded” about what to do with its weapons.
    


            “We can talk about freezing or storing or laying down, with the Palestinian guarantees, not to use it at all during this ceasefire time or truce,” Bassem Naim told the Associated Press in an interview in Qatar. The proposal appears to fall short of the disarmament clauses under the ceasefire agreement, and it's not clear if Israel would accept anything else.
    


Hamas willing to discuss ‘freezing or storing' weapons, senior official says, amid concerns over ceasefire



            To manage disarmament, the agreement calls for an international force that will secure parts of Gaza ahead of Israel's withdrawal. But that force only exists on paper now. The United Nations Security Council passed a US-sponsored resolution last month that enshrined Trump's 20-point plan, including the mandate necessary to create a multinational force for Gaza, but not a single nation has formally committed troops to it yet.
    


            The Trump administration's goal is to have the force deploy to Gaza sometime early next year, according to the US official. But it's not clear which countries would participate. Even those like Indonesia and Azerbaijan, both of which had previously expressed willingness to send troops, appear far less committal now. American and Israeli officials told CNN the international force would initially deploy alongside the Israeli military in the Israeli-occupied parts of Gaza, though whether Muslim nations would want to be seen cooperating with Israeli forces is uncertain.
    


            In the meantime, Israel will continue to back local anti-Hamas militias in Gaza, according to the Israeli officials, even after the death of the leader of the most prominent gang last week. In a potential blow to Israel's post-war plans in Gaza, Yasser Abu Shabab was killed in what one of the sources described as “internal clashes,” underscoring the volatile nature of the territory after two years of war.
    


            Without any clear prospect of Hamas' disarmament or the international oversight mechanism, the second phase will focus on reconstruction efforts within Israeli-occupied Gaza. Israel has begun clearing areas in Rafah in southern Gaza to allow for the rebuilding of the shattered territory, as part of a broader strategy to convince Palestinians to move to what the US has dubbed “alternative safe zones,” and isolate Hamas.
    


            In the near-term, the Trump administration is focused on finalizing elements of Gaza's post-war governance. According to US and Israeli officials, the US is working to finalize the Board of Peace that will oversee the redevelopment of Gaza and the Palestinian technocratic committee to run the territory. At some unspecified date after that, a reformed Palestinian Authority, which currently governs parts of the occupied West Bank, is supposed to take over the administration of Gaza, opening the door to what the UN resolution called a “credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination.”
    


            Highlighting the long-term difficulties of the ceasefire agreement, Israel has already rejected both Palestinian Authority responsibility for Gaza and any notion of Palestinian statehood.

Crypto ETFs:

Vanguard Group may now allow clients to trade spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, but one of the firm's senior investment leaders says its underlying view of crypto remains unchanged.

Bitcoin is better understood as a speculative collectible — akin to a popular plush toy — than as a productive asset, according to John Ameriks, Vanguard's global head of quantitative equity, who said the token lacks the income, compounding and cash-flow properties the firm looks for in long-term investments.

Your company's Dell laptops are about to cost more.

Starting December 17, the computer maker is set to hike prices across its commercial product lines, according to an internal list of upcoming price changes sent to staff on December 9 and seen by Business Insider.

The list outlines price hikes for Dell's commercial business — meaning its sales to corporate clients rather than individual consumers. The commercial business accounts for about 85% of Dell's annual revenue in the Client Solutions Group (CSG), the division that sells laptops and PCs, according to its latest annual results.

The company is one of the leading providers of computer hardware to US companies, and prices aren't just rising at Dell. An industry-wide shortage of memory and storage chips is driving up costs across the PC industry, affecting competitors like Lenovo and HP as well.

The soaring demand for AI infrastructure has tech companies snapping up enormous quantities of memory and storage chips, increasing competition for consumer devices.

A Dell spokesperson told Business Insider that "like others in the industry, Dell takes targeted pricing action, when necessary, while maintaining supply continuity and its commitment to customer value."

"Our supply chain is resilient and globally diverse. It's designed to offer the needed flexibility when navigating macroeconomic, regulatory and trade dynamics," the spokesperson said.

How much more expensive a laptop at Dell will be next week depends on how much memory and storage you require.

The global shortages are hitting two key types of chips that are essential components in most user devices: DRAM and NAND.

When you buy a laptop, DRAM — dynamic random-access memory — is the memory, usually 8GB to 32GB for an average customer. NAND — non-volatile flash memory — is used for SSD storage, typically around 512GB or 1TB.

From next week, Dell Pro and Pro Max notebooks and desktops with 32GB of memory will cost between $130 and $230 more, according to the list of price changes seen by Business Insider. If opting for the top-of-the-range 128GB memory, the price is set to rise by between $520 and $765 per device.

Selecting a laptop with 1 TB of storage will add to the overall cost by between $55 and $135.

An employee at Dell who works in sales said the percentage increase would be "between 10% and 30%" depending on the contract. They asked to remain anonymous as they are not permitted to speak publicly, but Business Insider has verified their employment.

The price list also includes price hikes for AI laptops containing Nvidia Blackwell GPUs and individual monitors. For example, a Dell Pro 55 Plus 4K Monitor, currently listed on Dell's website at $1,349.99, will be $150 more expensive, according to the price list.

AI laptops containing an Nvidia RTX PRO 500 Blackwell GPU with 6GB will become $66 more expensive, and a 24GB GPU will cost $530 more, the pricing chart shows.

"It's impacting everyone, and there's no way around it currently, so customers will just have to pay more if they want the products," the sales employee said.

Higher prices make for a tougher sell, already a challenge for sales teams amid today's tariff-weary consumers and enterprises.

Dell sent an email to its "go-to-market" (GTM) sales staff on November 25, which Business Insider has seen, outlining the "critical next steps" sellers should take to prepare ahead of the increase.

"Global memory and storage supply are tightening fast," Dell warned GTM team members.

The price of contracts for DRAM and NAND chips has "already risen significantly this quarter, and suppliers are signaling further increases and allocation constraints driven by AI demand," Dell said in the email.

The company told its sellers to "move decisively" ahead of the price increases to "protect value for our customers and for Dell."

The email advised teams to engage with top accounts in the coming week, close deals, and plan significant opportunities and multi-quarter deals to protect the sales pipeline.

"Ordering today for future delivery DOES NOT lock in current pricing," Dell warned, but said that acting now would help customers stay ahead of "significant anticipated memory increase."

The Dell sales employee said that there had been an initial rush to help customers buy remaining inventory, but now the situation is largely viewed as "out of our control."

The employee said Dell was also absorbing some of the costs internally, through hits to margins and limiting discounts that sales staff can offer.

In the company's third-quarter earnings call on November 25, Jeff Clarke, Dell's COO and vice chairman, said the market's price increases were "unprecedented."

"We have not seen costs move at the rate that we've seen," Clarke said. "Demand is way ahead of supply. And as we wade our way through that, we're going to lean on the things that we've always done."

Tech companies are buying massive amounts of DRAM and NAND to power AI models and cloud services, leaving fewer chips for consumer devices.

Combined with global supply-chain tensions, the explosion in demand has prompted the three companies that dominate the DRAM market — Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron — to raise their prices.

DRAM prices are expected to rise 30% in the final quarter of 2025, having already increased by 50% so far this year, according to Counterpoint, a global technology market research firm.

"The entire supply chain simply can't meet the demand that is now required and that inevitably leads to these kinds of challenges," Bob O'Donnell, the president and chief analyst at Technalysis Research, told Business Insider.

These price increases will "likely have a noticeable impact for all types of PCs from every PC vendor," said O'Donnell, adding that the supply shortage is expected to continue throughout 2026.

Nearly 100,000 photos obtained by House Democrats from the estate of notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein include images of President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, film director Woody Allen, and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon and others in social settings.

Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as they made the photos public, urged the Department of Justice to release investigative files it has related to Epstein ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to do so to comply with a newly passed law.

One image among a batch of photos released Friday morning shows Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release. Some of the women are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks. 

Trump is shown in another photo standing behind Epstein at what appears to be a social event. A third photo shows Trump sitting next to a woman, whose face is blacked out, on what appears to be a plane.

Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein before the two men had a falling out sometime in the early 2000s. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and has denied knowledge of Epstein's abuse of girls and women while they are friends.

CNBC has requested comment from the White House.

Clinton is shown in one photo standing with Epstein, his now-convicted procurer Ghislaine Maxwell, and another man and woman. The photo has Clinton's signature on it.

Other photos show former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was previously known as Prince Andrew of Britain, and Epstein's one-time lawyer Alan Dershowitz.

The dates, locations and context of the photos were not revealed as part of the release Friday. 

CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos, all of whom have denied wrongdoing. This story will be updated with their responses.

"This latest production contains over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein," a statement from Democrats on the Oversight Committee said.

"Images also include thousands of photographs of women and Epstein properties," the statement said. "Committee Democrats are reviewing the full set of photos and will continue to release photos to the public in the days and weeks ahead. Committee Democrats are committed to protecting the identities of the survivors."

Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee, in a statement said, "It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends."

"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW."

 Trump and top law enforcement officials in his administration for months resisted the idea of releasing investigative files related to Epstein and Maxwell before Congress in November overwhelmingly passed a law mandating their release by the Department of Justice.

Those files, which are separate from the ones released by the Democrats on Friday, have yet to be made publicly available.

Garcia said the committee received the new batch of photos from Epstein's estate on Thursday night.

He said that the committee's Democrats have reviewed "maybe about 25,000 of [the photos] so far."

"There's an enormous amount of photos we have not gone through," Garcia said. "It will take days and weeks to ensure that we got those photos and that a redaction is done in the appropriate way."

"Obviously there are photos of powerful men, and folks that we want to have an opportunity to speak with and ask questions of," Garcia said.

He noted that the photos were in the estate's possession, and that Epstein took some of them himself, while others may have been sent to him.

"Some of the other photos that we did not put out today are incredibly disturbing," Garcia added.

Republicans on the Oversight Committee, in their own statement, said, "Once again, Oversight Democrats are chasing headlines by releasing a handful of selectively censored and cherry-picked photos from the Epstein Estate."

"Democrats' hoax against President Trump has been completely debunked. Nothing in the documents we've received shows any wrongdoing," the Republicans said. "Ranking Member Robert Garcia and Oversight Democrats should be ashamed of this disgusting behavior of putting politics above justice for the survivors."

Epstein died from a jailhouse suicide in August 2019, weeks after he was arrested on child sex trafficking charges filed by the DOJ during Trump's first term in office.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for her 2021 conviction of crimes related to procuring underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.

Angel Urena, a spokesperson for Clinton, had said in a July 2019 statement, "President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York."

"In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation. Staff, supporters of the Foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip," Urena said. 

"He had one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein's New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail. He's not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein's ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida."

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, in a statement to CNBC, accused House Democrats of "selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative."

Jackson called the Democrats' focus on the president's connection to Epstein a "hoax," and argued that the Trump administration "has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have" by releasing documents and calling for transparency.

Clinton is shown in one photo standing with Epstein, his now-convicted procurer Ghislaine Maxwell, and another man and woman. The photo has Clinton's signature on it.

Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Friday explained why he voted against this week's interest rate cut, telling CNBC that policymakers should have waited until they had more information before easing further.

"I'm pretty optimistic that for 2026 rates will will be able to be a fair bit lower than they are today," the central banker said during a "Squawk Box" interview. "But I've just been uncomfortable front-loading too many rate cuts and assuming that what we've seen in inflation will be transitory."

Goolsbee was one of three Federal Open Market Committee members to vote against the quarter percentage point reduction, the third consecutive easing measure. He was joined by Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, as well as Governor Stephen Miran, who preferred a steeper cut.

While he has said in the past he sees room for rates to come down further, Goolsbee said a lack of progress on inflation argued against moving now.

Recent readings show the annual inflation rate around 2.8%, well above the Fed's 2% target.

"There's no way around we've been four and a half years above the inflation target, and the last six months have shown no progress," Goolsbee said. "Right before the lights went out [for the government shutdown], you saw a couple of relatively disturbing readings on services inflation. I just want to make sure that if we believe that this is transitory, let's not just put all our eggs in."

"While I voted to lower rates at the September and October meetings, I believe we should have waited to get more data, especially about inflation, before lowering rates further," the policymaker said in a post on the Chicago Fed's website.

Goolsbee will not be a voter on the FOMC in 2026 but will still participate in meetings.

"Given that inflation has been above our target for four and a half years, further progress on it has been stalled for several months, and almost all the businesspeople and consumers we have spoken to in the district lately identify prices as a main concern, I felt the more prudent course would have been to wait for more information." he wrote in a post on the Chicago Fed website.

 In the CNBC interview, he elaborated on his misgivings about cutting. 

While other Fed officials have expressed concern about the weakening labor market, Goolsbee said data has shown conditions to be "pretty stable."

"I'm pretty optimistic that for 2026 rates will will be able to be a fair bit lower than they are today. But I've just been uncomfortable front loading too many rate cuts," he said in the interview. "We don't take a lot of extra risk, in my view, to just wait to Q1 2026, and make sure that we're back on path at 2% inflation."

The FOMC on Wednesday voted to lower its benchmark rate to a range between 3.5%-3.75%. 

In his post-meeting news conference, Chair Jerome Powell expressed worry that the labor market looks weaker than the headline numbers suggest, saying he expects official nonfarm payroll counts to be lowered and show losses in recent months.

For his part, Goolsbee said he is "one of the most optimistic people" that rates will be lower in the year ahead.

Schmid also released a statement Friday explaining his dissent. He also voted against a rate cut in October.

"Inflation remains too high, the economy shows continued momentum, and the labor market—though cooling—remains largely in balance," Schmid said. "I view the current stance of monetary policy as being only modestly, if at all, restrictive. With this assessment, my preference was to leave the target range for the policy rate unchanged at this week's meeting."

Earlier Friday morning, Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson, who will vote in 2026, said she views policy as "somewhat restrictive" and is more worried about unemployment than inflation.

Also, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said she would prefer policy "on a slightly more restrictive stance" to guard against higher inflation, according to Reuters.

In total, six of the 19 participants at the Fed meeting indicated they opposed the cut, though only two were voters.

Nvidia has told Chinese clients it is evaluating adding production capacity for its powerful H200 AI chips after orders exceeded its current output level, according to two sources briefed on the matter.

The move comes after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the U.S. government would allow Nvidia to export H200 processors, its second-fastest AI chips, to China and collect a 25% fee on such sales.

Demand for the chip from Chinese companies is so strong that Nvidia is leaning toward adding new capacity, one of the sources said. They declined to be named as the discussions are private.

Nvidia did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.

Major Chinese companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, have already reached out to Nvidia this week about purchasing the H200 and are keen to place large orders, Reuters reported on Wednesday.

However, uncertainties remain, as the Chinese government has yet to greenlight any purchase of the H200. Chinese officials convened emergency meetings on Wednesday to discuss the matter and will decide whether to allow it to be shipped into China, said one of the two sources and a third source.

Very limited quantities of H200 chips are currently in production, Reuters reported on Wednesday, as the U.S. AI chip leader is focused on producing its most advanced Blackwell and upcoming Rubin lines.

Supply of H200 chips has been a major concern for Chinese clients and they have reached out to Nvidia seeking clarity on this, sources said.

As part of the briefing provided by Nvidia, the company has also given them guidance on current supply levels, said one of the first two people, without providing a specific number.

The H200 went into mass deployment last year and is the fastest AI chip in Nvidia's previous Hopper generation. The chip is manufactured by TSMC using the Taiwanese firm's 4nm manufacturing process technology.

TSMC and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Chinese companies' strong demand for the H200 stems from the fact that it is easily the most powerful chip they can currently access.

It is about six times more powerful than the H20, a downgraded chip from Nvidia tailored for the Chinese market that was released in late 2023.

Trump's decision on the H200 comes at a time when China is pushing to promote its own domestic AI chip industry. As domestic chip companies have yet to produce products that match the H200, there have been concerns that allowing the H200 into China could stymie the industry.

"Its (H200) compute performance is approximately 2-3 times that of the most advanced domestically produced accelerators," said Nori Chiou, investment director at White Oak Capital Partners.

"I'm already observing many CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) and enterprise customers aggressively placing large orders and lobbying the government to relax restrictions on a conditional basis," he said, adding Chinese AI demand exceeds the capacity of local production.

During the emergency meetings, there was a proposal to require each H200 purchase to be bundled with a certain ratio of domestic chips, one of the first two sources and a third source said.

For Nvidia, adding new capacity is also challenging at a time when it is not only transitioning to Rubin but also competing with companies, including Alphabet's Google, for limited advanced chipmaking capacity from TSMC.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to new closing highs yesterday as investors dove into old-economy and blue-chip stocks. The Nasdaq Composite sat out of the rally, as an 11% drop in shares of Oracle catalyzed the latest wave of worry about artificial intelligence spending.

Here's what to know:

Another day, another CEO departure: Lululemon announced yesterday that CEO Calvin McDonald will step down at the end of January. He will be replaced in the interim by two executives while the Canadian retailer searches for a permanent successor.

Lululemon reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter, but, as CNBC's Gabrielle Fonrouge notes, the company has been underperforming for more than a year. Shares of the athleisure retailer are up more than 9% this morning.

Costco also surpassed Wall Street's forecasts for its first quarter, boosted in part by e-commerce growth. The warehouse club said Black Friday was a record-breaking day for its digital business.

Mickey Mouse, meet ChatGPT. Disney announced a $1 billion equity investment in OpenAI yesterday. Under the agreement, users on OpenAI's Sora video platform will be able to make content that features the entertainment giant's copyrighted material — including more than 200 characters across the Disney universe.

Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC that the deal gives the company "a way in" to AI and will help it further reach younger consumers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said there will be limits on how Disney characters can be used in Sora videos.

Yesterday also marked OpenAI's 10th anniversary. CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos takes you through the company's transformation from a small, nonprofit research lab to the booming business it is today.

After the U.S. seized a tanker off Venezuela's coast, a White House official told CNBC yesterday that Trump is willing to do it again. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also said that the tanker will be taken to a U.S. port where the oil it carried will be seized.

CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco found that the tanker in question, identified as the "Skipper," had hid its location on multiple occasions since last year. Data suggests it has carried sanctioned oil from Iran and Venezuela since 2022.

Mover over, protein. Fiber is increasingly stealing the spotlight as shoppers focus on their gut health.

Data shows 22% of consumers listed high fiber content as a top-three factor when shopping, compared with 17% four years ago. On social media, the kids are calling it "fibermaxxing."

As a result, companies such as Coca-Cola and Nestlé are rolling out fiber-focused drinks, CNBC's Laya Neelakandan reports. PepsiCo also told CNBC that it's planning to launch high-fiber versions of Smartfood and SunChips next year.

Here are some stories we'd recommend making time for this weekend:

— CNBC's Sean Conlon, Jordan Novet, Tasmin Lockwood, Jennifer Elias, Kif Leswing, MacKenzie Sigalos, Gabrielle Fonrouge, Melissa Repko, Ashley Capoot, Kevin Breuninger, Spencer Kimball, Lori Ann LaRocco, Justin Papp, Eamon Javers and Laya Neelakandan contributed to this report.

One of this year's top food trends is facing some tough competition.

Protein captivated consumers and food companies in 2025, but fiber is increasingly stealing the scene as people place an increasing emphasis on promoting gut health.

It's taken hold on social media, where "fibermaxxing" — or the concept of increasing fiber intake through whole foods like fruits and legumes — has seen thousands of posts.

"Fiber is finally getting a spotlight, which is a great thing because it's a nutrient that people need," said Stephanie Mattucci, principal strategist at food research company Mintel.

Currently, 90% of women and 97% of men in the U.S. are not meeting their daily fiber requirements, Mattucci said. For most Americans, that recommended range usually falls somewhere between 25 grams and 38 grams of fiber per day, she added.

But more people are beginning to take notice of those gaps.

According to Mattucci, 22% of consumers in the U.S. said high fiber content was one of their top three important factors when shopping for food — up from just 17% in 2021.

Wall Street's companies are taking note, too. On an earnings call with analysts in October, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said fiber was emerging at the forefront of the company's product goals as it looked ahead to 2026.

"I think fiber will be the next protein," Laguarta said. "Consumers are starting to understand that fiber is the benefit that they need. It's actually a deficiency in U.S. consumers' diets, and that will be elevated."

In February, the company is going a step farther and plans to launch Smartfood Fiber Pop, featuring six grams of fiber per serving, and SunChips Fiber, incorporating fiber variants like whole grains and black beans, Pepsi's chief science officer, Tara Glasgow, told CNBC exclusively.

And there's a reason companies are broadening their offerings. Research firm Datassential found that fiber is on track to be the "next big health trend following on the heels of protein" in its 2026 trends report.

Of the consumers the firm surveyed, 54% said they are interested in foods and beverages that are high in fiber. That number is even higher — reaching 60% — among members of Generation Z, who are pioneering the "fibermaxxing" trend on social media.

And 42% of consumers said they believe the attribute of "high fiber" on a nutrition label of any food or beverage product is important to defining that product as "healthy," according to Datassential.

It's that momentum that landed fiber as one of Whole Foods Market's top trends for 2026.

Watching fiber intake isn't new, experts note, but it's often been associated with older people who require it for health reasons as they age.

"When I think of fiber, I immediately think of my grandfather. Every day, he had his little baggie of All-Bran, and he brought it everywhere he went, probably out of necessity," Mintel's Mattucci said, citing the slowing of digestive tracts as people age.

Still, something has shifted as consumers of all ages have started placing more emphasis on promoting gut health and digestive wellness — and fiber entered the spotlight.

The emphasis on diversity of fiber intake and finding it in everyday whole foods rather than through supplements or powders is part of what's allowing it to find popularity and align with current culture, according to Angela Salas, a senior dietitian at the University of California, Davis.

The two types of fiber — soluble and insoluble — work together to keep people fuller for longer, improve digestion, and lower blood pressure and cholesterol, Salas said. In some ways, fiber could mimic the effects of weight-loss drugs because it takes longer to break down food and therefore sits in the stomach for longer, she said, which could be a factor for its recent popularity.

"These nutrients have always been around and always kind of shifts, I think, from the food industry saying, 'What can we highlight? What do people want to be focusing on so that we can continue to sell the same product, just slightly altered?'" Salas said.

Still, Kate Pelletier, a registered dietitian nutritionist at the University of Michigan Health, said it's important to note that fiber is not sufficient as an alternative to GLP-1 drugs, and a balanced plate is the best way to stay healthy.

Pelletier said fiber's use as a "street sweeper" for the body is likely one of the reasons it's been thrust back into the spotlight.

"There's been a really big shift into more natural plants instead of popping a supplement or using a protein powder," Pelletier said. "We can get the benefit of fiber from thinking about adding more wholesome foods into our diet, versus typical diet culture [which] focuses on taking out X, Y or Z." 

Food and beverage companies are jumping on the momentum, too.

Earlier this year, Coca-Cola launched its prebiotic soda, Simply Pop, with six grams of prebiotic fiber in five flavors to encourage gut health. Nestlé unveiled a new protein shake in June with four grams of prebiotic fiber designed specifically to support the digestive health of adults on GLP-1 medications.

Other companies like Olipop have also entered the prebiotic soda market, boasting recipes that promote gut health, while smaller businesses, like Floura fiber bars and Sola Bagels, have also begun selling fiber-rich products.

Pepsi's Glasgow told CNBC the company is taking every opportunity to explore consumers' newfound interest in fiber. Glasgow said the research and development team's work starts in science and follows trends to keep up with their audience's evolving tastes.

Pepsi already has products on the market that specifically boast high fiber content, like its prebiotic cola and Quaker oatmeal. As consumers start to explore the previously "sleepy little nutrient," Glasgow said, Pepsi is innovating new products across its beverages and food brands.

"We hear it from consumers as well that they're becoming more knowledgeable about nutrition and their nutrition needs," Glasgow said. "And I think that's where the excitement is coming from. I feel it growing."

Glasgow said the company, which already launched successful protein-packed products this year, is moving toward products that incorporate multiple sources of gut-healthy ingredients.

"We saw protein grow in a big way in the last couple years," Glasgow said. "I think [consumers] are then expanding their view, and they realize there's not one ingredient alone that is the silver bullet. It's about getting the right ingredients all together."

For some, fiber isn't just a trend.

Naomi Aganekwu, a 27-year-old content creator, said she started incorporating fiber more intentionally into her diet last year. Now, she makes sure each meal she eats has at least five to 10 grams of fiber through foods like beans, lentils and chia seed puddings.

Aganekwu said she's seeing results from incorporating fiber into her diet, like being satiated after meals and seeing her hormonal acne reduce. And as she's championing fiber, she's seeing the people around her do the same, especially among her generation.

It's become personal for Aganekwu, too, whose father died earlier this year of colon cancer. Some research has shown fiber could prevent colorectal cancer in addition to promoting overall health, according to the National Institutes of Health.

"You don't want to wait until you're 60 or 70 and you're dealing with more diagnoses," she said. "There's a lot that you can do, even just in your everyday choices, down to what you're putting on your plate, that can directly impact your chances or decrease your chances of developing critical diseases."

Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the level of fiber in Smartfood Fiber Pop.

For 16 hours, an AI agent crawled Stanford's public and private computer science networks, digging up security flaws across thousands of devices.

By the end of the test, it had outperformed professional human hackers — and at a fraction of the cost.

A study published Wednesday by Stanford researchers found that their AI agent, ARTERMIS, placed second in an experiment with 10 selected cybersecurity professionals. The researchers said the agent could uncover weaknesses that humans missed and investigate several vulnerabilities at once.

Running ARTEMIS costs about $18 an hour, far below the average salary of about $125,000 a year for a "professional penetration tester," the study said. A more advanced version of the agent costs $59 an hour and still comes in cheaper than hiring a top human expert.

The study was led by three Stanford researchers — Justin Lin, Eliot Jones, and Donovan Jasper — whose work focuses on AI agents, cybersecurity, and machine-learning safety. The team created ARTEMIS after finding that existing AI tools struggled with long, complex security tasks.

The researchers gave ARTEMIS access to the university's network, consisting of about 8,000 devices, including servers, computers, and smart devices. Human testers were asked to put in at least 10 hours of work while ARTEMIS ran 16 hours across two workdays. The comparison with human testers was limited to the AI's first 10 hours.

The study also tested existing agents, which lagged behind most human participants, while ARTEMIS performed "comparable to the strongest participants," the researchers said.

Within the 10-hour window, the agent discovered "nine valid vulnerabilities with an 82% valid submission rate," outperforming nine of 10 human participants, the study said.

Some of the flaws had gone unnoticed by humans, including a weakness on an older server that testers could not access because their browsers refused to load it. ARTEMIS bypassed the issue and broke in using a command-line request.

The AI worked in a way humans could not, the researchers said. Whenever ARTEMIS spotted something "noteworthy" in a scan, it spun up additional "sub-agents" to investigate in the background, allowing it to examine multiple targets simultaneously. Human testers had to do this work one step at a time.

But the AI isn't flawless. ARTEMIS struggled with tasks that required clicking through graphical screens, causing it to overlook a critical vulnerability. It is also more prone to false alarms, mistaking harmless network messages for signs of a successful break-in.

"Because ARTEMIS parses code-like input and output well, it performs better when graphical user interfaces are unavailable," the researchers said.

Advances in AI have lowered the barrier to hacking and disinformation operations, allowing malicious actors to enhance their attacks.

In September, a North Korean hacking group used ChatGPT to generate fake military IDs for phishing emails. A report from Anthropic in August found that North Korean operatives used its Claude model to obtain fraudulent remote jobs at US Fortune 500 tech companies — a tactic that gave them insider access to corporate systems.

The same report also said a Chinese threat actor used Claude to run cyberattacks on Vietnamese telecom, agricultural, and government systems.

"We are seeing many, many attacks," Yuval Fernbach, the chief technology officer of machine learning operations at software supply chain company JFrog, told Business Insider in a report published in April. He added that hackers have been using AI models to extract data, shut systems down, or manipulate a website or tools.

British Airways passengers spent more than nine hours on a transatlantic flight that ended up back where it started.

Wednesday's Flight 243 took off from London Heathrow Airport at 1:22 p.m. and was supposed to land in Mexico City around 11 hours later.

However, five hours into the journey, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner turned around over the Atlantic Ocean.

It had already passed Greenland and was only about 150 miles off the coast of Canada's Nunavut territory, according to data from Flightradar24.

The plane then headed back across the ocean, arriving in London just after 10 p.m.

The airline said in a statement that the diversion was due to an unspecified technical issue.

"The flight landed safely and customers disembarked normally following reports of a technical issue with the aircraft. We've apologised to our customers for the delay, and our teams are working to get their journeys back on track," the statement said.

It can be frustrating for passengers when they're diverted to their origin — a so-called flight to nowhere — but often it's the best course of action.

Returning to Heathrow, BA's main hub, makes it easier for the airline to rebook passengers on alternative flights and fix any problems with the aircraft.

Diverting elsewhere might have also left the plane and crew out of place, disrupting the airline's schedule. Plus, a stopover in Canada or the US may have caused the crew to reach their maximum working hours.

When BA Flight 243 turned around, its closest airport was Iqaluit in northern Canada, less than 300 miles away.

Some flights have diverted to this remote town in the past, but it can ultimately be more disruptive.

Last year, an Air France flight diverted to Iqaluit after a burning smell was detected in the cabin.

The pilots declared an emergency, and a different plane was rerouted to rescue the passengers. It was originally scheduled for another flight, so that had to be canceled. Passengers were then taken to New York, where they were rebooked onto other flights to reach their intended destination of Seattle.

Ultimately, it depends on how urgent the diversion is, since safety is the top concern.

However, if possible, returning to the flight's origin can be the simplest option for both passengers and the airline.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced on Thursday, with both hitting fresh closing records. The Russell 2000 index also ended the session at a new high, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's quarter-point cut on Wednesday.

But if investors analyze Thursday's individual stock movements, they will see not all is well with the AI play yet. Oracle shares plunged nearly 11%, a day after it reported weak quarterly revenue, higher capital expenditure and long-term lease commitments. Oracle's slide dragged down AI-related names such as Nvidia and Micron. 

In extended trading, Broadcom shares fell 4.5%. The chipmaker beat Wall Street's expectations for earnings and revenue, but CEO Hock Tan appeared to have failed to address worries that their largest customer, Google, might eventually make more of its chips in-house. Rising memory prices would also pressure margins, while the company's chip deal with OpenAI might not be binding.

That's why the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.26% despite other major U.S. indexes hitting records. Putting the two together, that means investors are rotating out of tech into other parts of the market. The S&P 500 financials sector, for instance, closed at a fresh record, buoyed by jumps in Visa and Mastercard. 

Even though the AI theme seems to be under scrutiny, other sectors are performing well on the back of a resilient U.S. economy — as signaled by Fed officials on Wednesday — and buoyed by interest-rate cut. So long as nothing throws a spanner in the works, looks like we're all set for a happy holiday season.

New records for U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched fresh highs on Thursday, but the Nasdaq Composite, weighed down by Oracle, underperformed and fell. Asia-Pacific markets advanced Friday, with several major indexes rising at least 1%.

Broadcom's fourth-quarter results beat expectations. The chipmaker also saw its net income nearly double from a year ago, and revealed that Anthropic is its $10 billion customer. But shares slumped in extended trading.

Disney to invest $1 billion in OpenAI. The media giant will also allow Sora, OpenAI's video generator, to use its copyrighted characters, under a $1 billion licensing agreement. "We think this is a good investment for the company," Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC.

Reddit launches legal challenge in Australia. The county introduced a ban on social media for teens under 16, which came into effect on Wednesday. Reddit argues that the law is "invalid on the basis of the implied freedom of political communication."

[PRO] Where will Oracle go from here? Analysts are re-looking their price targets for Oracle stock after the firm released a disappointing and confusing earnings report on Wednesday. 

Trump scared Europe with his national security strategy. That's no bad thing, ex-CIA chief says

White House's new national security strategy gave Europe a scare last week as it warned the region faced "civilizational erasure" and questioned whether it could remain a geopolitical partner for America.

The strategy was, "in a way, going after the Europeans but, frankly, some of the Europeans needed to be gotten after because I watched as four different presidents tried to exhort the Europeans to do more for their own defense and now that's actually happening," David Petraeus, former CIA director and four-star U.S. Army general, told CNBC's Dan Murphy in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.

Thailand's king has approved the dissolution of parliament, deepening political instability in the Southeast Asian nation ahead of an attempt by the U.S. to salvage a fragile ceasefire with Cambodia.

In a royal decree published Friday, King Maha Vajiralongkorn endorsed a request by Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul to dissolve parliament after his minority government failed to reach an agreement with the majority opposition People's Party on proposed constitutional changes. 

Under Thai law, a general election must be held within 45 to 60 days of the decree.  

The opposition had reportedly threatened to file a motion of no confidence after Anutin's government pushed to expand the powers of elected lawmakers under a planned constitution overhaul. 

In a post on Facebook late Thursday, Anutin said he would "return power to the people." 

The political turmoil came as the Southeast Asian nation has been locked in a large-scale spat with Cambodia over long-disputed border claims. Tensions escalated this week as fierce clashes broke out at several locations along the border, which have reportedly killed at least 20 people and left dozens of civilians injured. 

 U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to speak with the leaders of the two countries soon, with Anutin saying the call has been scheduled for 9:20 p.m. Thailand time on Friday (8:20 a.m. Eastern). 

Anutin, who assumed office in September after Paetongtarn Shinawatra was dismissed by Thailand's Constitutional Court for an ethics violation related to the Cambodia dispute, has taken a tougher stance in the border clashes, a move that could fuel nationalist support for his conservative Bhumjaithai party ahead of the election. 

Dissolving parliament would not affect Thailand's military operations along the frontier, Anutin told local media outlets Friday.

Southeast Asia's second-largest economy has grappled with tepid growth this year, expanding just 1.2% in the third quarter as the extended political turmoil, tariff uncertainty with the U.S. and border conflicts weighed on confidence.   

Thailand's benchmark SET Index, ranked among the world's worst-performing equity gauges for 2025, has lost around 10% so far this year. The baht has been relatively resilient, strengthening over 7% this year against the greenback amid weakness in the dollar.

The latest tensions followed the collapse of a fragile ceasefire brokered in July by Trump, who threatened to halt trade talks with the two countries unless they ended the fight. 

Thailand's top diplomat, Sihasak Phuangketkeow, told his U.S. counterpart Marco Rubio Friday that the country was committed to finding a peaceful resolution, but sustainable peace must be backed up by actions, according to Reuters.

"We see a risk of the conflict persisting into early 2026 if the Thai government judges that adopting a harder line could bolster its political standing ahead of the likely early-2026 elections," said Alexandra Hermann, lead economist at Oxford Economics. 

The renewed tensions increased the downside risks to Oxford Economics' 1.6% GDP growth forecast for Thailand in 2026, Hermann added, citing a potential loss of the Cambodian export market, labor-force shortages from an outflow of Cambodian workers and higher U.S. tariffs if trade talks stall.

Before the conflict, Cambodia was Thailand's 11th-largest export market in 2024, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce, accounting for around 3% of total goods exports. 

Bilateral trade has collapsed this year, with border crossings shut. The total value of Thailand's exports to Cambodia plummeted 67% in October from a year earlier, Ministry of Commerce data showed.

Gareth Leather, senior Asia economist at Capital Economics, however, noted that a third of those exports are petroleum, which could easily find an alternative market, but the key risk would be Trump reintroducing higher tariffs on Thailand for breaking the ceasefire he had helped brokered. 

"The biggest risk is that the breakdown of the ceasefire irritates the Trump administration as the truce had been one of the regional conflicts he claimed credit for helping to stabilize," Leather added. 

Meanwhile, a prolonged conflict could risk removing between 500,000 and 1.5 million Cambodian migrant workers from Thailand's domestic labour force of around 40 million, Hermann estimates.

Uber is preparing for a robotaxi surge, and its CEO says one market will drive it.

Dara Khosrowshahi said in an interview with Bloomberg Television published Friday that robotaxis are a "trillion-dollar-plus" opportunity and Asia is a huge growth market for the ride-hailing giant.

"I expect to be in 10-plus markets by next year. And we want those markets to be in the Asia-Pacific region as well," Khosrowshahi said. Uber has self-driving vehicles in the US and the Middle East.

Analysts have long touted autonomous mobility as one of the biggest bets in the transportation industry. In 2023, McKinsey estimated that if robotaxis and roboshuttles scale, the shared-mobility market could reach $1 trillion by 2030.

Khosrowshahi said Japan has "great potential" for its robotaxi push, despite being behind in regulation.

"With an aging population, there's a real need for transportation, not just in the large cities but in the rural areas," he added. He also pointed to Hong Kong and Australia as potential key markets for its robotaxi services.

Khosrowshahi said Uber now works with more than 20 autonomous-vehicle partners — including China's Baidu, WeRide, and Pony.ai, as well as Waymo in the US.

"We will have access to autonomous technologies in the large cities and markets that really count," he added.

With a market that large, Khosrowshahi said autonomous driving is unlikely to be a "winner-take-all" industry.

"It's an exciting technology, but there are many players getting to the finish line," he said.

"We just have to make sure that the players that we work with are safe and that again, we're working with the regulators in a constructive manner," he added.

Uber has been leaning hard into autonomous driving. During its third-quarter earnings call in November, Khosrowshahi said the company is already seeing signs that robotaxis can boost demand.

"The biggest scale operations that we've got are with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta," Khosrowshahi said. "And what we are seeing is that those markets are growing faster than other US markets," he added.

Other industry leaders have also been hyping the sector.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly said that robotaxis will power the company's growth. In May, Musk said in an interview with CNBC that Tesla would hit one million self-driving cars by the end of next year, a claim he also made in 2019 that did not materialize.

The path to profitability remains murky. HSBC analysts warned in July that the robotaxi market has been "widely overestimated," and said it could be years before fleets make real money.

Even the most advanced players are burning cash. Alphabet's "Other Bets" division — which includes Waymo, as well as other subsidiaries — lost $1.42 billion in the third quarter.

The cost of an autonomous driving vehicle is steep. Analysts estimate that each Waymo vehicle costs about $150,000 to produce. The high costs have squeezed some companies out of the robotaxi market, including Ford and General Motors.

The White House's new national security strategy gave Europe a scare last week as it warned the region faced "civilizational erasure" and questioned whether it could remain a geopolitical partner for America. 

The document shocked allies on the continent as it criticized its leaders as "weak" and slammed the region's stance on immigration, democracy, freedom of speech, while adding its waning economic and military power was waning.

"It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies," it said, adding that the region suffered from a lack of self-confidence. The document also called for the U.S. to re-establish "strategic stability" with Russia, despite its war against Ukraine.

But David Petraeus, the former CIA Director and four-star US Army general, told CNBC it was no bad thing for European nations to get a wake-up call to look after their defense and security. 

The strategy was, "in a way, going after the Europeans but, frankly, some of the Europeans needed to be gotten after because I watched as four different presidents tried to exhort the Europeans to do more for their own defence and now that's actually happening," he told CNBC's Dan Murphy in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.

Petraeus said President Donald Trump had been "very, very substantial" in getting the Europeans to spend more on defense.

"He's gotten them to commit to what they should have done years ago," Petraeus said. He pointed to European members of NATO agreeing earlier this year to increase defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, after sustained pressure from the Trump administration.

Petraeus' comments come as diplomatic efforts continue to end the war in Ukraine, with U.S. officials holding talks regarding peace proposals with Russian and Ukrainian counterparts in recent weeks. 

Both Russia and Ukraine, and its European allies, have promoted different peace plans with contradictory demands and "red lines." The biggest obstacles to peace remain disagreements over post-war security guarantees for Ukraine and Russian demands that Kyiv cede the eastern region of Donbas.

Washington is reportedly urging both sides to come to an agreement before Christmas, but there is also skepticism that this is possible. Russia, meanwhile, appears to be enjoying the increasing pressure that Europe and Ukraine are coming under from Washington.

Petraeus said he had little faith that Russia could compromise over a peace plan with Putin showing little sign of compromise over war objectives such as territorial control, regime change, and a "demilitarized" Ukraine with no prospect of NATO membership.

"I'm encouraged that there is an effort spurred by the United States and backed by President Trump, personally, in many respects, and his direct negotiators to try to bring the war to an end. I'm not encouraged by Moscow's response," Petraeus said. 

"Vladimir Putin just continues to reiterate that his goals are the maximalist objectives he's held all along, which essentially denies independence to Ukraine. He wants to get a pro-Russian president to replace President Zelenskyy ... He wants to demilitarize Ukraine [and] ... he wants to be given ground that is in the most fortified area of Ukraine," he added.

 Putin "is not going to budge," Petraeus added.

Ukraine's European allies have been looking at ways to continue funding its war against Russia, as well as considering its eventual post-war reconstruction, which is likely to cost over $500 billion, according to the United Nations, and Russian reparations.

The EU is believed to be close to a deal to mobilize a sizable chunk of the estimated 210 billion euros (around $244 billion) worth of Russian sovereign assets currently frozen in European financial institutions. 

There are, however, concerns over the legal ramifications and the potential retaliation from Moscow; Russia's security council chief warned last week that using Russian assets would be tantamount to a justification for war.

Petraeus said if the EU did go ahead with using frozen Russian reserves, it would be a "game changer."

"We've heard a lot of game changers before. I've never bought into those. But ... $200 billion or even 100 billion euros of money for Ukraine would be a game changer. It solves their fiscal and economic problems for a couple of years," he said.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced on Thursday, with both hitting fresh closing records. The Russell 2000 index also ended the session at a new high, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's quarter-point cut on Wednesday.

But if investors analyze Thursday's individual stock movements, they will see not all is well with the AI play yet. Oracle shares plunged nearly 11% after reporting on Wednesday weak quarterly revenue, dragging down AI-related names such as Nvidia and Micron. 

In extended trading, Broadcom shares fell 4.5%. The chipmaker beat Wall Street's expectations for earnings and revenue, but CEO Hock Tan appeared to have failed to address worries that their largest customer, Google, might eventually make more of its chips in-house. Rising memory prices would also pressure margins, while the company's chip deal with OpenAI might not be binding.

That's why the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.26% despite other major U.S. indexes hitting records. Putting the two together, that means investors are rotating out of tech into other parts of the market. The S&P 500 financials sector, for instance, closed at a fresh record, buoyed by jumps in Visa and Mastercard. 

Even though the AI theme seems to be under scrutiny, other sectors are performing well on the back of a resilient U.S. economy — as signaled by Fed officials on Wednesday — and buoyed by interest-rate cut. So long as nothing throws a spanner in the works, looks like we're all set for a happy holiday season.

— CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos contributed to this report.

New records for U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched fresh highs on Thursday, but the Nasdaq Composite, weighed down by Oracle, underperformed and fell. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed 0.5% higher.  

Disney to invest $1 billion in OpenAI. The media giant will also allow Sora, OpenAI's video generator, to use its copyrighted characters, under a $1 billion licensing agreement. "We think this is a good investment for the company," Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC.

SpaceX will launch IPO in 2026. Elon Musk confirmed the news in a post on X, which follows multiple articles last week about the firm's plans to go public. Musk said over the weekend that reports of SpaceX's $800 billion valuation were "not accurate." 

Broadcom's fourth-quarter results beat expectations. The chipmaker also saw its net income nearly double from a year ago, and issued a strong forecast for the current quarter on the back of AI demand. But shares slumped in extended trading.

[PRO] Where will Oracle go? Analysts are re-looking their price targets for Oracle stock after the firm released a disappointing and confusing earnings report on Wednesday. 

India's $3.3 trillion opportunity for global fund houses

This year, the world's largest fund house, BlackRock, launched multiple mutual fund schemes in India through Jio BlackRock, marking the U.S. firm's reentry after its exit in 2018. The world's fourth largest asset manager, State Street, is reportedly looking to buy a stake in an Indian fund house.

Accelerating financialization of Indian household savings is driving flows: as more retail investors participate in capital markets, the opportunities for asset managers to handle those funds are ballooning.

Bitcoin signage in Times Square in New York.

Bitcoin continues to drift toward the lower bound of its recent trading range with any increase in the price seen being met by selling from investors who purchased the largest cryptocurrency near the all-time high reached in early October. 

Crypto analytics firm Glassnode said various metrics point to a “mild bearish phase,” defined by modest capital inflows outweighed by steady selling pressure from larger holders.  With prices stuck in a “weak but bounded range,” the firm noted, time itself becomes a negative force as unrealized losses accumulate. Relative unrealized losses jumped to 4.4%, the highest in nearly two years after spending most of that period below 2%, signaling a transition from euphoria to “elevated stress and uncertainty.”

Central bank digital currencies are a far safer option than stablecoins, which pose greater risks than their purported benefits, according to Reserve Bank of India deputy governor T. Rabi Sankar.

“Do stablecoins serve a purpose? It seems to me that they do not; at any rate, they do not serve a purpose that cannot be served better by fiat money,” Sankar said at the Mint Annual BFSI Conclave 2025. Stablecoins fail the fundamental tests that define modern money and pose risks far greater than the benefits their proponents claim, he said.

Central bank digital currency (CBDC) is backed by the fiat currency of a country, issued by regulators. Stablecoins are private tokens that are pegged to a currency or another asset.

Calling stablecoins inherently unstable, Sankar said that India's financial system already has fast, low-cost, and robust digital rails such as Unified Payments Interface (UPI), real-time gross settlement (RTGS) and national electronic funds transfer (NEFT), leaving “little justification” for integrating private digital currencies into the domestic ecosystem.

While stablecoins are often promoted as tools for faster cross-border transfers or vehicles to expand financial inclusion, Sankar countered these claims, saying that in reality, stablecoins continue to be used predominantly within the crypto market as instruments for leverage and speculation, rather than as everyday transactional currency.

“To sum up, many of these benefits are neither unique to stablecoins nor have stablecoins yet established any of the benefits their proponents claim,” he said. “By their very nature, they are in many ways inferior to available forms of money in achieving those benefits.”

On the other hand, the risks they introduce to financial stability and broader macro-financial stability are extremely serious.

He also warned that widespread adoption of stablecoins, whether denominated in domestic or foreign currency, could trigger currency substitution, weaken India's monetary policy transmission, disrupt capital account management, disintermediate banks and increase systemic vulnerabilities.

The risk of losing sovereign seigniorage to private issuers, particularly those operating offshore, is a leakage of public revenue with significant long-term implications.

Sankar encouraged the usage of CBDCs, calling them a technologically advanced yet safe public alternative that preserves monetary sovereignty.

CBDCs, he said, combine the advantages of tokenised digital money, programming capability, atomic settlement, lower cross-border frictions, while still retaining the essential attributes of sovereign currency with fiat backing, trust and singleness.

Encouraging CBDC adoption domestically, he said, would require making digital rupee usage ‘functionally similar to cash,' including offering tiered anonymity for small-value transactions.

On the international front, he also said that bilateral and multilateral CBDC corridors could deliver the same cross-border efficiency stablecoins promise, without destabilizing national financial systems.

This fits alongside India's existing push to interlink fast payment systems such as Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with partner jurisdictions, a move he said reduces any need for private alternatives.

Sankar, however, acknowledged privacy concerns associated with programmable CBDC use cases, particularly those linked to targeted benefits such as subsidies.

A programmable CBDC is a digital form of a country's money with built-in rules, allowing it to be automatically controlled for specific uses, locations, merchants, or expiry dates, enabling smart contracts for targeted subsidies, programs, or automated escrow. For example, government funds could be programmed to only buy specific goods like fertilizer, ensuring they reach the intended purpose efficiently.

According to Sankar, cash-like anonymity is “unavoidable” if the digital rupee is to achieve widespread adoption. However, achieving such anonymity in a digital framework remains challenging.

“...digital transactions always leave a footprint. It is difficult to anonymize transactions. It is possible. There are technologies which make that possible. But more importantly, we would require a legal backing. Even if it is possible to wipe out a transaction technologically, I think, at least most public institutions would not do that unless there is a legal backing to such anonymity,” Sankar said at the fireside chat.

It is one of the main concerns in the US and a few other countries, he said. “We will have to build towards that anonymity to create the unique case for CBDCs for domestic use.”

He called wholesale CBDC transactions helpful, especially in cross-border payments as they simply save the huge amount of capital that banks employ in managing the settlement risk. However, there is a need for other countries to adopt CBDCs as well.

Sankar also linked the global momentum around CBDCs to the rising prominence of stablecoins, which he described as an increasingly influential force over the past year.

“I think it is very important for CBDCs to exist across countries and connected to each other, so that you can actually show a use case which is superior to stablecoins,” he added.

Five digital asset firms have received conditional approvals Friday to become federally chartered trust banks by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) in a major step to bring U.S. dollar stablecoin issuers under federal regulatory oversight.

Blockchain firm Ripple and Circle's (CRCL) First National Digital Currency Bank are on the list, which also includes BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets and Paxos, each having previously operated under state charters that will be converted to conditional federal status.

The OCC is the only federal agency that charters banks and trusts, and this surge in approvals potentially marks a major turning point in crypto banking. Since the arrival of President Donald Trump's administration, the regulator — run by his appointee, Jonathan Gould — has shifted from a crypto-resistant stance to a friendly approach.

"The OCC will continue to provide a path for both traditional and innovative approaches to financial services to ensure the federal banking system keeps pace with the evolution of finance and supports a modern economy," Gould said in a statement. 

If the newly approved trust banks can meet agency expectations, they'll permanently join about 60 regulated institutions with such charters, which allow for fiduciary activities including custody. National trust banks — a category that includes the first chartered crypto bank, Anchorage Digital — have certain limits in their business activities, so they don't offer the same deposit and lending capabilities as the OCC's larger pool of national banks.

Ripple chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse said in an X post that the OCC's move is "huge news," a "massive step" for the firm's $1.3 billion RLUSD$0.9999 stablecoin. He also slammed the bank lobby for their "anti-competitive tactics."

"You've complained that crypto isn't playing by the same rules, but here's the crypto industry — directly under the OCC's supervision and standards — prioritizing compliance, trust and innovation to the benefit of consumers," Garlinghouse said. "What are you so afraid of?"

Circle, the issuer of the $78 billion stablecoin USDC$0.9998, said in a press release that the national trust bank charter would "enhance the safety and regulatory oversight of the USDC Reserve, while enabling Circle to offer fiduciary digital asset custody and related services to institutional customers."

Paxos, the company behind the $3.8 billion PYUSD$0.9998 and the consortium-backed, $1.4 billion Global Dollar token (USDG), said that its federally regulated platform would "allow businesses to issue, custody, trade and settle digital assets with clarity and confidence." Notably, Paxos has been operating under a New York Department of Financial Service (NYDFS) charter since 2015, and first applied for federal charter in 2020.

Mike Belshe, CEO of BitGo, said that the development "marks an official end to the war on crypto and the beginning of the next era of innovation in banking," adding that "we've entered the era of regulatory integration, and improvements will continue to happen fast." BitGo is the issuer behind USD1 (USD1), the digital dollar token of World Liberty Financial, a crypto project with close ties to the Trump family.

The crypto sector has long struggled with banking in the U.S., including a prolonged fight against regulators and large institutions that the industry accused of systemically debanking their companies and executives. The Trump administration has sought to reverse any policies and banking activity that adversely targeted crypto firms. 

The OCC issued a report on Thursday about debanking, arguing that all nine of the largest banks were involved and that those guilty of severing banking ties to legal business customers could face punishment.

Artificial intelligence-focused stocks are coming under pressure on Friday, dragging tech-related equities and bitcoin BTC$92,441.66 lower during the early U.S. session.

Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), the ninth largest asset by market cap, tumbled 10% despite strong earnings as its outlook disappointed investors' lofty expectations.

The Nasdaq index was down over 1% in the first hour of the session. Adding that to Oracle's 10% slump on Thursday and a further 3% decline on Friday, as investor concerns are mounting that the red-hot AI theme that fueled much of this year's stock market gains might be fizzling out.

Bitcoin, trading around $92,500 overnight, plunged 2% following the U.S. stock market open to $89,800 recently, extending the choppy action through the week. A consistent theme this week has been bitcoin setting intraday lows during U.S. trading hours, a pattern that has led to the filing of the proposed AfterDark Hours ETF. 

Bitcoin miners, some of which have been increasingly leaning into AI for diversification, showed a similar reaction to Broadcom's miss. Hut 8 (HUT) fell more than 5%. Iren (RIEN) and Riot (RIOT) dropped about 4%, while Cipher(CIFR) and Iren (IREN) both were down about 2% over the past day. 

Crypto-related stocks also fell alongside the Nasdaq. Robinhood (HOOD) and Strategy (MSTR) were both down nearly 2%. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) was hit hard and fell more than 5%. Coinbase (COIN) dropped slightly.

Markets had already been under pressure after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's speech on Wednesday, which hinted at a possible rate cut pause in January. As a result, markets now expect only two rate cuts in 2026 instead of three. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who was against a December rate cut, however, said he expects more in 2026 than the current median projection. 

Several other members of the Federal Reserve will also speak over the course of today as the central bank's blackout period following its December meeting on Wednesday has ended. Traders will be looking for any guidance on whether Fed officials agree with Powell on potentially holding rates steady in January.

Milk Mocha has grown beyond its familiar cartoon identity and is now shaping a community-owned digital ecosystem powered by the $HUGS token. What separates it from many best crypto presales is the role given to its supporters. Token holders are not passive participants. They actively guide the project through on-chain governance.

At the current presale stage, 1 $HUGS is priced at $0.0004023 in Stage 6, with $227k already raised. As interest builds, attention is not only on price movement but on influence. Through the Milk Mocha DAO, decisions about NFTs, treasury use, and charitable action sit with the community. The roadmap is not dictated from the top. It is shaped collectively, which is why this presale continues to attract long-term minded participants.

Many projects focus on selling tokens first and explaining governance later. Milk Mocha takes the opposite route. It invites participants to help build from the start. The HugVotes system allows anyone who stakes $HUGS to submit ideas, discuss proposals, and vote on outcomes. This transforms the presale from a transaction into shared ownership.

Supporters are not buying based on short-term movement. They are securing a voice. Decisions range from approving new utilities to shaping future NFT collections. This shift from observer to contributor is why Milk Mocha often appears in discussions around best crypto presales. Influence is earned through commitment, not noise. When users see their votes matter, trust grows, and that trust turns into continued staking and engagement.

Governance power within Milk Mocha follows a clear rule. Influence is tied to staking. Those who commit tokens for the long term carry more weight in decisions. This encourages alignment between governance and sustainability rather than quick exits. HugVotes allow the community to guide NFT themes, allocate event budgets, and approve partnerships.

Every step is visible and permanent. There is no central override and no hidden process. Voting power scales with staked tokens, which rewards consistency and belief in the project. Instead of relying on promises, Milk Mocha offers direct participation, reinforcing its position among best crypto presales built on accountability.

Milk Mocha extends governance beyond the ecosystem itself. Through the Charity Pool, token holders vote on how funds are donated to real-world causes. These decisions are not made behind closed doors. They are proposed, debated, and approved through HugVotes, with all transactions recorded on-chain.

Whether the cause supports animal welfare, education, or emergency relief, every donation requires community approval. This structure adds transparency rarely seen in digital fundraising. The emotional connection many already have with Milk and Mocha strengthens participation here.



Supporters are not just holding a token. They are directing meaningful action. This blend of financial utility and social impact is another reason Milk Mocha is frequently listed among best crypto presales with substance behind the narrative.

Presale buyers are not joining simply to accumulate tokens. They want influence. Early supporters understand that staking $HUGS now increases their say in future decisions. This desire for involvement is a key driver behind Milk Mocha's presale activity.



This model turns early participation into a strategic advantage. Instead of waiting for outcomes, buyers help shape them. That approach explains why presale engagement remains strong. People are not funding someone else's plan. They are building a system they can influence, protect, and grow.

Milk Mocha shows that digital ownership can extend beyond holding tokens. Through staking, HugVotes, and community-led governance, it delivers real control to its supporters. This is why it continues to rank among meaningful best crypto presales, not just for potential upside, but for shared responsibility.

The DAO plays an active role in decisions that matter, from spending and NFTs to charitable giving. Early participants are more than buyers. They are voters, builders, and contributors. In a space where trust is often requested, Milk Mocha places that trust directly in the hands of its community and allows them to lead.

For years, the biggest bitcoin obstacle was regulators, who had control over how the cryptocurrency was used, taxed and tracked. Now the biggest threat may be physics. The fast rise of quantum computing, which works on a subatomic level using exotic technologies, threatens to upend the cryptography that secures all blockchain-based digital assets. And the clock may already be ticking.…

Ops, si è verificato un problema

This story was originally published on Banking Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Banking Dive newsletter. 

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency conditionally approved five digital asset firms, including Circle, Ripple and Paxos, for de novo national trust bank charters, the regulator announced Friday.

Circle's First National Digital Currency Bank and Ripple National Trust Bank were conditionally approved for national trust charters, while Paxos Trust Co., BitGo Bank & Trust and Fidelity Digital Assets' state charters will be converted to national ones.

“Paxos is now entering a new phase of regulatory supervision and we're excited to power a platform subject to federal oversight and supervision,” CEO Charles Cascarilla said in a statement Friday. “This will enable customers to innovate, incubate and grow digital asset businesses safely and seamlessly within the US.”

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the charter move “deepens” his firm's “longstanding commitment to the highest standards of trust and compliance.

“This important milestone will give the world's leading institutions greater clarity and confidence to build on Circle's platform as stablecoins and blockchain technology move rapidly into the mainstream,” Allaire said in a statement Friday. “As a public company, we're focused on operating under rigorous regulatory oversight and building the infrastructure that allows digital dollars like USDC to become a core part of global finance.”

The OCC, for its part, said it “applied the same rigorous review and standards it applies to all charter applications.”

“New entrants into the federal banking sector are good for consumers, the banking industry and the economy,” Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gould said in a statement. “They provide access to new products, services and sources of credit to consumers, and ensure a dynamic, competitive and diverse banking system.”

In a speech Monday to the Blockchain Association, Gould said the OCC has allowed national trusts to engage in nonfiduciary custody activity for decades, adding that prohibiting them from engaging in such activities would “not only threaten to undermine the dynamic and evolving nature of the federal banking system but would also disrupt well over a trillion dollars in traditional activities of existing national trust banks.”

“Custody and safekeeping services have been happening electronically for decades,” Gould said Monday. “There is simply no justification for considering digital assets differently.”

The five firms will join the ranks of 60 already-established national trust banks. Not every high-profile cryptocurrency-related charter application saw approval, though. Coinbase's application and that of Stripe subsidiary Bridge were not among those approved Friday.

Gould and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Acting Chair Travis Hill have vocally advocated for new bank charters.

Anchorage Digital, previously the only other crypto firm to receive OCC approval for a national trust bank, lauded its new contemporaries.

“Anchorage Digital Bank became the first federally chartered crypto bank in January 2021— and we never wanted to be the last. This is long overdue,” CEO Nathan McCauley said in a release seen by Banking Dive. “With a nearly five-year head start — and immense investment in compliance along the way — Anchorage Digital Bank has pioneered a path for others to follow.”

Not everyone is as enthused over the charter news. Greg Baer, CEO of the Bank Policy Institute, a trade group, said the development “leaves substantial unanswered questions … chiefly, whether the requirements the OCC has outlined for the applicants are appropriately tailored to the activities and risks in which the trust will engage.”

“We hope the OCC will share more details about these applications so the public can better understand the rationale behind today's decision,” Baer said.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse decried “anti-innovation bank lobbyists” in his statement Friday. 

“The conditional approval of our trust bank charter represents a massive step forward –setting the highest standard for stablecoin compliance with both federal and state oversight … ensuring [the firm's token] is the most transparent and responsibly managed stablecoin in the market today,” Garlinghouse said.

Key Takeaways

The Depository Trust Company (DTC) has received approval to pilot a securities tokenization scheme.

The DTC will now establish standards that could define the future of tokenization.

Participants in the tokenization pilot are expected to receive a list of approved blockchains.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has granted the Depositary Trust and Clearing Company (DTCC) approval to develop a securities tokenization program.

The Depository Trust Company, a DTCC subsidiary, is now tasked with developing standards to record the ownership of stocks, ETFs, and Treasuries on the blockchain.

Some of the first tokenized securities in the U.S. include money market funds like Franklin Templeton's FOBXX and BlackRock's BUIDL.

Although these are real, regulated products, they exist outside of DTCC clearing and settlement.

Up until now, blockchain-powered issuance and settlement have existed as parallel rails that remain subordinate to the core financial infrastructure.

With a no-action letter from the SEC, the DTCC will move forward with a pilot tokenization scheme expected to launch in the second half of 2026.

As the United States' primary central securities depository, pretty much every transfer of U.S. equities, corporate bonds, or notes runs through the DTCC, which processed transactions worth $3 quadrillion in 2023.

When it sets standards, they have implications for capital markets around the world.

In other words, the future of securities tokenization—questions like which blockchains will be approved and what kind of information tokens must be inscribed with—now rests with the DTC.

Rather than prescribing a particular blockchain, the SEC has tasked the DTC with defining objective technology standards that platforms must meet.

In practice, however, the organization will maintain a list of approved blockchains that meet its criteria.

Participants in the tokenization pilot are expected to receive this list in the coming months.

                            Sei Giga Could Make Blockchain as Fast as the Internet — Here's How It Works                        

As blockchain technology continues to evolve, speed and scalability remain its biggest challenges. The team behind the Sei Network believes it has found the next major leap forward – Sei Giga, an upgrade that promises to make blockchain as fast and responsive as the internet itself.

To understand what makes Sei Giga different, CCN spoke to Jayendra Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs, who shared insights into how this new version reimagines blockchain performance from the ground up.

Sei Giga is the next major upgrade  of the Sei blockchain, a layer-1 blockchain built to handle huge numbers of transactions extremely quickly while still being compatible with Ethereum's smart contracts. It's designed to solve the biggest performance limits of traditional blockchains by rethinking how blocks are created, ordered, and executed. 

Next generation blockchains like Sei Giga will create types of MEV that are completely new, and poorly understood.

Traditional blockchains like Ethereum are secure and decentralized, but they struggle with:

Sei Giga tackles all of these by redesigning three main parts of a blockchain:

By upgrading these, Sei Giga aims to match Web2-like performance while keeping decentralization and security intact. 

“Sei Giga fundamentally reimagines the Sei blockchain as it is today,” said Jog. “With +200k TPS, 400-ms finality, and an MEV-resistant architecture, Sei Giga will mark the next quantum leap in how blocks are built,” Jog noted.

This speed boost, he explained, is made possible by a redesigned consensus mechanism and new layers for execution and storage, all working together to deliver “the speed and capacity to provide Web2-like UX, without sacrificing decentralization.”

In other words, Sei Giga isn't just a faster version of Sei, it's a full architectural overhaul aimed at matching the performance of traditional internet applications.

Sei Giga's scalability comes down to two key innovations.

“There are essentially two ways Sei Giga achieves this,” Jog explained. “Multiple validators propose blocks simultaneously, and the computationally burdensome task of transaction execution happens after blocks are ordered.”

This separation between ordering and execution allows Sei to handle vast numbers of transactions in parallel. It's a bit like a restaurant kitchen that takes orders from many customers at once, then organizes and prepares them efficiently without slowing down service.

When asked whether Sei's lightning-fast 400ms finality was already available on the main network, Jog confirmed:

“Yes, Sei finality today is 400ms, approximately +30x faster than Ethereum finality. The breakthrough of Sei Giga will be achieving 5 gigagas throughput without sacrificing the speed needed to provide the performance for Web2-like apps.”

That means transactions confirm almost instantly, a massive advantage for financial apps, games, and trading platforms where every millisecond matters.

Speed often comes at the cost of complexity, but Sei Giga avoids this trade-off.

“The Giga upgrade has been designed to dramatically increase chain performance without increasing hardware requirements for validators,” Jog said.

“Giga will introduce new node types, but will allow existing validators to continue with the same hardware used for the current network.” This ensures the system remains accessible and decentralized, even as it scales up.

One common issue on blockchains is what happens when multiple users interact with the same smart contract at once. Jog explained how Sei Giga addresses this:

“Transactions requiring access to the same storage slots is an edge case that affects every EVM chain, causing slight performance degradation when it occurs,” he said.

“Because the Giga upgrade decouples consensus and execution, Sei's consensus will be unaffected by this edge case, unlike other EVM chains.”

Sei Labs is also developing solutions like access lists and native compilation of hot contracts, which could further improve performance, not just for Sei, but for the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

For developers, Sei Giga is designed to be backward compatible.

“Apps that are live on Sei won't need to migrate to Sei Giga once it's on mainnet,” Jog explained. “The network will upgrade seamlessly while retaining compatibility with apps on the network. Blue chip launch partners will be announced as we get closer to the full launch.”

That means developers and users alike can expect a smooth transition without needing to rewrite or re-deploy their apps.

“Sei is bytecode compatible with Ethereum's EVM up to the recent Fusaka upgrade, excluding EIP-4844 as Sei doesn't use blobs for storing transaction data,” Jog said.

“Bytecode compatibility is important because it means developers don't need to recompile or re-audit their code. With only a few small changes to account for gas limits and gas token references, developers can copy, paste, and deploy.”

This makes Sei Giga an inviting option for Ethereum developers looking for higher performance without giving up EVM familiarity.

Jog also revealed that Sei Labs will be launching a $5 million Global Mobile Innovation Program to encourage development across mobile and consumer devices.

“We work closely with developers to provide them with all the documentation, tooling, and devnet/testnet needed to deploy on Sei for the first time,” he added.

This kind of early ecosystem support is designed to help developers build and test applications that take full advantage of Sei Giga's speed and scalability.

As networks grow, maintaining decentralization becomes harder. Jog explained that Sei Giga's new design keeps this balance intact:

“Sei Giga improves the algorithm used for block proposing and also introduces new node types, ensuring validator nodes only need to maintain a limited history of the chain's state,” he said.

“While hardware requirements for validators are unlikely to change, overall Sei Giga will be as decentralized as it is today.”

For everyday users, Sei Giga promises a lightning-fast, MEV-resistant chain with the capacity and stability needed for real-world applications.

According to Jog, the end result is a network capable of delivering the kind of seamless, near-instant user experience people are used to from traditional apps and websites.

Sei's ambitions extend beyond gaming or DeFi.

“We've designed Sei to support applications across Web3 use cases,” Jog said, “and you'll see applications deployed across DeFi, gaming, AI, and everywhere blockchain technology improves our lives online.”

He summarized Sei Labs' long-term goal clearly:

“Sei was purpose-built to be the infrastructure for the internet of money. Internet native financial institutions need internet native financial infrastructure. With Sei Giga we want to build the first next-generation blockchain: a blockchain that meets Wall Street's need for high throughput and fast finality, on the blockchain.”

Oops, something went wrong

The crypto market remained choppy on Friday with bitcoin (BTC) having spent the past seven days pinned between $88,000 and $94,000 in a week dominated by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points.

Interest-rate reductions are typically seen as bullish catalysts for risk assets like bitcoin as investors are less incentivized to hold fiat currencies like the dollar, thus searching for returns elsewhere.

But neither bitcoin nor the broader crypto market behaved as expected, with BTC tumbling to below $90,000 after the cut before rising back to the upper side of the range. The CoinDesk 20 Index is up 0.57% since midnight UTC.

The altcoin market remains relatively weak as several tokens including jupiter (JUP), kaspa (KAS) and quant (QNT) have faced double-digit declines this week.

BTC's 30-day implied volatility, represented by Volmex's BVIV index, continues to decline, falling to its lowest since Nov. 10. Traders seem to be anticipating choppy price action in final weeks of 2025.

The ether volatility index has dropped to the lowest since late October.

On Deribit, BTC and ETH put bias remains intact across all time frames.

Block flows featured a bias for calendar spreads in BTC and ETH.

In futures market, ZEC's open interest (OI) has surged by 16% to 2.28 million ZEC, nearing the record high of 2.32 million ZEC.

HYPE, SUI and SOL have also seen notable increases in OI over 24 hours, indicating renewed capital inflows. OI has held largely flat in BTC and ETH.

Privacy coins continue to be the top performers of the altcoin market as zcash (ZEC) led the way with a 9% gain over the past 24 hours.

There were also notable intraday recoveries for AAVE, HYPE and LIDO, but performance over the past week remains muted.

CoinMarketCap's "altcoin season" indicator is now at a cycle low of 16/100, a sign that traders are declining to turn to the speculative altcoin market.

The chronic underperformance is demonstrated by CoinDesk's Memecoin Index (CDMEME), which is down by 59% year-to-date in contrast to the CoinDesk 10 (CD10, which has lost 7.3%.

The demise of the memecoin market, once the bedrock of hype-driven crypto speculation, indicates a change in investor profile behavior over the past year.

While the market used to be dominated by retail investors, the rise of ETFs and digital asset treasury (DAT) companies has knocked that demand to one side; replacing it with slow and steady price action.

Colle AI (COLLE), the multichain AI-powered NFT creation platform, announced the rollout of its Signature Pattern Generator, an intelligent automation system designed to dramatically speed up high-volume NFT variant production. The new engine enables creators, brands, and studios to generate large sets of stylistically consistent visual variations in seconds, removing the bottlenecks traditionally associated with scaling NFT collections across multiple chains.

The Signature Pattern Generator identifies core stylistic anchors within a creator's initial concept—such as motif structure, color identity, stroke behavior, and texture geometry—and automatically generates coherent variations derived from those foundations. This creates a unified visual language across hundreds or even thousands of outputs while preserving artistic intent. By eliminating repetitive manual adjustments, the system empowers creators to expand ideas rapidly and maintain quality across extensive NFT drops.

Fully integrated with Colle AI's multichain publishing architecture, the generator prepares every variant with chain-aware formatting and metadata optimization for ecosystems including Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, BNB Chain, and the XRP Ledger. As batches scale, the system automatically maintains consistency, structural integrity, and on-chain readiness, ensuring that creators can transition seamlessly from high-speed generation to deployment. “Pattern-based variation is essential for large-scale NFT creation,” said J. King Kasr, Chief Scientist at KaJ Labs. “The Signature Pattern Generator gives creators a powerful engine for producing thematic consistency at scale, without compromising artistic identity or multichain reliability.”

The launch of the Signature Pattern Generator expands Colle AI's growing suite of intelligent creative tools designed to accelerate high-volume, high-fidelity digital production. With this addition, Colle AI continues to push the boundaries of rapid ideation, scalable design, and frictionless multichain publishing—supporting a new generation of creators building at speed across Web3.

The Bank of Canada has shelved plans for a central bank digital currency, likely under pressure from banking institutions worried about their profit margins.Keito Newman/The Globe and Mail

Claude Lavoie is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. He was director-general of economic studies and policy analysis at the Department of Finance from 2008 to 2023.

Ottawa's new framework for regulating stablecoins has cryptocurrency advocates celebrating. 

The federal legislation will allow companies to issue loonie-backed stablecoins – cryptocurrency pegged to the Canadian dollar. Tetra Digital, a financial services group, plans to launch one early next year. 

The government's move comes after the United States passed the GENIUS Act, raising concerns that Canada might fall behind in the digital currency race.

But Ottawa missed a much better opportunity: introducing a central bank digital currency that would make Canada's banking system more inclusive, stable and efficient. Yet the Bank of Canada has shelved plans for a CBDC, likely under pressure from banking institutions worried about their profit margins.

Given that nearly 90 per cent of transactions already happen electronically through e-transfers, credit cards and debit cards, why bother with stablecoins?

Ottawa's new stablecoin framework a key step toward monetary sovereignty, advocates say

The answer lies in efficiency. Stablecoin transactions don't need to pass through multiple domestic and foreign institutions before settlement, enabling faster processing, lower fees, greater privacy and easier international transfers. By pegging to the Canadian dollar, they avoid the wild volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which has fallen more than 30 per cent in recent months.

Yet significant risks remain. A private stablecoin's value depends on the issuer's trustworthiness and ability to maintain adequate high-quality reserves. “De-pegging” incidents have occurred, where stablecoins meant to equal $1 have dropped to 90 cents or lower.

Users must also find someone willing to accept their stablecoin or convert it to traditional currency, which is particularly complex in cross-border transactions. Unlike credit cards and electronic banking, stablecoins offer no fraud detection or consumer protection. A transaction to the wrong address, a hack or a lost private key means the money is gone.

A central bank digital currency would provide the same settlement benefits and eliminate the risks posed by private alternatives.

As legal tender issued by the Bank of Canada, a CBDC would be accepted anywhere Canadian dollars are currently accepted. It would carry the same backing as the current dollar, with zero de-pegging risk. 

BoC's Macklem lays out high-level vision for stablecoin regulation

International agreements between central banks would facilitate fast, cheap conversion between countries' CBDCs, simplifying transfers to friends and family in Europe, Japan or elsewhere. Controlling illicit activities would be easier than with private digital currencies.

Holding a CBDC would essentially equal holding deposits at the central bank (or at some kind of new national public deposit bank) accessible via card, computer or smartphone. The government could create an account for every Canadian using social insurance numbers, extending electronic payment benefits to the underbanked – the homeless, elderly and people in remote areas. Federal transfers could become faster and more efficient.

With all the advantages of CBDCs, the Bank of Canada abandoned the idea. The decision, of course, ultimately rests with the government. Launching a CBDC would require legislative changes, notably the Bank of Canada Act and Currency Act. So why isn't the government pursuing it? The answer likely lies in the BoC's stakeholder consultation report.

One key factor emerging from these consultations is financial institutions' concerns about a CBDC's impact on their operations. A CBDC would remove incentives for holding money in banks' deposit accounts. Why keep money in accounts that earn virtually no interest – and charge fees – when you could hold it more securely at the central bank with no fees? Banks would lose a stable source of low-cost funding.

Banks argue that this threatens financial stability. But if Canadians moved from bank deposits into CBDCs, this would simply level the playing field between banks and other non-deposit-taking financial institutions. 

Most financial institutions lack access to bank deposits as funding (e.g. First National, Wealthsimple, Manulife) yet operate successfully. Moreover, the Bank of Canada has tools to address any financial stability problems that emerge.

The real reasons for resistance are simple: a CBDC would hurt large deposit-taking institutions' bottom lines and would eliminate the market – and profits – for privately issued stablecoins.

Other concerns include privacy issues and the complexity of the required regulatory framework. Although it is worrisome that some people trust private cryptocurrency issuers more than their public institutions, these challenges are manageable. A CBDC could also coexist with physical cash. 

With more than 130 countries exploring central bank digital currencies – many in pilot and development phases – shelving this idea may be a missed opportunity that future generations will regret.

Oracle's earnings miss and $80B market cap wipeout show how tightly Bitcoin now tracks AI-driven tech risk, but the policy response to a credit crunch could recreate the liquidity conditions.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Oracle lost roughly $80 billion in market value on Dec. 11 when revenue missed expectations, and management hiked AI-related capex from $35 billion to about $50 billion, funded in part with rising debt.

The stock dropped up to 16%, dragging Nvidia, AMD, and the broader Nasdaq lower.

Reports framed the move as fanning “AI bubble” fears, with investors questioning whether the payoff from building massive data-center capacity is arriving fast enough to justify those costs.

On the same tape, Bitcoin slipped below $90,000, likely due to worries over the AI sector denting risk appetite.

The single-day episode encapsulates Bitcoin's new structural vulnerability: it has become the high-beta tail of the AI trade, moving in lockstep with tech equity sentiment and bleeding harder when AI-linked stocks crack.

The correlation between Bitcoin and Nvidia reached approximately 0.96 over a rolling three-month window leading into Nvidia's November earnings, according to analysis from 24/7 Wall St.

Regarding Nasdaq, The Block data shows that the 30-day aggregate Pearson Correlation coefficient was 0.53 as of Dec. 10.

Additionally, Bitcoin is down around 20% since the Fed began easing interest rates on Sept. 17, while the Nasdaq is up 6%. This suggests that when tech stocks crash, Bitcoin tanks harder.

The AI bubble narrative has matured rapidly over the past few weeks.

Reuters reported in late November that AI-linked valuations and macro gauges such as the Buffett Indicator have pushed overall US equity valuations beyond dot-com-era extremes, while AI-heavy indices show sharp pullbacks and rising volatility even as enthusiasm remains high.

Besides, big tech companies have raised hundreds of billions of dollars in bonds this year to finance data centers and hardware. Morgan Stanley estimated a funding gap of around $1.5 trillion for the AI infrastructure build-out, and Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi warned that AI-related borrowing now exceeds tech's run-up before the dot-com crash.

Essays in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and The Atlantic both cite roughly $400 billion in AI spending this year against only about $60 billion in revenue.

The math implies that most firms are deeply loss-making and that the wider economy is now partly leaning on an AI investment boom that cannot last indefinitely.

If the AI bubble bursts, the damage to Bitcoin will go beyond simple correlation, as AI capex increasingly becomes a credit story.

Estimates indicated that AI-related data center and infrastructure financing deals jumped from about $15 billion in 2024 to roughly $125 billion in 2025, driven by bond issuance, private credit, and asset-backed securities.

Analysts in a Reuters piece compare some of the structures and opacity to pre-2008 patterns and warn of “untested risks” if tenants or cash flows disappoint.

Central banks now treat this as a financial-stability problem. The Bank of England's recent stability update explicitly highlights stretched valuations in AI-focused firms. It also warns that a sharp correction in AI-linked equities could threaten broader markets via leveraged players and private-credit exposures.

The ECB's November 2025 Financial Stability Review makes a similar point: the AI investment boom is increasingly funded through bond markets and private capital, making it more exposed to swings in risk sentiment and credit spreads.

Oracle is the poster child. Its $50 billion capex plan for AI data centers, alongside a roughly 45% jump in long-term debt and record credit-default-swap spreads, represents exactly the sort of over-extended balance sheet regulators worry about.

If an AI bubble pops, those spreads widen, refinancing costs jump, and leveraged funds that were long AI-themed debt and equities are forced to cut gross exposure. Bitcoin sits at the end of that chain.

Chinese researchers' analysis of Bitcoin versus global liquidity finds a strong positive relationship between Bitcoin prices and global M2 or broad liquidity indices. Their paper called BTC a “liquidity barometer” that performs well when global liquidity is high and poorly when it contracts.

The liquidity story is straightforward: if the AI bubble bursts and forces a credit squeeze, the first-order effect is a global de-risking and liquidity pullback.

Bitcoin is one of the first things macro and growth funds sell when margin calls come in, and its outsized sensitivity to liquidity makes the drawdown worse.

The other half of the story is what happens after the first wave of deleveraging.

The same institutions that worry about an AI-driven correction also implicitly point toward the likely response. If over-levered AI and credit markets wobble hard enough to threaten growth, central banks will re-ease financial conditions.

The IMF's latest Global Financial Stability Report warns that AI-driven equity concentration and stretched risk asset valuations make a “disorderly correction” more likely and stresses the need for careful, but ultimately supportive, monetary policy to avoid amplifying shocks.

History gives a template. After the COVID shock in March 2020, aggressive quantitative easing and liquidity provision coincided with a massive rise in total crypto market cap from around $150 billion in early 2020 to roughly $3 trillion by late 2021.

A recent Seeking Alpha report mapped Bitcoin against global liquidity and the dollar index shows that, once easing starts in earnest and the dollar weakens, BTC tends to put in large upside moves over the following quarters.

The narrative rotation also matters. If AI equities go through a classic post-bubble hangover, with lower multiples, negative headlines, and political backlash over wasted capex, some portion of speculative and macro capital could rotate into a different “future of money” or “anti-system” bet.

Bitcoin is the cleanest non-corporate candidate.

Recent market stress has already seen capital concentrate back into BTC rather than alts. As liquidity thinned and volatility rose recently, Bitcoin's dominance has climbed to around 57%, with ETFs serving as the institutional on-ramp.

Additionally, although Bitcoin has recently shown a correlation with tech stocks, decentralization and scarcity remain the core of the “hedge” narrative.

Bitcoin's structural problem is that it cannot decouple from the AI trade in the short term, but it depends on policy responses to an AI bust for its medium-term upside.

In the immediate aftermath of an AI credit crunch, Bitcoin bleeds because it is the high-beta tail of macro risk, and global liquidity contracts faster than most assets can adjust.

In the months that follow, if central banks respond with renewed easing and the dollar weakens, Bitcoin historically has captured outsized gains as liquidity flows back into risk assets and speculative narratives reset.

The question for allocators is whether Bitcoin can survive the first hit well enough to benefit from the second wave.

The answer depends on how violent the AI correction is, how quickly policy pivots, and whether institutional flows through ETFs and other vehicles hold or break under stress.

Oracle's Dec. 11 earnings miss is a preview: Bitcoin dropped below $90,000 in the same tape that wiped $80 billion off Oracle's market cap, showing that the correlation is live and the sensitivity is real.

If the AI bubble fully unwinds, Bitcoin takes the punch first. Whether it emerges stronger depends on what central banks do next.

However, one short term positive indicator revealed itself later in yesterday's trading session. Nvidia recovered 1.5% from its intraday low, while Bitcoin followed suit but gained over 3%, reclaiming $92,000.

Anthony Scaramucci showed up to Solana Breakpoint in Abu Dhabi wearing a tie — a small act of rebellion in a sea of hoodies — and then proceeded to make a much bigger one on stage: Solana is going to “flip” Ethereum.

Scaramucci's Solana Prediction

Not in the Twitter-war, zero-sum, “ETH is dead” kind of way. More like: same league, different growth curve, and Solana ends up with the bigger market cap. “I think it will flip Ethereum, but that doesn't mean Ethereum's going down or anything like that. I think there's going to be market share for Ethereum. I think they could both grow, but I think from a market capitalization perspective, I think Solana will end up growing faster,” Scaramucci told CoinDesk Live on Dec. 11.

That's been his line for a while. This time it came with a prop: his new book, Solana Rising, which dropped Dec. 9 and — according to Scaramucci — quickly hit the top of Amazon's “new releases” list for investment management/investment strategy. He framed the book as something for the skeptics, or at least for the friends of the believers.

The pitch is familiar if you've been anywhere near crypto conferences this year, but Scaramucci's version is unusually blunt: Solana is the fastest-growing chain, it's stacked with activity, it's cheap to use, and it's easy to build on. Then you add staking, and you've got what he keeps calling “great tokenomics.”

And yes, he's heavily aligned. “Full disclosure,” he said, “I have a large personal holding in Solana. I have it on the firm's balance sheet.” How large? On SkyBridge's balance sheet, he put it at “probably 60%,” with the firm sitting on “north of a nine figure balance sheet.” His personal portfolio allocation, he estimated, is around “6% 7%.” Big, but not “I sold the house for SOL” big.

Notably, Scaramucci emphasized that he's not “chain monogamous.” He likes Avalanche. He likes Ethereum. He's not doing maximalism. He's doing a portfolio. “In fact, who is chain monogamous?” he joked.

The Skybridge Capital founder added: “It's not an amorous thing. It just has to do with the realities of investing. It's like owning a lot of stocks in your portfolio. But to me, I just think that it is the fastest growing chain. That's the most activity of like the top 50 chains combined. It's got lots of use cases, lots of versatility. It's easy to develop on and it's very low fees to transact on and it's got great tokenomics if you want to stake your Solana like I do.”

He also pointed to the debut of the first spot Solana ETF in the United States — “first staking ETF,” in his words — as another signal that we're still early. Then came the price talk, because of course it did.

Could SOL hit $300–$400 by the end of next year? “Sure,” he said, tying it to a more constructive US regulatory backdrop — specifically his hope that the CLARITY Act gets passed and unlocks “the full utilization of tokenization.” Longer term, he went bigger: “Is Solana go to $1,000 over the next five years? I really do believe that.”

He also revisited Bitcoin. Same vibe: right call, wrong calendar. “I've been right about Bitcoin, but I've been wrong about timing,” Scaramucci said, sticking with a $150,000–$200,000 target, and arguing a friendlier rate environment next year could help.

At press time, SOL traded at $139.14.

Right down to the Holy Grail ... almost.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The sandstone cliff faces of the ancient city of Petra (one of the New Seven Wonders of the World) have long been in the archaeological limelight. They've even spent time in the Hollywood limelight as the location for several scenes in the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. But in a recent on-screen appearance—and no offense to Harrison Ford's iconic professor—they were the site of a very real discovery.

Discovery Channel's popular show “Expedition Unknown” was on site to document the discovery of 12 human skeletons and artifacts dating back at least 2,000 years, which had all been long hidden beneath the famed Khazneh (or “Treasury”) in Petra. The colossal find was accomplished by a team lead by archaeologist Pearce Paul Creasman.

It's a find that, were he real, Indiana Jones would certainly be proud of. 

“This is a hugely rare discovery,” said Josh Gates, host of the Discovery Channel's program, according to CNN. “In the two centuries that Petra has been investigated by archaeologists, nothing like this has been found before. Even in front of one of the most famous buildings in the world … there are still huge discoveries to be made.” 

Creasman, executive director of the American Center of Research, employed ground-penetrating radar to first see if it was possibile that additional tombs were located at the site. The gathered data matched up to data collected from areas where tombs had been found in the past, and the Jordan government gave the approval for excavation beneath the world-famous site. 

The team was beyond pleased to see an actual tomb materialize, and truly shocked by the fact that it was full of remains and artifacts—many of the tombs at the ancient city have been found empty, picked clean long ago. 

Along with the 12 sets of skeletal remains—several of the bones from which had mold, thanks to the porous sandstone allowing moisture into the space in the flood-prone area—the team found a mix of bronze, iron, and ceramic artifacts. This included one ceramic chalice tucked in the arms of one of the deceased, ironically reminiscent of the “Holy Grail” depicted in The Last Crusade. “It really was this awesome moment,” Gates said, “of history imitating art.” 

The Treasury, located near the main entrance to the city, is believed to be at least 2,000 years old. It is a striking mausoleum carved into the sandstone cliffs that has long attracted tourists aplenty, but dating this iconic monument has proven difficult because of the lack of finds within the tombs. 

“We were hopeful to find anything that might tell us more about the ancient people and place,” Creasman said. For instance, Gates believes that the individuals buried in the newly discovered tomb show must have been of very high status because of the prime real estate used for the burial place.“Human remains,” Creasman continued, “can be a really valuable tool in that regard. The burials in this tomb are articulated, so the bones haven't been rummaged around and moved, so that's exceedingly rare.” 

Delving deeper into the remains and artifacts found in the tomb could open additional information about the Khazneh, Petra, and the lives of the Nabataeans who once inhabited the area. “I think learning who they are,” Gates said, “is really going to help unlock part of the story of the Treasury.”

China's planted a bunch of new trees since 1981, but that extra foliage is shifting more precipitation to some areas while drying out others.

Here's what you'll learn when reading this story:

It's no secret that China is particularly adept at building things. The world's largest dam? In China. Largest high-speed rail network? That'd be China. Largest wind farm? China. Solar Array? Argentina. Really? Nope, it's also China. Largest ancient landmark? You get the picture.

Alongside all of that building, China has also been growing. Taking inspiration from that last infrastructure accolade, China began growing the Three-North Shelterbelt, or “The Great Green Wall,” in 1978 as an effort to combat soil erosion and decrease desert storms. The project, the country's state-sponsored media announced, was finally complete as of last year. 

According to Reuters, China grew 116,000 square miles of trees, increasing the country's total forest coverage from 10 percent in 1949 to roughly 25 percent in 2024. But a new study published in the journal Earth's Future, shows that all those additional trees (roughly 78 billion since the early 80s, by some estimates) come with some unforeseen consequences for China's water distribution. 

Scientists from Tianjin University, China Agricultural University in Beijing, and Utrecht University in the Netherlands found that between 2001 and 2020, increased vegetation reduced water resources in both the eastern monsoon region and the northwestern arid region. That's a big deal, considering these areas make up roughly 74 percent of China's total land area, according to Live Science.

According to the study, regreening efforts like the Great Green Wall—along with other tree-planting initiatives, such as Grain for Green Program and the Natural Forest Protection Program, with both started in 1999—have increased evapotranspiration, which is a portmanteau of evaporation and transpiration (the process through which plants release water vapor through tiny pores known as stomata). 

“These shifts caused changes in precipitation, directing more moisture to the Tibetan Plateau, which saw an increase in water availability,” the authors wrote. “In contrast, eastern and northwestern China experienced a decrease in water availability, with the northwest losing the most due to substantial moisture moving to the Tibetan Plateau.”

By studying these rapid land use/cover changes (LUCC), the authors also note that certain zone transitions—such as grasslands-to-forests or croplands-to-grasslands—impacted evapotranspiration, precipitation rates, and water availability at varying rates. For example, grasslands transformed into forests increased evapotranspiration and precipitation, but negatively impacted water availability. 

Unfortunately, China's water availability isn't conveniently distributed for its population. According to the study, the country's northern regions contain roughly 46 percent of its population and more than half of the arable land, but only 20 percent of water availability. The authors argue that these altered hydrological cycles need to be taken into account when planning future reforestation efforts. 

“Our findings highlight that land cover changes can redistribute water resources between regions,” the authors wrote. “Understanding these effects is crucial for planning sustainable land and water management in China.”

Medical cannabis is widely used for issues such as chronic pain, anxiety and insomnia, but a major analysis led by UCLA Health reports that the scientific support for these uses remains weak.

A study published in JAMA examined more than 2,500 scientific papers released from January 2010 through September 2025, including randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses and clinical guidelines. Over 120 of these studies were given priority based on sample size, recency, relevance and the range of health conditions they addressed. Interest in cannabis and related compounds such as CBD has steadily increased, and a 2018 survey found that 27% of adults in the U.S. and Canada had used them for concerns like pain, anxiety and sleep.

Public Belief Outpaces Current Scientific Evidence

According to first author Dr. Michael Hsu of UCLA Health, many people assume cannabis provides reliable medical benefits, yet recent research does not fully support those assumptions.

"While many people turn to cannabis seeking relief, our review highlights significant gaps between public perception and scientific evidence regarding its effectiveness for most medical conditions" said Hsu, health sciences clinical assistant professor at the UCLA Health Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences. "Clear guidance from clinicians is essential to support safe, evidence-based decision-making when discussing medical cannabis with their patients."

Proven Benefits Remain Narrow

The review found that only specific pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoid products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have demonstrated clear clinical benefits. These medications are limited to certain conditions, including HIV/AIDS-related appetite loss, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and severe pediatric seizure disorders such as Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.

For many other health problems, the available evidence remains uncertain or insufficient. Although more than half of medical cannabis users try it for chronic pain, current clinical guidelines do not recommend cannabis-based treatments as the first option for pain management.

Potential Health Risks Identified

The analysis also examined safety concerns. Long-term studies in adolescents showed that high-potency cannabis may be associated with higher rates of psychotic symptoms (12.4% versus 7.1% for low-potency) and generalized anxiety disorder (19.1% versus 11.6%).

Around 29% of medical cannabis users also met the criteria for cannabis use disorder. Daily consumption, especially of inhaled or high-potency products, may contribute to cardiovascular problems, including elevated risks of coronary heart disease, heart attack and stroke when compared with non-daily use.

Guidance for Clinicians

The review recommends that clinicians screen for cardiovascular disease and psychotic disorders, consider possible drug interactions and evaluate whether potential harms outweigh the benefits before recommending THC-containing products.

"Patients deserve honest conversations about what the science does and doesn't tell us about medical cannabis," Hsu said.

Study Limitations and the Need for More Research

The authors acknowledged several limitations. The analysis was not a systemic review, and no formal risk of bias assessment was completed. Some of the research included was observational and may have been influenced by confounding factors. Clinical trial findings may also not apply to every patient due to differences in study design, participant characteristics and the cannabis products evaluated.

"Further research is crucial to better understand the potential benefits and risks of medical cannabis. By supporting more rigorous studies, we can provide clearer guidance and improve clinical care for patients," said Dr. Hsu.

Researchers from Harvard, UC San Francisco, Washington University School of Medicine, and New York University contributed to the study.

The Taş Tepeler region of archaeological sites in Türkiye has yielded more artifacts that were possibly associated with funerary customs.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Echoes of some of the oldest established human settlements remain in what is now the Taş Tepeler region of Türkiye. Literally meaning “Stone Hills,” it has been a trove of ancient artifacts originating from sites such as Göbeklitepe, Karahantepe, Sefertepe and Sayburc. Unearthed in its rocky landscape are figures and carvings that whisper of rituals and beliefs that shaped the lives of Neolithic people who lived 12,000 years ago.

Archaeologists excavating these sites were taken aback by how advanced these people's sense of social organization was. Excavations have been ongoing for five years, and in that time, they have unearthed obelisks, stelae, stone figures, and the remnants of what were once thriving communities in whcih groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers settled permanently as the environment became more fertile. 

Taş Tepeler has recently revealed some particularly intriguing objects. Human sculptures, some with possible funerary associations, offer a glimpse into how an early society viewed (and coped with) death.

Maybe the most striking figure was found at Sayburc—a human bust, carved with what appear to be ribs and a mouth that has been stitched shut (and can be seen here). It is thought that this carving is of a deceased individual, and that the stitched mouth is a visual metaphor for the silence of death. It might be the face of an ancestor, or have had a ritual use that is still unknown. Because this and other figures discovered at Taş Tepeler were made before writing began in the region, identifying who or what the carvings represent is difficult.

The figure is “an impressive example of the aesthetic and expressive sculptural tradition of the Neolithic period,” Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, minister of Culture and Tourism, told Türkiye Today, adding that it opens up “an opportunity to reassess prehistoric concepts of death beyond burials and skull traditions.”

Hardly anything was known about Neolithic funeral customs in Türkiye until the discovery of a skull in Sefertepe last year. Burials were secondary, meaning that the dead were left to decompose until only skeletons were left. Previously discovered bones showed cut marks and burns that suggested a type of ritual practice. When the skull appeared in a stone cavity, lying on its side, it told archeologists that it must have had special significance, and was displayed in an area intended for it before those practices were carried out. (It was already known that skulls were separated and possibly hung outside before the second burial.)

Whether the figure with the stitched lips had any association with a second burial is unknown. Also found at Sefertepe were two human faces carved out of stone, along with a black serpentinite bead with carvings of faces on both sides—all of which are stylistically different from human images at other Taş Tepeler sites. As suggested by slight variations in the structure of the brow and nose and the curvature of the cheek, the people of Sefertepe may have had their own way of depicting the human face. Another human figure found at Göbeklitepe, known more for its sculptures of animals, was embedded in a wall (possibly as an offering).

Early foundations of social stratification and family life are evidenced in Taş Tepeler. Because the fertility of the land after the last Ice Age allowed communities to feed themselves without hunting frequently, the population grew, explaining the expansion of human settlements. When there was surplus of food, people producing it gained wealth. Those who could not produce as much food, or whose harvests were not as plentiful, were seen as having a lower social status. Structures that used to be living spaces also showed that religious and domestic spaces frequently merged.

As artifacts continue to be recovered, Ersoy sees Taş Tepeler as a region that “will be recognized as the Neolithic capital of the world.”

Long COVID (LC) involves a spectrum of chronic symptoms after acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Current hypotheses for the pathogenesis of LC include persistent virus, tissue damage, autoimmunity, endocrine insufficiency, immune dysfunction and complement activation. We performed immunological, virological, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses from a cohort of 142 individuals between 2020 and 2021, including uninfected controls (n = 35), acutely infected individuals (n = 54), convalescent controls (n = 24) and patients with LC (n = 28). The LC group was characterized by persistent immune activation and proinflammatory responses for more than 180 days after initial infection compared with convalescent controls, including upregulation of JAK-STAT, interleukin-6, complement, metabolism and T cell exhaustion pathways. Similar findings were observed in a second cohort enrolled between 2023 and 2024, including convalescent controls (n = 20) and patients with LC (n = 18). These data suggest that LC is characterized by persistent activation of chronic inflammatory pathways, suggesting new therapeutic targets and potential biomarkers of disease.

Long COVID (LC), also known as post-acute sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (PASC) or post-COVID-19 condition (PCC), is characterized by multi-organ symptoms that can persist for months or years after recovery from acute COVID-19 infection1,2,3,4,5. LC prevalence estimates vary widely; some estimates of the percentage of those infected with COVID-19 who develop LC are more than 10% (ref. 2). Risk factors for LC include the severity of the acute infection, age, sex and preexisting health conditions; the most common symptoms are fatigue, brain fog, exercise intolerance and cognitive impairment4,6.

The pathophysiology of LC1,7,8,9,10,11 remains unclear but may involve increased complement activation, metabolomic abnormalities, endocrine insufficiency, inflammatory responses and uncoordinated immune responses3,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Current hypotheses include persistent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or viral remnants20,21, autoimmunity4,7,22,23, cortisol insufficiency12,24, latent herpesvirus reactivation25, metabolic dysfunction19,22,26,27, T cell dysregulation28 and inflammatory tissue damage2,6,9,14,16,29,30,31,32,33. Given the diversity of signs and symptoms of LC, treatment is typically symptomatic and personalized, with an emphasis on rehabilitation. The STOP-PASC trial34 revealed that a 15-day course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir showed no significant improvement in treating LC (PASC) symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog and shortness of breath34, underlining the need for new therapeutic approaches for LC.

In this study, we evaluated the immunological and inflammatory responses in people with LC compared with convalescent controls (CCs) at 90–180 days and more than 180 days after initial COVID-19 infection using immunological assays, virological assays, transcriptomics and proteomics. The first cohort was enrolled in 2020–2021, and the second cohort was enrolled in 2023–2024. Our data show that chronic inflammation, T cell exhaustion, metabolic dysregulation and upregulation of the JAK-STAT and interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling pathways are key features of LC.

We evaluated samples from 142 participants who were enrolled in an observational cohort of the Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness (MassCPR) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston between April 2020 and October 2021 (hereafter the 2020–2021 cohort). This cohort included UCs (uninfected; n = 35), acutely infected individuals less than 30 days after COVID-19 infection (acute; n = 54), CCs (n = 24) and patients with LC (n = 28) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Clinical symptoms in the LC group included primarily shortness of breath, brain fog, fatigue, pain, cough and abnormal smell and taste (Fig. 1a), which is consistent with prior reports9,16,23,30,35,36,37,38,39,40. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected during the acute phase (<30 days) (LC: n = 6; CC: n = 5), 90–180 days (LC: n = 26; CC: n = 21) and more than 180 days (LC: n = 21; CC: n = 5) after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Plasma samples were also collected during the acute phase (LC: n = 8; CC: n = 4), 90–180 days (LC: n = 22; CC: n = 8) and more than 180 days (LC: n = 19; CC: n = 6) after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed immunological and virological assays, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and plasma proteomics.

a, Symptom prevalence in individuals with LC (n = 28) and individuals who recovered (CCs, n = 24) in the 2020–2021 cohort. b, log10-transformed nAbs titers and IFNγ (ELISpot responses against the WH/2020, Delta and BA.1 variants of SARS-CoV-2) in CC (n = 9) and LC (n = 41) individuals on day 90–180 after infection. The dots are individual participants and the red bars are group medians. Samples from several time points were assessed for participants with LC. c, Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genomic (N, E) and subgenomic (N single-guide RNA (sgRNA), E sgRNA) RNA in CCs (n = 9) and LCs (n = 41). Medians (red bars) are shown for each group. Samples from several time points were assessed for participants with LC. d, K-mean clustering across acute COVID-19 (n = 54), LCs (n = 28), CCs (n = 24) and uninfected (NC) (n = 35) individuals. All available samples were included in the k-mean analysis for the LC and CC groups. e, Heatmap of top significant (Padj < 0.05) proinflammatory genes upregulated (red) or downregulated (blue) in LCs compared to CCs or NCs at day 90–180 after SARS-CoV-2 infection. f, Transformed log2 fold change expression of the top upregulated (pink) and downregulated (dark) genes in LCs compared to CCs and NCs (Padj < 0.05).

Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses using luciferase (LUC)-based pseudovirus neutralization assays and T cell responses using pooled peptide interferon-γ (IFNγ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assays against SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Delta and Omicron BA.1 in the CC and the LC groups did not detect differences in SARS-CoV-2 nAb titers and identified a trend toward higher Spike-specific IFNγ ELISpot responses in the LC compared with the CC group (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). We did not detect plasma SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in any CCs or individuals with LC using PCR with reverse transcription genomic or subgenomic viral load assays (Fig. 1c).

Bulk RNA-seq in PBMCs from individuals with LC (n = 26) and CCs (n = 21) at day 90–180 and in uninfected (n = 35) and acute (n = 54) individuals identified reads that mapped to the human genome and multiple common viruses (SARS-CoV-2, varicella zoster virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Epstein–Barr virus, human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, influenza virus, rotavirus). We did not detect significant differences in viral read counts for these common viruses in the LC compared with the CC group (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Unsupervised clustering of bulk RNA-seq transcriptomic data revealed a distinct stratification between the LC group and the other cohorts, whereas the CC group clustered with the UCs (Fig. 1d). Differential bulk RNA-seq gene expression analysis in PBMCs across these groups showed upregulation of multiple proinflammatory markers in the LC compared with the CC group and uninfected individuals, including chemokines and cytokines (CXCL2, CXCL3, CCL3, IL10, IFNG, IL6, TNF, IL1B, IL1A, NFKBIZ), the NLRP3 inflammasome and the complement and coagulation genes C5, F3 and THBS1 (Fig. 1e,f). In contrast, downregulation of activating (for example, KLRC2) and inhibitory (for example, KLRC1, KIR3DL2) natural killer (NK) cell receptors and T cell activation markers in the LC compared to the CC group was observed (Fig. 1f).

Analysis of differentially expressed genes in the LC group compared with the CC group at day 90–180 after infection identified an increase of multiple proinflammatory markers, such as IL6, NLRP3, TNF, JAK2, CSF2, IL1B and IL10, in the LC compared with the CC group (Fig. 2a). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of signatures associated with signaling by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ and IFNγ, JAK-STAT pathways, complement and coagulation cascade, metabolic pathways and immune cell signatures of monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells (Fig. 2b), while RNA processing and nitrogen metabolism, oxidative stress and amino acid transport, were decreased in the LC compared with the CC group (Fig. 2b). Additionally, transcriptomic signatures of T cell activation and differentiation (CD28, ICOS, TCF7) were downregulated in the LC compared with the CC group at day 90–180 after infection (Fig. 2b), while CD8+ T cell exhaustion signatures and programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD1) signaling-associated genes (IFI44, PRDM1, NR4A3, NFKBIA, MAFF) were significantly increased in the LC group (Fig. 2c), suggesting a potential role of T cell dysregulation in the pathogenesis of LC. Moreover, JAK1, JAK-STAT and IL-6 signaling pathways correlated inversely with T cell activation and positively with CD8+ T cell exhaustion and PD-1 signaling (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Signatures of T cell activation and differentiation were positively correlated with IFNγ ELISpot responses, whereas proinflammatory signaling and immune exhaustion signatures were negatively correlated with IFNγ ELISpot responses (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We observed a significant correlation between IL-6 and JAK-STAT signaling pathways with complement and coagulation pathways, metabolic signatures and PD-1 signaling in the LC group (Fig. 2d), suggesting a potentially coordinated role of these pathways in the pathogenesis of LC, while the IL-6 and JAK-STAT signaling pathways correlated negatively with the metabolism of amino acids and oxidative stress in the LC group (Fig. 2d). IFNγ, IL-6, JAK-STAT and T cell exhaustion pathways correlated with clinical symptoms in the group with LC, including fatigue, shortness of breath and cognitive complaints (Fig. 2e).

The red and blue lines indicate linear regression. The gray shading represents the 95% confidence interval (CI).

To investigate the timing of the chronic inflammatory pathways in the LC group in finer detail, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using blood samples collected at less than 30 days (LC, n = 6; CC, n = 5), day 30–100 (LC, n = 7; CC, n = 4), day 100–200 (LC, n = 22; CC, n = 5) and day 200–300 (LC, n = 22; CC, n = 6) after infection from individuals with LC and CCs. We observed upregulation of proinflammatory pathways associated with IL-1, IL-6, JAK-STAT, IFN signaling, cell cycle, metabolic pathways, complement activation and T cell exhaustion pathways in the LC group by day 30, with increased and sustained effects for over 200 days (Extended Data Fig. 3). Pathways associated with IL-6, JAK-STAT and JAK1 signaling were upregulated at both day 90–180 (Fig. 3a) and more than 180 days (Fig. 3b) in the LC group compared to the CC group, as highlighted by the persistent increase of several leading genes in the pathways, including IL6R, IL6, IL1R, CD14, CSF1, CSF3RLEPR, IL4R, STAT1, STAT3 and JAK2 (Fig. 3a,b). Weighted gene correlation network analysis revealed that individual markers of the JAK-STAT and IL-6 signaling pathways, including IL6R, AKT1, JAK2, IL1B, IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 and CD14 were highly correlated and positively associated with the subsequent development of LC (Fig. 3c).

The top genes driving the enrichment of each pathway are shown in the red circles. The x axis represents each gene's rank in the gene list, while the y axis shows the corresponding gene rank metric score. c, Gene interaction network analysis showing the top leading genes for the IL-6 and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. The edges represent the Spearman correlation between genes (P < 0.05). Hub genes with a high number of correlated genes are represented by larger circles.

We also performed proteomics analysis on plasma from the LC (n = 22) and CC (n = 8) groups at day 90–180 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 2). We observed increased levels of plasma cytokine signaling, including JAK-STAT (STAT5, STAT1, IL6ST, SOS1, RELB), IL-6, NF-κB signaling, complement and coagulation cascades (TMPRSS6, F8, C9, C1S, F9, C6, C1R, FN1), metabolic pathways (PTPN11, LEPR, PTEN, EIF4E) and corticotropin-releasing hormone and leptin signaling (TCF4, PRKCA, PRKCB, PLCG1) in the LC group compared to the CC group at day 90–180 after infection (Fig. 4a), while DNA damage repair (RAD51C, RAD51D, HUS1, MSH2, RPA2, PARP1, YY1, CETN2), cytotoxic T cell (DFFA, BCL2, FADD, B2M, CD3G, HLA-E, CD247, HLA-G, BID), telomere maintenance (PCNA, PRIM1, TEN1, RUVBL1, RPA2) and amino acid metabolism (GNMT, PDHB, DLD, AMT, PDHA2, BHMT2, GOT1, MRI1, GOT2, MTAP, CTH) were decreased in the LC group compared to the CC group at day 90–180 after infection (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the plasma JAK-STAT signaling pathways by proteomics correlated positively with plasma proinflammatory signatures such as the NF-κB signaling pathway, complement activation, leptin signaling and corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling, and correlated negatively with plasma DNA damage repair, cytotoxic T cell and granzyme B signaling in the LC group (Fig. 4b,c). These data indicated that LC is associated with chronic inflammation, as well as immunological and metabolic dysregulation.

To evaluate whether activation of proinflammatory pathways during acute COVID-19 infection correlated with the subsequent development of LC, we performed an exploratory analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic changes in the subset of participants in this cohort (LC: n = 8; CC: n = 5) who had PBMC and plasma samples both during acute COVID-19 (< 30 days) and at day 90–180 after infection. Transcriptomic profiling of PBMCs indicated that acutely infected participants who subsequently developed LC had higher levels of proinflammatory pathways such as IFNβ and IFNγ, JAK-STAT and IL-6 signaling, as well as innate immune cell signatures of monocytes neutrophils and complement and coagulation cascades (CCL3, CCL20, CD160, F13A1, F3, IL6, NR4A1, NLRP3, THBS1) during acute infection compared with acutely infected patients who fully recovered (CCs) (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Plasma proteomics profiling validated the significant increase of proinflammatory pathways (IL-6 signaling, complement cascade, leptin signaling pathway) during acute infection in participants who subsequently developed LC compared to those who recovered (CC) (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d).

To explore further the potential association between early activation of proinflammatory pathways during acute infection and the subsequent development of LC, we used a supervised random forest (RF) algorithm to identify key blood and plasma features during acute infection that predict the development of LC. This model revealed that gene expression and protein levels of complement activation, proinflammatory response, JAK-STAT, IL-6, IL-6-JAK-STAT3, IFNβ and IFNγ signaling pathways during acute infection were among the top predictors for the development of LC (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f). A feature importance analysis revealed upregulation of the IL-6 and JAK-STAT signaling, corticotropin-releasing hormone, IL-10 and TNF signaling pathways during the acute phase were among the top predictors for the development of LC. Together, these observations suggested that early activation of proinflammatory pathways strongly predicted LC development based on gene and protein profiling.

To confirm our findings in an independent cohort with LC, we performed transcriptomics profiling of peripheral blood samples collected on days 15–700 after infection from individuals with LC (n = 18) and CCs (n = 20) who were enrolled at the BIDMC clinical site of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) RECOVER prospective clinical trial between October 2022 and December 2024 (hereafter the 2023–2024 cohort) (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3). All study participants had standardized clinical meta-data and responded to structured symptom questionnaires41 (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Table 3). Pain, neurological symptoms, brain fog, fatigue and cough were the primary symptoms that were more frequent in the LC compared with the CC groups (Fig. 5a). Transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood in the LC (n = 10) and CC (n = 12) groups at day 90–180 after infection indicated upregulation of pathways linked to proinflammatory cytokine signaling (IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 signaling), complement activation, proinflammatory immune cell signaling, signatures of T cell exhaustion and certain metabolic and immune regulation pathways in the LC compared with the CC group (Fig. 5b). In contrast, pathways associated with mitochondrial function, amino acid metabolism and signatures of NK cells, T cells and B cells were downregulated in the LC compared with the CC group (Fig. 5b). In line with observations from the 2020–2021 cohort, the IL-6, JAK-STAT and JAK1 signaling pathways remained persistently upregulated in the LC group both at day 90–180 and more than 180 days compared to the CC group (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d).

Dots represent participants; the red horizontal bars indicate the group medians. A two-sided Kruskal–Wallis tests with post hoc pairwise comparisons using Dunn's test with Bonferroni correction was used. Padj values are shown.

We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assays to evaluate the plasma levels of selected proinflammatory markers at day 90–180 (LC, n = 19; CC, n = 13), more than 180 days (LC, n = 19; CC, n = 13) and UCs (n = 13) in the 2023–2024 cohort (Fig. 5c,d and Extended Data Fig. 6). Plasma levels of IL-6R were significantly elevated in the LC group compared to the CC and UC groups at day 90–180 and more than 180 days using ELISA (Fig. 5c) and MSD (Fig. 5d), suggesting a link between chronic inflammation and LC8,12,16,33.

We next combined data from the 2020–2021 and 2023–2024 cohorts and performed an RF analysis using the gene expression profiles at day 90–180 and day 180–365 after infection to define the pathways that correlated most robustly with LC compared with CC. For each time point, RF models were trained using gene sets corresponding to individual pathway modules, and performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) metrics. Pathways related to IL-6, JAK-STAT, IFNγ, proinflammatory response, antigen presentation and activation, and complement cascade were the top pathways associated with LC status at day 90–180 (Fig. 6a) and day 180–365 (Extended Data Fig. 7). Individual markers within the IL-6 and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, including JAK1, PIK3, CXCL8, BCL2L1, OSM, MAP3K8 and STAT3 were the top genes associated with LC (Fig. 6b).

a, ROC curves showing the AUC from the RF analysis of individual biological pathways at day 90–180 after infection. b, Bar plot showing the top key genes identified using the RF analysis. The genes are ranked in descending order of importance for each pathway with respect to the accuracy of the model.

Finally, in an exploratory sex-stratified analysis at day 90–180 after infection, using transcriptomic profiling in peripheral blood in the combined cohort, females with LC (n = 29) showed stronger enrichment of inflammatory pathways than females who recovered (CC, n = 14), including monocyte signatures, proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, IL-6, JAK1, JAK-STAT signaling, and T cell exhaustion (Extended Data Fig. 8a). In the LC group, these pathways were generally higher in females than males (Extended Data Fig. 8b), whereas no significant sex differences were detected within the CC group (Extended Data Fig. 8c). These data demonstrate persistent activation of proinflammatory pathways in a validation LC cohort, with possibly greater inflammation in females compared with males, although these observations require confirmation in larger studies.

In this study, we found that individuals with LC were characterized by persistent activation of chronic inflammatory pathways compared with CCs. These pathways included proinflammatory cytokine signaling, complement activation, metabolic dysregulation and immune exhaustion and persisted for more than 180 days. These findings suggest that chronic inflammation may contribute to the pathogenesis of LC and define potential new therapeutic targets.

We observed that participants with LC exhibited reduced granzyme B and cytotoxic T cell signaling and increased immune exhaustion, suggesting dysregulated cross-talk between the innate and adaptive immune responses15,28,42. Our findings are consistent with prior reports that the IL-6 and JAK-STAT signaling pathways were upregulated in individuals with LC28,43,44, particularly in those with cardiorespiratory or multisystem symptoms. We also found that chronic upregulation of IFNγ signaling was associated with LC and correlated with signatures of reduced T cell activation and increased T cell exhaustion, suggesting that chronic immune stimulation may lead to functional impairment of T cells. These findings are consistent with prior observations5,28 and suggest the potential role of T cell dysregulation and exhaustion in LC pathogenesis.

Our study also confirms and extends prior reports of metabolic dysregulation in LC1,8,10,12,19,22,26,30,33. We observed a decrease in amino acid metabolism and an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling, leptin signaling, fatty acid metabolism, bile acid and beta-alanine metabolism in LC. Moreover, these metabolic pathways correlated with proinflammatory pathways in the LC group, suggesting a link between metabolic dysregulation and chronic inflammation. We also observed decreased activity of the telomere maintenance and DNA damage recognition and repair pathways, chromatin regulation and DNA methylation in the LC group. Impaired telomere maintenance could be associated with premature cellular senescence or apoptosis that may impede tissue repair processes45,46.

Our study is limited by relatively small cohorts of individuals with LC who were predominantly female and with symptom clusters that primarily involved fatigue, brain fog and pain. Larger studies from more diverse populations will be required to assess the generalizability of our findings. Nevertheless, we observed good concordance between the 2020–2021 initial cohort and the 2023–2024 validation cohort. Another limitation is the use of bulk RNA-seq, which limits more detailed resolution of pathways at the cellular level. Therefore, future studies should use single-cell transcriptomic and T cell profiling technologies to provide higher-resolution data. Nevertheless, our observations suggest potential therapeutic targets for LC that could be explored in clinical trials. Because the IL-6 and JAK-STAT pathways were among the top upregulated pathways in participants with LC in both the 2020–2021 and the 2023–2024 cohorts, we have initiated a clinical trial to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the JAK1 inhibitor abrocitinib for LC (NCT06597396).

In conclusion, our data demonstrate that LC is characterized by chronic inflammation, immune exhaustion and metabolic dysregulation. Current therapeutic efforts are largely focused on antiviral agents to address potential residual viral replication. However, the lack of efficacy of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in treating LC highlights the need to explore alternative therapeutic strategies34. Our data suggests that the JAK-STAT and IL-6 pathways, and the IFN and metabolic pathways, are potential therapeutic targets that could be evaluated for LC.

The 2020–2021 cohort samples were collected between April 2020 and October 2021 as part of the MassCPR COVID-19 biorepository. This discovery cohort of 142 individuals included UCs (n = 35, 51% female and 49% male), acutely infected individuals (n = 54, 50% female and 50% male), CCs (n = 24, 60% female and 40% male) and patients with LC (n = 28, 86% female and 14% male). Samples were collected during the acute phase (< 30 days after infection) and during the chronic phase between 30 and 300 days after infection.

The 2023–2024 validation cohort samples were collected between October 2022 and December 2024 as part of the BIDMC biorepository jointly with the BIDMC clinical site of the NIH RECOVER study with the complete clinical meta-data and structured symptom questionnaires. This validation cohort of 38 individuals included CCs (n = 20, 55% female and 45% male) and patients with LC (n = 18, 78% female and 22% male). Samples were collected during the acute phase (< 30 days after infection) and during the chronic phase between 30 and 700 days after infection.

Symptoms in the 2020–2021 cohort were self-reported, whereas symptoms in the 2023–2024 cohort were collected with the RECOVER standardized symptom questionnaire. All samples were collected as part of the MassCPR, RECOVER and BIDMC biorepository studies with institutional review board approval and participant informed written consent. De-identified and cryopreserved samples were used in this study.

The nAb titers against the SARS-CoV-2 variants were determined using pseudotyped viruses expressing a LUC reporter gene. In brief, a LUC reporter plasmid pLenti-CMV Puro-Luc (Addgene), the packaging construct psPAX2 (AIDS Resource and Reagent Program) and Spike protein expressing pcDNA3.1-SARS-CoV-2 SΔCT were cotransfected into human HEK 293T cells (CRL-3216, ATCC) with lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Pseudotyped viruses of the SARS-CoV-2 variants were generated using the Spike protein from WA1/2020 (Wuhan/WIV04/2019, GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_402124), B.1.617.2 (Delta, GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_2020950) and Omicron BA.1 (GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_7358094.2). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the supernatants containing the pseudotyped viruses were collected and purified using filtration with 0.45-μm filter. To determine nAb titers in human sera, HEK-293T-hACE2 cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well overnight. Three-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum samples were prepared and mixed with 60 μl of pseudovirus and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before adding to the HEK-293T-hACE2 cells. Forty-eight hours later, cells were lysed in Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega Corporation) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers were defined as the sample dilution at which a 50% reduction (NT50) in relative light units was observed relative to the average of the virus control wells. Titers greater than 1:20 were considered positive.

Cellular immune responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 were assessed using IFNγ ELISpot assays using pools of overlapping 15-amino-acid peptides for the Wisconsin delta and omicron variants (21st Century Biochemicals). Ninety-six-well multiscreen plates (Merck Millipore) were coated with 1 µg per well of mouse antihuman IFNγ (MabTech) overnight in endotoxin-free Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with DPBS three times and blocked using Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 media containing 10% FCS for 2–4 h at 37 °C. Peptides pools were prepared at a concentration of 2 µg per well, and 200,000 cells per well were added. Peptides and cells were incubated for 15–20 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed with DPBS-Tween seven times and then incubated with 1 µg ml−1 per well of biotinylated antihuman IFNγ (MabTech) for 2–4 h at room temperature, followed by four washes with DPBS-Tween and 1.33 µg ml−1 per well of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-biotin (Rockland) for 2–3 h at room temperature. Plates were developed with nitroblue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate chromogen (Pierce), stopped by washing with tap water, and read using an ELISpot reader (KS ELISPOT Reader, Carl Zeiss). The number of spot-forming cells per 106 cells were calculated, subtracted over background (PBMCs incubated with medium and dimethylsulfoxide without peptide).

PBMCs were lysed in 700 μl of TRIzol and then extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) with on-column DNase digestion. RNA quality was assessed using a TapeStation 4200 (Agilent Technologies) and then 10 ng of total RNA was used as input for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis using the Clontech SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Takara Bio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplified cDNA was fragmented and appended with dual-indexed barcodes using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). Libraries were validated using capillary electrophoresis on a TapeStation 4200, pooled at equimolar concentrations and sequenced with PE100 reads on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000, yielding ~30 million reads per sample on average. Alignment was performed using STAR v.2.7.3a47; transcripts were annotated using a composite genome reference that included the GRCh38 Ensembl release 100 and SARS-CoV-2 (GCF_009858895.2, ASM985889v3, MN985325.1). Transcript abundance estimates were calculated internal to the STAR aligner using the htseq-count algorithm. Transcript abundance estimates were calculated internal to the STAR aligner using the htseq-count algorithm. DESeq2 (ref. 48) was used for normalization, producing a normalized read count.

To assess for viral transcription, sample reads were aligned to a reference of 59 complete viral genome sequences using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (v.0.7.17)49 to produce a sorted alignment (.bam) file. SAMtools (v.1.3.1) was used to summarize the number of reads aligned to each genome. The complete FASTA file is provided along with the bulk RNA-seq raw data.

A total of 55 ml serum or plasma from all participants, five pooled plasma controls and one buffer control were analyzed using the SomaScan Assay Kit for human plasma V4.1 (cat. no. 900-00020), measuring the expression of 6,596 unique human protein targets using 7,596 slow off-rate modified aptamer reagents (SOMAmer), single-stranded DNA aptamers, according to the manufacturer's standard protocol (SomaLogic). The modified aptamer binding reagents, SomaScan assay, and its performance characteristics and specificity to human targets, have been described previously. The assay used standard controls, including 12 hybridization normalization control sequences used to control for variability in the Agilent microarray readout process, and five human calibrator control pooled plasma replicates and three quality control (QC) pooled replicates used to mitigate batch effects and verify the quality of the assay run using standard acceptance criteria. The readout was performed using the Agilent microarray hybridization, scan and feature extraction technology.

Twelve hybridization control SOMAmers were added alongside SOMAmers to be measured from the serum samples and controls of each well during the SOMAmer elution step to control for readout variability. The control samples were run repeatedly during assay qualification and robust point estimates were generated and stored as references for each SOMAmer result for the Calibrator and QC samples. The results are used as references for the SomaScan v.4.1 Assay. Plate calibration was performed by calculating the ratio of the calibrator reference relative fluorescence unit (RFU) value to the plate-specific calibrator replicate median RFU value for each SOMAmer. The resulting ratio distribution was decomposed into a plate scale factor defined by the median of the distribution and a vector of SOMAmer-specific calibration scale factors. Normalization of QC replicates and samples was performed using adaptive normalization by maximum likelihood with point and variance estimates from a normal US population. Post-calibration accuracy was estimated using the ratio of the QC reference RFU value to the plate-specific QC replicate median RFU value for each SOMAmer. The resulting QC ratio distribution provides a robust estimate of accuracy for each SOMAmer on every plate. SomaScan RFU values and clinical information were obfuscated to protect personally identifiable information while preserving biologically relevant biomarkers. These reference datasets were provided by SomaLogic. We used the limma R package to identify differentially expressed proteins in the LC and CC groups. The method involves fitting a linear model to the data and then performing a t-test to identify proteins that are differentially expressed between two or more groups. P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. The R packages ggplot2 and ComplexHeatmap were used to generated the figures. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using GSEA (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). Genes were preranked according to the fold change from the highest to the lowest; GSEA was used to assess the enrichment of selected gene sets. Cytokine signaling, immune cell signatures and molecular pathways were compiled from the MSigDB Hallmark, C2, C7 and C3 gene sets (www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp) and the blood transcriptional modules. The GSEA Java desktop program was downloaded from the Broad Institute (www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) and used with GSEA preranked module parameters (number of permutations: 1,000; enrichment statistic: weighted; 10 ≤ gene set size ≤ 5,000)50. Sample-level enrichment analysis50 was used to investigate the enrichment of pathways in each animal. Briefly, the expression of all genes in a specific pathway was averaged across samples and compared to the average expression of 1,000 randomly generated gene sets of the same size. The resulting z-score was then used to reflect the overall perturbation of each pathway in each sample.

We estimated pathway activity per sample using ssGSEA51. Leading-edge gene lists were parsed from the prior GSEA output and used as the gene sets for each pathway. For every sample, genes were ranked according to normalized expression and an enrichment score was computed as the difference between the empirical cumulative distributions of ranks for leading-edge genes versus all other genes; higher scores indicate greater pathway activation. Scores were normalized (per sample and then z-scored across samples) to enable comparisons, yielding a samples × pathways ssGSEA matrix for the downstream analyses.

To explore associations between symptom presence and gene expression signatures, we merged the one-hot symptom mapping with the original cohort data containing pathway-level gene expression profiles. For each of the 18 symptom categories, we then identified all patients who had that symptom and averaged their gene expression values across all measured pathways. In other words, for each symptom like fatigue or brain fog, we looked at all the patients who had that symptom and calculated the average expression level of each gene pathway in that subgroup. This produced an 18 × n matrix (where n is the number of gene pathways), with each cell representing the average expression in patients with that symptom. The resulting correlation matrix was visualized using a heatmap with color mapping reflecting average expression levels. This can be formally represented as:

Where Cj,k is the average expression of gene pathway (k) for symptom (j), Sj is the set of patients with symptom (j) and Gi,k is the expression value of gene pathway (k) for patient (i).

Cytokines were assessed using ELISA. An antihuman cytokine coating antibody was adsorbed onto 96-microwell plates. Microwells were washed with wash buffer; human serum samples and human cytokine standards were prediluted in assay buffer and added to each plate. Plates were then incubated for 1 h before adding antihuman cytokine horseradish peroxidase (HRP). After an additional 1-h incubation, plates were again washed with wash buffer. SeraCare KPL TMB SureBlue Start solution was added to each well; plate development was halted by adding SeraCare KPL TMB Stop solution to each well. Absorbance at 450 nm was recorded with a VersaMax Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). The standard curve was prepared from human cytokine standard dilutions and the human cytokine concentration was determined. For each sample, the cytokine concentration was calculated using a four-parameter logistic curve fit; cytokine concentrations of the unknown samples were interpolated from the linear portion of the standard curve generated from the human cytokine standards of known concentration.

Serum levels of human IL-6R were tested using the R-PLEX Human IL-6R Kits from Meso Scale Discovery (cat. no. K1510GR-2) by the Metabolism and Mitochondrial Research Core (BIDM) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the plate was coated using the provided biotinylated capture antibody (1:100 dilution). The highest Calibrator standard is 2,000 pg ml−1. Then a fourfold serial dilution was done to generate seven calibrator curve using a four-parameter logistic model. The detection limit is 0.4 pg ml−1. Samples were thawed on ice and diluted at a 1:200 ratio using the Diluent 7 provided by the kit. The assay plate was read by a MESO QuickPlex SQ 120 instrument and data were analyzed using the Discovery workbench 4.0 software.

We applied ssGSEA, which transforms gene expression profiles into enrichment scores for predefined gene sets (for example, pathways), thereby producing a matrix in which each row corresponds to a sample and each column represents a pathway activity score. To assess the contribution of individual pathways, we trained an RF classifier using the ssGSEA scores as input features. The dataset was randomly split into a training set (70%) and a testing set (30%) using stratified sampling to preserve the class distribution. The RF model was trained with 500 trees using the randomForest R package, where the outcome variable was CLASS (LC or CC) and the predictors were the ssGSEA-derived pathway scores. Model performance was evaluated using the held-out test set, with classification accuracy and a confusion matrix computed to assess prediction quality. To determine the relative importance of each pathway in predicting the LC outcome, we extracted the mean decrease in Gini impurity (MDG) from the trained RF model. The MDG quantifies how much each feature (pathway/gene) contributes to reducing classification uncertainty. A scatter plot was created to display the relationship between prediction accuracy and MDG for each pathway using transcriptomic and proteomic pathways. We added bar plots to visualize the top pathways/genes ranked according to importance generated by the RF model. Each bar represents a pathway; its length reflects its importance in the RF model. This plot highlights the most influential pathways in distinguishing LC from CC based on ssGSEA scores. All figures were generated using R v.4.4.2, using standard visualization packages for statistical and transcriptomic data analysis.

The data from the RNA-seq and proteomics were analyzed with RStudio (v.4.4.0) in PRISM 9.0 (GraphPad Software). Pathways enrichment analysis was performed using the GSEA software. Sample-level ssGSEA was performed using the GSVA (v.1.40) R package. The ssGSEA analysis delineates a comparative exploration of the groups' median values, visually represented through the data distribution and median lines. Statistical significance, denoted by the calculated P value, is highlighted above the comparison line, where a P < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. The two-sided Mann–Whitney U-test was used to identify significant differences between groups. For more than one group comparison, we used a Kruskal–Wallis test to compare all three groups; when significant, we performed post hoc pairwise comparisons with the Dunn's test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. nAb titers and IFNγ ELISpot counts were analyzed after log10 transformation; to avoid undefined values, measurements <1 were set to 1 before transformation. For each viral variant (WH/2020, Delta, BA.1), CC and LC groups were compared using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann–Whitney U-test) test on the log10 values. Multiple testing across variants within each assay (nAb and ELISpot analyzed separately) was controlled using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure; adjusted qvalues are reported in the subpanel titles; nominal P values are shown above the parentheses. A nonparametric test was selected a priori because immune readouts are typically right-skewed with potential outliers and unequal variances, and the groups are independent. Individual data and group medians are displayed in the plots. Analyses were performed in R using the base wilcox.test with Benjamini–Hochberg adjustment. Because of the limited sample availability, no statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes and we used all the samples that were made available to us. Where applicable, data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested.

Long COVID continues to disrupt millions of lives, especially through persistent neurological symptoms like fatigue, sleep problems, and brain fog. Researchers tested whether raising NAD+ levels with high-dose nicotinamide riboside could help restore energy metabolism and ease symptoms. While the randomized trial didn't show major differences in cognitive scores between treatment and placebo groups, participants who took NR for at least 10 weeks reported improvements in fatigue, sleep, mood, and some executive function tasks. The results highlight both the complexity of long COVID and a promising direction for future therapies focused on cellular energy and inflammation.

Chao-Yi Wu, PhD, OT, from the Department of Neurology and Edmarie Guzmán-Vélez, PhD, of the Department of Psychiatry at Mass General Brigham, are the lead and senior authors of a paper published in eClinicalMedicine, "Effects of Nicotinamide Riboside on NAD+ Levels, Cognition, and Symptom Recovery in Long-COVID: A Randomized Controlled Trial."

Q: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience?

Millions of people worldwide continue to experience lingering symptoms after COVID-19, a condition known as long COVID. These symptoms can affect people of all ages and often include neurological issues such as "brain fog," which makes thinking and memory difficult. Because these problems can significantly disrupt daily life, researchers are working to find effective treatments.

Our clinical trial tested whether raising levels of NAD+ -- a molecule that helps cells produce energy -- through nicotinamide riboside (NR), a form of vitamin B3, could improve health outcomes. Participants took NR supplements for up to 20 weeks, and we tracked changes over time.

Q: What question were you investigating? 

The NAD+ molecule is present in all human cells and is essential for energy production, immune function and inflammation control. Previous research suggests COVID-19 may interfere with NAD+-related biological processes, possibly contributing to neurological symptoms.

In our study, we wanted to know if boosting NAD+ through NR supplementation could improve cognitive function and ease common long COVID symptoms.

Q: What methods or approach did you use?

We ran a 24-week clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital between August 2021 and September 2023. We enrolled 58 people with long COVID and randomly split them into two groups:

To ensure unbiased results, neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was getting the real supplement at first.

We measured NAD+ levels through blood tests and asked participants to complete surveys and cognitive tests about memory, sleep, fatigue and mood at the beginning, at 10 weeks and at 20 weeks.

Q: What did you find?

Of the 58 people who joined the study, 37 started NR right away, and 21 began with the placebo. Only 18 people completed the full 22-week protocol. The others left the study for reasons such as getting COVID again, moving, changing medications or experiencing possible side effects.

When we compared the two groups, we didn't see major differences in thinking or memory scores, which were the main focuses of the study. Other symptoms like fatigue, sleep and mood also didn't show big differences between groups.

However, in exploratory post hoc analyses with a slightly larger sample size of everyone who took NR for at least 10 weeks, we observed improvements in self-reported fatigue, sleep, and depressive symptoms after 10 weeks of NR supplementation compared to baseline. Some also performed better on a task of executive functioning, a set of mental skills that help us, for example, plan, organize, and switch between tasks. This suggests that some people may benefit from the use of NR, even if the overall results didn't show clear differences between groups.

Q: What are the implications?

Long COVID affects an estimated 400 million people worldwide, yet its causes remain unclear. In this study, high-dose NR safely boosted NAD+ levels. While results were mixed, findings suggest that boosting NAD+ may play a role in easing symptoms like fatigue and poor sleep for some people. This points to a promising direction for future treatments.

The most common side effects were mild, such as easy bruising or rash. None were serious, and only a few participants discontinued due to side effects

Q: What are the next steps?

Future studies should include larger and more diverse groups to confirm these findings and identify who benefits most. For example, do men and women respond differently? Are people with lower baseline NAD+ levels or higher inflammation more likely to improve? Because long COVID often involves inflammation, an important question is whether boosting NAD+ can help reduce it.

We also plan to analyze physical activity data collected during the trial, as well as examine whether other supplements taken by participants influenced NR's effects.

“America should be thrilled.”  

Scientists just brought us one step closer to the dream of unlimited power. On November 17 at the Nevada National Security Site, a nuclear energy startup called Valar Atomics achieved zero-power criticality, a crucial step in nuclear energy development. 

Also known as cold criticality, the term refers to a self-sustaining chemical reaction of uranium-235, a radioactive uranium isotope. As the name suggests, cold criticality means the fission system doesn't reach full operating temperatures (which are hotter than 1300°F), and therefore doesn't generate power. Instead, cold criticality is the foundational step that precedes operational status. Still, the recent achievement is an opportunity for researchers to understand the behavior of the core, which could mean we're closer than ever to unlocking true unlimited energy. 

“Zero power criticality is a reactor's first heartbeat, proof the physics holds,” Isaiah Taylor, founder and CEO of Valar Atomics, says in a press release. Taylor believes this achievement is ushering in “the dawn of a new era in American engineering”—one that he believes will evolve rapidly. 

🔮 Check Out Our New Video Series, Pop Mech Explains: PrecognitionYou've probably had that eerie feeling before—knowing what's about to happen before it actually does. Flashes of deja vu. A text from someone you were just thinking about. A dream predicting the future. Coincidence? Or something deeper? Across four chapters, we investigate the science and speculation behind those “gut feelings.” Go Down the Rabbit Hole With Us 

The recent tests are a part of Project NOVA (Nuclear Observation of Valar Atomics), a campaign to verify the physics of cold criticality. The startup worked in partnership with the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) National Criticality Experiments Research Center (NCERC), which has its roots in the Manhattan Project, the program that developed nuclear weapons during World War II. Valar Atomics designed the central part of the core, which features a high-temperature gas reactor (HTR) design. Typically, HTR cores rely on helium gas and ceramic material to stabilize the fission, or atom splitting, process.

Valar Atomics' success is also part of a larger national effort in the United States. The DOE's Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program seeks to expedite the nuclear reactor testing process, attempting to reinstate the U.S. as a global leader in nuclear energy. The current goal of the program is for several advanced reactors to reach full criticality—or operational status—by July 4, 2026.  

As exciting as the recent achievement may seem for proponents of nuclear energy, there are still many obstacles for Valar Atomics to clear before its reactors are viable for commercial use. 

“It is much easier to achieve a zero-power criticality than to actually make power in a reactor. There's a huge technical gap between those things,” Taylor confesses in an interview with Inc. “But I certainly wouldn't underestimate the value of the data that we're going to get out of this test.”

According to the press release, zero-power criticality experiments allow the research team to better understand the core's “neutronic behavior,” which is simply the physics of the reactor. The team is also studying variables such as the reactivity control, or the rate of reactions within the core, and burnable poisons, which act as buffers in reactors.  

Next, the Valar Atomics team will test their core at extreme temperatures and progressively higher power levels. The reactor will also have to undergo safety and regulatory processes with the DOE, according to the Valar Atomics communications team. Should the U.S. achieve its goal and see several reactors reach full criticality by this summer, it would allow the country to “to stay competitive in AI, rebuild industrial capacity, keep a stable grid, maintain reasonable prices, and cut emissions at the same time,” the team explains. 

However, two major hurdles remain for clean, commercial nuclear energy: scaling the reactors to industrial sizes and actually harnessing power for the grid. Still, progress must start somewhere, and Valar Atomics' recent experiments are a promising test run.  

Max Ukropina, head of projects Valar Atomics, puts it simply in the release: “America should be thrilled, but wanting more.”

At least 5.6 million people had their names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers stolen in a data breach at 700Credit, a company that runs credit checks and identity verification services for auto dealerships across the United States.

In a statement on its website, the Michigan-based company blamed the October data breach on an unidentified bad actor.

According to Michigan's attorney general, the hacker stole personal data collected from dealers between May and October 2025.

The company said it was now sending letters by mail to individuals whose information had been stolen in the data breach, which offers credit monitoring services.

“If you get a letter from 700Credit, don't ignore it,” said Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel. “It is important that anyone affected by this data breach takes steps as soon as possible to protect their information. A credit freeze or monitoring services can go a long way in preventing fraud, and I encourage Michiganders to use the tools available to keep their identity safe.”

Google is rolling out a beta experience that lets you hear real-time translations in your headphones, the company announced on Friday. The tech giant is also bringing advanced Gemini capabilities to Google Translate and expanding its language-learning tools in the Translate app.

The new real-time headphone translations experience keeps each speaker's tone, emphasis, and cadence intact, so it's easier to follow the conversation and tell who's saying what, Google says. The new capability essentially turns any pair of headphones into a real-time, one-way translation device. 

“Whether you're trying to have a conversation in a different language, listen to a speech or lecture while abroad, or watch a TV show or film in another language, you can now put in your headphones, open the Translate app, tap ‘Live translate' and hear a real-time translation in your preferred language,” said Rose Yao, Google VP Product Management, Search Verticals, in the blog post.

The beta is rolling out now in the Translate app on Android in the U.S., Mexico, and India. The feature works with any pair of headphones and supports more than 70 languages.

The company plans to bring the capability to iOS and more countries in 2026. 

As for the advanced Gemini capabilities coming to Translate, Google says they will enable smarter, more natural, and accurate text translations. They'll also enable improved translations of phrases with more nuanced meanings, like slang, idioms, or local expressions.

For example, if you're trying to translate an English idiom like “stealing my thunder,” you'll now get a more accurate translation instead of a literal word-for-word translation, as Gemini will parse the context to capture what the idiom really means.  

This update is rolling out now in the U.S. and India, translating between English and nearly 20 languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and German. The update is available in the Translate app on Android, iOS, and on the web.

Google is also expanding its language learning tools to almost 20 new countries, including Germany, India, Sweden, and Taiwan. English speakers can now practice German, while Bengali, Mandarin Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, German, Hindi, Italian, Romanian, and Swedish speakers can practice English. 

The tech giant is also adding improved feedback so you can get helpful tips based on your speaking practice. 

Additionally, Google is adding a feature that tracks how many days in a row you've been learning, making it easier to see your progress and stay consistent. While the tools were already designed to take on Duolingo, this new feature brings the experience even closer to the popular language-learning app.

“All this started with a really hot summer day in '21,” said Chris Muench, sitting in a small conference room at Hyviva, his startup based in Redmond, Wash.

The Pacific Northwest was being scorched in a heat dome and Muench's power went out at his home in nearby Duvall. The experience led him to purchase solar panels, but he also wanted to capture the excess power that was generated when the sun was shining its brightest, socking it away for when it wasn't. 

That led Muench and his wife, Sanja, to launch Hyviva in 2023 to build modular, hydrogen-powered energy storage units that essentially produce electricity from water. This month, the business is shipping its first devices to customers. 

Hyviva is initially targeting residential solar installations, a potentially ripe market as long-standing policies allowing homeowners to sell unused solar power back to utilities are being phased out in many places. That excess power can total 20% or more of a household's daily energy generation, according to a solar trade group. 

“That's the catalyst for storage,” said Paul Owen, chief marketing officer. “You've got this opportunity that's going to waste right now.”

Stored solar power can also reduce a home's reliance on utility-provided electricity — which is getting more expensive — and keep the lights on and fridge running during power outages.

Hyviva's device is a little narrower than a standard refrigerator, built from stacked units with a shiny black casing. Here's how it works:

“Every module can be plugged into another module without the need of a hydrogen expert,” Chris Muench said. “Just ‘Lego brick' them together, and then you decide how much power draw do you want, how much storage do you want, how much hydrogen you want to generate.”

The five-person company is promoting its technology online and was at the CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas last January. Hyviva's initial customers are in Europe and the first units are being built in Germany. The startup can also do manufacturing in Redmond for U.S. customers.

Hyviva's biggest U.S. rival is the Tesla Powerwall system that uses conventional lithium-ion batteries to hold power. The company reported $7.4 billion in revenue last year from energy generation, and that number has continued to climb.

Hyviva touts its product's competitive features across performance, safety and longevity. The startup's basic system holds more power — 33.6 kilowatt hours to Tesla's 13.5 kWh. While blazes are uncommon, lithium ion batteries pose a fire risk that's greater than the hydrogen present in a Hyviva device for short periods. And conventional batteries lose capacity over time, while the metal hydride retains its hydrogen storage capabilities for decades.

The startup, however, faces big hurdles when it comes to costs.

Tesla's Powerwall 3 costs roughly $15,000, including the system and installation costs, while a Hyviva unit is priced at about $40,000. 

But when it comes to scaling the storage capacity, the cost advantage flips as it's cheaper and easier to add hydrogen storage to the Hyviva system. So a 90-kilowatt hour setup is about $50,000 for the startup, while the company estimates a comparable Tesla system would cost $82,000 installed.

To put the capacity in perspective, a U.S. single-family household consumes around 80 kilowatt hours of power per day on average. 

As power demand keeps expanding globally, experts estimate that $1.2 trillion worth of battery energy storage will be needed through 2034. That escalating need is reflected in pockets of growth in the sector, including a Texas startup called Base Power that leases batteries to homeowners and recently announced $1 billion in new funding. And energy storage is being paired with data centers to reduce their power grid impacts, including at an Oregon campus that's installing 31 megawatts of batteries.

At the same time, Hyviva and others face political headwinds at the federal level as the current administration pushes policies and budgets that hobble renewable energy companies and deployments.

But the startup is attracting interest, said Chief Operations Officer John Traynor. It has funding from an angel investor and reports having dozens of potential customers, with commercial sites and utilities reaching out as well.

“That's given us the confidence that we're on the right track,” Traynor said.

My understanding, at least several years ago, that Netflix was paying as much to Apple in subscription fees, as they did for their AWS hosting.I also noticed when upgrading my Spotify account, I couldn't do that through the iphone app itself - I assumed this was because it would break TOS, or they didn't want to pay a massive chunck of the monthly subscription cost to Apple.

I would think making sure outside payment links aren't scams will be more expensive than that because checking that once isn't sufficient. Scammers will update the target of such links, so you can't just check this at app submission time. You also will have to check from around the world, from different IP address ranges, outside California business hours, etc, because scammer are smart enough to use such info to decide whether to show their scammy page.Also, even if it becomes ‘only' hundreds of dollars, I guess only large companies will be able to afford providing an option for outside payments.

There has been craploads of litigation about “Fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory” licensing over the last two decades, and fees that are percentages of revenue with no cap have survived and there is no reason to believe any of these legal standards will change.In fact, I think it's likely that Apple and Google will team up to create a standards body that defines the method for distributing/installing smartphone apps (because this is now in their best interest, not that I want them to).  These standards are going to end up using a bunch of patents that you will have to license on FRAND terms.Yes, the cost is going to go down.  Yes, Epic is going to benefit a lot more than any indie developer.  Such is life

> Speaking to reporters Thursday night, though, Epic founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said he believes those should be “super super minor fees,” on the order of “tens or hundreds of dollars” every time an iOS app update goes through Apple for review.Wow, one step forward, and one step back. Good job, Epic.The outcome is obviously going to be that Apple's store will have the most apps, with the most up to date versions, and with the most free apps/games. I'm sure Fortnite will do just fine though.Unless I'm misunderstanding this, why would the court allow Apple to act as a gatekeeper for their competitors?

This is the fundamental problem, and not something this court ruling does anything to fix. Apple has full control over what software its competitors are allowed to sell. The court's solution? Tell Apple to be more fair when dictating rules to its competitors. Yeah... I'm sure that'll work great.

Sure you can use your own payment processor, we're still charging 27% though. Sure you can have your own App Store, you still have to go through the same review process though. It seems some of the cracks in this malicious compliance are starting to show.

- Apple shouldn't be able to charge for external payments, come on.- Force prominent disclosure of refund policies. Epic Games doesn't allow them for IAP. Apple does. Epic knows exactly how predatory that is, betting some kids will find ways to spend thousands and the parents will be helpless. Ideally you'd have a law mandating refunds, but without that, there should be mandatory disclosure on the IAP screen, at least for microtransaction games. You can't have fair "competition" when you have an information asymmetry, and if these rulings don't mandate that, you'll open the floodgate for these gaming companies to screw over parents.

Apple has no official App Store refund policy, either for IAP or for upfront paid apps. I've already looked for one. There's of course a form to request a refund, but refunds are entirely at Apple's discretion, for any reason or no reason, and Apple often exercises its discretion to refuse refunds.

The use case is rich iPhone users who want an easy experience to watch videos, read, or consume social media on a larger screen than their phones. It's especially popular for the children or elderly parents of these rich people. You can argue this use case is narrow, but it's decently profitable.Just because this use case doesn't apply to your experience doesn't mean anyone who disagrees is a brainwashed fanboy.I will agree that the iPad Pro range seems overly niche to me — but also it could be I just don't understand the use case. If someone else finds it productive and pleasant to use, what difference does this make to me or you?

You don't own the e-books you buy on Amazon's Kindle store. You simply own a license to view the content at your leisure, and Amazon can revoke the license for whatever reason it chooses. However, there's a small spot of hope for people who want to own the things they buy. Amazon will allow users to download some books starting in 2026, though only if a publisher offers its own approval.

You can read more about Kindle's policy change on its DRM (digital rights management) support page. Starting on Jan. 20 next year, “verified purchasers can download the EPUB or PDF files of your confirmed DRM-free books.” That acronym is a catch-all term for any software limitation that restricts users from reselling or otherwise manipulating copyrighted works. Good e-Reader (via Android Police) first spotted the change in policy.

Back in February, Amazon closed a loophole that allowed users to download Kindle books and send them to other e-readers. This “Download & transfer via USB” feature in tandem with older e-book formats allowed some users to then hack the files, changing their format to make them accessible on other devices. Sure, the tool was certainly used for book piracy, though other users simply wanted to access books they already—ostensibly—owned on their choice of device.

Now, Amazon is putting the onus on book publishers to decide whether users should be able to own their e-books, at least in the traditional sense of the word “own.” Starting early next year, users can download either EPUB or PDF via the Manage Your Content and Devices page on Amazon's website. This won't work if you're reading these e-books via a Kindle Unlimited subscription. The new DRM rules state that if you download an e-book and the publisher changes its mind, you'll still maintain control of that copy even if you can't download it anymore.

This will be a positive change for any lingering Kindle readers with big libraries. Amazon's latest devices, like the $280 Kindle Colorsoft and the $630 Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, are more expensive than some other e-reader alternatives, so this is a win for smaller e-reader brands as well. Now, the only lingering question is which publishers will be willing to offer PDF access to their books.

If you consider how fast the publishing industry went after the Internet Archive for daring to create a public online repository of books and journals, there may be few authors and publishers willing to enable free digital downloads. The Association of American Publishers (AAP), a trade group representing the big five major publishing houses, successfully sued the Internet Archive for copyright infringement. At least, in the words of founder Brewster Kahle, the Internet Archive “survived” the lawsuit, even if the library didn't.

AAP wrote after the case settled late last year, “The public interest… is served best when authors and their publisher licensees can decide the terms on which they make their works available.” Gizmodo reached out to several of the major publishing houses for comment on plans for book downloads, and we'll update this post if we hear back.

Even if Amazon is pushing responsibility onto the publishers, at least it may mean we can finally feel some small, incremental sense of ownership.

In a move worthy of a post on the Not Like The Other Girls subreddit, Reddit, one of the world's largest social platforms, is arguing that it isn't like other, actual social media sites, as the company seeks to overturn Australia's law banning children under 16 years of age from social media.

In a lawsuit filed with Australia's top court, Reddit argues the law, which came into force on December 10, limits free political discourse by preventing children from airing their views online, and should be overturned.

And if the legislation isn't overturned, the company says it should be exempted from the law because it doesn't meet the legislation's definition of a “social media platform.”

Reddit is essentially asking the Australian High Court to address some of the questions raised about the legislation, which requires 10 major services to deactivate under-16s' accounts and prevent them from using the app. Critics argue that the law infringes on children's rights, and companies have sought to raise questions about what “social media” even defines.

Indeed, calling itself a “collection of public fora arranged by subject,” Reddit brought up definitions of the word “social” in its filing to make the case that “it is not the sole or a significant purpose of Reddit to enable persons to interact ‘in a social manner'.”

“Reddit enables online interactions about the content that users post on the site. It facilitates knowledge sharing from one user to other users. It is not a significant purpose of the site to enable interactions engaged in because of a particular user's relationship with or interest in another user as a person […] Reddit is significantly different from other sites that allow for users to become ‘friends' with one another, or to post photos about themselves, or to organise events,” the filing reads.

In a post accompanying the filing, Reddit admin LastBluejay said the law carries “some serious privacy and political expression issues for everyone on the internet.”

“While we agree with the importance of protecting people under 16, this law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't,” the post reads.

Reddit also points out that a significant portion of content on social media platforms is accessible without an account, and kids under 16 years old would be more easily protected if they were allowed to have accounts that could then be restricted.

I'm bringing this up because it's the perfect litmus test to show whether you really care about age verification, or if you want personal trackability for all internet behavior.I'd be okay with this for certain situations (e.g. a forum that doesn't want to foreign agitators to pretend they are US voters), but the whole porn thing is a ridiculous farce because there are still going to always be millions of non-us porn sites that don't enforce US laws.

As a not super tech savvy parent I find it impossible to keep my son off screens. He always finds a workaround. So I'm a fan of age verification especially after reading The Anxious Generation, despite all the hate it gets from hacker news.

reply

But it sounds like your wish is to keep people of screens in general, which I don't think age verification would accomplish.

You meant logical criticism?

reply

This coloring problem is NP complete and somehow the thing the prover is proving is encoded in the graph structure.  At the end of the day, the only thing the verifier is sure of is that the prover can make the three colored graph, 1 bit that corresponds to the thing the verifier wants to know (eg - does the prover have a token that can show they are over 18).

My bigger concern would be who gets to issue these tokens. If it's limited to a particular government, then that doesn't work very well on a global internet. And making the internet not global (blocking adults from accessing foreign websites that don't adhere to your scheme) is kinda authoritarian IMO.If we're going to do age verification and blocking of adult sites, it needs to be local to the user's device (and thus under the control of parents, not governments).E.g. Instead of mandating sites verify users, we mandate internet-capable devices sold to kids have certain content restrictions, the same way we mandate you can't sell  alcohol to kids. To make this more effective than existing content filtering, implement some kind of legally-enforced content-labeling standards websites have to follow to be whitelisted on these devices. This way the rights, freedoms, and privacy of adults using adult devices is unaffected.

The key is to be open about it and “more” than reasonable; allow things when requested that aren't harmful.If we're too perfect at protecting them from the world they'll have no tools to deal with the world, which they will have to do eventually.

What happens when the parent goes to bed and the kid hard resets the router? Or the parent goes to bed and the kid spoofs the mac of the parent's device?It's a good outcome!

Do you dpi? How do you prevent your kids from evil maiding you? Is your personal computer locked in a cage, and do you check all your paraphernalia for keyloggers, etc. before booting?

Instead how about we simply continue to make reasonable laws regarding behaviour and holding individual people and companies responsible when they violate the law.Whilst we are at it we can keep content filtering for pre teens and imposed by parents and accept that teens are going to figure out how to get to the real internet at some point.

And yes, you are arguing against "making it easier for parents" - my original post literally advocated for legislating tech companies to make controls available, effective, and easy to use. If you truly believe what you're saying, then you'd agree with me. Instead you're nitpicking my ability to parent my kids. Exactly the behavior that isn't working, so please continue - I'm sure it'll work now.

You willingly invited that conversation. I obliged.> If you truly believe what you're saying, then you'd agree with me.Get over yourself. You have not made an attempt to ask for a solution from me to find common ground. You keep trying to remove yourself from the responsibilities of parenting in the modern world as shown in the examples you put forth and your initial post asking that parents not shoulder the blame for what is happening under their nose. Surely they have some level of culpability.I believe that it would be good for Parental Controls on devices to have a toggle to say that the phone is being used by someone in under 13, or someone 14-18 (whatever bands you want). When enabled, this flag should be available to locally installed apps and remote connections. Laws can be passed that tell remote connections how they must act when receiving this flag. This keeps me, an free adult, from being subjected to more corpo/govt tracking.

Ad hominem attacks - great way to find common ground. I actually did try to find common ground, which is that we need to legislate. My argument is that the real entities that need legislation are the ones who can most afford to do so - in both time, resources, and ownership of the platforms that we are all beholden to. I will not advocate for even more punitive restrictions on parents (who already are subject to enough societal punitive pressures as it is - TBH your post is a great example. Instead of empathy, you reply with scorn and derision - as if I'm not good enough to parent my kids).> I believe that it would be good for Parental Controls on devices to have a toggle to say that the phone is being used by someone in under 13, or someone 14-18 (whatever bands you want).So you're admitting that parental controls are ineffective?> Laws can be passed that tell remote connections how they must act when receiving this flag.And those laws are enforced through what mechanism?

Grow some skin. I used that ad hominem in response to your false dilemma/no true support comment of "If you truly believe what you're saying, then you'd agree with me".

So we talk about it and try to get them to manage it themselves. They're not unwilling, but the addiction of continuous scrolling is really hard to break. It's not even that the content is terrible, it's more just the mindless zombies -- like sitting all day on the couch watching TV. And they don't even have an IG or TT account (and won't be getting one for a long time) -- this is YouTube (which now has endless scrolling like TT) which I don't want to block altogether because there's other helpful resources on there.I've always been an early adopter, and was on BBS and IRC and all that back in the day, love the fact that the Internet is a place you can easily set up your own blog and all that, but recently I've honestly come to f*ing hate the internet in general and social media in particular.

My daughter is still a baby, so the problem is still a few years away. But I don't know how to best handle it.In some ways, I see social media as more poisonous to the brain than alcohol or tobacco. So, forbidding - or heavily limiting - internet access sounds like a plan.On the other hand, part of me being a parent is teaching her how to navigate the world. And part of that, wether I like or not, is using the internet. Having contact with the communication tools that exist.The world is full of sons of bitches. If I don't teach her how to deal with that, I would be raising an idiot.Still, a problem for the future me to ponder over.

Opposition to ID checks because you believe the internet should be open and free is reasonable but this article twists itself into knots throwing everything at the wall.

Most email pages contain only one real message, buried under layers of repeated headers/footers. I wanted to rebuild the conversations without all the surrounding noise.I used an OCR + vision-LLM pipeline to extract individual messages from the email screenshots, normalize senders/recipients, rebuild timestamps, detect duplicates, and map threads. The output is a structured SQLite database that runs client-side via SQL.js (WebAssembly).The repository includes the full extraction pipeline, data cleaning scripts, schema, limitations, and implementation notes. The interface is a lightweight PWA that displays the reconstructed messages in a phone-style UI, with links back to every original source image for verification.Live demo: https://epsteinsphone.orgAll source data is from the official public releases; no leaks or private material.Happy to answer questions about the pipeline, LLM extraction, threading logic, or the PWA implementation.

On Instagram, Ross Duffer revealed a tiny bit more about the next drop of Stranger Things season five episodes coming to Netflix this Christmas.

“Chapters Five, Six and Seven: locked, mixed, scored, colored… Volume Two is DONE,” he wrote, and revealed a video of their titles.

Chapter Five, is titled “Shock Jock.” It “picks up moments after the end of ‘Sorcerer.' Frank Darabont is back, but he flexes very different muscles on this one than he did on ‘Turnbow Trap'—it's far darker, and far scarier,”  Ross Duffer wrote. Darabont, a veteran director in the Stephen King universe, delivered one of the strongest episodes in Stranger Things 5‘s first batch.

The Duffer Brothers' longtime collaborator, Shawn Levy, who is currently working on Star Wars: Starfighter, makes his franchise return with Chapter Six. It's called “Escape from Camazotz,” and Ross Duffer described it as “the biggest episode of the three—and the performances make us cry every time we watch it.” That's the kind of character work we expect as we draw closer to the last stand for Hawkins against the Upside Down.

Then there's Chapter Seven, “The Bridge.” The penultimate Stranger Things installment will be co-directed by the Duffers and Levy. “Don't want to say too much, but aside from the finale, it's probably the most emotional chapter of the season. It's gonna be a long six-day wait for the finale…” he teased.  He also added, “Runtimes to come.”

Stranger Things season 5, volume one, is now streaming on Netflix. Volume Two will be released on December 25, and the series finale will take its bow on December 31.

Learn the basics and improve your PowerShell skills


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In this guide we will take a look at some simple command prompt commands and then delve into PowerShell and learn how it handles the same tasks, providing you a guide to the top ten powershell commands you need to know to get started.

In the 1990s I had a 486 PC with just enough RAM to run Star Wars X-Wing or Windows 3.1. I learnt the MS-DOS prompt and I was soon navigating the filesystem and tweaking config files like a sys admin with a deadline. These days I spend more time in the Linux terminal than Windows Command Prompt, but it did have me wondering how the command prompt and its “successor” PowerShell behaved in 2025. And so, here we are!

Microsoft's PowerShell is a command line shell and scripting language that is more powerful than the command prompt, and offers automation and system administration tools for the Windows sys admin who wants to automate parts of their role. The scripting side of things has advanced logic such as loops, variables, functions etc and that makes it ideal for boring jobs like user creation, system configuration and software deployment.

PowerShell uses cmdlets (command-lets) that are small, single-function commands and has a get and set syntax to get the information that we need, and then we can set the configuration to how we want things to work.

Those of us with a little grey in our hair will probably be familiar with MSDOS commands, and most of these commands still work with PowerShell. Let's take a quick look at a few of the old commands.

Command

Description

Example

dir

Lists the contents of a directory, this can be the current working directory, or another location passed as an argument.

dir



Another location

dir C:\Users\

cd

Changes the current directory.

cd Music

copy

Copy file(s) from one location to another.

copy truck.png c:\Users\lespo\Documents\

del

Delete a file

del truck.png

move

Moves a file from one location to another.

move truck.png c:\Users\lespo\Documents\

mkdir

Creates a new directory in the current working directory, or in another location if passed as an argument.

mkdir Images



Another location

mkdir D:\Images

rmdir

Delete a directory in the current working directory, or in another location is passed as an argument.

rmdir Images



Another location

rmdir D:\Images

ipconfig

Shows information on the currently active network connections.

ipconfig

ping

Checks a network connection by “pinging” a target IP address or URL.

ping 8.8.8.8

tasklist

Lists all of the running processes by name or PID.

tasklist

Lets now take a look at how PowerShell does things with these ten commands.

1. Get-Help

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

 




The Get-Help command is your key to unlocking the built-in help files that PowerShell has hidden away. It can display information on cmdlets and their syntax.

The help files can be updated by running this command.

2. Get-Command



Not sure what commands you can run in PowerShell? This command lists all of the available commands and functions at your disposal.

3. List and Control Services



In the background on our Windows machines, services run to perform tasks and await user input. These services can range from DHCP for our network to Google Chrome updates to print services like Bonjour. We can list all running and stopped services with this command.

We can then stop a running service by running this command and passing the name of the service. For example, here I am stopping the Bonjour print service.

If I need to restart a service, I just use this command and pass the name of the service.

4. List all the running processes



Much like services, these commands can list the running processes on your PC. They could be the multiple Chrome processes that prevent all of your windows and tabs from disappearing when a crash occurs. Once we know which processes are running, we can stop a process that is consuming too much of our resources.

To list the processes.

To stop a process.

5. List files and directories

 




There are a few ways to list the contents of a directory. We can use dir or ls to list the contents of the current directory, or another location by passing the location as an argument. We can also use get-childitem to perform the same task.

6. Copy-Item

 




Essentially, this is the same command as copy but in PowerShell. Of course, you can still use copy in PowerShell, it acts like an alias for this command. Here I am copying a file IMG_20251105_111626.jpg into the same directory, but I am changing the destination files name to testpic.jpg.

7. Move-Item

 




The move-item command works just like move, changing a file's location to a new directory. Here I am moving the testpic.jpg to a new directory inside the current working directory. I use dir, passing the directory as an argument.

8. Remove-Item

 




This is basically the same as using the del command to delete a file. Here I change directory to extras, and then I use Get-ChildItem to list the contents of the directory. Then I use Remove-Item to delete testpic.jpg before I then list the contents of the extras directory to show that the deletion has occurred.

9. Get, set and append content

 




Have you ever needed to take a peek inside a text file, but don't need to open a text editor? I've done this many times on Linux (less / more / cat) and there came a time where I needed to in Windows PowerShell, so I used this. Here I am reading the contents of textfile.txt which I created in Notepad++. The output of the file is dumped to the PowerShell terminal, just like Linux would send output to the terminal.

 




If you need or want to create a file in PowerShell, you can use this command to create a new file. Note that the command will interactively ask for input [value0[, [value1] etc. When you have entered all your text, press Enter on a blank line to signal to the command that you are done. This command will overwrite the contents of the file, so only use it on new files or if you are really sure.

 




If you want to append to a file, you'll need to use this command. It has the same [value0], [value1] workflow as Set-Content.

10. Test-Connection

 




This is effectively the same command as ping. It contacts a remote host and checks that your machine, and the remote machine can communicate with each other. This is often used to check that your PC can get online, especially when trying to determine network connectivity issues. The command takes an IP address or URL as an argument, here I am using the IP address for Google's main DNS server.

 




Here is the same command, using google.com as the target.

So there we go, we've taken our first steps into PowerShell commands, comparing them to command prompt commands and explaining how to use them. Some are useful, others are quirky, and their “DOS” aliases make much more sense for daily use, but there will come a time when we need to know these commands, say for a script or configuration file, so keep them in mind.

But delays the completion of its construction?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


TSMC is mulling upgrading the capabilities of its yet-to-be-built Fab 23 phase 2 in Japan in a bid to make chips on its N4 process technology (4nm-class) there, according to Nikkei. Advancing fab capabilities is hardly something unexpected for foundries like TSMC, as they tend to follow demand with their offerings. What is perhaps more surprising is that TSMC has removed heavy machinery equipment from the site and has notified suppliers that it would not need new fab tools in Japan throughout the whole 2026.

TSMC's Fab 23 phase 2 (aka JASM phase 2) near Kumamoto, Japan, was projected to make chips on N6 (6nm-class) and N7 (7nm-class) fabrication technologies, which would complement the capabilities of the company's Fab 23 phase 1 that processes wafers using 40nm, 28nm, 22nm, 16nm, and 12nm-class manufacturing processors. If the information from Nikkei is correct, then Fab 21 phase 2 will also add N4 and N5 capabilities to its list to make more advanced chips for Japanese customers.

Truth to be told, although N5/N4 and N7/N6 families of manufacturing technologies have completely different design rules and the former are substantially more advanced than the latter as they use up to 14 EUV layers, the equipment that they use is generally similar. As a result, TSMC's N5/N4 fabs reuse as much as 90% of the tools used by N7/N6 production lines, enabling relatively easy fab upgrades. That said, upgrading Fab 23 phase 2 to N4 and N5 should not be a big challenge for TSMC, but might require some redesigns as the N4 production line requires more EUV lithography tools, and these are physically larger than DUV tools. In fact, back in 2023, the company already mulled enabling N4 production in Kumamoto, so everything might be ready for the installation of more EUV scanners.

One interesting thing to note about TSMC's Fab 23 phase 2 is that while it entered the early phase of physical build-out in late October (according to Nikkei), photos taken at the site in November showed cranes, excavators, and piledrivers on site. However, images captured in early December reveal that nearly all heavy equipment has since been removed. Also, suppliers were notified that work would pause, although no reasons were provided. Furthermore, TSMC reportedly notified its tool suppliers that it would not need new equipment in Japan throughout 2026, which implies that it will not start equipping JASM phase 2 next year due to construction delay, which is barely news given all the information surrounding the facility.TSMC declined to comment on the report. However, it did note that TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei announced the construction start of Fab 21 phase 2 during the company's most recent earnings call.“Next, in Japan, thanks to the strong support from the Japan Central, prefectural, and local governments, our first specialty fab in Kumamoto has already started volume production in late 2024 with very good yield,” said Wei. “The construction of our second fab has begun, and the ramp schedule will be based on our customers' needs and market conditions.”

The RAM is in another castle.

Something's rotten in Mushroom Kingdom, and this time around it's not Bowser's fault. Nintendo's stock price took a 4.7% nosedive today, due to predictions that the Japanese console maker won't be able to keep its profit margins as high as expected. As has become the norm these days, the fear is caused by the ongoing RAM and chip availability crisis, as AI datacenters grab any transistor that's not nailed to the floor.

The latest dip wiped $14 billion off Nintendo's market cap and brought the stock roughly to its May price, eroding gains made since then. It's also the second hit in as many days, with the weekly drop being about 9.8%. The production cost for the Switch 2 has risen substantially, given that it uses 12 GB RAM chips whose cost has reportedly risen by 41% in Q4 alone.

Adding insult to injury, the NAND flash onboard the console also saw an 8% aggravation. Bloomberg notes that this rise in storage pricing will also reflect itself on storage cards, further cementing statements previously made by OEMs like Transcend and Adata, some of which are even unable to secure flash chips to begin with. The Reuters report also points out that microSD cards aren't really optional, as some titles chew up most of the Switch 2's capacity.

Stockholders are right to be concerned, as reports from earlier in the year remark that Nintendo was apparently selling the Switch 2 at a very slim profit margin, with some outfits estimating that non-Japanese sales could be at a simple break-even point, or even at a loss. The U.S. tariff situation is only likely to complicate that matter further.

Having said all that, the Switch 2 actually sold at an aggressive price during Black Friday, effectively bundling Mario Kart World for free with the console, so it's not impossible that Nintendo saw where the RAM winds were heading and took the appropriate precautions beforehand.

Plus, even with this latest dip, the stock is still up around 25% for the year. Add to that the fact that Nintendo almost certainly makes the lion's share of its money from games rather than hardware, and maybe this situation is just a temporary concern.

Every fall, something predictable happens across tech companies of every size. Teams who can architect systems, debug impossible bugs, and ship product under pressure suddenly hit a surprising moment of hesitation:

Open Enrollment.

It's the time of year when even the most capable engineers, founders, and operators pause in front of a benefits grid trying to make sense of deductibles, copays, networks, and plan names that seem to shift just enough each year to make the familiar unfamiliar again.

And in a workplace where decisions are constant — from product roadmaps to sprint planning — the mental load of choosing health benefits hits differently. It's personal. It's financial. It's high stakes. And it shows up right when the year is at its most demanding.

What most people don't say out loud is this:Open Enrollment doesn't feel hard because the information is complex.It feels hard because the decision matters.

Tech is a magnet for problem-solvers. But benefits aren't a problem to solve; they're a system to navigate — and one with moving parts. Plans change. Rates change. Networks shift. What made sense last year might not be the smartest choice this year.

Take the 2026 updates, for example. Medical plans saw adjustments, including a clearer design for the TechStarter 7000 plan where the deductible and out-of-pocket maximum now align. Dental plans added richer preventive coverage through the new Max Wellness 2500 option. Vision plans expanded LightCare benefits for screen-heavy work. Life insurance maximums increased to meet the needs of growing families. And mental health support transitioned fully to SupportLinc, bringing modernized EAP services with only a minor rate impact.

These updates are meaningful — but for the average employee, they're also one more layer to interpret.

Tech professionals often ask themselves the same questions:What if I pick the wrong plan? How do I know which option is truly right for my family? Is this benefit worth the cost?

It's decision fatigue, but with higher emotional stakes.

Founders and HR leaders often tell us the same thing:

“We don't need more options — we need clarity.”

Benefits shouldn't feel like a scavenger hunt or a crash course in insurance terminology. They should feel like a system built to reduce friction, not add to it.

That's where ALLtech was built differently.

Instead of asking employers to assemble benefits from scratch, ALLtech brings structure to the complexity. It's a trust designed specifically for Washington tech companies, combining high-quality carriers with a curated experience that removes guesswork and makes decisions easier for both employer and employee.

The goal isn't to overwhelm people with choices; it's to give them better ones, delivered in a way that makes sense for how tech teams work.

Ask any engineer what makes a system great, and you'll hear the same themes:

ALLtech approaches benefits with that same philosophy.

Through partnerships with Regence BlueShield, Delta Dental of Washington, VSP Vision Care, The Standard, and SupportLinc, ALLtech offers tech employers a cohesive benefits experience instead of a fragmented one. The structure is intentional — a platform that evolves alongside the companies it serves.

For 2026, that evolution includes:

These aren't small updates. They're part of a long-term strategy to make benefits feel easier — not because they are simpler, but because they are better structured.

Open Enrollment is often treated like a compliance moment: check the box, confirm your choices, move on.

But for employees, it's something more personal — a reflection of how supported they feel at work.

When benefits are confusing, employees feel it.When benefits are clear, employees feel that too.

For 2026, ALLtech's updates are designed to help Washington tech teams enter Open Enrollment with confidence instead of hesitation. Employees can evaluate plans more simply. Employers can communicate changes more clearly. And everyone can make decisions with a little less weight on their shoulders.

In a year where every company is thinking carefully about retention, culture, and long-term sustainability, that clarity matters.

Your team won't remember every line item in the benefits guide. But they will remember how supported they felt while making the decision.

Benefits are more than a cost.They're a signal — about culture, about care, about the type of company you're building.

When you choose a system built for innovators, creators, and high-performance teams, you send a message:

“We thought about you. We designed this with you in mind.”

And that message lands every time an employee books a doctor's visit, fills a prescription, gets new glasses, or seeks support in a stressful moment.

Open Enrollment may come once a year.But the impact lasts all year long.

                Reading time 2 minutes
      

Tonight at the Game Awards, we finally got a first look at Capcom and Paramount Pictures' upcoming Street Fighter film, which wasted no time getting down to all the action.

While there may have been some reservations about whether a live-action Street Fighter movie would have the juice to look the part without coming off as too goofy to be legitimately hype, we have to admit, it certainly shut us up a little bit. The trailer was a mile a minute, referencing while showing off its illustrious list of actors and wrestlers in full costumes, and dare we say they looked pretty decent for Hollywood cosplay of video game characters. The trailer itself was mostly a hodgepodge of action with very little hinting toward what its actual story might be, but it's really there for that at the moment. Let's watch Chun Li kick fools, Guile do his flash kick, and folks and cars alike get air-juggled.

As far as the last Street Fighter film endeavors go, those being the Jean-Claude Van Damme one and that other one about Chun Li you likely forgot about, this film definitely leaned more heavily into embracing the camp of the games' nonstop action. Aesthetically, though, the game seems to be taking more pointers from its newest game, Street Fighter VI‘s more neon-drenched urban look. All the better to make Cody Rhode's Guile hair look just that much more pronounced.

In case the rapid-fire role call of video game characters was too fast for you, here's the who's who of Street Fighter and the actors bringing them to life:

Time will tell whether the film will have a story mode as raucous as its trailer's unbridled arcade action. But from this first look, director Kitao Sakurai definitely left a good first impression of what's to come when the movie hits theaters in 2026.

World, the biometric ID verification project co-founded by Sam Altman, released the newest version of its app today, debuting several new features, including an encrypted chat integration and an expanded, Venmo-like capability for sending and requesting crypto. 

World was created by the startup Tools for Humanity in 2019, and originally launched its app in 2023. The company says that, in a world roiled by AI-generated digital fakery, it hopes to create digital “proof of human” tools that can help separate the humans from the bots. 

During a small gathering at World's headquarters in San Francisco on Thursday, Altman and World's co-founder and CEO, Alex Blania, briefly introduced the new version of the app (which developers have termed a “super app”) before the product team took over to explain the new features. During his remarks, Altman said that the concept for World grew out of conversations he and Blania had had about the need to create a new kind of economic model. That model, based around web3 principles, is what World has been trying to accomplish through its verification network. “It's really hard to both identify unique people and do that in a privacy-preserving way,” said Altman.

World Chat, the app's new messenger, seems designed to do just that. It uses end-to-end encryption to keep users' conversations safe (this encryption is described as being equivalent to Signal, the privacy-focused messenger), and also leverages color-coded speech bubbles to alert users to whether the person they're talking to has been verified by World's system or not, the company said. The idea is to incentivize verification, giving people the power to know whether the person they're talking to is who they say they are. Chat was originally launched in beta in March.

The other big feature reveal on Thursday was an expanded digital payment system that allows app users to send and receive cryptocurrency. World app has functioned as a digital wallet for some time, but the newest version of the app includes broader capabilities. Using virtual bank accounts, users can also receive paychecks directly into World App and make deposits from their bank accounts, both of which can then be converted into crypto. You don't have be verified by World's authentication system to use these features.

Tiago Sada, World's chief product officer, told TechCrunch that part of the reason chat was added was to create a more interactive experience for users. “What we kept hearing from people is that they wanted a more social World app,” Sada said. World Chat is designed to fill that need, creating what Sada says is a secure way to communicate. “It took a lot of work to make this feature-rich messenger that is similar to a WhatsApp or a Telegram, but with encryption and security of something that is a lot closer to Signal,” Sada said.

World (which was originally called Worldcoin) deploys a unique authentication process: Interested humans get their eyes scanned at one of the company's offices, where the Orb — a large verification device — converts the person's iris into a unique and encrypted digital code. That code, the verified World ID, can then be used by the person to interact with World's ecosystem of services, which are available through its app.

The addition of more social-friendly features is clearly meant to drive broader adoption of the app, which makes sense since scaling verification is the company's main challenge. Altman has said that he would like the project to scan a billion people's eyes, but Tools for Humanity claims to have scanned less than 20 million people.  

Since standing in long lines at a corporate office to have your eyeballs scanned by a giant metallic ball may seem slightly less than enticing to some users, the company has already sought to make its verification process less cumbersome. In April, Tools for Humanity announced its Orb Minis — hand-held, phone-like devices — that allow users to scan their own eyes from the comfort of their homes. Blania previously told TechCrunch that, eventually, the company would like to turn the Orb Minis into a mobile point-of-sale device or sell its ID sensor tech to device manufacturers. If the company takes such steps, it would drop the barrier to verification significantly, potentially inspiring much more widespread adoption.

President Donald Trump signed a highly anticipated executive order on Thursday that sets in motion a plan to establish a national regulatory framework for artificial intelligence while undercutting states' abilities to enact their own rules.

The order, titled “Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence,” creates an AI litigation task force within the Justice Department to directly challenge state AI laws the administration finds to conflict with federal policy. It also directs the Department of Commerce to craft guidelines that could make states ineligible for future broadband funding if they pass “onerous” AI laws.

The push for sweeping federal preemption of state AI laws has largely been fueled by AI investors, conservative policy shops, and tech industry trade groups. These groups have argued that a patchwork approach to AI regulation could stunt Silicon Valley's AI boom and reduce America's competitiveness on the global stage. White House AI and crypto adviser David Sacks has been one of the most vocal proponents of a light-touch approach to AI regulation.

“The EO gives your administration tools to push back on the most onerous and excessive state regulations,” Sacks told Trump during Thursday's signing ceremony. “We're not going to push back on all of them. For example, kids safety we're going to protect.”

The order is similar in many respects to an earlier draft obtained by WIRED but with a few key differences. The executive order instructs Sacks and Michael Kratsios, the assistant to the president for science and technology, to prepare a legislative recommendation establishing a federal policy framework for AI. One of the new additions is a carve-out within this legislative recommendation asking Congress not to preempt state AI laws that aim to protect children, promote data center infrastructure, and encourage state governments to procure AI tools.

“We want one central source of approval, and we have great Republican support. I think we probably have Democrat support too, because it's common sense,” Trump said during Thursday's signing ceremony. “Every time you make a change, and it could be a very reasonable change, you still won't get it approved if you have to go to 50 states. This centralizes it.”

In the absence of federal regulations, officials from states across the country have pushed through their own investigations and legislation to govern the use and development of AI. Trump's executive order specifically calls out certain state AI laws—such as Colorado's SB24-205, which aims to limit “algorithmic discrimination” in AI models—as an attempt to “embed ideological bias.”

Several other state AI laws may also fall in the crosshairs of this executive order. California governor Gavin Newsom signed a law in September requiring large tech companies to publish safety frameworks around their AI models. In June, New York's legislature passed a bill that would empower the state's attorney general to bring civil penalties of up to $30 million against AI developers that fail to meet safety standards. That bill is currently sitting on New York governor Kathy Hochul's desk, awaiting her signature or veto—though she's reportedly considering amendments that could weaken the bill significantly.

Shortly before the order was signed on Thursday, several state attorneys general were quick to criticize the Trump administration's attempt to curb state power.

“Now is not the time to let this new technology progress unchecked. AI development and deployment are happening quickly, and state attorneys general are the most agile regulators we have historically,” New York attorney general Letitia James said in a briefing with reporters on Thursday. “It has always been collaboration, not conflict, between state legislatures and Congress that yielded some of the most critical federal legislation in our country's history.”

While the order may set a national tone for AI regulation, Trump does not have the authority to bar states from continuing to pass their own laws. Civil rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have called the order “unconstitutional,” and it's likely to be challenged in court.

Theo Baker is truly an outlier. 

While journalism as a major has seen shrinking enrollment for years and is even being dropped by some schools entirely, Baker, a senior at Stanford University, has doubled down on old-school investigative reporting, and it is paying off spectacularly.

Baker first made headlines as a college freshman when his reporting for The Stanford Daily led to the resignation of Stanford president Marc Tessier-Lavigne. After uncovering allegations of research misconduct spanning two decades, Baker — just one month into college — found himself “receiving anonymous letters, conducting stakeouts, and tracking down confidential sources,” according to his publisher. Meanwhile, high-powered lawyers tried to discredit his work. By year's end, Tessier-Lavigne had resigned, and Baker became the youngest-ever recipient of the George Polk Award, one of journalism's most prestigious honors.

Shortly after, Warner Bros. and famed producer Amy Pascal won a competitive auction for the film rights to his story.

But if that scandal put Baker on the map, his upcoming book may cement his reputation as the rare young journalist willing to challenge Silicon Valley's startup machine. 

“How to Rule the World,” out May 19 — three weeks before he graduates — promises an explosive look at how venture capitalists treat Stanford students as “a commodity,” wooing favored undergrads with slush funds, shell companies, yacht parties, and funding offers before they even have business ideas in their hunt for the next trillion-dollar founder.

“I watched in real time as my peers were taught to cut corners and plied with enormous wealth by people who wanted to exploit their talent,” Baker, who turns 21 next month, tells Axios. Drawing on more than 250 interviews with students, CEOs, VCs, Nobel laureates, and three Stanford presidents, the book aims to expose what Baker describes to Axios as a “weird, money-soaked subculture that has so much influence over the rest of the world.”

It's perhaps an unsurprising move from someone who grew up around top journalists. His father is New York Times chief White House correspondent Peter Baker, and his mother is The New Yorker's Susan Glasser. While his peers chase venture capital funding and six-figure startup salaries, Baker spent his sophomore year reporting and took his junior year off to write, including two months at the Yaddo writers' retreat.

That choice becomes even more striking against the backdrop of journalism's current struggles. While traditional journalism programs fail to fill classes and media outfits face seemingly relentless layoffs, Baker represents something both exciting and increasingly uncommon: a star student betting his career on accountability journalism. Whether he's a harbinger of renewed interest in investigative reporting remains to be seen, but we'd guess his book will capture the attention of plenty of college students — and it will almost certainly make waves in Silicon Valley while doing it.

Mass General Brigham is announcing the spinout of AIwithCare, a company founded by researchers from the health system who developed an artificial intelligence (AI) screening tool that significantly outperformed manual screening for determining a patient's eligibility and enrolling them in a clinical trial.

The tool, RECTIFIER (RAG-Enabled Clinical Trial Infrastructure for Inclusion Exclusion Review), was first developed and studied by researchers at Mass General Brigham's Accelerator for Clinical Transformation. Since the publications of a proof-of-concept study in June 2024 and prospective, randomized-controlled, blinded trial in February 2025, RECTIFIER's use has continued to expand across the healthcare system, with more than 20 active and onboarding use cases in research and clinical operations, including in cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, neurology, pathology and psychiatry.

RECTIFIER represents the first new company spun out by Mass General Brigham involving a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI application developed by researchers within the health system. The development and deployment of the tool was born out of a collaborative effort between the healthcare system's Digital, Personalized Medicine, Accelerator for Clinical Transformation and Innovation groups.

Through AIwithCare, and its AIwithCare Studio platform, the researchers plan to scale this capability to other healthcare systems, hospitals and clinics seeking to match their patient populations with relevant clinical trials and support medical and operational applications with improved analytics.

Building tools that fit smoothly into clinical trial workflows requires cross-functional teams with expertise in clinical practice and with technical aptitude. That includes change management, software development, information security, and product and program management. Our ability to bring all these skills together to develop AI solutions was essential. Now that this work is complete, it will be much easier for others to deploy and benefit from the capabilities."

Jane Moran, Chief Information and Data Officer, Mass General Brigham

RECTIFIER leverages generative AI to screen a patient's electronic health record for information that can determine their eligibility for a clinical trial such as diagnoses, key health indicators and current or past medications. The tool assesses unstructured data available in notes and reports, which are often crucial for determining trial eligibility but are typically inaccessible without a laborious manual review process from research coordinators and clinical staff.

In a 2024 study in NEJM AI, RECTIFIER was found to more accurately identify eligible patients that met a heart failure trial's eligibility criteria when compared to manual screening, and at a far lower cost than traditional methods. A follow-up randomized trial of nearly 4,500 patients, published in JAMA earlier this year, found that the rate of enrollment using RECTIFIER for patient screening was almost double that of traditional manual screening. That study also showed no significant differences in trial eligibility and enrollment rates in separate analyses factoring in patients' race, gender and ethnicity.

"Licensing RECTIFIER is a major milestone in our goal of delivering AI-powered solutions that improve operational workflows, enhance clinical trial efficiency and optimize care delivery pathways," said RECTIFIER research co-senior author and AIwithCare CEO and co-founder Alexander "A.J." Blood, MD, MSc, associate director of the Accelerator for Clinical Transformation and cardiologist in the Heart and Vascular Institute at Mass General Brigham.

"The tool's demonstrated ability to rapidly and accurately identify patients for studies can be a game-changer for research teams and especially for the patients who deserve timely access to clinical trials of cutting-edge therapies," added Sandy Aronson, president and Chief AI Officer, AIwithCare, former executive director of IT and AI at Mass General Brigham Personalized Medicine, and current digital research principal architect for the health system.

In addition to clinical trials, groups at Mass General Brigham are using RECTIFIER to accelerate patient identification and reduce the burden of manual chart review in clinical and population health use cases.

Pediatric gastroenterologists are using RECTIFIER to perform patient referral triage with demonstrated 94.7% accuracy, identifying urgent labs and symptoms buried within clinical notes with 98% accuracy. The Mass General Brigham Population Health Service Organization, a department responsible for improving care for over 650,000 patients through value-based models, has also used RECTIFIER to streamline patient assessment eligibility for a heart failure management program. Additionally, the group is using the tool to accurately identify those above their goal blood pressure, allowing health system resources to be directed towards them to reduce their cardiovascular risk. Other groups are using RECTIFIER to perform high-resolution phenotyping of patients with sickle cell disease or across ALS trials to accelerate patient identification and enrollment for faster access to potentially life-altering therapeutics.

Mass General Brigham Innovation, which facilitated the new company spinout, works with researchers throughout the healthcare system to manage tech transfer commercialization and coordinate industrial relationships such as licensing agreements, formation of new companies and other contracts, in addition to intellectual property (IP) management and general advising, with an ultimate goal of translating novel research advances and innovations from bench to bedside. In the past year alone, Mass General Brigham Innovation had more than 1,400 active licenses, more than 600 new inventions disclosed, and nearly 200 issued U.S. patents.

Advancing AI that can streamline matching patients with clinical trials reflects our commitment to practical innovation that strengthens patient care and expands access to promising therapies. Deploying such technology more broadly could help reduce significant barriers in care delivery and ultimately accelerate clinical research."

Chris Coburn, Chief Innovation Officer at Mass General Brigham

The University of Manchester's Centre of Excellence in Biopharmaceuticals (COEBP) has developed a biopharmaceutical manufacturing platform that allows rapid isolation of high-producing CHO cell populations.

The researchers needed to evaluate the antibody titer in hundreds of study samples. Due to the substantial manual processing necessary for ELISA, cell cultures were frozen to regulate throughput. Data was obtained retrospectively, delaying decisions and resulting in lengthy, unproductive periods.

The lab introduced antibody titer measurement using the Amperia™ system, streamlining measurement from crude samples and enabling same-day results.

Freezing and thawing cell cultures can delay reintroduction into productive workflows. Reducing the need for sample freezing helped limit extended periods of unproductive time.

Amperia™ reduces the need to batch and store samples prior to analysis, helping avoid delays of up to three weeks.

Abselion started in 2018, at that time under the name HexagonFab, in a small corner of a laboratory at the University of Cambridge.

We set out with the humble goal to make protein research simpler. Scientists should be able to pursue their passion for discovery and innovation, rather than spend their valuable time with tedious, manual tasks. With RED we had access to the ideal technology to create this product. A product that is so compact that it could fit on every bench, and so affordable that it is accessible to everyone. Over the years we have designed, built and tested our first product Amperia and we're proud to introduce it to the world.​

Using menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in women with inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, according to the results of a matched prospective analysis presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), held December 9-12, 2025.

Women who inherit a pathogenic mutation in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are advised to follow the recommended guidance to have their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed (a procedure known as bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) at relatively early ages to safeguard against their elevated risk of ovarian and/or fallopian tube cancer, said study presenter Joanne Kotsopoulos, PhD, a scientist at the Women's College Hospital Research and Innovation Institute and a professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto in Canada.

Removing the ovaries can induce early menopause. Although MHT can treat the symptoms of menopause, many patients might not want to take MHT if they perceive MHT to be unsafe and instead suffer unnecessarily with the symptoms, Kotsopoulos explained. "We cannot simply recommend a drastic surgery like oophorectomy for young women without offering a way for them to manage the well-established short- and long-term outcomes of surgical menopause," she said. "I believe we should educate patients and their health care providers on how we can safely balance the risks and benefits of MHT use to ensure longevity and improve quality of life. 

Unfortunately, there has been a lot of reluctance and misinformation regarding MHT, which is mostly attributable to findings from studies conducted in the general population (those without BRCA mutations) showing an association between MHT use and an increased risk of breast cancer. To help manage the side effects of oophorectomy safely in women with BRCA mutations, we need data from well-designed observational studies of MHT use in this specific population who, due to their genetics, face elevated risks of breast cancer."

Joanne Kotsopoulos, PhD, scientist at the Women's College Hospital Research and Innovation Institute and professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto

Kotsopoulos and colleagues conducted a matched prospective analysis-a type of observational study-in which they tried to recreate the conditions of a clinical trial by analyzing data from women with menopause (mostly induced by surgery) and whether they used MHT. Patients with a history of cancer, patients who had received a bilateral mastectomy, and non-menopausal patients were excluded.

The researchers created 676 matched pairs of women who did and did not use MHT after menopause, with pair-matching based on whether they carried BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, birth year, and age at menopause. Participants ranged in age from 22 to 76, with an average age of 43.8.

Participants who used MHT took one of several different formulations: estrogen alone, progesterone alone, estrogen and progesterone, tibolone, or conjugated estrogen and bazedoxifene.

After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years-which used the date of first MHT use in the MHT-exposed group as the starting point-the researchers found that incident breast cancer cases were significantly less in the women who used MHT, with 87 cases in the MHT-exposed group versus 128 cases in the MHT-naïve group.

When the investigators analyzed the data by which MHT formulation was used, most of the different MHTs were not associated with the risk of breast cancer (neither an increase nor a decrease in risk). However, two formulations were associated with decreased risk of breast cancer. Women who received estrogen-only MHT were 63% less likely to develop breast cancer than their MHT-naïve counterparts. And of the 43 women who received conjugated estrogen and bazedoxifene, none of them developed subsequent breast cancer. "Although based on smaller numbers, this is definitely an exciting and interesting area for future research," Kotsopoulos said. "Hypothetically, conjugated estrogen and bazedoxifene could be used to mitigate breast cancer risk by avoiding progesterone, which is thought to be the breast cancer risk-associated component of MHT. Future trials will be necessary to test this hypothesis."

There were no significant differences in the results whether patients carried a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant, an indication that underscores MHT's safety for carriers of BRCA mutations, according to Kotsopoulos.

"Our findings suggest that clinicians should take a personalized approach to menopause management for women with BRCA mutations who are suffering from the impact of surgical (or natural) menopause, if there are no contraindications for them," said Kotsopoulos.

Limitations of the study were noted and included a follow-up time of 5.6 years and small patient numbers in certain subgroups, such as the number of women enrolled carrying a BRCA2 mutation.

The study was funded by Breast Cancer Canada and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

Cell line creation is a major success factor in biologics manufacturing. It establishes the basis for product yield, quality, and long-term process stability. However, despite significant breakthroughs in host engineering, vector systems, and culture conditions, early-stage clone selection is still one of the least analytically supported stages of development.1

Therapeutic proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, enzymes, and fusion proteins, are becoming increasingly essential components of current treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and genetic disorders.

Each of these modalities requires a well-characterized and scalable manufacturing cell line. This makes cell line development a technical requirement and strategic imperative for biopharmaceutical companies.

In this interview, industry expert Dr. Raj Singh discusses the PathoVerse, a pioneering global digital ecosystem designed to transform pathology through connectivity, AI integration, and collaborative innovation across research and clinical practice. 

As a practicing pathologist, I saw how fragmented our field had become. Different vendors, systems, and formats made true collaboration almost impossible. With PathPresenter, our goal was to simplify one of the biggest challenges in pathology: managing images at scale. We built a platform that pathologists could use daily without worrying about interoperability.

Over time, as our community grew to more than 70,000 users across 180 countries, we realized we had the foundation to create something even larger: a vendor-agnostic global ecosystem where clinicians, researchers, and technology partners could unite. That vision became the PathoVerse.

We built three interconnected modules. The first is the clinical and consultation platform, which supports enterprise-level case management and includes an FDA-approved viewer that handles all image types – pathology, radiology, cytology, and gross images.

The second is the education platform, which powers digital classrooms in more than 30 institutions. The third is the biobanking and research platform, which enables HIPAA-compliant data sharing with researchers, pharma, and AI developers.

Together, these modules cover everything a pathologist does on a day-to-day basis.

Our biggest differentiators are deep domain knowledge and absolute interoperability. PathPresenter is compatible with any scanner, LIS, AI module, or storage architecture. Because it was created by practicing pathologists, it reflects real-world workflows and needs.

It is not a static product but a living, evolving platform shaped by constant feedback from thousands of users worldwide. It is used in over 60 institutions, including major names like MSKCC, Cincinnati Children's, and Dr. Lal PathLabs.

AI is valuable only when it is connected to the wider ecosystem. A standalone model has little impact. We integrate AI directly into PathPresenter, allowing it to be used by pathologists, oncologists, researchers, and even patients to interpret results. By embedding validated AI tools into a secure, scalable infrastructure, we ensure that breakthroughs from leading AI companies reach real-world clinical practice.

The PathoVerse is a collaborative digital ecosystem that connects pathology data, technology, AI, and human expertise to enable real-world innovation. Pathology is evolving rapidly with advances in 3D imaging, virtual staining, digital twins, and AI diagnostics, yet many of these tools exist in isolation.

The PathoVerse bridges these silos, offering a unified infrastructure where technologies, datasets, and workflows can come together seamlessly, enabling shared progress across research, diagnostics, and education. It is all about turning silos into integrated systems.

ConsultConnect is the fastest and easiest way for organizations to implement digital pathology, as it removes the logistical bottlenecks that make consultations slow and expensive. When we talk about consultations, there is often friction at every step. Cases may come from sister hospitals or external labs, yet most systems still cannot communicate with each other. In some places, even departments within the same hospital remain disconnected.

Traditionally, a consultation can take between five and 14 days, but the problem has never been a lack of expertise; pathologists are more than ready to provide their insights. The real barrier has always been logistics. It is almost unbelievable that in an age where we can stream data from Mars, we still ship glass slides in boxes. Slides can break or get lost, and patient information is often re-entered manually, adding even more delays.

ConsultConnect removes all these barriers. Through AWS, we can set up secure web portals for institutions in a matter of days. Hospitals can upload digital slides and case data, and our HL7 middleware transfers the information directly into the recipient's LIS or dashboard. The pathologist reviews the case, adds any stains or notes, and sends the report back through the same portal.

With partners like Grundium, we also provide pathways to easier scanner accessibility at referring sites. Institutions using ConsultConnect pay only per consultation once the service starts. This approach enables hospitals to launch a digital consultation network rapidly, demonstrate revenue potential, and prove that digital pathology can serve as a growth engine rather than an expense.

For patients, ConsultConnect means faster access to expert opinions and better continuity of care. It transforms a once slow and fragmented process into a connected, efficient workflow that embodies the true purpose of the PathoVerse: collaboration without barriers.

For institutions, the PathoVerse creates new revenue streams, enables global consultation networks, and simplifies the deployment of digital pathology. For patients, it provides faster, more accurate access to specialized diagnostics regardless of location. Ultimately, it accelerates how ideas move from concept to real-world clinical solutions.

Digital pathology should no longer be seen as a cost. When implemented strategically, it becomes a growth engine. Departments can offer consults or even AI analysis as a service, generating revenue while improving diagnostic efficiency. Institutions that adopt this model are already seeing measurable operational and financial benefits.

We are just at the beginning. Our goal is to connect hospitals, researchers, and technology companies across every region of the world. The PathoVerse will continue expanding throughout the Middle East, Asia, and South America, building a federated network that supports seamless access, consultation, and data sharing. By working together, we can truly transform how pathology contributes to precision medicine and global healthcare.

The PathoVerse is evolving into a global collaboration engine for pathology. Institutions are moving beyond the question of why to go digital and are now asking how to expand it across diagnosis, education, and AI research. Future growth will include AI-as-a-service offerings, broader consult networks, and deeper integration with partners such as AWS, Grundium, Imagenomix, and MSKCC.

Our mission remains clear: to connect every pathologist, laboratory, and data system worldwide, making pathology a connected, insight-driven cornerstone of precision medicine.

New analysis from a WHO global expert committee on vaccine safety has found that, based on available evidence, no causal link exists between vaccines and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The conclusion reaffirms WHO's position that childhood vaccines do not cause autism.

The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), established in 1999, brings together international experts to provide independent and authoritative scientific advice to WHO on global vaccine safety related priorities.

The latest analysis, discussed by the Committee on 27 November 2025, focused first on the relationship between thiomersal-containing vaccines and ASD, and the association between vaccines in general and ASD. Evidence based on 31 primary research studies, published between January 2010 and August 2025, including data from multiple countries, strongly supports the positive safety profile of vaccines used during childhood and pregnancy, and confirms the absence of a causal link with ASD.

The Committee also assessed the review of potential health risks associated with vaccines with aluminum adjuvants, drawing on studies conducted from 1999 through March 2023. In addition, it reviewed a recent large cohort study analyzing nationwide registry data of children born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018. In summary, the available high-quality evidence shows no association between the trace amounts of aluminum used in some vaccines and ASD, supporting the ongoing use of vaccines with aluminum adjuvants.

Following its review, GACVS reaffirms its previous conclusions from 2002, 2004 and 2012: vaccines, including those with thiomersal and/or aluminum, do not cause autism.

WHO advises all national authorities to rely on the latest science and ensure vaccine policies are grounded in the strongest available evidence. Global childhood immunization efforts represent one of the greatest achievements in improving lives, livelihoods and the prosperity of societies. During the past 50 years, childhood immunization has saved at least 154 million lives.

 December 12, 2025  

Alex Garlick worked in Congress during the 2017 debate over whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was one of the most memorable years for federal healthcare policy in recent memory.

He's now a political science professor at the University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, where he analyzes the ability of healthcare lobbyists to wield influence and shape policy reforms, and how that ends up increasing prices for everyone. Garlick's research on the topic and his own experience in Congress served as the foundation to write a new book, “Pre-existing Conditions: How Lobbying Makes American Health Care More Expensive,” which was published in October.

Garlick talked to Medscape Medical News for a Q&A about his book and what his research tells us about how special interest spending can block wide-scale changes in the healthcare system and what can be done to combat lobbying efforts and reduce healthcare costs. Answers have been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Why did you decide to write this book?

I worked in Congress in 2017, when the effort to repeal and replace the ACA was going on, so that was really like a front-row seat to see just how many interests and lobbyists were involved in the issue. And while that reform didn't pass, I think it really informed the country on how the ACA worked, and many of the policy battles we've seen since then have kind of echoed some lessons of that, including this fall with the government shutdown.

Political scientists have not always believed that lobbyists have a major impact on policies that are made. But when I look at healthcare finance policy in particular, I think that this is an issue where lobbyists are particularly influential in their ability to stop cost containment policies from being put into effect.

Now that the country is seemingly having a cost of living or affordability crisis, it's getting more attention. And I think the influence of lobbyists is more important to understand now than ever.

In your book, your research shows that, at the state level, each individual healthcare lobbyist adds about $7 to healthcare costs. How did you come to that number, and what does that mean for healthcare costs as a whole?

The data from the book look at changes in each state's per capita expenditures on healthcare. So how much do the people living in each state pay for healthcare? And what we see is that when more healthcare industry lobbyists are in each state, year over year, there tends to be less healthcare legislation that's introduced, and the costs tend to rise more.

I see that as a function of the fact that many efforts at regulating the healthcare industry are going to make things more affordable for patients and consumers. And when legislators or bureaucrats are putting less effort into regulating their healthcare market, costs tend to inflate higher, and that's why we see each individual lobbyist associated with higher spending in each state.

So then how does health lobbying shape what reforms are even viable for state legislatures to take on?

The major way lobbying affects the policies that are considered is that lobbyists can almost dictate what legislators will work on. And what I mean by that is healthcare is a very complicated subject to understand and to legislate. The best way to understand the healthcare field is to talk to healthcare professionals.

So, when legislators are relying on the healthcare industry for information, it gives the industry lobbyists leverage and the ability to broker what information will be given to lawmakers to make them more comfortable and able to legislate on an issue.

Moving to the federal level, are there any examples in Congress right now that show how lobbyists have been effective in shaping healthcare policy?

The $50 billion rural hospital transformation fund [included in the domestic tax bill passed earlier this year] is an acknowledgment that the future cuts that are going to come to Medicaid are going to disproportionately affect rural hospitals that rely on Medicaid reimbursements to keep the lights on.

I think that it is in some ways an indication of the effectiveness of the hospital lobby that they were able to get the Senate to acknowledge the future cuts to Medicaid were going to affect hospitals in particular. This fund was an effort by the Senate to shore up the hospitals, and it's also an opportunity for states and hospitals to have their lobbyists continue to have an impact.

Zooming back to Vermont — because that's where you work and do research — what can other states learn from Vermont in terms of trying to lower healthcare prices?

First of all, healthcare is not very affordable in Vermont, and I think there are kind of two lessons that can be learned from that.

I think the first lesson is you don't want to let a hospital monopoly dominate your market the way that it does in Vermont. The University of Vermont Medical Center charges much higher prices than independent providers do around the state….Those costs really add up for the insurers and then eventually for the residents of Vermont over time.

In terms of a positive lesson for Vermont, Vermont has a regulator with the ability to approve or reject upcoming price changes year over year. It's called the Green Mountain Care Board. In recent years, the Green Mountain Care Board has had showdowns with the University of Vermont Medical Center, which kind of shows the ability of a powerful regulator to make things slightly more affordable for residents.

Last year, the Green Mountain Care Board rejected a hospital-projected price increase. The response of the hospital was pretty disruptive, as the CEO of the hospital system actually left, and the hospital is now under new leadership. While I'm not privy to what happened on the hospital side, it's clear that the regulator has had an impact on the business model of what the hospital is doing there.

What are some other policy ideas that you might have for healthcare cost containment?

I think the tool that legislators and bureaucrats should be eager to look for is ways to increase the supply of healthcare providers, particularly in hard-to-reach areas such as rural areas. Because in some ways, healthcare is like other parts of the marketplace. When supply is restricted, prices go up because healthcare demand does not seem to be going down anywhere….When personnel is lacking, hospitals end up paying exorbitant prices for travel nurses or having to patch things up on a short-term basis.

The other thing I think that legislators should be thinking about is how to address prices directly. Wholesale administrative price controls have been attempted before in the country. Preventing the emergence of vertical or horizontal monopolies is another way to protect patients. If healthcare is going to be provided in the open market, at least give patients a chance.

New evidence reveals how everyday processed foods may disrupt gut barriers and amplify inflammation, while targeted dietary strategies offer promising ways to improve outcomes in Crohn's disease.



Conceptual framework linking ultra-processed foods (UPFs) to mechanistic pathways, inflammatory cascade, clinical outcomes, and dietary interventions in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 

In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, a group of researchers synthesized evidence linking ultra-processed foods (UPFs) to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) risk, activity, mechanisms, and therapeutic dietary strategies.

More than half of calories in many nations now come from UPFs, paralleling rising IBD, which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), disorders that disrupt school, work, and family life.

The NOVA classification defines UPFs as industrial formulations rich in refined substrates and additives. Large cohorts link higher UPF intake with CD more than UC. Additives such as emulsifiers, carrageenan (CGN), and maltodextrin (MDX) can impair the intestinal barrier and microbiome, and many rely on packaged meals, hence guidance matters.

Further research is needed to standardize exposure, test mechanisms, and personalize nutrition, while also recognizing that prospective cohorts remain vulnerable to unmeasured confounding and early disease-driven dietary change.

This narrative review was conducted with a structured approach to summarize epidemiological, mechanistic, and therapeutic evidence. Investigators searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus from January 2010 through March 2025 using combinations of terms for UPF, the NOVA, IBD, CD, and UC, and for specific additives such as emulsifiers (such as CMC), CGN, and MDX.

Additional mechanistic evidence on non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS), titanium dioxide (E171), and high salt derived from supplementary targeted searches rather than the core predefined strategy.

Reference lists of key studies and reviews were hand-searched. Human studies were eligible if they defined exposure by NOVA or additive doses and reported incident IBD, disease activity, relapse, or surgery.

Mechanistic models in animals or intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were included when doses approximated dietary exposure, although many experiments still used concentrations higher than typical human intake.

Extraction captured exposure assessments (for example, food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)), outcome measures, and effect estimates including hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR), and relative risk (RR).

Study quality, potential confounding by socioeconomic status (SES), and risks of reverse causation were qualitatively considered. Given heterogeneity across designs, populations, and outcomes, quantitative pooling was not attempted. Instead, evidence was synthesized narratively across three domains: epidemiology, mechanisms, and therapeutic implications, emphasizing recency, biological plausibility, and clinical relevance.

Outcomes were cross-checked for consistency in cohorts, while noting that NOVA classification inconsistency contributes to exposure misclassification.

Across multinational cohorts, higher UPF intake was consistently associated with greater CD risk, with weaker or null findings for UC. In the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology cohort, five or more daily UPF servings were linked to incident IBD versus fewer than one (HR approximately 1.8).

Three large United States cohorts showed a dose-response association with CD, not UC. The NutriNet-Santé cohort reported no significant association, likely limited by few events and short follow-up. In the UK Biobank, the highest UPF intake predicted about a twofold higher CD risk (HR approximately 2.0) and a greater likelihood of IBD-related surgery. 

Among patients, higher UPF intake correlated with active disease (OR approximately 3.8), and a remission cohort had more relapses over one year with the highest intake (HR approximately 3.9). Meta-analyses supported these signals, with a pooled RR of approximately 1.7 for CD and approximately 1.3 for overall IBD. However, the authors emphasize that these associations do not establish causality and require cautious interpretation, particularly because UPF consumption may correlate with broader lifestyle patterns that are difficult to fully adjust for.

Mechanistic data provide plausibility. Emulsifiers such as CMC and P80 thin mucus, promote bacterial encroachment, reduce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and shift the microbiota toward proinflammatory profiles, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT), CMC altered the microbiota, lowered fecal SCFAs, and increased abdominal discomfort. CGN activates toll-like receptor (TLR), Bcl10, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in IECs and accelerates relapse in UC in a double-blind RCT. MDX enhances adherence and biofilm formation by adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), impairs antimicrobial defenses, and worsens colitis in interleukin-10, deficient mice. 

NNS can impair human glucose tolerance via microbiome-dependent mechanisms. In models, E171 interacts with mucus and immune pathways; the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) no longer considers E171 safe as a food additive. High-salt diets, common with UPFs, reduce Lactobacillus species, deplete SCFAs, and promote T helper 17 cell (Th17) inflammation.

The review notes that many mechanistic studies use high, continuous exposures that may not reflect typical human diets, and that translating these findings to clinical risk requires careful dose-response evaluation.

Therapeutic evidence converges on reducing UPFs and selected additives. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) remains first-line induction for pediatric CD and likely works partly by removing habitual exposures.

Partial enteral nutrition (PEN) is more acceptable but requires careful food selection. The Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED) plus PEN was non-inferior to EEN for induction and improved maintenance. Minimally processed patterns such as a Mediterranean-style diet or the Specific Carbohydrate Diet improve symptoms for some patients, though adherence and adult data vary.

Additive-focused approaches suggest benefits from CGN avoidance in UC and from low-microparticle diets targeting E171. The review emphasizes that evidence is strongest for pediatric CD, with adult and UC evidence still limited and heterogeneous, and that dietary strategies remain adjunctive rather than stand-alone therapy.

Evidence from cohorts, mechanistic models, and trials indicates that UPF consumption is associated with higher CD risk and may worsen outcomes across IBD, with weaker signals for UC.

Additives, including CMC, P80, CGN, MDX, E171, and high salt, plausibly erode barrier function, shift the microbiome, diminish SCFAs, and activate TLR and NF-κB pathways and Th17 cell responses. Clinically, EEN, the CDED, and minimally processed patterns offer benefit.

Patients and families can prioritize meals while clinicians personalize plans, standardize tools, and support trials, but the authors note that professional guidelines currently prioritize whole-food dietary patterns rather than categorical UPF elimination because causal evidence is still emerging.

A new randomized trial reveals how simple food choices before and after fasted HIIT can shift the body's oxidative stress and recovery patterns, offering practical guidance for tailoring nutrient timing to support training goals.



Study: Acute Impact of Polyphenol-Rich vs. Carbohydrate-Rich Foods and Beverages on Exercise-Induced ROS and FRAP in Healthy Sedentary Female Adults - A Randomized Controlled Trial. Image Credit: Improvisor / Shutterstock

University of Vienna researchers recently conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of polyphenol-rich foods and carbohydrate-rich foods in mitigating oxidative stress during exercise. The findings, published in the journal Antioxidants, highlighted the benefits of carbohydrates during exercise and of polyphenols during recovery under fasted, high-intensity conditions, and in a sedentary female population.

Exercise-induced oxidative stress is a well-established condition in sports. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during exercise have both beneficial and detrimental effects, depending on their concentration and timing.

Excessive ROS production is associated with impaired muscle contraction, poor recovery, and muscle soreness. Chronic exposure to ROS increases the risk of various diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and age-related pathologies.

Physiological levels of ROS, on the other hand, play vital roles in strengthening muscle and improving antioxidant defense mechanisms. This dual role of ROS highlights the existence of an optimal physiological state in which moderate levels of oxidative stress and inflammation optimize exercise performance and recovery.

Diet plays an essential role in modulating exercise-induced oxidative stress. Carbohydrates may attenuate oxidative stress by reducing physiological stress and inflammatory responses rather than directly scavenging ROS in vivo, although glucose and sucrose have shown radical-scavenging properties in vitro.

Polyphenols, a diverse group of plant-derived compounds, have gained significant attention in medical science due to their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Polyphenol-enriched whole foods have shown significantly greater physiological relevance in mitigating oxidative stress than conventional high-dose vitamin supplements, as vitamins at higher concentrations have been found to suppress the body's internal antioxidant defense system.

To provide a comprehensive overview of the impact of dietary interventions on exercise-induced oxidative stress, researchers at the University of Vienna designed a randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of carbohydrate- and polyphenol-rich foods in mitigating oxidative stress during resistance-circuit high-intensity interval training.

This randomized controlled trial initially randomized 45 women, of whom 30 completed the full protocol, comprising healthy, sedentary females aged 19 to 33 years. Four types of foods were analyzed in the study, including two polyphenol-rich foods (pomegranate juice and blueberries) and two carbohydrate-rich foods (whole-grain bread and bread roll).

The participants were randomly assigned to two study arms: one included blueberries, whole-grain bread, and bread rolls, and the other included pomegranate juice. Within each study arm, participants randomly consumed each of the included foods after a 12-hour fast, with a washout period of at least seven days between intervention days. In both study arms, water intake served as a control condition.

On each intervention day, participants performed the resistance training, and blood samples were collected at baseline, immediately before training, immediately after training, and 15 minutes after training. The samples were analyzed to measure ROS (electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy) and total antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing ability of plasma assay, FRAP).

The analysis of control group participants (water intake) revealed a clear induction in ROS levels and total antioxidant capacity following the training session. However, the magnitude of these changes was modest and subject to inter-individual variability, indicating a considerable physiological stress response.

The analysis of intervention group participants revealed that intake of carbohydrate-rich foods significantly attenuated the training-induced elevation in total antioxidant capacity and showed a non-significant trend toward attenuating the training-induced elevation in ROS levels, compared with intake of polyphenol-rich foods or water. These observations highlight a protective role of carbohydrates against oxidative stress, primarily through effects on FRAP rather than consistent significant effects on ROS.

Regarding the intake of polyphenol-rich foods, the study found significant efficacy in enhancing recovery after training. Compared with carbohydrate intake, polyphenol intake significantly reduced ROS levels during the post-exercise recovery period, although no significant differences relative to water were observed.

Regarding total antioxidant capacity, a continuous increase was observed during the recovery period, reflecting the impact of high-intensity training sessions, with no significant differences between the intervention foods during recovery and with changes reflecting redox-system kinetics rather than enhanced antioxidant capacity.

The study highlights the protective efficacy of carbohydrates against exercise-induced oxidative stress and the efficacy of polyphenols in accelerating post-exercise normalization of ROS levels.

The observed benefit of polyphenol intake is particularly significant, as chronic exposure to oxidative stress is associated with impaired recovery, reduced muscle function, and increased risk of tissue damage.

The observed benefit of carbohydrate intake may reflect the fact that sufficient carbohydrate availability reduces exercise-induced oxidative stress by lowering reliance on fat oxidation and minimizing mitochondrial ROS production.

These effects are particularly relevant during endurance exercise, where carbohydrates mitigate cumulative oxidative stress responses from repeated sessions and sustain performance. However, over-suppression of ROS production may impair training adaptations such as muscle strengthening, highlighting the importance of dosage in carbohydrate strategies.

Overall, this study provides valuable information for both athletes and coaches to optimize their performance and training adaptations through nutrition, although the findings should be interpreted cautiously, given that the study population consisted of sedentary young women, the intervention assessed acute, single-session effects, and the fasted-state high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocol does not fully reflect typical training environments.

Given the findings, researchers suggest integrating polyphenol-rich foods in meals consumed before and after training sessions. Regarding carbohydrate-rich foods, they emphasize personalized approaches based on training intensity, duration, and energy demands, while acknowledging that performance impacts were not directly measured in this trial.

A single-dose oral medication called zoliflodacin shows promise as a new treatment for antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea, according to a phase 3 clinical trial published in The Lancet. The study found that one dose of zoliflodacin was as effective as the current standard treatment, which combines two antibiotics: an injection of ceftriaxone followed by an oral dose of azithromycin.Gonorrhoea is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections, affecting over 82 million people globally each year. However, it is increasingly difficult to treat as the bacteria that cause infection develop resistance to current antibiotics. This new medication has the potential to help slow the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and make gonorrhoea treatment more accessible worldwide.The international trial involved more than 900 people from five countries (USA, South Africa, Thailand, Belgium, and the Netherlands). Participants received either the new pill or the standard treatment. Results showed that zoliflodacin cured over 90% of infections at genital sites. The medication was well tolerated, with side effects similar to those seen with current treatments, and no serious safety issues were reported.Zoliflodacin is currently awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If approved, the authors say it could greatly improve global efforts to control drug-resistant gonorrhea infections, support community-led care, and protect reproductive health for millions of people.

Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent and host of KFF Health News' weekly health policy news podcast, "What the Health?" A noted expert on health policy issues, Julie is the author of the critically praised reference book "Health Care Politics and Policy A to Z," now in its third edition.

Congress is running out of time to avert a huge increase in health care premium payments for millions of Americans who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Dec. 15 is the deadline to sign up for coverage that begins Jan. 1, and some consumers are waiting to see whether the credits will be extended, enabling them to afford coverage next year.

Meanwhile, a federal vaccine advisory panel handpicked by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. voted last week to end the universal recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine dose at birth. It's just the start of what are expected to be major changes in childhood vaccine recommendations overall.

This week's panelists are Julie Rovner of KFF Health News, Anna Edney of Bloomberg News, Maya Goldman of Axios, and Sheryl Gay Stolberg of The New York Times.

Among the takeaways from this week's episode:

Also this week, Rovner interviews Georgetown University professor Linda Blumberg about what the GOP's health plans have in common.

Mikel Arteta has delivered a clear message to £64 million signing Viktor Gyokeres, insisting that “two things have to merge” for the Swedish striker to thrive at Arsenal. The manager believes both player adaptation and tactical integration are essential as Gyokeres searches for form. After an injury setback and a slow Premier League start, expectations remain high for the summer arrival.

Gyokeres arrived at Arsenal in the summer after scoring heavily for Sporting CP, but his transition to the Premier League has been slower than expected. The striker managed just one league goal since September and missed crucial development time after joining without a proper pre-season and then picking up an injury. Arteta has repeatedly defended the player's progress, emphasising that adaptation to Arsenal's system and the demands of English football takes time.

His limited goal return has become a talking point as the Gunners battle at the top of the Premier League table, especially after their lead was narrowed following a recent defeat at Aston Villa. Despite Gyokeres' struggles, Arsenal have remained competitive, but Arteta is aware that the No.9 position must eventually provide greater scoring output. With Gabriel Jesus returning to fitness, competition for minutes is intensifying at a key point in the campaign.

As pressure around Gyokeres grows, questions have been raised about whether Arsenal must change their approach to suit him or whether he must mould himself to their tactical demands. Arteta, addressing this balance directly, outlined the combined responsibility needed from both sides. His explanation offers the clearest insight yet into how the club sees Gyokeres' long-term development and what must happen for his £64m move to be considered a success.

Speaking to the media, Arteta explained the shared responsibility between Arsenal and Gyokeres, saying: “I think the two things have to merge. I think we have to put the player in the best possible condition to explode and fulfil his potential. And there are certain things that within the role, in the manner that we play, has to be fulfilled.”

He continued by highlighting the importance of the team around the forward, adding: “And that's a combination of both. And then it's not only that. I think more important is the connections and the players around him at the end.”

Addressing Gyokeres' progress and fitness, Arteta said: “Those interactions, that understanding, how it develops. And before the injury, I think he was in a great place. I think it took him a while at the beginning because, as you said, it's a different league, different demands. He had no pre-season. And now he's starting to get, again, some momentum. And the goals will come, and we're going to be very pleased with him.” Asked what will help unlock the striker's form, he added: “Yes, probably the thing that's going to unlock him is goals, and he's so used to that that I think he needs that for himself, for his confidence, and I think we're going to judge his performances based on that as well. That's logical, but for the rest, I think he's in a really good place. I think physically he's in a good place, and now he needs to start to convert the chances that he's getting.”

Gyokeres was signed to bring a more direct, physically dominant option to Arsenal's attack, a contrast to the fluid movement provided by Jesus. The Swede's impressive scoring record in Portugal created major expectations, but the transition to England has exposed the differences in tempo, physicality and tactical discipline between leagues. Arsenal believe his profile still fits the long-term vision, especially with Arteta seeking more vertical threat and penalty-box presence.

His early adaptation was hindered by arriving without a pre-season, something Arteta repeatedly referenced as a critical factor in his slower start. Players who join late or return from injury often struggle with Arsenal's high-intensity demands, which rely on timing, pressing structure and positional rotations. Gyokeres' lack of rhythm made it difficult for him to integrate in the same way as those who completed a full summer programme.

Arsenal plan to continue giving Gyokeres minutes as he rebuilds sharpness, but he now faces competition from Jesus, whose return naturally increases expectations for goal output. Arteta is convinced that Gyokeres will eventually “explode” once adaptation and tactical cohesion fully align, but patience will be required from fans and analysts alike.

If Gyokeres can begin converting chances, the long-term outlook changes dramatically, as Arsenal believe he has all the tools to become a top Premier League striker. Should the drought continue, pressure will inevitably increase, but Arteta remains publicly unwavering in his support.

World Cup

Ticket prices released by FIFA this week for the men's World Cup in 2026 were, on average, 174 per cent higher than projected in the official bid book submitted by the joint proposal from the United States, Canada and Mexico to soccer's world governing body.

As part of an official FIFA process to be considered to host a World Cup, bidding nations must submit a bid book, which can be studied by both FIFA and federations across the world, who in turn judge its merits and decide who to vote for. The so-called ‘United' bid, which brought the American, Canadian and Mexican bids together under one umbrella, was published by FIFA in March 2018. The bid said that it made projections after “careful research and consultation with various resources and industry experts.”

The bid book's pricing, according to a person familiar with the bid who remains anonymous to protect relationships, leaned on the high side because the United bid was seeking to persuade FIFA and its member associations across the world that the World Cup in North America would return plenty of money into the global soccer ecosystem. Pricing for the World Cup is set by FIFA, with no input for the national soccer federations of the host country.

Yet even the projections made by the United bid do not come close to the prices unveiled by FIFA after the World Cup draw last weekend.



This week, in a phase which opened on Thursday, FIFA sold tickets in its “lottery phase” for specific matches, adjusting its prices based on the anticipated demand for each fixture. It revealed prices for Category One (the highest), as well as Category Two and Category Three. The vanishingly small number of Category Four tickets available in previous phases of sales were not present at all for this lottery phase.

FIFA's average price across the three categories for the opening games (i.e. the three opening matches of the tournament for hosts Canada, Mexico and the United States) was $1,728, compared to the projected average of $569 across the three categories in the bid book. This represents an increase of 204 per cent for those seeking to watch the USMNT play Paraguay, Mexico play South Africa, or Canada play the winner of a UEFA playoff between Wales, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Italy, or Northern Ireland.

An even more dramatic increase is present in the average price across the three categories for the World Cup final, which will take place at MetLife Stadium in New York/New jersey on July 19. While the bid book projected an average price of $1,099 across the three categories, FIFA has increased this by 459 per cent, with their average at $6147.

For the semi-finals, the increase is 197 per cent, up from $733 in the bid book to $2174 in FIFA's released pricing. In the quarter-final, the leap is 153 per cent, increasing to $1044 in FIFA's pricing across the three categories from an average of $412 in the bid book. The increases in the group stage, round of 32 and round of 16 is more modest, but still substantial, with increases of 49 per cent, 61 per cent and 94 per cent respectively.

FIFA's elimination of category four tickets also counters the projections in the bid book, which had indicated that seven per cent of available seating would be set aside for the lowest price point. FIFA did have some of these available in previous phases of sales, priced at $60 for some group stage matchups, but they never confirmed how many existed and those which did appeared to be very small in number, often limited to the upper corners of upper decks of NFL stadiums. Then, on Thursday, the category disappeared altogether for the current sales phase.

The bid book had projected that Category 4 tickets would be available for $21 during the group stages, $31 in the round of 32, $42 in the round of 16, $66 for the quarter-final, $84 for the semi-final and $128 for the final.

FIFA's pricing for the tickets at the World Cup has been criticised by the leading European soccer fans' group. Football Supporters Europe has called on FIFA to “immediately halt” ticket sales for participating member associations (PMA) due to what it calls a “monumental betrayal of the tradition of the World Cup”.

FIFA has been approached for comment but did not do so by the time of publication.

More than two dozen American cities are eager to host matches as part of U.S. Soccer's joint bid with Mexico, Jamaica and Costa Rica for the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup. Those cities, however, declined to sign long-form agreements that FIFA expected ahead of last month's bid deadline.

Leaders of the cities included in the joint bid are seeking the opportunity to negotiate more favorable terms with FIFA before agreeing to anything binding. So far, they have only been willing to sign non-binding, one-page memorandums of understanding provided by U.S. Soccer.

These fall well short of the commitments required to make the bid compliant with FIFA's rules, which state that host city and stadium agreement templates must be submitted “signed and in unaltered form.”

FIFA plans to formally award hosting rights to the four Concacaf member nations at its annual congress on April 30, 2026, in Vancouver. Whether it will do so without more concrete commitments from American host cities remains to be seen.

The financial incentive for FIFA to move ahead with the four-nation bid, which would see most matches held in the U.S., is obvious. Just as the 2026 Men's World Cup in the U.S., Mexico and Canada is expected to shatter revenue records, a Women's World Cup staged largely in the U.S. projects to be the most lucrative women's sporting event ever. U.S. Soccer's bid forecasts the competition generating more than $4 billion in revenue, about seven times the previous record generated by the 2023 edition in Australia and New Zealand, and four times the target for the 2027 tournament in Brazil.

The cities' hesitation to put pen to paper traces back to the experience of the 11 U.S. municipalities preparing to host matches in the 2026 World Cup. Under the agreements they signed in 2017, those cities have taken on most of the costs of hosting matches and FIFA fan fests — a burden local leaders have pegged at $100 million to $200 million per city — while having limited ability to generate offsetting revenue.

FIFA introduced a local sponsorship program meant to be a core fundraising mechanism for cities, but many have found the available assets too limited to appeal to brands. Each city is allowed to sell up to 10 supporter packages (apart from New York/New Jersey, which can sell 20), but the 16 host cities across the U.S., Mexico and Canada have thus far combined to announce only 35 supporters, or 2.2 per city, with six months remaining before the tournament.

FIFA has softened some of its most onerous demands on 2026 host cities, eliminating a requirement that cities provide free public transportation to matches and offering them more flexibility to determine the scope of their fan fests. Still, the prevailing sentiment remains that the terms for 2026 have been too demanding, given that FIFA is the primary financial beneficiary of the event.

“There's had to be this growth and evolution between when the [2026] bid was first sent out to all of us and where we are today,” Zaileen Janmohamed, president and CEO of the Bay Area Host Committee, said at a public event in June. “There has been some progress in that, and I think that progress will continue for the Women's World Cup. I think this will be an evolving model that both sides will just have to continue to iterate on until we try to find something that really sticks and is tight.”

Several representatives for prospective host cities spoke with Sports Business Journal on the condition of anonymity to ensure FIFA doesn't hold their participation against their market in the selection process. They all stressed that they want to host the competition, but need certainty the terms will be more favorable than in 2026.

U.S. Soccer issued a statement, saying in part, “We look forward to continued collaboration with local partners and FIFA as we prepare to deliver a tournament of unprecedented success and drive the women's game forward.”

FIFA declined to comment on its discussions with the cities and the national federation. 

In December 2023, U.S. Soccer and the Mexican Football Federation delivered a joint bid to host the 2027 Women's World Cup. Prior to submission, U.S. Soccer told host cities for the 2026 Men's World Cup that it planned to inform FIFA that the U.S. “will only want to host the Women's World Cup if host city partners are set up for success.” The federations withdrew that bid in April 2024, and FIFA ultimately awarded the 2027 event to Brazil.

In April 2025, U.S. Soccer formally confirmed its interest in teaming with other Concacaf member nations to bid for the 2031 Women's World Cup. The U.S. and its then-unidentified co-bidders were the only countries announced by FIFA as having expressed interest in 2031, but the participating federations would still have to go through a formal bid process. 

U.S. Soccer subsequently began soliciting interest in May from U.S. cities about inclusion in the bid. At an information session for leaders from interested cities in July, U.S. Soccer assured the cities that FIFA's terms would be more practical and take their concerns into account, but the national federation could not yet provide details. 

It wasn't until early November — weeks before the bid submission deadline — that the cities got their first look at FIFA's proposed terms. Multiple sources said the main host city agreement was virtually identical to the contract for the 2026 World Cup, not even reflecting concessions FIFA made in the lead-up to next summer's competition.

FIFA did, however, include a series of “side letters” promising to negotiate later on a handful of issues. With the cities themselves, those included public transit and fan fest requirements. With stadium owners, FIFA would be willing to discuss the financial model for stadium use and whether the venues could keep naming rights in effect during the competition.

Even with those assurances, though, host city leaders were uncomfortable signing the underlying agreement. For starters, the cities are seeking to negotiate new terms on a much wider range of issues than were carved out in the side letters, including potential revenue sharing. FIFA also didn't provide any timeline for the deferred issues to be resolved, prompting concern that the governing body could keep the cities in limbo for years.

Furthermore, several city leaders felt it was unreasonable to be given mere weeks to commit to terms for an event more than five years away, particularly with some in the throes of preparation for the 2026 men's event.

“Some of these things have to go in front of city councils and get approvals, and that just doesn't happen overnight,” one host city leader said.

Multiple sources said leaders from nearly all of the prospective U.S. host cities signed a draft letter to FIFA informing the governing body of their decision to decline to sign the agreements and requesting broader negotiations. U.S. Soccer asked the cities not to send the letter, however, and instead sign one-page MOUs that could accompany the bid. The cities agreed and are now awaiting guidance from either FIFA or U.S. Soccer on next steps.

One of the main questions host cities have is what role U.S. Soccer will have in negotiations with FIFA about the terms for the 2031 Women's World Cup and the organization of the competition. U.S. Soccer has largely been marginalized in the lead-up to the 2026 World Cup, and each of the 16 host cities has had to deal directly with FIFA on hosting issues.

Despite U.S. Soccer's previous insistence that it only wants to host the event if it benefits host cities, several host city leaders said they are unsure whether U.S. Soccer will advocate for them in negotiations with FIFA or prioritize getting FIFA what it needs to secure the bid.

A source with knowledge of U.S. Soccer's thinking said the organization is aiming to get firmer commitments than the MOUs from host cities ahead of the FIFA Congress in April, but there is an understanding that some key issues won't be resolved until after the 2026 World Cup. Those issues could be agreed upon during FIFA's 2031 host city selection process, which would likely take place in 2027. In that case, cities that are most amenable to FIFA's terms would likely have a leg up in the selection process.

If there's one thing FIFA, U.S. Soccer and the host cities can agree on, it is a shared desire for the U.S. to play a major role in hosting the Women's World Cup. There's a widely held sentiment that the issues at stake are reconcilable. How the parties navigate them will shape both the bid and the next era of major event hosting in the U.S.

Scotland fans and politicians have criticised Fifa over its "outrageous" ticket prices for next summer's World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico.

The men's national team will face Haiti and Morocco in Boston before taking on Brazil in Miami when they return to the tournament for the first time in 28 years.

After the ticket application window opened on Thursday, it emerged prices for the group games will range from £134 to £523.

The Scottish Football Association (SFA) - which brokered a deal to secure priority tickets for Scotland Supporters' Club (SSC) members - said pricing was a matter for Fifa.

World Cup ticket prices 'monumental betrayal' say fans' group

World Cup ticket ballot opens - here's all you need to know

BBC Scotland has asked football's world governing body for comment.

Fans' group Football Supporters Europe have condemned the "extortionate" pricing strategy as have supporters' groups on both sides of the Scotland-England border.

Politicians also united on the BBC's Question Time to voice their concerns.

Steve Clarke's Scotland side qualified for the finals last month after a thrilling 4-2 Hampden victory over Denmark.

Following the draw in Washington DC, Scotland have been allocated 3,889 tickets for the Haiti match on 13 June and the same number for the Morocco game on 19 June.

Both fixtures will be played in the 63,815 capacity Boston Stadium.

For the match against Haiti, the prices will be £134, £298 or £372, while for the Morocco games tickets will cost £163, £320 or £447.

For the clash with five-time champions Brazil on 24 June Scotland have been granted 3,736 tickets.

It will be played in the Miami stadium which has a capacity of 64,091.

Tickets for that match will cost £198, £373 or £523.

Scotland fan Karen Gall criticised the ticket allocation and the fact group stage games are priced based on the perceived popularity of the teams involved, rather than at a flat rate.

She told the BBC's Radio Scotland Breakfast programme: "They are just making it unaffordable for fans essentially."

Karen, who lives in Glasgow, has decided not to enter the ballot.

She said: "There is no point. We can't realistically afford it.

"We have thought about going. We do have friends in Boston we could potentially stay with.

"We could go and soak up the atmosphere but, by the same token, we could just stay here and have a great party at home."

Daris Nesbitt will be in the US for the tournament after booking a £300 flight from Barcelona to Boston before last Friday's draw.

He has enough SSC loyalty points to guarantee the cheapest category 3 tickets for the group stages.

Daris, of Bishopton, Renfrewshire, also saved money by pre-booking 22 hotels in advance but he still faces a expensive trip.

The IT analyst said: "I would say so far, totalling up, it has cost me about £4,000 - and that's before I even get a beer."

Daris told the programme some members of the Tartan Army might travel to the US just to follow the action in a fan zone.

He said: "The ticket pricing is absolutely ridiculous.

"I know there's people on third party websites paying £1,000 for games."

Supporters have also voiced their concerns on social media.

Writing on X, Stephen Watson said: "I've followed Scotland home and away for 27 years in the SSC. Have a decent enough regular income; and I'm sitting here contemplating if I can afford/justify paying for a R32 ticket at the World Cup having already decided just to take in 2 group games.

"It shouldn't be like this."

The Scottish Football Supporters' Association (SFSA) said national football associations across the globe should "hold Fifa to account for the excessive ticket prices".

SPSA chief executive John MacLean also criticised the "poor level" of ticket allocations and what he described as the "unacceptable" dynamic pricing model.

Mr McLean said: "The SFA president Mike Mulraney, who has recently been appointed chair of The Fifa Finance Committee, is ideally placed to express the widespread disappointment of Scottish fans and indeed fans all around the world at ticket prices that are, in some cases, five times the cost in Qatar.

"We hope the opportunity is not lost to represent the views of ordinary football supporters."

Meanwhile, the Football Supporters' Association's England Fans' Embassy said the ticket prices were a "slap in the face" for supporters.

The issue even made it on to the BBC's Question Time programme on Thursday.

A member of the audience in Paisley asked: "Are Scotland fans being priced out of the World Cup by the greed of Fifa?"

The SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn, who is a member of the Tartan Army, branded the ticketing arrangements "a complete scam".

The Aberdeen South MP also highlighted the fact supporters need to buy tickets in advance for the knock-out stages.

He said: "Fifa take your money, stick it in their back pocket for a game you might never go to and then give it back to you less an administration fee.

"That's the worst bank you have ever heard of."

Flynn told the programme that supporters were being "fleeced" and called on football bodies to get together and "demand an end to this".

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the pricing structure was "utterly shameful".

He added: "We all have to gang up with confederations and nations across the globe and say to Fifa: 'Not a chance'."

Scottish Conservatives leader Russell Findlay, who travelled to France for Scotland's last World Cup appearance in 1998, said: "The ticket prices are completely outrageous."

He added: "Without fans at football it is sterile, it is dead, it is not worth it.

"We need to get this fixed."

Findlay added that the Scottish government could help supporters at home by ensuring pubs are open "in the wee small hours" for Scotland's matches which kick off at 02:00 and 23:00.

Former Conservative business and Scotland Office minister, Lord Malcolm Offord, who last week defected to Reform UK, plans to attend the Brazil match.

He told the programme: "It is a commercial venture. You are not going to get Fifa to change their mind."

But Lord Offord agreed with fellow panellist, journalist Angela Haggerty.

He added: "The best parties will actually be at home."

The 2026 World Cup will feature 48 teams and be played from 11 June to 19 July in 16 cities across the US, Canada and Mexico.

The Fifa ticket application window runs until 13 January and fans will be charged for successful ticket applications in February.

On Monday, SSC members will be sent an access code to apply for Scotland's three group stage matches and potential knock-out matches.

For each match that is oversubscribed, a ballot using a loyalty points system will be used to determine who is successful in receiving their chosen category ticket.

An SFA spokesman said: "The ticket pricing policy for the World Cup is a matter for FIFA as the tournament organisers.

"Nonetheless, we made the strongest possible representation that those members with the highest points from our Scotland Supporters' Club loyalty scheme should be given first access to the official ticket allocation.

"We are glad that this has been achieved and are preparing for the Participating Member Association sales window opening next week."

In World Cup parlance, Qatar was Fifa president Gianni Infantino's qualifier. Now it's the big time for Trump's dictator-curious protege

I used to think Fifa's recent practice of holding the World Cup in autocracies was because it made it easier for world football's governing body to do the things it loved: spend untold billions of other people's money and siphon the profits without having to worry about boring little things like human rights or public opinion. Which, let's face it, really piss around with your bottom line.

But for a while now, that view has seemed ridiculously naive, a bit like assuming Recep Erdoğan followed Vladimir Putin's election-hollowing gameplan just because hey, he's an interested guy who likes to read around a lot of subjects. So no: Fifa president Gianni Infantino hasn't spent recent tournaments cosying up to authoritarians because it made his life easier. He's done it to learn from the best. And his latest decree this week simply confirms Fifa is now a fully operational autocracy in the classic populace-rinsing style. Do just absorb yesterday's news that the cheapest ticket for next year's World Cup final in the US will cost £3,120 – seven times more than the cheapest ticket for the last World Cup final in Qatar. (Admittedly, still marginally cheaper than an off-peak single from London to Manchester.)

Like all dictator-curious populists, Fifa loathes its people – the fans. Thinking back, I've even been at tournaments where the governing body has sponsored show trials. In South Africa in 2010, we had something called the Fifa World Cup Courts – 56 courts where Fifa indicated it had finally outgrown fast food tie-ins and slapped its branding on justice itself. Or rather, on summary justice – which became an official tournament partner as cases were rushed through to appease the governing body. A group of Dutch women who'd worn orange minidresses to a game as stunt-marketing for Bavaria beer were arrested. Fifa filed criminal charges against the company.

Again, in retrospect that all seems rather small beer (sorry). Orange-coated faux fans are positively encouraged these days, but only if they come in the sole form of US president Donald Trump, whose bromance with Infantino has been one of the more mesmerisingly weird developments of his presidency.

But then, just as power-playing moguls place themselves on each other's company boards, so autocrats love other autocrats. Back in January, many of us were still vaguely startled to see Gianni given a great seat at Trump's inauguration, barely two rows behind the tech oligarchs, where he was able to laugh uproariously at the bit of the speech where Trump announced he'd be renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. (Just a little niggle between Fifa co-hosts.) But now that we've seen Infantino pop up everywhere from Gaza peace conferences to regular turns in the Oval Office, it almost feels strange when he isn't part of Trump's malarial travelling court – the Dontourage, if you will.

Whether Infantino will at some point end up in the woodchipper, just like everyone does with Trump, is unclear. For now, the president is enjoying having his tummies tickled. A week ago, at the World Cup draw, Trump obligingly suggested the NFL give up the rights to calling its sport football in the United States. “But when you think about it, shouldn't it really be called … this is football,” Trump waffled. “There's no question about it. We have to come up with another name for the NFL. It really doesn't make sense when you think about it.” This is what happens when the president gets booed at the Super Bowl, instead of being given an inaugural award like he was at Infantino's fever dream of a draw. Yes, even though you couldn't believe the shamelessness until you actually saw it with your own eyes, it was incredibly credible that Infantino would indeed confect some nutty “Fifa peace prize” and award it to Trump.

In recent history, both the Olympics and the World Cup have shown they are always able to covertly or overtly override local laws of the host country for the duration of their sporting event. Fortunately, though, this is unnecessary in the US, where being ripped off for sports tickets is effectively the 28th amendment. Furthermore, this World Cup is already shaping up to be the sort of reciprocally abusive arrangement we've seen when the tournament previously tipped up in non-democracies. Trump can use it to threaten Democrat mayors with loss of city hosting rights, while Infantino can charge genuinely crazy money and have Fifa run the entire secondary ticketing/scalping market without interference. Everyone's a winner, as long as they hold all the cards.

And the peasants – the fans – just have to suck it up. Fifa elections have effectively been hollowed out by the strong-arm practice of buying off the votes of smaller nations via disproportionately large grants. The dictator makes sure countries know what's good for them. The gravy train rolls on. So if you fancy getting rid of Gianni and everything he represents, I'd love to know the mechanism you have in mind. Maybe one day football will have some kind of revolution, in which hordes of endlessly oppressed people who actually like the sport will storm Infantino's Zurich palace, and loot all the valuable gifts of obscure provenance. But it won't be soon, unless one or more of the big football markets gets it together and pulls out.

Until then, we'll just have to accept that there is simply no one who cares less than Infantino, and simply no sport that hates its fans quite as much as football. In fact, if only those fans could afford the tickets, they'd have the receipts to prove it.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will bring soccer fans from around the world to the streets of Atlanta as eight matches are set for Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

Officials for the tournament, which runs from June 11 to July 19, announced the group stage match-ups last week, allowing fans to purchase tickets knowing which teams are playing.

If you're still hoping for a chance to see your favorite team play in Atlanta, the random selection phase of ticketing is on now and will continue until Jan. 13. Here's how to enter the draw.

The Random Selection Draw period, the third round of ticketing, opened Dec. 11 and will remain open until Jan. 13 at 11 a.m. ET.

When you enter the drawing during that time will not impact your chances of winning a chance to purchase tickets, officials said.

To enter the drawing, you can go to FIFA.com/tickets and create a FIFA account. You will then be asked to choose what team you root for, where you'd like to see a match and your contact information.

It's important to look at the ticket pricing before registering for the draw. If chosen, you will be automatically charged for the tickets you have been awarded.

"Fans will be able to select which match(es), respective ticket category(ies), and number of tickets per match they'd like to purchase, subject to household restrictions," FIFA officials said. "All successful and partially successful ticket applicants will receive communications via email and subsequently will be automatically charged for their tickets in February. A partially successful application indicates that a fan will receive the number of tickets requested to a match, but not all matches requested."

If you don't want to leave your World Cup dreams to chance, there are a few other options for purchasing tickets.

First, if you would only like to attend a game for a specific team, you may be eligible for a Participating Member Association. Each association has their own process of designating tickets, but members may be able to purchase tickets from a section of tickets pre-determined for supports of their team. Information about PMAs is available on the FIFA ticketing site.

Some fans can also purchase "premium, elevated matchday" ticket experiences through hospitality packages, found at FIFA.com/hospitality, or from On Location, the group curating the experiences for the World Cup.

Qatar Airways is also offering travel packages for out-of-town fans. The packages include match tickets in category 1 or 2, transport in the city and to and from the airport, hotel stays and domestic and international flights.

The FIFA Resale/Exchange Marketplace will be the last official outlet to buy match tickets. The marketplace will open on the FIFA ticketing site on Dec. 15.

Resale tickets may be available through other, unofficial outlets after that period.

As the U.S. and Canada prepared for the 2026 soccer World Cup tournament, rumors abounded about the rapport between U.S. President Donald Trump and the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the international self-regulatory body for association soccer.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has been criticized for violating ethics rules when he created a FIFA Peace Prize for Trump, including by former FIFA President Sepp Blatter. Infantino is no stranger to controversy, having been implicated in the Panama Papers scandal in 2016, targeted in a FIFA ethics committee investigation for alleged malpractice in 2017, and investigated for criminal conduct in Switzerland in 2020. 

The recent relationship between Trump and FIFA under Infantino's leadership has raised many questions and fueled several rumors, true and false, eight of which Snopes investigated.

The forward's blocked contract and a growing talent drain to Europe have nudged the NWSL into crisis mode. Here's what's happening and why it matters

The Trinity Rodman contract saga has exposed a fundamental tension at the heart of the National Women's Soccer League: a salary-cap model built for stability and measured growth coming in collision with a global market that has accelerated far beyond it.

Rodman is one of the most important young players in US soccer, arguably its most marketable female star and a centerpiece of the NWSL's future. Yet European giants have offered her salaries that America's top women's domestic league cannot legally match, prompting the NWSL to veto a record-breaking Washington Spirit deal (and the players' union to file a grievance in response).

At the same time, a wave of top talent has already crossed east across the Atlantic, raising questions about whether the NWSL can still compete. Here's what's happening and why it matters …

Because she is exactly the kind of star the NWSL cannot afford to lose. At 23, Rodman is one of the most explosive young players in the world: already a USWNT cornerstone (and one-third of the Triple Espresso front line), an Olympic champion, a marketing draw and a foundational star for the Spirit. Her contract expires at the end of December and European clubs have offered her salaries far beyond what any NWSL team can pay under the league's salary cap.

The Spirit attempted a record deal averaging over $1m per year only for the NWSL to block it, saying it violated league rules. The NWSL Players Association (NWSLPA) has now filed a grievance accusing the league of breaching the collective bargaining agreement and effectively imposing an unnegotiated maximum salary.

Rodman's future is a litmus test: if the NWSL cannot retain a player of her caliber, executives fear the league may be structurally incapable of keeping or attracting world-class talent.

Yes, and it already has. Salary growth in Europe's major leagues has surged and transfers for top players have accelerated. Alyssa Thompson's shock move from Angel City FC to Chelsea underscored how vulnerable the NWSL has become. Several other players have departed in recent windows, including national team members Naomi Girma, Crystal Dunn and Emily Fox, often for salaries that the NWSL's cap cannot approach. Clubs say they cannot compete financially: even players willing to take pay cuts discover the NWSL cap requires reductions so steep that the move becomes unfeasible.

European teams routinely offer seven-figure salaries. NWSL teams operate under a 2025 cap of $3.5m total. It doesn't take a CPA to suss out what's behind the migration.

Many general managers privately told ESPN they fear the league will be unable to retain top players – or recruit global stars – unless the NWSL modernizes its pay structures. The Rodman standoff has simply made a long-simmering problem impossible to ignore.

Because this is happening at a moment when the USWNT's long-standing global dominance is under real threat. For decades the US had advantages that Europe lacked: youth infrastructure, college pathways through scholarships, professionalism and visibility. But that gap has closed rapidly.

European clubs like Barcelona, Chelsea, Lyon, Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain now operate with world-class facilities, elite coaches, sophisticated analytics programs and, critically, rising wages. The transfer market and Champions League have turned Europe into the epicenter of the women's game. Several European national teams have equaled or surpassed the USWNT tactically and technically, as seen at the 2023 World Cup.

If the NWSL cannot keep its brightest stars – including generational talents like Rodman – the center of gravity in the women's game will continue shifting toward Europe.

The NWSL's Board of Governors has reportedly approved a new roster mechanism on Thursday that would allow teams to pay salaries beyond the cap, effectively an NWSL version of Major League Soccer's designated player rule. According to an ESPN report, it has been dubbed the High Impact Player program.

The rule will let teams spend up to $1m in additional funds on eligible players while only incurring a portion of that salary as a cap hit. To qualify as a High Impact Player, individuals must meet a mix of sporting or commercial metrics, such as recent USWNT minutes, Ballon d'Or recognition, NWSL Best XI honors or broader marketability benchmarks.

The proposal, now approved by the board, would:

give each club a set pool of supplemental money beyond the salary cap

restrict that pool to players who meet elite criteria

allow teams to split funds among one or multiple stars

introduce a minimum threshold so the mechanism is used only for top talent

maintain parity by preventing unlimited spending

In the short term, the rule gives the Spirit a means to keep Rodman, though they must still agree to terms with her. The mechanism also requires formal consultation with the NWSLPA under the CBA.

The new system would effectively replace “allocation money”, previously used to top up salaries, which the NWSL is phasing out.

Rodman and the Spirit agreed to a backloaded four-year deal with escalators taking her average pay above $1m, far beyond what the current cap structure can absorb. The league rejected the deal, arguing it violated the collective bargaining agreement and posed “structural risk” to a system that depends on tight cost controls. Commissioner Jessica Berman has repeatedly said the league is “not a charity”.

The NWSLPA counters that nothing in the CBA creates a maximum salary, and by blocking the deal the league effectively imposed one without negotiation.

The grievance process is underway:

the league has 14 days to respond in writing

if unresolved, a grievance committee of league and union reps reviews it

if still unresolved, it moves to arbitration

The outcome could reshape how salaries are handled across the league.

Because European wages have exploded. Clubs such as Chelsea, Barcelona and Lyon can offer salaries exceeding $1m a year – and they do so without the constraints of a hard cap. They benefit from Champions League revenue, massive global brands and fanbases, and ownership groups willing to invest heavily in the women's game.

By contrast, even in 2029 – the final year of Rodman's proposed deal – the NWSL base cap will still be under $5m. Without supplemental mechanisms, signing even a single million-dollar player destabilizes an entire roster.

Simply, Europe's financial model has shifted the global market. The NWSL's current model has not kept pace.

Symbolically enormous and strategically dangerous.

Rodman is a face of the league, a marketing anchor and one of the few players capable of bringing non-hardcore sports fans into the tent. Losing her at 23, at a moment when European salaries are surging and club environments are improving rapidly, would feed the narrative that NWSL is no longer the top destination for elite players.

Executives fear a pattern: young standouts go abroad for money and Champions League football, while top internationals stay away because the league can't afford them.

As ESPN's Jeff Kassouf wrote: “Attracting casual fans is the only way for the NWSL to truly grow at scale, and while gimmicks like creating artificial fan sections from a new league sponsor are obligatory attempts at commercial growth, they mean nothing without the players that keep fans watching. Rodman is the type of player – not the only one, no, but she's right at the front of the line – that people pay to come watch. She is the type of player who creates fans.”

Both leagues face pressure to retain stars, but they are at very different moments. WNBA players are pushing for higher pay and improved conditions, yet they are negotiating from a position strength, with unprecedented fan interest, rising valuations and CBA leverage. The WNBA is expanding, financially and competitively.

The NWSL, by contrast, is improvising solutions from a position of vulnerability. Its stars are being priced out, its cap is rigid and its competitive environment cannot match Europe's. While WNBA players fight for a bigger slice of a growing pie, NWSL clubs are trying to prevent the pie from disappearing overseas.

A few things:

The Board of Governors consults with the NWSLPA on Thursday's vote

The NWSL has until mid-December to respond in writing to the NWSLPA grievance

If unresolved, the issue moves to a grievance committee and potentially arbitration

Rodman can officially negotiate with any club once her contract expires on 31 December

European clubs remain prepared with multi-million-dollar offers

The league insists it will “do everything we can to keep Trinity Rodman here”. The coming weeks will determine whether that promise represents meaningful structural change or simply a defensive slogan in a changing global market.

The new-look FIFA Intercontinental Cup sees the six reigning champions of every major continental club competition battle it out for a chance of silverware to end the year. 

The winners of the UEFA Champions League, Copa Libertadores, Concacaf Champions Cup and all other current holders of the premier continental tournaments in FIFA's six confederations have a shot at the title. 

The new version of the competition started in 2024, with Real Madrid lifting the trophy with a comfortable 3–0 victory over Pachuca in the final. With Los Blancos vacating their Champions League crown back in May, they won't participate in the 2025 Intercontinental Cup, opening the door for a new champion to be crowned.

The FIFA Intercontinental Cup is the tournament that succeeded the old version of the FIFA Club World Cup. The inaugural 32-team Club World Cup took centre stage in the summer of 2025 and will be played every four years, whereas the Intercontinental Cup will continue to be an annual event that takes place to close out the calendar year.

Every single match in the FIFA Intercontinental Cup is a straight elimination bout. The tournament begins with the FIFA African-Asian-Pacific Cup, with the three champions from Africa, Asia and Oceania's confederations battling it out for a place in the tournament's semifinal.

The FIFA Derby of the Americas pits the Concacaf Champions Cup winner against the Copa Libertadores winner, and they go on to meet the winner of the above in the FIFA Challenger Cup. The victor in that clash then goes on to contest the Intercontintal Cup with the reigning Champions League holders.

The FIFA Intercontinental Cup final will take place on Wednesday, Dec. 17. The game will be played at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium in Al Rayyan, Qatar, a venue that hosted seven matches during the 2022 World Cup. 

Paris Saint-Germain await the winner of the FIFA Challenger Cup in the final, aiming to conquer the tournament for the first time.

Paris Saint-Germain, the 2024–25 Champions League winners, are immediately placed into the Intercontinental Cup final because of the competitiveness and historical ranking of European football's primary club competition.

It means Luis Enrique's side only need to overcome one hurdle to pick up another trophy—victory in the final would add to the Ligue 1, Coupe de France, French Super Cup and UEFA Super Cup crowns they have won this calendar year.

Some sort of annual FIFA Intercontinental club competition has been around since 1960, with various changes to the format occuring over that time.

In 2005, the tournament merged with the Club World Cup, but things have reverted back to how they were after FIFA's decision to expand the latter into a four-yearly 32-team format.

Real Madrid are the only official winners of the current Intercontinental Cup iteration, and historically have won the most titles with four. AC Milan, Boca Juniors and two Uruguayan rivals, Peñarol and Nacional, won three under the old banner but only Madrid's current reign is recognised in the current lineage.

The Club World Cup entered a new era in 2025, with the first ever 32-team edition of the tournament taking place on U.S. soil.

Unlike the five-game Intercontinental Cup, the new version of the Club World Cup follows the previous Champions League and World Cup formats. Eight groups of four teams where the top two advance to the knockout rounds that begin with the round of 16.

Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain in the 2025 Club World Cup final to become the first ever champions of the new version of the competition.

The Club World Cup will be held every four years, presumably as a warm up for the World Cup the following year. Meanwhile, as mentioned previously, the Intercontinental Cup will be held every year.

As continental champions, all six teams that participate in the Intercontinental Cup every year are also granted direct qualification intp the next edition of the Club World Cup. As a result, Auckland City FC, Al Ahli, Pyramids FC, Cruz Azul, Flamengo and PSG will participate in the 2029 Club World Cup.

Manchester United are reportedly eyeing Sunderland midfielder Noah Sadiki following his sensational Premier League start, with Chelsea also keeping a tab on the £15 million ($20m) star. Ruben Amorim has urged the board to sign at least one midfielder in the summer of 2026 after missing out on Brighton's Carlos Baleba. They are also monitoring the likes of Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson.

According to Sky Sports' Sacha Tavolieri, United are now "all in" for Sunderland's breakout midfielder Sadiki, with the Red Devils positioning the 20-year-old as a major summer 2026 target. They have made him their preferred option should attempts to sign Brighton's Baleba collapse for a second consecutive window. He arrived at the Stadium of Light only a few months ago for £15m ($20m) from Union Saint-Gilloise, and has been one of the Premier League's surprise stars. He has started all 15 of Sunderland's fixtures this season, anchoring their midfield with composure well beyond his years. Meanwhile, Chelsea are said to have sent delegates directly to Sunderland after the clubs met on October 25, enquiring about a potential price tag. The Blues' interest is genuine, but they may struggle to offer Sadiki immediate minutes. At Chelsea, the youngster would find himself fighting Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez for a starting place. United, however, offer a far clearer pathway, with uncertainty surrounding Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro.

United's long-running pursuit of Baleba, a saga stretching back to the summer, remains unresolved. The club agreed personal terms with the Brighton midfielder, but had to withdraw their interest due to the Seagulls' steep asking price. United planned to revisit the deal in 2026, when Brighton expect to cash in, but the Seagulls' valuation continues to be a major stumbling block. Moreover, his inconsistent form this season has added further hesitation, with senior figures reluctant to sanction what could become a record-breaking fee. 

Casemiro, meanwhile, is entering the final months of his contract. United want the Brazil icon to remain, but only on reduced wages. There is no guarantee he will agree, and clubs in Saudi Arabia remain on standby. Ugarte has struggled for rhythm, and Mainoo, who was once the club's crown jewel in midfield, is increasingly unsettled after a run of high-profile omissions from Amorim's starting XI. United expect Napoli to table a formal enquiry for Mainoo as early as January, which will provide the midfielder an exit route from Amorim's exile. He is desperate for minutes to impress England manager Thomas Tuchel ahead of the March international break, which will be the final time The Three Lions will convene for an international break before the summer World Cup.

Sunderland paid a modest sum for Sadiki in July, but his value has surged rapidly thanks to his assured Premier League performances. With an intelligent reading of play, tidy distribution and an exceptional work rate, he has become indispensable for a Black Cats side who have taken the top flight by surprise. United are determined to build a squad for the future with young generational talents at its core. They have recently signed 13-year-old defender Socrates from The Elite London Academy, another unpolished diamond unearthed by their scouting network. 

Following the signing, The London Academy wrote: "From the moment he joined Elite London Academy, you could see he had something special: technically gifted, intelligent on the ball, brave in duels, and always hungry to learn. Along his journey, we organised trials for him at Arsenal, Tottenham and Crystal Palace. He completed full trials at these clubs but these did not result in registration. Arguably, missed opportunities for the clubs.

"But what makes Socrates different is how he responded. He didn't sulk. He didn't lose confidence. He showed resilience, maturity and a mindset far beyond his age. Instead, he pushed harder. Soon exciting opportunities have followed. Socrates was offered registration at a top Cat 1 club in the North in August after a successful trial."

While the recruitment team accelerate long-term planning ahead of a potentially transformative and chaotic summer window, Amorim remains focussed on his job at hand. The Red Devils return to the Premier League stage on Monday against Bournemouth, and after a convincing 4-1 victory over Wolves, the Portuguese manager will look to beat the Cherries at home.

Manchester City have announced that head coach Pep Guardiola will skip pre-match press duties ahead of a Premier League clash with Crystal Palace due to a "personal matter". Guardiola was due to face the assembled media on Friday, but his place in that hot seat will be filled by assistant manager Kolo Toure - with the Blues' talismanic boss set to be back in the dugout at Selhurst Park.

City are confident that the issue will not impact plans for a trip to South London. Guardiola is expected to take his place on the bench as usual after naming a team that he hopes can pick up three more points in an ongoing title bid.

A morale-boosting 2-1 victory over Real Madrid in midweek Champions League competition has helped to raise spirits in the City camp. They are now just two points adrift of table-topping Arsenal - who play host to rock bottom Wolves on Saturday evening.

Any slip up from the Gunners would leave the door open for City to climb to the summit, as they prepare to tackle high-flying Palace on Sunday. Guardiola heads into that game aware that his record against Eagles boss Oliver Glasner is not the best - with an FA Cup final defeat suffered against the Austrian tactician last season.

Guardiola will, however, have City ready for another tough test in the English capital. That is despite being forced to miss a press conference due to issues in his private life. He has left matters in the capable hands of Toure.

Pep Lijnders, who once worked alongside Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool, boasts more experience in the coaching department - and is accustomed to facing the media - but was also unavailable on Friday due to a scheduled day off.



Toure is speaking as the public face of City for the first time since being promoted to a first-team role over the summer. The 44-year-old represented the Blues and Arsenal - winning Premier League titles with both - in his playing days.

He began his coaching career as an assistant to ex-Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers at Celtic, before following him to Leicester. An unsuccessful spell was taken in as manager of Wigan Athletic during the 2022-23 campaign, with that stint lasting just nine games as no wins were picked up.

Former Ivory Coast international Toure - who played alongside his brother Yaya at City - returned to the Etihad Stadium as an assistant to U18s manager Oli Reiss in 2024. He was then allowed to bridge the gap between youth and first-team ranks in July 2025.

City's academy director Thomas Krucken told the Manchester Evening News of that decision, as Guardiola freshened up his backroom staff: "Before the season starts, we sat together with Txiki [Begiristain], Hugo [Viana], the head of coaching, Kolo - he is a very important part now because he knows the players really well - and there are a core of four players training. The EDS train every day next to the first team so it's easy for us and the players Pep needs, he gets.

"The door to the first team is always open. I think we have a fantastic interface. Kolo is an important part but also Pep Lijnders has huge experience over a period of his seasons at Liverpool and before. He is an expert in working with young players. We have a regular meeting with Hugo, Pep Lijnders and Kolo, the head of coaching Jose [Luis Rueda] who is our head of Individual Player Development."

Former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola has been in charge of City since 2016. He has taken in 556 games at the game and boasts a win ratio of 70.5 per cent. The Catalan passed 1,000 matches as a manager this season.

He has overseen six Premier League title triumphs, with one of those - in 2022-23 - forming part of a historic Treble. In total, he has won 18 trophies with City and is tied to a contract through to the summer of 2027.

Hello! Roll up, roll up for World Cup tickets. And get ready to live on bread and water.

Coming up:



Horrific World Cup hotel prices you can just about forgive. Business is business, and in no respect would the hospitality industry be classed as an intrinsic product of football.

World Cup tickets are, though, and at the risk of sounding like The Simpsons ‘old man yells at cloud' headline, I can't avoid the conclusion that FIFA is taking the proverbial. The latest ballot for seats at next summer's finals opened yesterday. FIFA's dynamic pricing model is every bit as bad as you'd imagine.

I know TAFC is labouring the point about how expensive the 2026 World Cup will be to attend, but frankly, the point can't be made often enough. Fans group Football Supporters Europe (FSE) called the ticket structure a “betrayal”, and who can argue? Take a look at the following figures and judge for yourself:

You can appreciate now what FIFA president Gianni Infantino meant when he said the World Cup was the equivalent of 104 Super Bowls. Super Bowl seats might be ultra expensive, but it is, quite evidently, a one-off event. FIFA, in its wisdom, expects punters to pay $2,355 for top-grade tickets for Mexico versus South Africa. And it's probably right in calculating that when push comes to shove, enough of them will.



Henry Bushnell has published the entire list of who is being asked to pay what for which match. It's not that every game is out of reach financially, but the levels of accessibility are dreadful. To quote Seb Stafford-Bloor this morning, World Cups should be open to as many ordinary people as possible. This one feels depressingly exclusive.

A certain amount of money-making was to be expected, but when FIFA's estimated revenue from the 2026 finals is set at more than $10bn, some of the commercialism resembles corporate greed. FIFA explained in a statement to The Athletic that “the pricing model … reflects the existing market practice for major entertainment and sporting events within our hosts on a daily basis, soccer included.” Oh well then.

FSE has urged the governing body to take stock, consult with supporter organisations, and rethink its pricing model. I hope the group don't hold their breath waiting for a reply.

Erling Haaland's haul of 55 goals from 54 Champions League appearances sounds like a wind-up. He's only slightly less prolific domestically, and the time is right to start the debate about whether he is — or might prove to be — the finest finisher to grace the English scene.

He's just passed the 100 mark in the Premier League and his individual droughts are much like the droughts they experience on the west coast of Scotland. But despite how ruthless Haaland can be, he's up against phenomenal competition.

The feted Everton striker, Dixie Dean, for example, maintained an average of 0.86 goals per game in the 1920s and '30s. Haaland's current average is slightly better (0.89, or 145 from 167 matches for Manchester City), but Dean kept it up for more than a decade. He also holds the record for the most strikes in a single top-flight season — 60 (if you can believe that) in 1927-28.

It's inconceivable that Haaland will ever take that particular crown from Dean. The Premier League is too competitive for any modern-day centre-forward to hit 60. But Alan Shearer's Premier League record of 260 goals, and Jimmy Greaves' all-time top-flight high of 357? For as long as Haaland is on the rampage in Manchester, don't regard either tally as safe.

Football club nicknames are great fun, and the odder the better. Scottish teams have a real talent for this. Cowdenbeath are the Blue Brazil (for reasons of irony). Arbroath are the Red Lichties (something to do with a lighthouse). Clyde are the Bully Wee (your guess is as good as mine).

If you've ever wondered why Everton are the Toffees, Paddy Boyland has an answer for you. Back in the 19th century, a shop selling a certain brand of toffee or medicinal sweet started trading in that area of Liverpool. After Everton were founded in 1878, the nickname stuck to them naturally.

In time, the club established a ‘Toffee Lady', whose job it was to pass out sweets to the crowd at games. The tradition might have been lost when Everton left Goodison Park at the end of last season, but Jazz Barnes, above, is keeping it alive at their new stadium, and Paddy went to meet her.

You'll laugh at this: the sweets used to be thrown into the stands. In line with health and safety regulations, they now have to be handed out in a basket. Modern life, eh?

Saturday: Premier League: Burnley vs Fulham, 12.30pm/5.30pm — NBC, Peacock Premium/Sky Sports; Arsenal vs Wolverhampton Wanderers, 3pm/8pm — USA Network/TNT Sports; La Liga: Barcelona vs Osasuna, 12.30pm/5.30pm — ESPN, Fubo/LaLigaTV; Ligue 1: Metz vs Paris Saint-Germain, 1pm/6pm — beIn Sports, Fubo, Fanatiz/Amazon Prime.

Sunday: Premier League (all Sky Sports in UK): Crystal Palace vs Manchester City, 9am/2pm — NBC, Peacock Premium; Sunderland vs Newcastle United, 9am/2pm; Brentford vs Leeds United, 11.30am/4.30pm — both USA Network; La Liga: Alaves vs Real Madrid, 3pm/8pm — ESPN, Fubo/Premier Sports; Serie A (both TNT Sports, DAZN in UK): Milan vs Sassuolo, 6.30am/11.30am — Paramount+, Fubo, DAZN; Bologna vs Juventus, 2.45pm/7.45pm — CBS, Paramount+, Fubo, DAZN.

Emmanuel Sabbi hitting both posts with one shot in the MLS Cup final was, on the face of it, as unlucky as unlucky gets. But along came Romain Esse with Crystal Palace in the Conference League last night, doing exactly the same but seeing the second rebound trickle back along the goal line for good measure. Try not to chuckle at him shaping to celebrate twice, only for the penny to drop.

World Cup

2026 World

Cup Prep

For U.S. men's national team fans, the 2026 World Cup draw was “a dream draw.” It was, according to most Americans, something close to a “best-case scenario.” A matchup with Australia was a “layup for the U.S.,” CBS Sports analyst Mike Grella said. Fox Sports pundit Alexi Lalas called it a “great group” for the USMNT, one “that you should expect this United States team to win.”

And for the Aussies?

“This is a good result for the Socceroos,” wrote the Sydney Morning Herald.

And for Paraguay, the USMNT's first opponent?

“I think it's a very evenly matched group,” Paraguay coach Gustavo Alfaro said.

Their reactions underscored a reality that all the dreamy Stateside optimism seemed to ignore. Sure, Paraguay-Australia-European playoff winner is absolutely a winnable group for the USMNT. But, especially if that playoff winner is Turkey, it's also a losable group. Of all 12 drawn last week, it is, potentially, the group with the most “parity,” as Alfaro said. It raises the USMNT's ceiling but also lowers the floor — for the Americans, and for every other contestant.

“I think we feel, like everyone else in the group, that it's a group that you can get out of,” Australia coach Tony Popovic told Australian media. “I'm sure every nation looks at the teams and says, ‘OK, we've a chance.'”

And if the U.S. sees a “layup”?

“Anyone that underestimates us, I think, will get a rude shock when it comes to those group games,” Popovic said.

There is, to be clear, no suggestion that U.S. players and coaches are underestimating anyone. “There's no easy game at a World Cup,” midfielder Tyler Adams said. Overconfidence is not necessarily the concern.

The concern is simply that the group is tricky; not stacked or murderous, but potentially trickier than it first appeared. If Turkey wins the European playoff — one that also features Kosovo, Romania and Slovakia — all four teams would be in the FIFA top 39 and the Elo top 34. If you were to average each team's FIFA rank and its Elo rank, they'd all be within 10 places of one another, between Turkey (20) and Paraguay (30).

No other 2026 World Cup group will be able to say any of that.

Mexico, by contrast, got South Africa (Elo: 77th). Canada got Qatar (96th). Most groups, in this first 48-team World Cup, have a minnow — a Haiti or Curaçao, a New Zealand or Cape Verde, Jordan or a playoff winner that could be Jamaica, the Democratic Republic of Congo or New Caledonia.

The U.S. didn't get one.

Its group looked “easy” because there is no giant. Seeded in Pot 1, as a co-host, the U.S. avoided FIFA's entire top 10, and then also evaded Colombia, Morocco, Croatia, etc. For the first time in modern program history, the USMNT will be the highest-ranked team in its World Cup group, per FIFA's rankings. That's why the group is full of possibilities.

But there is also a possibility for “disaster,” as Lalas called it. The scenario where the Americans fail to beat Australia, Paraguay and Turkey is entirely realistic — more realistic than it would be in most other 2026 World Cup groups. Group D, in that sense, is a double-edged sword.

It is not a difficult group, per se, but the bars for “difficult” and “easy” have shifted in the 48-team era — in part because 12 relatively weak teams have been added to the field, in part because eight of 12 third-place teams now progress to the knockout stages.

Previously, when the top two of four advanced, the bottom and top of a group held equal weight. Now, if round-of-32 qualification is the primary goal, a group's weak link is arguably more consequential. A pushover, such as Qatar or Curaçao (the two lowest-ranked teams in the field, per Elo), makes the path to the bottom of the group difficult to fathom. It makes at least one win likely. And in this new format, three points and a decent goal differential might be sufficient.

A pushover is what the USMNT doesn't (yet) have in Group D.

So, it is not an easy group, not a best-case scenario, not a “layup.”

It is, for better and worse, wide open.

The U.S. men's national team, it seems, is back to a good place.

The Nations League and Gold Cup eliminations for the U.S. have faded into the past. There's no more feuding between the team's best players and the manager. The Americans are undefeated in five matches, all against World Cup-qualified opposition. They've outscored those opponents 12-4, and there finally seems to be a plan: either a clear back three or a back four that morphs into a back three because one of the fullbacks is more of a center back. It's similar to what Mauricio Pochettino did in his one year at Chelsea, and it has coincided in an uptick in both performances and results for the World Cup co-hosts.

But what about the broader player pool? Pochettino has done a fantastic job of expanding it -- there's a much bigger collection of players who seem capable of contributing than there was a year ago. But a national team manager can only have a minor impact on the true quality of the players at his disposal. We learn a lot more about them when they're at their day jobs: playing for club teams.

So with the European season fast approaching its midway point and the MLS just recently wrapped, it's time for one last edition of the USMNT Player Performance Index before the end of 2025.

For the unfamiliar or forgetful, this is our way of trying to rank the performance of every American professional soccer player in the world. I use the word "trying" because it's not perfect -- ranking soccer players, especially across multiple competitive contexts, is impossible -- but it's useful.

To come up with the rankings, we use a combination of talent, playing time, team quality and ... that's it. Simple, but effective.

For talent: The metric is Transfermarkt's estimated market value for every player. This isn't a one-to-one match for talent, but it's close enough, and having it as part of the input ensures that the rankings don't stray too far from what the world thinks of a given player.

For playing time: We simply take the percentage of available minutes each player has played for his team in their domestic league.

For team quality: We use Opta's power rankings, which rate every professional club team in the world. These ratings aren't perfect either -- MLS teams are ranked a little too highly, for one -- but they offer a uniform way of assessing the quality of the teams every American plays for.

And so, the rankings work off a simple premise: if you're playing a lot of minutes and your team has a high rating, then you're likely contributing valuable performance to your team.

For the current edition, the market value makes up 15% of the rating, minutes played makes up 20%, and team quality makes up the remaining 65%. I've also added a 10%-of-minutes threshold, and that means Cole Campbell (1.8% of minutes for Borussia Dortmund) and Antonee Robinson (4.5% of minutes for Fulham) both miss out.

Some other notable absences: Norwich City's Josh Sargent, Orlando City's Alex Freeman, and Real Salt Lake's Diego Luna didn't make the top 50. Were I doing this more subjectively, Luna still wouldn't be in the top 50, I don't think -- he's been way better for the USMNT than in MLS over the past year. Freeman, however, would easily be top 50 because he was probably the best fullback in MLS. And Sargent also would be somewhere on the list. But none of their club teams were good enough for them to make the cut in this edition of the USMNT PPI.

Now, to the list ...

- O'Hanlon: Why Christian Pulisic is having his best season ever
- Predicting the USMNT's starting lineup at the World Cup
- How Roldan went from USMNT afterthought to Pochettino fave

Ten years ago, Richards would've been playing for a Champions League team in Italy, Spain or Germany. Instead, he's playing 99.5% of the minutes for, well, the fourth-place team in England.

Even if you don't think Crystal Palace will be there come season's end, the team is currently rated as the 12th best in the world by Opta. Such is the financial might of the Premier League that Palace, according to these ratings, would be the second-best team in France, Italy, and Germany, while they'd be behind only Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain.

More simply, Palace is the best team any American is currently playing for, and Richards is playing every minute of every game.

After a nightmare start that got Erik ten Hag fired as manager before the transfer window had even closed, Leverkusen has stabilized. After Bayern Munich, Leverkusen is battling it out with RB Leipzig and Borussia Dortmund to be the second-best team in Germany. And outside of his injuries, Tillman has been close to an automatic first-choice starter under both of his managers.

There's not really much in the way of notable statistical production on the ball -- he's making a lot of defensive plays, playing a lot of passes, completing a lot of passes, and not doing much else. But he moved for a major transfer fee over the summer, and he's starting for a Champions League-quality side. That's enough to get him to No. 2.

Unfortunately, Pulisic no longer qualifies for FBref's leaderboards after dipping slightly below the one-third-of-the-minutes threshold. But after his two goals earlier this week, he's now averaging 1.82 non-penalty goals+assists per 90 minutes. That's almost half a goal/assist more than Harry Kane, who leads Europe's Big Five top leagues (among qualified players) with 1.36 per 90.

He's sort of the "is the dress blue or gold?" of U.S. fandom.

If I told you that Adams had played nearly 90% of the minutes for a good Premier League team so far this season, you probably would have one of two reactions: (1) Wow, that's such good news for the World Cup! Or (2) Oh my god, no, he's going to get hurt before the World Cup.

He's first in progressive passes and second in progressive carries for a team that has beaten the defending English and Italian champs by a combined 10-3. Given Antonee Robinson's injury problems and Weston McKennie's inconsistent call-ups, it seems as if there's now a core four of close-to-irreplaceable players for the USMNT ahead of next summer: Richards, Pulisic, Adams and Dest.

It started off well -- kind of. He played a lot for Atletico at the beginning of the season, but Atletico was bad to start the season. Then he stopped playing, and now Atletico is pretty much as good as it always is, again.

Since the end of August, Cardoso has played only 71 minutes for Atletico across all competitions. If you thought this move seemed like too big of a jump for a player with a solid season and a half in Spain, then nothing about the first few months of this season will have convinced you otherwise.

It happened again. McKennie wasn't playing for Juventus to start the season and everyone freaked out. And then his new manager eventually realized his team is better when McKennie is on the field. Despite the slow start, McKennie has played nearly two-thirds of the Serie A minutes for Igor Tudor. And as always, he's just doing a little bit of everything, everywhere:

Juventus is in seventh in Serie A -- that's why he's not higher here -- but the team's expected-goal differential is second-best in Italy after Inter Milan. I'd expect Juventus to gradually rise up the table over the next few months, and the same thing should happen to McKennie the next time we do these rankings.

What Weah is getting on loan at Marseille: more minutes than he got at Juventus.

What Weah is not getting on loan at Marseille: any minutes at his preferred position of wing.

Marseille could give Paris Saint-Germain a genuine title challenge this season -- its expected-goal differential is not far behind the European champs -- and that's happening mostly with a lineup in which Weah plays either as a fullback or a wingback. But that might not be as big of a problem for the U.S. as it once seemed.

No one in Europe thinks Weah is a top-class winger even though he mostly has been one of the starting wingers for the U.S. over the past half-decade. But with this new system, Pochettino has leaned more toward inside-forward types rather than pure wingers as the two players next to his striker. That doesn't suit Weah at all, so his path to a starting spot with the U.S. might be as a wingback after all.

He's no longer putting up Messi-like per-minute numbers for PSV anymore -- and that's a good thing. Why? Because it means he's no longer just coming in during garbage time and pummeling Eredivisie clubs that are way worse than PSV.

Pepi still isn't first choice at PSV, but he already has 515 minutes in the league this season. Last season, he finished just south of 700.

I don't think Tessmann is a future star or anything -- he's already 24 -- but he is a solid starting midfielder for a fringe Champions League team in France. Here's how he fares compared to his peers in Ligue 1, per the various grades from Gradient Sports:

With that level of play, he should be in the mix for the starting spot in the midfield next to Adams next summer.

It has been a terrible season for the two young American midfielders on Champions League clubs and Pochettino doesn't seem to like them. Musah even made this list only because he'd played 90 minutes in a match for Milan before moving to Atalanta. With his new club, he has played 60 total minutes and hasn't appeared in a league match since before Halloween.

Jeff Carlisle recaps Folarin Balogun's big night for Monaco in the Champions League.

I like how such a simple rating system can discover the same thing Pochettino has found out over the past couple of months: Roldan is very good at soccer.

Delgado, a midfielder, and Haak, a midfielder-turned-defender, haven't been called up by Pochettino and probably won't be any time soon, but they've both played a ton of minutes for two of the better teams in MLS. In the past, they'd probably be in the mix for one of the final few roster spots, but now this pool has guys who play for Champions League clubs such as Atletico Madrid and Atalanta and probably won't even make next summer's roster, either.

It's funny that perhaps one of the best MLS teams of all time that relied heavily on Americans is also the one that plays its home games in Canada. White, Sabbi, Berhalter and Blackmon combined to play all but one minute of the 3-1 MLS Cup loss to Inter Miami.

I don't want to alarm anyone, but Banks was 18 at the beginning of the season, and he's now just a full-time starter for a team in the Bundesliga at a position that peaks later than average and typically favors older players. The main problem is that Augsburg isn't very good. In fact, the team is very bad: a minus-9.2 expected goal differential, worst in the Bundesliga. But Augsburg has been a lot better -- a roughly average side -- in the minutes when Banks has played.

It's all really promising, and if you were going to pick one out-of-nowhere player to not only make the World Cup roster, but start next summer, then Banks would be your guy. As long as he keeps playing, I'd be very surprised if he doesn't get a call-up to the next full camp.

It feels as if he moved to Manchester City just last year, but he's somehow already 28 years old.

Palmer-Brown never lived up to the hype after he debuted for Sporting Kansas City as a teen, starred at the 2017 under-20 World Cup, and signed with the best club team in the world. But now he's quietly just a starter for one of the biggest clubs in Greece, where he's managed by ... (cleans off glasses in a theatrical fashion that suggests I am familiar with the meme of Tobey Maguire in "Spider-Man") ... Rafa Benitez.

A quick shoutout to Sands, who recovered from a gruesome ankle break earlier in February to become one of St. Pauli's most reliable ball-winners this season.

Though he hasn't played particularly well, at least he's playing -- sometimes. Reyna has zero goals or assists through 255 league minutes for Gladbach, but he's already fewer than 100 minutes shy of his entire minutes haul with Dortmund last season.

The question for the rest of this season: Can he start playing more often? And a not-unrelated question to that: Can he start having more of an impact when he gets out there?

The legend of the bald USMNT keeper is born

The 2002 World Cup stands as the most successful run that the USMNT has made in that tournament in the post-1990 era. In the eight times since then that the USA has qualified, it is the only time the team has won two games in a World Cup. That record is in no small part thanks to the stellar play of goalkeeper Brad Friedel.

Fans on the East Coast would have been up at 4am to catch the opener where the USA faced Portugal. In that match, the Stars and Stripes shocked a team talented enough to win the World Cup. The Americans came away with a 3-2 win, however it was in the next match that Friedel began notching his name in the history books.

The USA went ahead 1-0 against South Korea thanks to Clint Mathis scoring in the 24th minute. That lead would be in jeopardy when Jeff Agoos committed a foul in the box on a free kick. Friedel saved the ensuing penalty but South Korea drew even in the 78th minute and the game would end 1-1. This video really captures the moment and is only helped by the music selection.

This moment would be critical because the Americans got beaten soundly 3-1 by Poland in the final group match. Had the penalty against South Korea gone in, the USA would have dropped the point they ended up needing to advance. While the final game in the group was a wash, it would be when Friedel stepped up and made another penalty save.

That save saw him become just the second keeper in World Cup history to save two penalties given in regular play in the same tournament. He joined, fittingly enough, Polish keeper Jan Tomaszewski who set the mark in 1974. Friedel's performance in the 2002 World Cup was one of the best, if not the best, showings for a keeper in the entire tournament. It would add to his legend as he would continue his terrific career abroad and earned him being nicknamed “The Human Wall” in the tournament.

Once again, Mauricio Pochettino was in tears.

The 53-year-old Argentine is, by his own admission, emotional. It's something fans of the U.S. men's national team came to learn after a narrow loss to rival Mexico in the Gold Cup final in July, when Pochettino broke down while addressing his players. 

But this time, his vulnerability wasn't public. It occurred last month in Tampa after Pochettino sparred with reporters — full disclosure, I was one of them — about the idea of the U.S. team having "regular" players following a resounding 5-1 win over two-time world champion Uruguay. 

It was when Scott Goodwin pulled him aside.

The post-match episode reminded Goodwin, one of the deep-pocketed donors who helped U.S. Soccer underwrite the former Chelsea, Paris Saint Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager's reported $6 million salary, of one of the most iconic tales in American sports. And one that was made into a Disney movie. 

The 2004 film "Miracle" recounts the true story of the triumphant 1980 U.S. men's Olympic hockey team. At those Games, a team comprised of amateur college players somehow defeated the fully professional four-time defending champion Soviet Union en route to the gold medal. Five decades later, the "Miracle on Ice" team and its story is still considered one of the greatest upsets in global sports history.

That squad was coached by Herb Brooks, a no-nonsense taskmaster who despised entitlement above all else and who demanded total sacrifice and buy-in from his players. He kept them guessing about who would make the final roster all the way until the eve of those Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, lest anyone took their spot on the squad for granted.

In the film, Brooks was deftly portrayed by actor Kurt Russell, who delivered on those great movie scenes that make you want to run through a wall. 

Pochettino, for all his obvious charm and warmth in social settings or in front of the cameras, is every bit as demanding on the training field — and, if necessary, as ruthless — as Brooks was on the ice.

"When Mauricio was mad at your question after the Uruguay game, he said something like, ‘These are the players today. It's not the A players or the B players' — that was a repeat of a scene from the film," Goodwin told me when I spoke to him this week.  "I said, ‘Watch this movie on the flight home.' 

"Well, he watched it.  And right away he sent me back the quote, 'I'm not looking for the best players. I'm looking for the right players.'  He picked up on that immediately." 

Since he was hired to replace Gregg Berhalter almost 15 months ago, Pochettino has tried to remake the U.S. team in his own image. The Americans were coming off a historically poor performance at the 2024 Copa América, where they became the first host nation not to reach the knockout stage in that tournament's century-plus-long history. With the all-important 2026 FIFA World Cup looming, the need for a world-class coach who could hold a group that had become far too comfortable to account and get the best out of them was obvious.

Having successfully managed the egos of bona fide superstars like Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar over a 15-year European club career, Pochettino would not tolerate even the most decorated U.S. veterans putting themselves ahead of the greater good. He called in hungry newcomers, some of whom have risen to the challenge to become mainstays. 

After losing to Panama and Canada in March, the U.S. ended the year on a five-game unbeaten streak (with four wins) — all against nations who have qualified for the World Cup next summer. It took some time, but Pochettino's message has clearly gotten through. The goal, he said again after last week's World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., is to win the World Cup — nothing less.

Previous U.S. coaches didn't dare set the bar so high publicly. Jürgen Klinsmann, a World Cup-winning player with Germany who helmed the Americans at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, famously said flat out it was impossible beforehand. Bruce Arena did the same 12 years earlier despite repeatedly telling his players in private they'd beat a stacked Portugal in their 2002 opener in South Korea. They did, and Arena's U.S. went on to reach the quarterfinals, still the country's best finish on the men's side since the inaugural 1930 event.

Although it might engender increased pressure and expectations — just eight countries have ever hoisted the World Cup — there's a good reason Pochettino and his staff aren't setting any limits on what the U.S. can accomplish on home soil. The current odds for the Americans lifting the trophy next July 19 in New Jersey are about 80-1. In just his second full season coaching in England's Premier League, Leicester City overcame 5000–1 odds to win the title. Greece won the Euros in 2004 as a 150-1 underdog. (The 1980 Olympic hockey team's chances of beating the Russians were as high as 1000-1, based on some estimates.)

There's even a precedent with the U.S. team, which stunned pre-tournament favorite England 1-0 at the 1950 World Cup in Brazil — a result so unlikely some news outlets reported it as a 10-1 victory for the Three Lions, assuming the wire services were in error.

But to "do the impossible," as the coach likes to say, all of Pochettino's charges have to believe that they can achieve what most clear-eyed outsiders are convinced they can't.

"If we don't have this synergy and that energy in between 26 players, we can win one game," Pochettino told reporters last week after the U.S. drew Paraguay, Australia and a yet-to-be-determined European side as their World Cup opponents.  "But [to win] a competition like the World Cup, it's impossible."

Which is why he needs the right collective group of players — not necessarily the best individual ones. 

"Good and right is completely different," he said, yet another reference to "Miracle."

Speaking at U.S. Soccer's Beyond the 90 Summit in New York City a few days earlier before the World Cup draw, it was clear the story had greatly influenced Pochettino.

"I'm in love with this movie," he told FOX Sports colleague Jenny Taft, who moderated the discussion. "I was watching, and I was nearly crying."

"Nearly?," Taft joked.

"OK, I was crying," Pochettino said. "We identified with so many things in the movie, how a group of 20 players who really believed in an idea [made it come true]. It's an amazing story.  I think it represents very well the culture of the USA — your culture."

That was Goodwin's idea when he made the recommendation.

"It's an American story about grit," he said. "At Mauricio's first press conference, he talked about grit and confidence and belief, and that's what he's tried to instill in this team.

"I thought the movie would allow him to connect with American culture more and understand a little bit more about our sports culture," Goodwin added. "Because in this country, sports is a lot of the culture. Some of the most patriotic moments in this country have been sports moments. 

"So for him to get to see that, and know that this kind of thing happened in this country, it made him believe a bit more that the kind of passion and belief and grit that he says the Argentinian national team has also exists here."

Pochettino has tapped into that notion even more in the days since the draw. An avid consumer of American pop culture — music, TV shows — the country's can-do spirit is one of the things that attracted him to the job. He's talked openly about his desire to leave a legacy behind whenever he leaves. For him, the opportunity to try to make history with an underdog that also happens to be the home team at the biggest World Cup ever staged was too seductive to pass up.

Which is why Pochettino even attended a New York Rangers hockey game at Madison Square Garden – coincidentally, the team that Brooks coached from 1981-85. 

"This is an unbelievable country, unbelievable people," said Pochettino during an appearance on the Pat McAfee Show on Monday, a day after the Rangers game. "When you are [invested], it's possible that you can achieve everything that you want. You arrived on the moon, you were the first. It's the most powerful country in every single area. Why not in soccer?"

He has the same question for those who doubt that the U.S. can orchestrate its own miracle next summer: "Why not us?"

Once again, Mauricio Pochettino was in tears.

The 53-year-old Argentine is, by his own admission, emotional. It's something fans of the U.S. men's national team came to learn after a narrow loss to rival Mexico in the Gold Cup final in July, when Pochettino broke down while addressing his players. 

But this time, his vulnerability wasn't public. It occurred last month in Tampa after Pochettino sparred with reporters — full disclosure, I was one of them — about the idea of the U.S. team having "regular" players following a resounding 5-1 win over two-time world champion Uruguay. 

It was when Scott Goodwin pulled him aside.

The post-match episode reminded Goodwin, one of the deep-pocketed donors who helped U.S. Soccer underwrite the former Chelsea, Paris Saint Germain and Tottenham Hotspur manager's reported $6 million salary, of one of the most iconic tales in American sports. And one that was made into a Disney movie. 

The 2004 film "Miracle" recounts the true story of the triumphant 1980 U.S. men's Olympic hockey team. At those Games, a team comprised of amateur college players somehow defeated the fully professional four-time defending champion Soviet Union en route to the gold medal. Five decades later, the "Miracle on Ice" team and its story is still considered one of the greatest upsets in global sports history.

That squad was coached by Herb Brooks, a no-nonsense taskmaster who despised entitlement above all else and who demanded total sacrifice and buy-in from his players. He kept them guessing about who would make the final roster all the way until the eve of those Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, lest anyone took their spot on the squad for granted.

In the film, Brooks was deftly portrayed by actor Kurt Russell, who delivered on those great movie scenes that make you want to run through a wall. 

Pochettino, for all his obvious charm and warmth in social settings or in front of the cameras, is every bit as demanding on the training field — and, if necessary, as ruthless — as Brooks was on the ice.

"When Mauricio was mad at your question after the Uruguay game, he said something like, ‘These are the players today. It's not the A players or the B players' — that was a repeat of a scene from the film," Goodwin told me when I spoke to him this week.  "I said, ‘Watch this movie on the flight home.' 

"Well, he watched it.  And right away he sent me back the quote, 'I'm not looking for the best players. I'm looking for the right players.'  He picked up on that immediately." 

Since he was hired to replace Gregg Berhalter almost 15 months ago, Pochettino has tried to remake the U.S. team in his own image. The Americans were coming off a historically poor performance at the 2024 Copa América, where they became the first host nation not to reach the knockout stage in that tournament's century-plus-long history. With the all-important 2026 FIFA World Cup looming, the need for a world-class coach who could hold a group that had become far too comfortable to account and get the best out of them was obvious.

Having successfully managed the egos of bona fide superstars like Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar over a 15-year European club career, Pochettino would not tolerate even the most decorated U.S. veterans putting themselves ahead of the greater good. He called in hungry newcomers, some of whom have risen to the challenge to become mainstays. 

After losing to Panama and Canada in March, the U.S. ended the year on a five-game unbeaten streak (with four wins) — all against nations who have qualified for the World Cup next summer. It took some time, but Pochettino's message has clearly gotten through. The goal, he said again after last week's World Cup draw in Washington, D.C., is to win the World Cup — nothing less.

Previous U.S. coaches didn't dare set the bar so high publicly. Jürgen Klinsmann, a World Cup-winning player with Germany who helmed the Americans at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, famously said flat out it was impossible beforehand. Bruce Arena did the same 12 years earlier despite repeatedly telling his players in private they'd beat a stacked Portugal in their 2002 opener in South Korea. They did, and Arena's U.S. went on to reach the quarterfinals, still the country's best finish on the men's side since the inaugural 1930 event.

Although it might engender increased pressure and expectations — just eight countries have ever hoisted the World Cup — there's a good reason Pochettino and his staff aren't setting any limits on what the U.S. can accomplish on home soil. The current odds for the Americans lifting the trophy next July 19 in New Jersey are about 80-1. In just his second full season coaching in England's Premier League, Leicester City overcame 5000–1 odds to win the title. Greece won the Euros in 2004 as a 150-1 underdog. (The 1980 Olympic hockey team's chances of beating the Russians were as high as 1000-1, based on some estimates.)

There's even a precedent with the U.S. team, which stunned pre-tournament favorite England 1-0 at the 1950 World Cup in Brazil — a result so unlikely some news outlets reported it as a 10-1 victory for the Three Lions, assuming the wire services were in error.

But to "do the impossible," as the coach likes to say, all of Pochettino's charges have to believe that they can achieve what most clear-eyed outsiders are convinced they can't.

"If we don't have this synergy and that energy in between 26 players, we can win one game," Pochettino told reporters last week after the U.S. drew Paraguay, Australia and a yet-to-be-determined European side as their World Cup opponents.  "But [to win] a competition like the World Cup, it's impossible."

Which is why he needs the right collective group of players — not necessarily the best individual ones. 

"Good and right is completely different," he said, yet another reference to "Miracle."

Speaking at U.S. Soccer's Beyond the 90 Summit in New York City a few days earlier before the World Cup draw, it was clear the story had greatly influenced Pochettino.

"I'm in love with this movie," he told FOX Sports colleague Jenny Taft, who moderated the discussion. "I was watching, and I was nearly crying."

"Nearly?," Taft joked.

"OK, I was crying," Pochettino said. "We identified with so many things in the movie, how a group of 20 players who really believed in an idea [made it come true]. It's an amazing story.  I think it represents very well the culture of the USA — your culture."

That was Goodwin's idea when he made the recommendation.

"It's an American story about grit," he said. "At Mauricio's first press conference, he talked about grit and confidence and belief, and that's what he's tried to instill in this team.

"I thought the movie would allow him to connect with American culture more and understand a little bit more about our sports culture," Goodwin added. "Because in this country, sports is a lot of the culture. Some of the most patriotic moments in this country have been sports moments. 

"So for him to get to see that, and know that this kind of thing happened in this country, it made him believe a bit more that the kind of passion and belief and grit that he says the Argentinian national team has also exists here."

Pochettino has tapped into that notion even more in the days since the draw. An avid consumer of American pop culture — music, TV shows — the country's can-do spirit is one of the things that attracted him to the job. He's talked openly about his desire to leave a legacy behind whenever he leaves. For him, the opportunity to try to make history with an underdog that also happens to be the home team at the biggest World Cup ever staged was too seductive to pass up.

Which is why Pochettino even attended a New York Rangers hockey game at Madison Square Garden – coincidentally, the team that Brooks coached from 1981-85. 

"This is an unbelievable country, unbelievable people," said Pochettino during an appearance on the Pat McAfee Show on Monday, a day after the Rangers game. "When you are [invested], it's possible that you can achieve everything that you want. You arrived on the moon, you were the first. It's the most powerful country in every single area. Why not in soccer?"

He has the same question for those who doubt that the U.S. can orchestrate its own miracle next summer: "Why not us?"

The third phase of ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup opened Thursday, and the prices immediately sparked outrage among fans.

“What FIFA is doing is inconceivable,” said Erik Vales, a Fort Worth resident who has attended the World Cups in Brazil (2014), Russia (2018), and Qatar (2022).

Vales was stunned by the soaring costs in this latest sales window, which offered fans another chance to secure seats for the tournament set to take place next summer in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

AT&T Stadium in Arlington will host more matches than any other venue, with nine games scheduled, including a semifinal.

Last weekend's announcement of the groups, schedules and venues for all 104 matches only pushed ticket prices higher.

FIFA has divided tickets into three categories:

Category 1: lower bowl seating

Category 2: middle tier

Category 3: upper level

For the first time, FIFA has introduced dynamic pricing, meaning ticket costs fluctuate based on demand for marquee matchups.

At AT&T Stadium, where reigning world champion Argentina, led by Lionel Messi, will take the field. FIFA has also set ticket prices for the marquee clash between England, ranked fourth in FIFA's standings, and Croatia, ranked 10th.

Tickets for Argentina vs. Austria (June 22), Argentina vs. Jordan (June 27), and England vs. Croatia are priced at $700 in Category 1, $500 in Category 2, and $265 in Category 3.

The most expensive group-stage ticket currently listed is for the United States vs. Paraguay opener on June 12 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, priced at $2,735 in Category 1. 

The opening match of the tournament, Mexico vs. South Africa on June 11 at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, is listed at $2,355 for Category 1 seats.

“Today's prices are insane,” said Vales, who displayed a Category 1 ticket for which he paid $175 to attend the group-stage match between Mexico and Croatia at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

At the World Cup in Russia, he paid $210 for a Category 1 ticket, and at the Qatar World Cup, he paid $220 for a ticket in the same category.

To attend the 2026 World Cup, fans can purchase individual tickets through FIFA's site if selected in a lottery. Otherwise, they must turn to hospitality packages, which cost thousands of dollars.

On the secondary market, prices have skyrocketed even further.

Resale tickets listed Thursday for Argentina vs. Austria at AT&T Stadium ranged from $1,697 in Category 1, $1,606 in Category 2, and $1,124 in Category 3. Some lower-bowl seats were listed for as much as $10,588.

“The dynamic pricing model is a game-changer. Before, you could buy tickets knowing the price wouldn't change regardless of which teams played. What FIFA is doing now, in my opinion, is price gouging, which is illegal in the United States,” Vales said.

Fan organization Football Supporters Europe (FSE) echoed those concerns, calling the current prices “extortionate.”

“This is a monumental betrayal of the tradition of the World Cup, ignoring the contribution of supporters to the spectacle it is,” FSE said in a statement.

The group-stage prices stand in stark contrast to FIFA's claims that $60 tickets would be available. U.S. soccer officials, when bidding for the tournament seven years ago, promised thousands of $21 seats during the opening phase of the tournament.

The prices announced by FIFA on Thursday will remain fixed through Jan. 13, the deadline for fans to apply for tickets. 

After that, FIFA will randomly select applicants, charge them the listed prices, and distribute tickets in February. Those not chosen will receive rejection notices.

Before Thursday's announcement, and even before the official World Cup draw, FIFA had already sold nearly 2 million tickets across two early lottery phases. 

In October, the organization set prices based on round and venue. By November, it had raised some of those prices in response to surging demand.

Vales, a veteran fan who has traveled across three continents to watch World Cup matches, now wonders if he'll be able to attend the tournament being staged in his own backyard.

“We're not asking for free tickets,” he said. “The only thing we're asking FIFA for is fair prices.”

Soccer fans have accused FIFA of a “monumental betrayal” after latest prices for World Cup tickets began to circulate on Thursday. 

The governing body allocates 8% of tickets to national associations for games involving their team to sell to the most loyal fans.

And a list published by the German soccer federation revealed prices ranged from $180-$700 for varying group stage games. The lowest price for the final was $4,185 and the highest was $8,680.

Those group-stage prices are very different from FIFA's claims of $60 tickets being available, while the target from United States soccer officials when bidding for the tournament seven years ago was to offer hundreds of thousands of $21 seats across the opening phase of games. 

Fan organization Football Supporters Europe (FSE) described the current prices as “extortionate.”

“This is a monumental betrayal of the tradition of the World Cup, ignoring the contribution of supporters to the spectacle it is,” it said in a statement. 

The English Football Association shared pricing information with the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) on Thursday evening, which showed that if a fan bought a ticket for every game through to the final it would cost just over $7,000.

FIFA said in September that tickets released through its website would initially range from $60 for group-stage matches to $6,730 for the final. But those prices are subject to change as it adopts dynamic pricing for the first time at the World Cup. 




FIFA tickets are available in four categories, with the best seats in Category 1.

In the price list published by the German federation, there were only three categories. 

The lowest priced ticket was $180 for Germany's opening group game against Curacao in Houston. The lowest price for the semifinal was $920 rising to $1,125.

The FSE called on FIFA to immediately halt ticket sales via national associations “until a solution that respects the tradition, universality, and cultural significance of the World Cup is found.”

The Associated Press approached FIFA for comment.

FIFA launched its third phase of widespread ticket sales Thursday, with fans now able to apply for specific matches for the first time through its “Random Selection Draw.”

Following last week's draw for the 2026 tournament, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, an updated schedule has been published.

That means fans know when and where the likes of Lionel Messi and Argentina will play. Previous ticket ballots were blind as the qualification period had not even been completed and the draw was yet to take place. 

Now participating nations have been placed in groups, with their paths through the tournament determined. For instance, Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo could go on to meet in the quarterfinals in Kansas City if both Argentina and Portugal top their respective groups. 

Not that fans are guaranteed to get tickets to the games they apply for. 

The draw opened Dec. 11 at 11 a.m. ET (1600 GMT) and closes Jan. 13, 2026. 

FIFA says ticket applications can be made at any point during this window and the timing of entry will not impact the chances of success. Fans can apply via FIFA's website for a maximum of four tickets per household per match and a maximum of 40 tickets throughout the tournament. 

Fans will need a FIFA ID to apply for tickets and can pick which matches and which pricing category they want to apply for.

Successful applicants will be notified by email in February and charged automatically.

The last time the U.S. hosted the World Cup in 1994 prices ranged from $25 to $475. In Qatar in 2022 prices ranged from around $70 to $1,600 when ticket details were announced.

Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium on July 19 are already going for in excess of $11,000 on secondary resale sites.

For this tournament FIFA has also set up its own resale platform where it charges a 15% fee based on the total resale price. 

FIFA said that closer to the tournament any remaining tickets will go on general sale on a first-come, first-served basis.

It did not reveal a time frame for the release of those remaining tickets.

 Carlos Alcaraz and his team took home three honours in the 2025 ATP Awards, capping a standout season in which the Spaniard secured ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF for the second time. 

 The 22-year-old claimed the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award, while his team Juan Carlos Ferrero and Samuel Lopez are voted Coach of the Year, guiding him to a Tour-leading eight titles in 2025, including two majors. 

 Jannik Sinner was voted Fans' Favourite for a third time, adding to a growing list of honours, including Newcomer of the Year (2019) and Most Improved Player (2024). In doubles, Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori also repeated as Fans' Favourite, the first back-to-back winners of the doubles award since Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan (2005-17). 

 The ATP Awards also recognised Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool as ATP Doubles No. 1 presented by PIF, achieving the feat in their first full season as a team. 

 Valentin Vacherot captures Breakthrough of the Year after a historic title run in Shanghai, where he defeated his cousin Arthur Rinderknech in the final to become the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 champion in history. 

 Andrey Rublev received the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award in recognition of his mental health advocacy and ongoing work through the Andrey Rublev Foundation, launched in 2024 to support children struggling with critical illness. 

 Tournament award winners included the Cincinnati Open (ATP Masters 1000), Qatar Exxonmobil Open in Doha (ATP 500), and Nordea Open in Bastad (ATP 250). On the ATP Challenger Tour, honours went to the BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux (ATP Challenger 175), Bahrain Ministry of Interior Tennis Challenger in Manama (ATP Challenger 125), Cranbrook Tennis Classic in Bloomfield Hills (ATP Challenger 100), Copa Internacional de Tenis in Curitiba (ATP Challenger 75), and Bolivia Open in Santa Cruz (ATP Challenger 50). 

 For the first time, members of the exclusive ATP No. 1 Club – current and former World No. 1 players – voted to decide two award categories: the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award and Breakthrough of the Year, a new award introduced this year to recognise milestone wins, significant jumps in the PIF ATP Rankings and first ATP Tour titles.

He reclaimed the position from Sinner after winning the US Open and has held it for all but one week since.

Five ATP Challenger tournaments have been honoured as Tournament of the Year in their respective categories. The winner at Challenger 175 level — the biggest category on that circuit — is the BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux.


Challenger 175 Tournament of the Year - BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France
A clay-court tournament held during the second week of the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome, the Bordeaux Challenger naturally draws a standout entry list. This year, all eight seeded players were inside the Top 80 of the PIF ATP Rankings, including eventual champion Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. 


Held at the historic Villa Primrose Bordeaux in southwest France, the Challenger 175 tournament's recognition goes beyond its stacked draw. The BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux is celebrated for its first-class hospitality to players and fans alike.


“We are truly honoured to receive this trophy, which recognises all the hard work put in over the years to grow the BNP Paribas Primrose Bordeaux tournament,” said tournament director Jean-Baptiste Perlant. “We would like to sincerely thank the ATP, as well as the players who have supported our event.


“I would like to share this with all the staff, volunteers, Villa Primrose's members and partners for their precious help.”

The F1 Rookies' Season Review

A chaotic Cooldown Room end of season quiz

Despite missing out on this year's title, Oscar Piastri will achieve the feat one day according to McLaren team mate Lando Norris.

Lando Norris believes that Oscar Piastri "will be a world champion" one day, having denied his McLaren team mate this year's title in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Norris became only the 35th driver to win the Formula 1 Drivers' Championship, with third place in Sunday's race at the Yas Marina Circuit enough for him to claim the crown by two points from Red Bull's Max Verstappen.

Piastri finished third in the standings, just 13 points behind Norris, despite having led for the majority of the season and recording the same number of wins as Norris with seven.

Piastri also held a 34-point lead at one stage after Norris' Dutch GP retirement, but a run of six Grands Prix without a podium in the final part of the season ultimately contributed to him missing out on a maiden title.

While Piastri admitted it was "not quite the ending I wished for", Norris was quick to praise his team mate and Verstappen amidst his own title celebrations, believing Piastri's time would come.

"I had two other guys who were pretty freaking fast and certainly made my life tough this year," said the 26-year-old.

"Oscar the whole way since round one, I knew he was probably going to be the toughest guy to beat and then you can never count out Max, he's Max.

"We certainly never counted him out and for anyone who might have done, he proved you wrong. I'm glad we kept ourselves on our toes and we were ready for such a thing, but a pleasure to fight Max, four-time world champion.

"For me to have those fights against him and enjoy those moments, maybe not always enjoy them but some of them, but just to share the track and fight against another world champion like him and certainly Oscar as well, who will be a world champion.

"I really enjoyed this season because of that. As much as they made my life hell a lot of the time, those moments I almost enjoyed the most."

“Love Island USA” fan-favorite Chelley Bissainthe is officially single — and she broke the news exclusively on SiriusXM's Page Six Radio on Friday.

During an emotional conversation, the Season 7 star revealed for the first time that she and fellow Islander Ace Greene — whom she fell for and coupled up with on the hit Peacock reality dating series — have ended their relationship.

“Ace and I actually decided to part ways,” Bissainthe shared, explaining that the choice was far from easy. “It really was a tough decision, like, for the both of us and very hard to decide. But, you know, when you love someone, sometimes loving someone means letting go. So I think we just got to a decision that was best.”

Bissainthe, 24, and Greene, 23, became one of the standout couples of Season 7, quickly forming a deep bond that viewers rallied behind. Their chemistry carried them through challenges, recouplings and Casa Amor turbulence — ultimately solidifying them as one of the season's most beloved pairings even after cameras stopped rolling.

But behind the scenes, Bissainthe says the pair faced real-world pressures that tested them in ways villa life never did.

“[There was] a mutual level of respect and understanding that we wanted this to work. But sometimes things don't work,” she admitted. “Couples go through things that are very challenging and sometimes the best thing to do is make a decision that needs to be made.”

The reality star explained that the breakup didn't happen overnight — and that both she and Greene were committed to communicating openly before choosing to part ways.

“We had a lot of conversations,” she said. “At the end of the day, it was just a mutual agreement of, like, this is for the best.”

Part of what weighed on her, Bissainthe acknowledged, was thinking about the fans who championed the couple from the moment they met on the show. Still, she trusts their supporters will understand.

“I've definitely thought about our supporters, our fans and stuff,” she said. “But I'll trust that they'll understand that this decision needed to be made if we were able to come to this mutual decision.”

Bissainthe chose not to disclose specifics about what led to the split, saying both she and Greene deserve grace and privacy.

“A lot happens in relationships. People can understand that,” she explained. “I think out of respect for the both of us, the details aren't really necessary. I think that we can be peaceful and understand that we're good with being able to be on the same page.”

Despite the breakup, Bissainthe insists the love between them was always real.

“Our relationship, from the very beginning, our understanding was our relationship wasn't for the press, for the media or anything,” she said. “It was because I truly love you, you truly love me. But challenges happen in relationships and sometimes, like I said, you just want to be able to say, ‘You know what, let's leave it right here before it turns into something it never needs to be.' Like, we can leave off with light and love.”

Now, the Los Angeles-based beauty says she's embracing a new chapter — one focused entirely on herself.

“Honestly, this whole process is going to come with a lot of healing, a lot of growth, a lot of time with myself,” she noted. “So I would just love that privacy and be able to focus on myself going forward.”

Still, she holds nothing but gratitude for Greene and the time they shared.

“We are put on this earth to experience people,” she reflected. “Sometimes we want it to last a lifetime and sometimes … it's for that moment in time. I'm very grateful nonetheless and at the end of the day, I wish Ace the best. And for myself, I just have to focus on healing and growth, what's next.”

Page Six reached out to a rep for Greene for comment, but did not immediately hear back. 

As for whether that “next” could include another appearance on “Love Island USA,” Bissainthe laughed.

“I don't know about that,” she said. “Maybe if they want me to guest-host or something, I would love that. But as far as searching for love there and being a contestant, I think I had my fair share.”

Palme d'Or winner Julia Ducournau showed how deftly she could employ genre and metaphor with her first two features, 2016's cannibal-themed “Raw” and the 2021 automotive body horror “Titane.” But based on early reactions, the French filmmaker's third feature, “Alpha,” proved an even higher concept.

“Alpha” stars newcomer Mélissa Boros as the film's titular 13-year-old protagonist, who is coming of age in a world plagued by a mysterious blood-borne virus that turns people into hardened, statue-like figures coughing up clay sand. Despite seemingly being aware of the risks, Alpha participates in needle-sharing one night, getting a large “A” tattooed on her arm at a house party where Portishead thumps in the background.

But the gravity of the situation only sets in when Alpha's single mother (Golshifteh Farahani) — a doctor at the local hospital who dedicates her days to treating people infected with the virus — finds out about the tattoo and forces her daughter to get tested.  

 










As the pair wait to find out if Alpha is destined to become another petrified victim of the virus, her estranged uncle Amin (Tahar Rahim) comes back into the picture, plagued by the symptoms of heroin withdrawal. This pushes Alpha further into a state of unrest over her fate, and adds a more literal element to Ducournau's AIDS allegory, while the film flashes back to happier times from the girl's childhood. 

Neon has released the trailer for “Alpha,” which premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival and also stars Emma Mackey, Finnegan Oldfield, and Louai El Amrousy. Set to “The Mercy Seat” by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, the somber montage of scenes underscores what some critics have described as an uncharacteristically self-serious quality about the film.

That quality, however, seems to be by design. In an interview with Vanity Fair back in March, Ducournau said that, upon reflection, she'd been annoyed with herself for staying in her “comfort zone” with her first two films and was looking to tap into something new with her next work.  

“I realized that I was saying something I'd already said in my two previous films. I got bored with it — and annoyed with myself for allowing myself to stay in that comfort zone. From film to film, I always feel like I can go further in the way I expose myself, which is incredibly hard to do,” Ducournau said. 

 










“With each film, I'm thinking that I can put myself in a more vulnerable place, in order to relate to the audience more and more,” she added. “And I'm not done digging. It's an eternal path: How can I be more sincere? How can I get closer to my emotions? How can I show them in a more precise way, with more generosity? To me, that is the only path. That's why I make films.” 

Fans of the French director — who, up until now, has been known for a different sort of body horror — will be able to see her charting a different path when Neon releases “Alpha” in U.S. theaters on March 27, 2026.

Walt Disney Animation Studios‘ Zootopia 2 will hop past the $1B mark worldwide with today's business included. The global box office total through Thursday is $986.1M. Of that, $232.7M is from domestic and $753.4M is from the international box office. The Jared Bush/Byron Howard-directed sequel will be the second studio movie to $1B in 2025 (following Disney's Lilo & Stitch), and becomes the fastest ever to $1B among all Hollywood animated films as well as all PG-rated titles — getting there in just 17 days.


	Crossing the threshold also marks the first back-to-back billion-dollar releases for Walt Disney Animation Studios, following last year's Moana 2. The studio now counts five billion-dollar titles since 2013: Frozen, Frozen 2, Moana 2, Zootopia and Zootopia 2.

	











	“Everyone at Disney Animation put their heart, soul and passion into this film to tell a story full of joy, imagination and incredible thoughtfulness,” said Bush, Chief Creative Officer, Walt Disney Animation Studios. “This milestone means the world to us, because more than anything, it means audiences are coming to theaters for a shared experience of watching this movie on the big screen, everyone together, from all walks of life around the world – and that is a Zootopia dream come true.”

EXCLUSIVE: Television's steamiest Heated Rivalry is just getting started.


	We can reveal Canadian streamer Crave has greenlighted a second season of LGBTQ+ ice hockey drama, with HBO Max again boarding for rights in the U.S. and Australia and now striking deals with program distributor Sphere Abacus for more territories.


	The Warner Bros Discovery-owned streamer has tapped series for Season 1 and Season 2 rights for Europe (excluding the UK, Ireland, Spain and Turkey), Asia and Latin America, and Neon/Sky New Zealand is also returning for Season 2. The HBO Max agreement is Asia spans Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, Macau, Sri Lanka and Nepal.

			Watch on Deadline		







Heated Rivalry, about a pair of top professional hockey players who secretly develop a romantic relationship that lasts over the years, quickly established itself as a flagship show for Crave and has been hailed by several reviewers as among the most significant LGBTQ+ shows on television. We've been tracking it closely since it was announced at the Crave Upfront this year and named it a show to watch at MIPCOM Cannes in October, where Sphere Abacus introduced the show to international buyers.


	The steamy drama is now Crave's biggest original series on record, growing its viewership by nearly 400% in initial seven-day streams following its debut two weeks ago on Friday, November 28, per mParticle and Amazon Channels internal data.

	It has emerging as a cultural lightning rod in Canada and has been a social media sensation across North America and Europe, with fan edits, reaction threads and behind-the-scenes clips flooding feeds across platforms. The buzz began early, with Heated Rivalry a top three trending topic on X in hockey-mad Canada during its premiere weekend. The final episode is due to drop on Friday, December 26.


	More international deals are expected soon, as buzz continues even in territories where the show isn't yet available. We understand several buyers in the UK have been chasing Heated Rivalry, with a deal looking imminent.


	Created by Canadian writer-director-producer Jacob Tierney (Letterkenny, Shoresy) and based on Rachel Reid best-selling book series Game Changers, the six-episode, one-hour romantic drama tells the story of rival hockey players Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) and Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie).

	They are two of the biggest stars in Major League Hockey, tied together by their ambition, rivalry and a magnetic pull neither of them understands. They begin a secret fling as rookies that morphs into a long journey of love, denial and self-discovery over the next eight years. They're forced to decide if there is room for love in their fiercely competitive world. 


	Earlier this week, my colleague Glenn Garner spoke with leads Williams and Storrie about the newest episode on Season 1, titled “Rose.” The pair leads an ensemble cast that includes François Arnaud as Scott Hunter, Robbie G.K. as Kip Grady, Christina Chang and Dylan Walsh as Yuna and David Hollander, Sophie Nélisse as Rose Landry, and Ksenia Daniela Kharlamova as Svetlana.


	“Heated Rivalry represents the very best of what Canadian creators can deliver: rich characters, compelling drama and a world audiences want to live in,” said Justin Stockman, VP Content and Programming at Crave parent Bell Media. “The response has been extraordinary, and seeing the series now travelling internationally is an incredible milestone.”


	In a statement, show creator Tierney and executive producer Brendan Brady added: “Watching our show become an international phenomenon has been extraordinary. We're profoundly grateful to everyone that has been on this journey with us. Being renewed for a second season so early is a true honor, and we can't wait to bring you even more of what you love.”


Heated Rivalry comes from Tierney and Brady's Accent Aigu Entertainment in association with Crave, with the participation of the Canada Media Fund and the Bell Fund. Tierney is writer, director, producer and executive producer, with Brady the producer and executive producer. Lori Fischburg is producer and book writer Reid is consulting producer.


	For Bell Media, Alison Korogyi is Senior Production Executive, Original Programming; Sarah Fowlie is Head of Production, Original Programming; Adam Feigen is Development Executive, Scripted Original Programming Rachel Goldstein-Couto is Head of Development, Original Programming; Brian Blazik is Head of Bell Media Sales, Sphere Abacus; Carlyn Klebuc is General Manager, Original Programming; and Stockman is Vice President, Content Development & Programming.


	The series is distributed internationally by Sphere Abacus, which is owned by Canadian producer Sphere Media and the primary distributor of programming from Bell, which is also a stakeholder in the UK-based company.

	











	Accent Aigu Entertainment is repped by CAA & 3 Arts. Their attorney is Jayme Alter of Dentons Canada LLP.

				Kehlani's ‘Folded' reigned over a standout year for R&B

T
his year, Kehlani turned 30 after spending more than a decade flying — and at times flailing — in the public eye as one of R&B's modern torchbearers. The singer-songwriter (who uses she/they pronouns) has mastered a lot in that time. Not too long ago, she took up surfing, a hobby that helped further tether her to her late father and inspired her third studio album, Blue Water Road. She's been a faithful gym rat as of late, too, as evidenced by abs so enviable some onlookers were convinced she had etched them.


	Then, after a career spanning four studio albums, four mixtapes, and five Grammy nominations, she found the perfect balance of nostalgia and innovation in “Folded” — an addictive song on romantic reconciliation that became her highest charting hit. It's earned her two more nominations at the 2026 Grammys. Both categories — Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance — are packed with excellent music, representing a banner year for the genre she's been a faithful student of her whole life. In the Best R&B Performance race, in particular, the singer is up against two good friends — Justin Bieber, for “Yukon,” and Leon Thomas, for his rendition of “Mutt” on NPR's Tiny Desk. Over Zoom from her home in Los Angeles, she tells me they've all talked in celebration.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“I'm so excited to be in a category with people that I love,” says Kehlani. “I love Justin. I fucking love Leon. That is my brother. Those are my family members.” When Kehlani was new to Los Angeles from Oakland and dropping songs on SoundCloud, Thomas was one half of the formidable production duo the Rascals alongside Khris Riddick-Tynes. Today, Riddick-Tynes is executive producing the forthcoming album Kehlani's hard at work on and was part of the team that brought “Folded” to life. “My first sessions in L.A. were with them,” she says of the duo. “I've been working with Leon and Khris since the beginning of time. Leon is secretly doing background vocals on a lot of my music. He texted us that morning and was like ‘My Grammy Award-nominated family!' That's a party. I'm just happy, man.”

	While “Folded” is an incredible feat of music-making, the Best R&B Performance nomination is especially fitting. It's undeniably been a song for the real vocalists — think Whitney Houston's canonical bite in telling an interviewer, “I listen to singers.… I very rarely listen to people who cannot sing,” and citing greats like Anita Baker and Luther Vandross. “Folded” exploded, in part, as netizens across social media tried their hand at covers. The song became part playground, part proving ground for the gifted.


	Slowly but surely, R&B veterans joined in. First, there was Mario, of “Let Me Love You” fame, in August. Then, Brandy — often called the “Vocal Bible” by other singers and who Kehlani has fiercely defended as one of the genre's most seminal voices — shared a cover with runs stacked to the high heavens in September. Jojo, who first debuted her stunning voice as a teen in 2004, tried her hand at it. Toni Braxton surprised fans with her snippet on Oct. 7, her 58th birthday — so did Tank. Later that month, all five artists, plus Ne-Yo, appeared on an official EP of “Folded” remixes. 


	It shows how difficult a song like “Folded” is to body, even for Kehlani and especially live. A seasoned stage performer, the only vocal tracks she uses are background parts and dance breaks. “There's not a lot of room for breath in the lead of ‘Folded,'” she explains. “It's traveling through a lot of my range. You don't really realize, until you have to sing that with no support, that you just got to smack that lead up and down. It's been a funny thing, but I think I got the hang of it now.”


	When I ask Kehlani what most prepared her for the monster of a song, her answer veers slightly from the heuristic. “There's an actual technical factor, and then there's a super spiritual factor that's happening in my life.” As for the latter: “I don't think at any point in my career I was ready to hold the level of pressure and success that I have right now. The way that this song is changing my realm and my world and my trajectory, I don't think that I could have held it any other time. I think God was just waiting for me to meet him with, ‘I can hold this. I'm sound enough. I'm sane enough. I'm spiritually grounded enough to be given a task like this or a season like this,' to be honest.”

	Released in June, “Folded” came as Kehlani was finally finding some peace living with bipolar II disorder, which she shared publicly in April, on her birthday. After months of struggling to find a psychiatrist accepting clients, she says, “I got diagnosed mid-crisis. Actually year one of the genocide, I'm sitting online having full-blown screaming fests with the phone.”

	











	Kehlani has been outspoken against the Israeli government since it began retaliating against Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that killed more than 1,200 people and kidnapped 251 hostages. The death toll in Gaza now tops 70,000. Kehlani, a United Nations commission, and the International Association of Genocide Scholars say Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians. Israel's Foreign Ministry has rejected that assertion, specifically calling a report commissioned by the United Nations' Human Rights Council “distorted and false.”


	The star has since been joined in her outcry by hundreds of musicians and labels who have supported initiatives like No Music for Genocide, including Hayley Williams, Japanese Breakfast, Muna, Clairo, Lucy Dacus, Nao, Faye Webster, MIKE, redveil, and more. Yet, back in October 2023, via Instagram, Kehlani broadly criticized her peers for being unengaged. In May 2024, as she prepared to release her last album, Crash, she doubled down. 


	Now, she notes she was also experiencing mania as she posted online incessantly at points. The psychiatric episodes, she says, heightened her very real anger and made her less strategic than she's learned to be since. “I'm just as mind-blown that people can sit around and be silent about this,” she tells me now. “But the way in which I would've gone about it would've probably been a lot more careful because I think I was just screaming and I alienated a lot of people in my realm that I really wish I could have just pulled in for conversation.” (Much more on this, in her own words, below.) 


	While many fans commended Kehlani's advocacy, the backlash was swift and harsh elsewhere. In the spring, Cornell University's president canceled a concert she was set to play, citing Kehlani's “antisemitic, anti-Israel sentiments in performances, videos, and on social media.” She rebuked the notion that she was antisemitic, saying at the time, “I am anti-genocide, I am anti the actions of the Israeli government, I am anti an extermination of an entire people, I'm anti the bombing of innocent children, men women … that's what I'm anti.” Then, under pressure from New York City mayor Eric Adam's office, the popular SummerStage concert series canceled her appearance set to celebrate Pride. 


	Today, Kehlani says, she couldn't even count the total number of paid opportunities she's lost: “It was coming from every angle.” This says nothing of the “massive amounts of death threats” the singer says she's received. Yet, for Kehlani — who has been no stranger to condemnation in the past, for everything from her love life to her tattoos — the most consequential controversy of her career has overlapped with the height of her mainstream success.

	











	“I just don't think that there was a way that I could have appreciated where I'm at right now without experiencing what I experienced,” she says. “I also think that it was necessary because I think that it's imperative that people see me thrive after this, so that they can know that they can speak and they can stand up for things they believe in, in light of being told their career will end because of it.”


	All this thriving means Kehlani is working through Thanksgiving. We're talking the day before. She typically doesn't commemorate the actual holiday, she says, but had a “Soulful Sunday” with friends that week. Her daughter Adeya appears off camera the moment Kehlani details that her routines these days revolve around the first-grader, of whom she has full custody after a legal battle with Adeya's father. She's hosting some of Adeya's pals for the break from school. (Kehlani recently told The Breakfast Club she's protected her daughter from her crises: “I don't fall apart in front of her,” she said. “She doesn't have a clue if anything is going on with me.”) Tomorrow, though, she's set to finalize the vocals for her album. And today, after our call, she has to run and meet the Usher to finalize their song on the LP (more on that below, too). The album title is off the record for now, but the crux of it is not. 


	“I really just homed in on making records,” says Kehlani. “If I think of the difference between bops, little songs here and there — records were things that took time and took effort from multiple people and took thinking of each individual song as a piece of art, versus I just came and doodled the song and spit it out and put it out, which I did for a long time. I'm not saying that there were a million, trillion steps or people involved in it, but I'm saying we treated these songs with the same amount of care.”


	Here, Kehlani goes deep on making an album indebted to classic R&B, the genre's recent queer awakening, what ethical fandom looks like, and how she's learned to live with bipolar disorder. 


On your birthday this year, you shared that you'd been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and BPD. What is the latter an acronym for?That's borderline personality disorder. But honestly, I need to get diagnosed by at least two more people because I think that BPD might be misdiagnosed. I'm speaking to you as [I'm] medicated, been in various forms of therapy. I might just be in some sort of remission for the BPD, but I've been episode-free and kooky-free for almost a year now. The episodes don't necessarily go away, but you can apply thought to them and you can acknowledge when they're happening, like, “Oh, OK, I woke up this morning feeling like a superhero and I need to do 872 things and maybe leave the country and maybe rethink my life. I must be manic.” Or you're like, “Everybody hates me. I think maybe I should die. I must be in a low.” You can go into these parameters of “Here's my steps, here's all the options I can choose to help myself through this right now.” I've been just in that world for the last year, and it's been really nice.

	











You've recently said that even Crash was made during a bout of mania, but as a fan, it can be hard to tell that that's happening. What did that look like for you pre-diagnosis, and how did it affect your career?What's interesting is I got diagnosed mid-crisis. Actually year one of the genocide, I'm sitting online having full-blown screaming fests with the phone, and I chop all my hair off. I had a pink buzz cut, and I was like, “How did nobody fucking just tell me I was in an episode?” I got my legs super tatted — didn't really recall the tattoo session. [The tattoo artist] finishes one leg apparently, and she's like, “OK, I'm done.” And apparently I was like, “Just keep going,” but through an entire bottle of tequila. There was a lot that happened that year; even the mania broke into full-blown paranoia. Leaving my house was difficult, thinking everybody is out to get me. I'm thinking I need to have security set outside my house. All the while, people are having very real conversations with me about my activism: “This is what can happen to your career and this is what can happen to you as a person and your safety.” I also was receiving massive amounts of death threats. So pairing all of the very real issues like that with a disorder like this, I flew off the handles. My romantic life was crazy. Every area of my life you can imagine was just like ass-whoop, ass-whoop, ass-whoop. I had been asking for a psychiatrist for six months, and every single person wasn't taking clients.


They were too busy? They were at capacity?They were full at capacity. And I'm like, if me — with access and money and the ability to have multiple people searching for this — am struggling right now, what is everybody else doing? So for six months, I'm in and out of crisis, in and out of psychosis and hypomania. Top-level manic things that can happen. I ran it up. I think there's been a lot of moments that people may have not noticed as an expression of my bipolar disorder.


It looks like, on paper, you're having your most successful year ever while bravely saying that there has been a genocide happening. How do you hold all of that? You were experiencing mania, but a lot of the things that you were saying were necessary. Before I got medicated, I sat down at lunch with my friend who's also medicated, [and they were] like, “Oh, just so you know, by day two, three on medication, you're going to wake up and look around and want to change everything. People are going to seem different to you. All your choices are going to seem fucking heinous to you. You're going to get ideas, new ideas about your regimen, just take your time with it.” Literally on day three, I was like, “Oh, I was tweaking.”

	











	I wouldn't say that I was brave because I was manic. I also have a hard time calling this brave in general. I think [in mania], you get hyper-confident. You don't think anything can happen to you. I think that how I naturally would feel about witnessing something like this is the same. I'm just as angry, I'm just as upset. I'm just as confused at our world and our government. I'm just as mind-blown that people can sit around and be silent about this. But the way in which I would've gone about it would've probably been a lot more careful, because I think I was just screaming and I alienated a lot of people in my realm that I really wish I could have just pulled in for conversation.


Who do you mean when you say “in your own realm”?In my industry, in my peer group, in my interpersonal circles. I appreciate looking back and just seeing that I was passionate and I cared. I think me now, with the grounding that I have, would've been more strategic. I'm not an organizer, but something I really learned in the last year and two years of moving through all of this and having really patient people teach me is their strategy, the way that they call people in and teach people. That was something that I really appreciated and learned to integrate post-having-more-sanity.


Can you give me an example of an encounter or a conversation that felt more aligned with these principles of organizing that you've learned, versus what felt a little more crash-out-y to you?Like Aja Monet — incredible person, incredible poet, incredible activist — hosted a bunch of us who were all aligned on this topic at her house. Artists, organizers, just people who needed a place to sit and imagine what a new world would look like. [We were] putting our thoughts together. “How can we call more people in? Is there any information you're maybe lacking on this subject? Let's talk about the history of it.” I'm sitting in the living room with people who have actually been to Palestine, who have been going back and forth to Palestine since maybe I was even in middle school. [It's like] “OK, you've done step one, which is you're angry and aware. Now, you have to take step two, and realize that this is a really long battle.” It's a really long fight. Even post ceasefire, the journey to the entirety of freeing Palestine itself is going to be a really long battle and you have to have some type of self-preservation so you don't burn out. We talked a lot about empathy fatigue and doing-the-work fatigue. It was just all of these things that I had never heard of. I think if everybody that was passionate was equipped with these thoughts and these processes, things would go differently. But step one, I'm grateful that I was angry and aware.

	











	But then the crash-out is that I put everybody that worked for me in a group chat and was like, “If you don't fucking say something, you're fired.” Does it come from a great place? Does it come from my heart and my anger? Yes. But does it do anything? Versus [asking], “How can I sit my team down and call them in and say, ‘Hey, you guys may have valid fears about speaking about this. Or you may feel like you don't actually know what's going on'?” Am I here to pacify that? No, but I can lovingly correct [that] being that I'm in a position of being leadership, and I'm responsible for [them] and I also want [them] to be an extension of me. Just all of these more thoughtful processes.


You've said you've lost a lot because of your advocacy for Palestine and against the Israeli government. Are you still losing things?Absolutely. Oh, there's people that have told me verbatim that they'll never with fuck with me. Companies, magazines, all of it. You name it. And you just thug it. That's honestly why I'm so consistent with my art. It's why I'm so direct-to-consumer. I'm going to get this song out to my fans. I'm going to work the song. I'm going to post about the song. I'm going to market it. I'm not afraid to talk to my fans and be in conversation with them because you can't disrupt that. That isn't dependent on a brand deal; that isn't dependent on anything except for me and the other humans that are listening to me. That's just where I've given my focus after the fact.


And do you also think having a decade-ish-long career has taught you that grassroots approach? You've had a very specific fan base follow you all these years. Are you reassured that if you continue to build that relationship that you can keep your life intact?I mean, these are some people that I have had to pass out my physical copy of my CD to when I was 19. These are people that have seen me go from a teenager to a mother. Your entire twenties, people spend not famous, fucking up and tweaking out and wilding out and then come to their thirties and be like, “Whoa, my twenties was a whirlwind.” They did it in private. I did it completely publicly. Every single thing that has been blasted, that's been out in the open, that people have seen gave them an opportunity to love me as a person.


	A lot of people have their opinions and you're not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but I think that people that really can grasp me as a whole human, they love me in a different way, and I definitely attribute [that to] my ability to keep floating and keep thriving too. My interactions with them aren't ever normal. They're full-blown, “How's your cat and how's your dog and how's your daughter and how's your mom doing? Have you spoken to your biological mom?” They care about me as a person.

	











What does responsible, respectful fandom actually look like to you? You're saying these people love you, but they also don't know you personally. I just base it off of “In a perfect world, what do I wish being a fan of someone would look like? In a perfect world, what do the boundaries of still being a person that's ever-changing and growing just like everyone else look like? How would I want to be received?” I've had to correct my fan base a lot over the years. I remember when I first came out [as queer] and they were being awful to the men that were also my fans. Then I had to correct the men from being weird and gross. I've had to [deal with] a lot of them being weird to any partner they've seen me with. I'm like, “Yo, bro, I get that you have a fixation on me, but you can't be awful to the person that I've chosen to share with you.” 


	Also, half the time, I've only chosen to share this with people because I'm tired of sneaking around. It's not a fun feeling in love to know you're going on a date and then you walk into a restaurant and everybody's like [mimics someone recording her on their phone beneath an imaginary table], or you just had a couple drinks with the person that you love and you stumbled out of a club and now there's some video that everybody's like, “Gotcha, bitch!” 


	It's a lot of picking and choosing of what to share and how to share and when to share. Also, being aware that you're not going to be able to ever be in control of the reception. But as far as my ethical fan base goes, I think it's guiding them when I can, correcting them when I can, not letting them bully other people or other artists, other fan bases. 


To your point of not wanting to sneak around, I'm a huge Kwn fan [the British, lesbian R&B singer with whom Kehlani has collaborated and starred on social media]. The public has seen that you guys have some sort of relationship — I don't know what kind, that's your business. I'm interested in how you reconcile those moments where you want to be more private in love — platonic or not — with the moments that you don't want to hide.I'm just going to speak broadly. I think that we just have a right to live freely and love freely. And just like any other girl, any normal person gets excited about anyone and wants to be able to have those moments where they're like, “I'm proud of them,” or, “I care about them, and I want to share,” I don't think celebrities are exempt from that. We don't suddenly have different feelings because we have millions of followers. It's a very strange feeling to come home and be like, “Oh, my God, so-and-so, did we get caught?” That's not pertaining to any relationship I've ever been in or any relationship I ever will be in or am in or not. It's just a rule of thumb that it's damned if you do, damned if you don't, in my position. Either way, it's just not normal. So once you accept that it's not normal, you just got to pick one. I think it'll vary for me. Depending on how I'm feeling, depending on how I'm living at the moment. I'm a 30-year-old woman. I am just learning and loving in front of everyone.


There are two things happening in R&B that I'm really excited about. One is the rise of queer R&B, but the other is the way artists like you are authentically tapping into the past. “Folded” does this really well; your latest single, “Out the Window,” does this well. How do you make music and videos that are an homage to a previous era without cosplaying it?Everything that I'm doing is because it includes the ingredients and the recipe of [an] era. I'm thinking of what I know as the classic recipes of R&B. I'm not a person that thinks something has to be reinvented over and over again. I've done it, but I don't think R&B is broken. I have ventured out of R&B; I've done a lot of pop music. I think most of my [music] has been alternative R&B, but I said I really wanted to make [music that] has the recipe of classic R&B.


	I think that there's a thin line between the cosplay-homage thing and this [thing] that has the ingredients. If you can name eight people when you're looking at my video or listening to my song and say, “OK, so I'm seeing Aaliyah, Janet, Usher, hearing Brandy, seeing Omarion” all at the same time, it just means that I'm doing justice to the era and I'm doing justice to the genre. 


I saw you were recording with producer and artist Ryan Leslie. Is whatever you guys worked on going to be on this album?Me, Ryan Leslie, and James Fauntleroy have a song that I think is dope.

	











What is the vibe of that song?It's very James-y. I love it. The coolest thing about it is when James makes something, you can hear the James in it, and I think it's probably one of the more eclectic songs on the project. It's not so straightforward R&B. It has a little energy in it. It has some bounce to it.


What does James-y mean to you?James has this incredible way of writing these whimsical melodies with these dirty, edgy lyrics that tell stories and paint a picture, but vocally, it's like there's so much traveling in it. I think he has such a sonic thing. You'll press play on a song and be like, “Oh, you went to the school of James Fauntleroy.” Just like I can hear so much Frank [Ocean] in a lot of the new generations, they're not realizing that even a lot of Frank-y stuff is James-y stuff.


	You can just really hear the schools that people graduated from in their music. I don't like when people say that's a bad thing. I think that these conversations were also had in the Nineties. We're paying so much homage to the 2000s and the Nineties. They were also paying homage to what came before them, and also being disruptive at the same time. It's having to navigate that balance.


You've also said that you have a song with Usher. Is that going to be on this album?Yeah, that's going to be on this. I actually have to go after this interview and finish the final vocals with him.


Oh, wait, in person?Yeah, yeah, yeah.


Did you guys make the bulk of this song in person?No, actually, we've been going back and forth multiple times to get the song right. Different songs at that as well. It's just trying to find the right song. But honestly, I just really appreciated how much of a person he's been to me. I had a show in Atlanta where my voice was completely gone when I got there because I was shooting a video until the late wee hours outside.

	











And was the video “Out the Window”?It was actually the original “Out the Window” that isn't coming out.


Quick aside, I don't want you to lose your story, but why did that get stopped?Too many variables. Everything was just seeming to go wrong, and we were missing a lot of footage and a lot didn't get shot, and it was just like, “Damn.” I got sick. I was actually outside in the middle of downtown L.A. Very “Touch” [by Omarion] vibes. I got sick as hell, and so when I got to Atlanta, I put on my [Instagram] story or on my notes “I'm so sick,” and he somehow saw that and called me and was like, “I'm about to bring you everything, and I'm about to put you on with my voice coach.” This man came to my hotel room, did vocal lessons with me, brought me 72 million remedies, and literally brought my voice back. I was only able to do One Music Fest because Usher Raymond saved my guts.


Who are the other dream collaborators you got to work with on this album?Oh, man, so many. The Underdogs. I got to write with Ne-Yo. I got to work with Stargate. I got to write with Tank. I cut a song from Johntá Austin. I did Jermaine Dupri and Brian Michael Cox. Oh, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Man, that was one of the coolest moments of my life, and it's probably my favorite song on the album.


What are you most excited about in bringing this album to life?Honestly, I just want people to have an experience. I want people to just love singing and dancing again. It is really that simple. It's such a personal moment for me right now to be proving myself. I feel so personally just motivated to rewrite my story, and I hope that trickles into the experience that people have. I hope people feel empowered.


What is the log line of the story that's being rewritten?I contributed a lot to R&B in the last 10 years, and I think it gets overlooked. I'm one of the few that are still remaining from my coming-out time [as an artist], and I think that's important. To still be able to make splashes like this 10 years in, I think it's a big deal.


You've been nominated for Best R&B Song at the Grammys back to back, last year for “After Hours.” How do you compare the experience?Last year, I was genuinely shocked. My friend texted me, and he lives in Brazil, so he was just ahead. I was asleep, and he was like, “Grammy noms come out today.” I was like, “They're not worried about me. I'm going back to sleep.” I woke up to seven missed calls and eight texts, and he was like, “They clearly worried about you. Wake up.” And I was like, “What the fuck?” Especially because “After Hours” and Crash in general had gotten such a polarizing reception. I was shocked.


	This year everybody, from week five of “Folded” coming out, was like, “You're getting a nomination.” So I had this opposite pressure, like, if we don't get nominated after everybody's saying this, then all I'm going to have to hear for the next months is how I was snubbed. I don't need that sitting on my back. I just need to be focused on creating, honestly. That's the biggest difference for sure.


How would your ideal Grammy week look? Your ideal Grammy day? What are you wearing? Where are you going? I honestly just want to be not-anxious. I want to be feeling very settled. I want to walk in there knowing that no matter what, I shifted a conversation. I want to spend time with my family. I want to wear a matching outfit with Destin [Conrad, nominated for Best Progressive R&B album for Love on Digital, which features Kehlani]. That's really what I want to do.

	











	I think most importantly, I just want to be sitting in gratitude that week and that day. I don't want any other feelings. I'm not a very competitive person. I don't really have those feelings. I'm stoked and I want to stay in this.


You mentioned Destin; Durand Benarr earned three grammy nominations as well. It really feels like we're in a special moment for queer R&B between you guys and others, similar to the sapphic moment in pop last year. Does it feel like something is happening to you?No, there is. I think that it was very taboo in the beginning for people to be able to use the pronouns they actually talk to in the actual songs that they sing. I think the fact that not only can you do that, but you can present exactly how you want to present, you can make music videos kissing the gender you want to kiss — all of that being possible right now is crazy. I don't know how to say anything that isn't obvious, like duh, people that are growing up need to be able to have their sexuality represented. I'm glad that I'm a part of it.


	It's a trip to be able to watch VH1's Behind the Music from old-ass shit and see how many people were in the closet. You hear these industry stories about how so-and-so was a little queer, and now we just don't have to do that. It's beautiful, and I consider us lucky.


“Folded” is a pronoun-less song. Do you think that it could have broken through like this if it wasn't?Honestly, I don't know. So many people who are new to me because of “Folded” think its about a man to the point where they got mad at me in the video because I wasn't having a man pick up his clothes from my house. And I don't think the video would've been successful if I had a love interest. If I would've did a video where I would've been having a woman come pick up her clothes and [been] kissing on a girl, they would've been mad regardless.


Are there songs on this album that you believe in like you believe in “Folded,” but are gendered in their pronouns?[There are] songs that I want people to, when they're singing the song, either feel like they are me in the song or feel like I am talking directly to them.

So the pronouns are mostly like “me” and “you”? All these songs we wrote with that perspective. If I was texting you, if I was writing you a letter, if I was talking directly to you, I don't go, “Yeah, I really miss you so much, girl.” I don't go, “Damn, me and you, baby girl.” I don't talk like that.


Is there anything that we didn't talk about that you would like to, especially with the album coming out?I just want to drill the point home that this was just my time to go this route and hit the nail on the head in a conscious choice to break through this ceiling that I've been [under] for a while. It took a lot of trying and failing [with] other sounds and succeeding in certain lenses. I think it took a lot of polarization in my art. I don't have any regrets about any choices artistically that I've made before. Going this direction doesn't mean this is the direction for the rest of my life either. I take it era by era and creative choice by creative choice. I'm just glad that people are receiving it right now.

The podcaster noted that her husband Jason's silence during Trav's comments said it all.

	Every couple fights. That's just a fact. Well, every couple except Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, apparently. A week after the Kansas City Chiefs tight end claimed on his New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce that he and Swift have “never once” fought in their two and a half years together, Jason's wife, Kylie, has weighed in.

	During Thursday's (Dec. 11) episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, Kylie responded to fan questions about how she feels about her soon to be sister-in-law's apparently argument-free relationship. “Notice how my husband was oddly quiet during this segment,” Kylie said. “He did ask a couple of clarifying questions. But for the most part, his ass knew that he could not say that after almost eight years married… We absolutely argue.”

	After spilling the truth, Kylie — who shares four daughters with the retired NFL great — clarified that the couple don't argue that often, “but we've definitely argued, for sure.” She then tried to parse whether Travis and that episode's guest, George Clooney, were talking argument or, like, argument argument. 


	“To be fair, I'm not a yelling arguer. So the arguments in our house, they're not a yelling situation,” Kylie said. “I just think that if you're married, you live together, specifically if you have children, you're potentially having some sleepless nights. You might have varying degrees of patience with certain situations with your kids.” 

	











	Travis' comments came after Clooney said he'd never clashed with his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, in the 10 years they've been a couple. When the two-time Oscar winner and Jay Kelly star then asked if Travis and Swift ever quarreled, the three-time Super Bowl winner replied, “Well, it's only been two and a half years, and you're right. I haven't gotten into an argument. Never once.”


	Bottom line: Kylie isn't buying it. Not from Clooney and not from Travis. “You're telling me you don't bicker or argue? Or maybe you do bicker, but you don't argue? I'm very confused about this,” she said, adding, “to George Clooney's credit, I would not argue with Amal either. Absolutely not. I would be right behind her like, ‘Yeah. Get them, what she said. I'm with her.' Whatever she says, we ride at dawn.”

	Sean “Diddy” Combs is threatening to sue Netflix for airing a docuseries that is, to say the least, unflattering to him. The disgraced music mogul's cease-and-desist letter claims the series, Sean Combs: The Reckoning, uses “stolen footage.” 


	The footage includes Combs launching into a tirade against former Danity Kane and Diddy-Dirty Money artist Dawn Richard after learning of her sexual harassment lawsuit against him and strategizing with his attorneys days before his September 2024 arrest. “We have to find somebody that'll work with us,” Combs says in the footage. “That has dealt in the dirtiest of dirty business. We're losing!”


	Asked how he got the footage, executive producer Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson declined to answer, explaining, “I figured most journalists would not disclose their sources.” (Side note: Some federal appellate judges could learn a thing or two about journalist-source confidentiality from Jackson.) 


	Michael Oberlies, a documentarian who Combs hired to film him, blamed a freelancer he said he'd hired to briefly fill in for him while he was away. In any event, series director Alexandra Stapleton says her team obtained the footage lawfully. 

	











	Assuming Stapleton is telling the truth, Combs' argument that Netflix is responsible for her source's alleged misconduct shouldn't fare well. It was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2001 case Bartnicki v. Vopper, and for good reason. The media has a First Amendment right to publish information of public concern obtained from sources who broke the law, so long as it didn't participate in the illegality. 

	











	Combs, of course, thinks the rules don't apply to him — hence his current address in federal prison. And he's got a history of trying to erase incriminating footage, like the hotel surveillance video of him beating then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura that he allegedly bribed security guards to bury. 


	But the same reasoning that protected a Pennsylvania radio host reporting on illegally recorded conversations about school union negotiations in the Bartnicki case also protects streaming giants airing docuseries about alleged predatory celebrities.

	Unless Netflix hacked Combs' computer, broke into his home, or otherwise stole the footage, the Supreme Court says Combs, to quote his debut album title, has “no way out.” Combs' legal team may think that's “unfair,” given that he didn't intend for the footage to go public. But that's his problem, not Netflix's. The public interest in the news outweighs a public figure's desire to control the narrative. (For similar reasons, any copyright claim Combs could bring against Netflix should fail under the “fair use” doctrine allowing excerpts of copyrightable materials to be used for journalism and commentary, among other purposes.) 


	Some of the most consequential reporting in history relied on records unlawfully obtained by others. Legendary whistleblower and Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) co-founder Daniel Ellsberg expected a life sentence when his conscience compelled him to copy classified documents to expose the government's lies about the Vietnam War and give them to the press. 


	But the case against Ellsberg fell apart due to government misconduct, and the Supreme Court ruled that the press could not be restrained from publishing the Pentagon Papers. The government's primary argument was not that The New York Times was responsible for Ellsberg stealing the documents. It argued the documents threatened national security — a theory the court rightly rejected as far too speculative to justify a “prior restraint” on publication.

	Years later, even Nixon officials admitted the government was never really concerned about national security, just embarrassment and reputational harm. That's exactly what Combs is worried about. In other words, his arguments are so flimsy that even the Nixon administration knew better than to rely on them. 


	But the Pentagon Papers case was over 50 years ago, and Bartnicki is already older than many of Combs' alleged victims were when he met them. The once-ironclad principle that journalists can publish documents stolen by their sources is under unprecedented attack.

	











Los Angeles Times reporter Maya Lau published an investigation exposing hundreds of L.A. County Sheriff's deputies with histories of misconduct. In response, the department launched a secret criminal investigation of Lau for “knowingly receiving stolen property.” Lau is now suing, and rightly so. Her case is far from the only example. 


	The Biden administration's prosecutors went after right-wing outlet Project Veritas for possessing and transporting Ashley Biden's diary, which it purchased from someone who stole it. The government characterized the diary as “stolen property,” which Project Veritas illegally possessed and transported. As FPF, the ACLU, and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) argued in a legal brief, the right to publish stolen materials becomes meaningless if merely having them is illegal. 


	The Trump administration dropped that case, but its reasons appear to have been political, not constitutional. It's currently pursuing charges against Daniel “Des” Sanchez for transporting anarchist literature, claiming he was concealing evidence that would incriminate his wife, who had attended a protest at which a police officer was shot. There's no evidence his wife had anything to do with the shooting, though, and possession of literature isn't incriminating.


	It's against this backdrop that the Trump administration threatens to do what was once unthinkable — prosecute reporters for obtaining and reporting leaks. He's got a weapon in his arsenal not available to Combs — the archaic Espionage Act, which, taken literally, prohibits mere obtainment and retention of national defense information, regardless of whether the defendant is a spy, a whistleblower, or a reporter.


	For decades, presidents resisted impulses to prosecute routine reporting under the act, recognizing the constitutional problems with doing so. But the Biden administration's extraction of a guilty plea from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (in a case initiated by the first Trump administration) for obtaining and publishing documents from sources opened the door to similar theories against more conventional journalists. 


	As Rolling Stone reported in June, Trump is eager to barge through that door. His Pentagon's ridiculous requirement for journalists to pledge not to publish “unauthorized” information — even if they obtain it lawfully from willing sources — makes clear how the administration sees the press's role.

	That's why it's so important that the courts don't allow those with the “Benjamins” — whether Combs or his former “good friend,” Trump — to chip away at Bartnicki's principles. When the powerful lock the front door to information, journalists and filmmakers need to find the back door. That means obtaining newsworthy footage and records from whoever has them, and telling the public what they say. That's not theft. As 50 Cent astutely notes, that's journalism.

	There's never been a tour like Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. Her two-year run around the world brought out a three-hour emotional exorcism of a show each night, getting bigger as it went along, for an unprecedented level of fan hysteria and ticket demand. So it makes sense that her new documentary series, The End of an Era, is anything but a standard concert flick. Instead, it follows the whole tour phenomenon, counting down the final months before the last show and capturing all the backstage drama and fan community that gathered around it.


	As Swift said onstage that final night in Vancouver, it was “the most thrilling chapter of my life to date — my beloved Eras Tour.” The six-part series premieres on Disney+ starting tonight, on the eve of Taylor's birthday. We saw the first two episodes — just the tip of this iceberg. Here are 13 takeaways from The End of an Era.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The doc counts down to the farewell night of the Eras Tour — the ultimate climax for the most mythically gargantuan tour in history. The final show was in Vancouver on Dec. 8, a few days before Taylor's birthday and almost exactly a year before the series premieres. Taylor refers to the epic run of the tour as “a lifetime within my life.” The End of an Era captures the madness of life on the road for everyone swept up into the Swiftian whirlwind — not just the star, or even just the onstage performers, but the giant community that goes into making this tour go, from the crew to the creative team to her family. —Rob Sheffield












	The doc focuses on the whole tour community, making stars out of the band and the dancers. There's so much Madonna Truth or Dare energy in the way the whole team becomes part of the story. Taylor's band is full of musicians who have been at her side for years — fans have been seeing and hearing them for so long, it's a rare treat to see them finally open up and tell their stories. We all know Amos Heller as the fan-fave bass stud who's been with Taylor since the early days — there's hilarious footage of them clowning around on the 2007 tour. He reveals one of his secret pro tips for keeping his musical chops in shape on the road — he practices his bass in the shower, since it's the one place where he won't wake up any of the neighbors in the nearby rooms. It's definitely surreal to see Amos busting out his bass moves in the middle of an empty bathroom when he's used to stadium stages, but like everything in the documentary, it's about capturing the gritty day-to-day work that goes into the glamour of those few hours onstage. That's showbiz, baby. —R.S.

The End of an Era doesn't shy away from the dark side of the spotlight, which makes it a sobering watch. In the first episode, Swift openly discusses the thwarted terror plot that forced the singer to cancel three nights of the Eras Tour in Vienna. (For the unacquainted, Swift has only cancelled a handful of shows in her 20-year career, and one was due to a military coup). “Never in my life did I think we would have a terrorist plot,” Swift says as she wipes tears from her eyes. “We dodged a massacre,” Swift continues. She then explains how she copes with such life-altering events and continues to push forward to put on a show to millions of fans. “You block it off,” she says, comparing herself to a pilot who needs to reassure everyone that all is well, even when it's not. — Maya Georgi


	Don't hold your breath, Tayvis Nation. Taylor's fiancé, Travis Kelce, isn't as prominent in the first two episodes; he's more of an off-camera presence. Kelce is only ever heard over the phone in two separate calls. Swift places the first call in the lead-up to her shows in London, clearly in need of some reassurance. She bemoans the fact that Kelce has practice but is still grateful to hear from him. “Some people got a vitamin drip, I got this conversation,” she tells her beau. Once the first show back is a smashing success and Swift is in a van home, she immediately calls Kelce again to share how elated she is at getting through it all. “I can hear it in your voice,” he says. “I'm just so happy to be back doing this,” she tells him. There's a few moments we hear “baby!” exchanged, but sadly, no “honey.” —M.G.

	It didn't take long for the fan community buzzing around the Eras Tour to take over as the star of the show. Swifties began their own tribal rituals that became part of the tour, after starting out on a strictly organic grass-roots level — most notably, the friendship-bracelet craze. As Taylor told the crowd on that final night in Vancouver, “I never thought that writing ONE line about friendship bracelets would have you guys all making friendship bracelets, making friends, and bringing joy to each other.” There's something a bit terrifying about the intense Deadhead-like devotion of the Swifties every night — and the singer is as mystified by it as anyone else. On the Eras Tour, the parking lot became a place for fans to hang out, sing along, meet fellow Swifties. As one older observer marvels in the doc, “It's like Woodstock without the drugs!” —R.S.












	Nobody knew what Taylor was going to do when she returned to the road. Her Lover Fest performances in the summer of 2020 got canceled in the pandemic, along with every other tour — on the day Taylor got the news her tour wasn't happening, she was so miserable she wrote “Mirrorball.” That led to Folklore and Evermore, not to mention — by the time she hit the road for the Eras Tour — Midnights. With this backlog of massive albums she hadn't performed live, people openly speculated that she might have simply gotten too big to tour at all. The whole idea of this experiment seemed impossible. (As Heller quips, “It seems obvious now, because it did work.”) But Taylor treated the whole show — era to era — as the long and winding tale of her life, growing up in public through her music. As she puts it, the show features “all the different girls I was until I turned into this one.” —R.S.


	Yeah, we still don't know. Sorry. Some of us are still traumatized by that. —R.S.


	A sight to warm anyone's heart: Taylor gives the London crowd in Wembley Stadium a little extra when it's Surprise Song o' Clock, with a local boy for a guest. Ed Sheeran was just a folkie kid when he went on the road with Taylor on the Red tour, making massive waves with his solo acoustic sets, blowing up into one of her most wildly successful proteges as well as one of her most enduring and endearing musical friendships. Even Ed, a man who's been rocking stadiums on his own for years now, seems a little daunted by the size and scale of the Eras Tour. But they sit down backstage to work on their classic Red duet “Everything Has Changed” — a transformative song in both their stories, not to mention the most famous song ever written by two people while bouncing on a trampoline. For both of these superstars, it's a reunion that's deeply personal even though they're sharing it with thousands of fans in realtime, tapping into their shared history — two old friends getting back to where they once belonged. —R.S.


	Who knew Florence Welch was so funny? As the singer and frontwoman for Florence + the Machine preps for a surprise performance of “Florida!!!” in London, it's like watching a fairy with impeccable comedic timing. “In my own shows, I just show up and run around,” she says during choreo rehearsals. The best part is when she describes popping up on the Eras Tour stage at showtime. “It was like walking on Mars,” she says. Welch was so out of orbit, she was even awestruck by her friend. “The persona is huge but the person is soft,” she says of Swift. But as soon as she saw the singer in her element, Welch recalls thinking what everyone else in the stadium was thinking: “That's Taylor fucking Swift!” —M.G.












	Taylor goes into some of the details of touring — like the way she started her physical training regimen six months before rehearsals even began. In early footage of tour rehearsals, there's a shot of her practicing the nightly move where she dives through a narrow hole in the stage. (That dive turned so many of us into anxious wrecks every night — it's still scary to witness when she's just rehearsing it. Too risky!) It's a revelation to see how hard everyone has to work just to keep up. As Swift says, “It is our job to make this look accidental, and it is our job to make this look effortless.” We see her downtime rituals, listening to audiobooks (in one scene she's taking in Liz Moore's crime novel The God of the Woods). Late in the tour, all the lighting crew get matching tattoos proudly proclaiming their number of shows. Taylor does a double take when she sees it, asking, “Why does it show the Grim Reaper?” Because they're surprised they even survived it. —R.S.


	Anyone who went to the Eras Tour, watched livestreams from home, or even tuned into the first concert film, was instantly charmed by lead dancer Kameron Saunders and his various ad-libs. (Like ever!) So it's a delight to watch him describe the arduous journey that brought him to the Eras Tour stage. Saunders opens up about facing discrimination as a black dancer with a larger body and being raised by a single mother, which makes dancing for the historic tour that much more special. “This feels like my Super Bowl,” Saunders says of the Eras Tour in a pointed remark. As fate would have it, Saunders' brother, Khalen, became a two-time Super Bowl champion with the Kansas City Chiefs alongside none other than Travis Kelce. —M.G.

	Two of the doc's most fascinating characters are the badass dancing queens: choreographer Mandy Moore and associate choreographer Amanda Balen. (Fans got to see both at work in The Life of a Showgirl movie, as part of the team behind the video for “The Fate of Ophelia.”) We get up close and personal as they share their professional stories, from Moore's work in Hollywood (Swift's friend Emma Stone urged her to hire Moore after La La Land) to Balen's career dancing for Janet Jackson, Céline Dion, and Lady Gaga. During one rowdy rehearsal for “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,” Taylor announces at top volume, in her snootiest faux-Brit accent, “We are doing theeee-aaaterrrrr!” But even in dance rehearsals, Taylor is constantly jumping into the creative flow. Working on one move, she tells Moore, “I'm seeing this as ‘girl in an insane asylum'-slash-‘wood nymph.'” —R.S.












	When Taylor sang “Long Live” on that final night in Vancouver, she changed the key line, “It was the end of a decade” to “it was the end of an era,” and that's the spirit of this doc. Like the tour itself, it ends up turning into a love song from Swift to the crowd, with her downright scary obsession with making a unique connection with the listeners. “You look out there and it's not just a blob of lights,” Taylor says in one candid moment. “There's millions of stories and counter-narratives all colliding in one place where we feel safe to be demonstrative of a whole spectrum of emotion.” That's the crowd she's performing for. The Eras Tour is what happens when a one-of-a-kind artist comes face-to-face with a one-of-a-kind audience — not just the people who made it into the room for the Eras Tour, but the ones who followed it from afar, joining in the global community that coalesced around this musical adventure. It's a project that only Swift — and her fans — could have brought to life. —R.S.

HBO Max has teased what audiences have to look forward to in 2026 with a promo that debuts never-before-seen footage from some of its most highly anticipated new and returning series including Euphoria Season 3, House of the Dragon Season 3, and Lanterns.


	“A few years after high school, I don't know if life was exactly what I wished,” Zendaya's Rue Bennett says as glimpses of each of the lead characters — Lexi Howard (Maude Apatow), Maddy Perez (Alexa Demie), Nate Jacobs (Jacob Elordi), Cassie Howard (Sydney Sweeney), Jules Vaughn (Hunter Schafer) and, of course, Rue — flash across the screen.

	The music stops as Rue walks into a club and a man (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), sitting in a booth surrounded by women, says to her, “You walk up into my house and you don't even introduce yourself.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Deadline previously reported that Akinnuoye-Agbaje is a new series regular who is “a ruthless kingpin.”


	As for House of the Dragon, Alicent (Olivia Cooke) declares: “Rhaenyra will do what she has to do. And what she has to do will be dire.”


	The Lanterns footage also gives the true first look at Kyle Chandler and Aaron Pierre as Hal Jordan and John Stewart in the DC series, from Ozark's Chris Mundy, Watchmen‘s Damon Lindelof, and comic book writer Tom King.


	“I trained my entire life for this,” Pierre's John pleads from the passenger seat as Hal (Chandler) drives down a dirt road. Hal responds: “You're not ready to get up in front of the class until the ring says you are,” before setting the Power Ring on the dashboard and rolling out of the car as it goes flying off a cliff.

	











	In addition to those titles, the promo features glimpses at the latest seasons of Dune: Prophecy and The Comeback. Other new series that were teased include DTF St. Louis, Rooster, Untitled Larry David Project, Half Man, Stuart Fails to Save the Universe, and War. Plus, there's a few clips from the two-part documentary Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!


	There are also plenty of other titles featured in the trailer, though those clips have already shown up elsewhere. Additional titles to come in 2026 are returners Industry, The Pitt, Hacks and The Gilded Age as well as the latest Game of Thrones spinoff A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

	As promised, Taylor Swift‘s The End of an Era documentary series gives a behind-the-scenes look at the Eras Tour — even when it gets dark. The series' first episode chronicles the unimaginable horror that struck the tour during the European leg. In August 2024, Swift was forced to cancel three nights in Vienna, Austria, after a terrorist plot was foiled.


	“Never in my life did I think we would have a terrorist plot,” Swift says in The End of an Era. She is wearing a black shirt in a direct-to-camera interview and wipes her teary eyes. “We dodged a massacre,” Swift continues. She then explains how she copes with such life-altering events and continues to push forward to put on a show to millions of fans. “You block it off,” she says, comparing herself to a pilot who needs to reassure everyone that all is well, even when it's not.


	Less than a week after the thwarted terrorist plot in Vienna, Swift and her crew had a five-date run at Wembley Stadium in London. The End of an Era series' first episode follows the singer as she returns to the stage and a packed stadium, days after the terrorist plot targeting Swift's Vienna concert run would have put thousands of lives at risk.

	











	“I have a weird feeling going into these last five shows in Europe,” Swift admits in the lead up. In the clip,  it is clear that Swift is still very shaken by the calamitous events; her voice is raw and raspy, and she is wearing an oversized T-shirt. But Swift remains resilient.

	











	“There's not a challenge she isn't going to conquer,” says Swift's longtime bassist Amos Heller as the team revs up for the Wembley dates. (Heller would know; he's been touring with the star since 2007).


	So the challenge to provide her fans with the best comeback show ever begins. Swift calls up her longtime collaborator and friend Ed Sheeran to perform with her for the surprise song set. In an intimate moment backstage with Sheeran, Swift reveals that the filming crew capturing them at that moment was supposed to have started filming in Vienna. In that same clip, she admits to “feeling very hunted recently.”

	Following the terror plot and Vienna show cancellations, Swift was admonished online for remaining silent in the immediate aftermath. The singer commented on the major news only after she wrapped her London shows. “Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows,” Swift wrote on Instagram at the time. “My priority was finishing our European tour safely.”

The End of an Era episodes also show how Swift's Wembley Stadium shows, which were filled with unique surprises and a resilient joy, were quite emotional for the singer. While in London, the star met with families affected by the stabbings at a kids' Swift-themed dance studio backstage. The actual meet-and-greets are not shown, but afterward, the singer breaks down in tears backstage as her mother offers comforting words. “You really helped them, I know it,” Andrea tells her daughter. 


	“It is my job to be able to handle all these feelings and perk up immediately,” Swift says at another moment in the documentary. After the safe execution and successful performance at the first Eras show in London, Swift is seen leaving, clearly relieved. But just before she gets into a black van, she can't help but ask her tour manager Robert Aleen, “Did anything bad happen that I don't know about?”

“Dancing with the Stars” professional dancer and current judge Derek Hough and his wife, Hayley Erbert, are eagerly awaiting the birth of their first child. Although the couple has not publicly announced the due date, their baby is expected to arrive in December and is due any day now!

A heavily pregnant Erbert and her husband Hough celebrated the last few moments of her pregnancy by showing off their dance moves and expressing their excitement about becoming parents. 

Erbert posted the short video on Instagram on December 10. It shows her and Hough showing off their moves, including standing on their coffee table, kissing, and being playful. In the caption, she shared her thoughts, writing, “Parents gone wild.” Fans have reacted to the post with loving and supportive messages, but Hough also left a comment on his wife's post. 

“Dang she a sexy woman,” he wrote. 

“So excited for you two. But also, why does it feel like you've been pregnant forever?” a fan shared. “Oh noooo…this baby better come soon,” another person wrote. 

Other reactions include, “That baby is gonna be dancing before they walk lol,” “Adorable! Save this video to embarrass your kids when they're teenagers,” and “Omg these two are so hilarious!! Hayley looks super cute!! Derek is such a big kid full of energy, he's gonna be an amazing dad!!! This baby is so blessed on may ways!!! Wishing Hayley a safe, easy & fast delivery!!!”

Fans are really invested in this pregnancy and cannot wait for Baby Hough's arrival. This baby is already so loved. But Erbert also deserves praise for the many things she has overcome in the last two years. On December 6, she posted a black-and-white photo of herself on Instagram. It shows her cradling her baby bump. 

In the caption, she shared her thoughts in a long, emotional message. “Two years ago today, I was given a second chance at life through life-saving brain surgery,” she began. “In these two years, I've gone through every human emotion imaginable, the kind that cracks you open and the kind that puts you back together. I've reclaimed parts of myself I thought I'd never find again, rediscovered who I am, and moved through seasons of loss, triumph, joy, endless fear, grief, healing, and quiet hope. It was a whirlwind to say the least.” 

Erbert shared her gratitude for what she has overcome and revealed how proud she is of herself for what she has accomplished. She ended her message with a powerful statement, writing, “What a miracle it is that two years ago I was fighting for my life… and now, here I am creating life.”

There are few bigger names in horror filmmaking than John Carpenter, and for good reason: from Illinois suburbs to Antarctic research bases, his films can make just about any place or premise instill dread, tension, and often disgust (ie, that part in The Thing where Copper gets his arms bitten off as he very unsuccessfully delivers CPR). Beyond his career in filmmaking, Carpenter has also expressed an interest in video games, and while this has mostly been limited to admiration from afar, he's contributed to soundtracks and consulted on games like F.E.A.R. 3 (which he also narrated) in the past.

This context makes the prospect of the upcoming co-op zombie shooter John Carpenter's Toxic Commando a bit more exciting, because at least on the outside, this doesn't seem to be a Tom Clancy situation where the name on the tin doesn't mean much. Carpenter is credited as both the game's writer and composer. So this begs the question: just how much John Carpenter is in here?

The short answer is that outside of its synth-laden soundtrack and pulpy action-horror premise, not much. At least through the first few hours of Toxic Commando (which we went hands-on with via a preview), the game works as a great reminder for how auteur theory mostly doesn't apply to bigger-budget video games. The complex, interdisciplinary process of making one (alongside other factors like large budgets that discourage creative risks) ultimately makes it unlikely that one person can single-handedly guide the creative process from the director's chair. And while this FPS has a few distinguishing elements in its own right that slightly separate it from the many other four-person co-op games about blasting zombies, Carpenter's singular direction isn't one of them—honestly, how could it be in this kind of online-focused affair where the expectation is that you'll be bantering with buddies instead of paying attention to dialogue and cutscenes?

If nothing else though, the setup for the plot is certainly in his wheelhouse. Four mercenaries sign up for a job that takes them to a quarantine zone that was the site of a mysterious disaster. Before long, they find out why this area was sealed off when they're suddenly accosted by waves of shrieking former humans infected by a black goo. Hey, it's a bunch of zombies. They hold them off for a bit, but ultimately come down with this plague and are given a week to live, tops. To stop this illness from spreading and escape alive, they'll need to team up with the man responsible for accidentally letting this thing loose in the first place, a vain rich dude who was trying to drill to the center of the Earth in search of renewable energy, as vain rich dudes tend to do.

All of that sounds perfectly Carpenter, whether it's commandos being deployed into a walled-off nightmare zone to complete a job (Escape from New York), human-consuming organisms (The Thing), or critiques of callous corporate elites (They Live), but the reality is that this serviceable spin on a Left 4 Dead-style co-op shooter doesn't quite bring enough new to the table to entirely stand out.

As for its format, you and up to three allies proceed through semi-open-ended levels to complete objectives, all while blasting very large numbers of zombies in the dome and collecting graded resources that can be used to upgrade your arsenal (this part is strikingly similar to Helldivers 2). Shoot various types of monsters and battle tar-covered tendrils while completing objectives like defending power generators and finding decryption keys.



It's pretty standard stuff, but thankfully, there are a few differences from Valve's influential duology and its imitators. For one, your crew has superpowers. As a side effect of the infection, the members of your team gain unnatural skills: the ability to shoot fireballs out of their hands, a defensive shield, a healing sphere, and a killer drone. These function a bit like the powers in a hero shooter, and while the cooldowns are a bit too long to fundamentally alter the experience, it's hard to say no to the satisfaction of launching an explosive ball of plasma into a horde of foes.

Another major distinction from most other zombie shooters is that this one truly, genuinely loves trucks. Like, a lot. In the tutorial mission, you become acquainted with a beefy four-wheel drive outfitted with a heavy machine gun, a harpoon used to rip down doors and gates, and a healthy dose of Mad Max regalia like plate armor and spikes. Then you're encouraged to pilot this bad boy through crowds of bodies, some of which will dive onto the windshield or grab hold of a door until you're able to give them a good shake (or a double tap). The levels are designed around these vehicles, whether it's navigating the elements, like thick mud that puts engines to the test, or how you need to chart pit stops for resources like gasoline and bullets to keep your ride running. These vehicles have a solid weight to them, and the way they interact with environmental obstacles like thick muck, uphill slopes, and, most of all, freaky undead monsters adds a physical, tactile quality to being behind the wheel.

Making good use of these vehicles is particularly important because if you don't, it's easy to become overwhelmed: another area where Toxic Commandos goes a bit past the co-op shooters of yesteryear is that new tech lets it throw even more zombies at you at once. In the opening setpiece, you drive through a sea of undead, as untold thousands of bodies churn in the background before trickling into an abyss like a putrid waterfall. While this segment slightly oversells how many attackers you'll be dealing with during dedicated gameplay sections, even outside of this showy intro, there are times when there will be an uncomfortable number of creepy guys running at you full tilt. Related to this, the highlight of the entire preview was a defense mission that involved holding out against a seemingly endless assault, as the sheer volume of these foes inevitably results in some slipping through the cracks and piling up on the bolted doors you're supposed to be protecting—the scale can be quite impressive, and it's helped by mechanics, like the ability to set up barbed wire and electric traps ahead of time, that make this feel like a last stand.

But while a few aspects here are at least slightly different than its predecessors, the game still can't quite escape a fundamental sense of déjà vu. The weapons you choose from are a variety of barely distinguishable assault rifles that would feel at home in any given military shooter (granted, these aren't real ones licensed from gun manufacturers that intentionally or not advertise AR-15s to teenagers, so that's an improvement). At least so far in the preview, there weren't any wacky contraptions that would feel fittingly pulpy for a game with both “John Carpenter” and “Toxic Commando” in the title. Where are the flamethrowers, nonsensical sci-fi weapons, and most important of all, the inexplicable shuriken?

Even more boilerplate are the progression systems which have all the trademarks of an RPG-ified gaming landscape. There are skill points that deliver thrilling boons, such as a marginal walk speed increases, weapon levels that very slowly increase to grant more attachments, and rifles that glow with rarity indicators like Borderlands. And while the script was apparently written by Carpenter, it feels barely distinguishable from any number of multiplayer-focused action games with forgettable characters and only the thinnest possible pretense to get out and start blasting, something not helped by unremarkable cutscene direction.

Perhaps the most fundamental issue, though, is that pulling the trigger doesn't feel as satisfying as it could. To be specific, it takes a strangely long time for your character to aim down the sights—Call of Duty may be jingoistic propaganda, but damn, the original Modern Warfare really changed this genre forever with its absurdly snappy aiming. Being outdone by an 18-year-old game is not great, especially considering that shooting is the central thing you'll be doing here. The feedback on weapons feels decent (as in, it's satisfying when zombie heads blow up like watermelons), and there's a real tension as your bullets fail to break the next incoming wave, but hopefully, this area improves before the game launches next year.

Regardless, it's easy to imagine at least a few Carpenter-heads will be disappointed that this game isn't something a bit more in his wheelhouse: a survival horror title, an Until Dawn-style choose-your-own-adventure, or really any form of exclusively single-player experience that could build some real ambiance (you can play this one solo, but it's abundantly clear it's meant for co-op). I'm sure just as many have grown cynical about X person's name being on a thing, but considering Carpenter's name is in the credits, it's not unreasonable to have expected a bit more of his style. Judged (perhaps more fairly) by its own merits, the game is a competent enough cooperative zombie shooter with a few unique hooks, like your magic sludge powers and (more literally) your big dumb truck's hook-harpoon gun. It's the type of thing which could quite plausibly keep a friend group busy for a few weekends. Unfortunately, like its B-movie premise, Toxic Commando seems like the kind of game that may have been best saved for a Blockbuster rental.

	Buzz is building for Paramount Pictures and Legendary's Street Fighter. 


	A teaser of the video game adaptation starring Noah Centineo, Andrew Koji, 50 Cent, Jason Momoa and wrestlers Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes, has dropped at the Game Awards, and a helluva lot of action is on display.


	Set in 1993 and helmed by director Kitao Sakurai, the movie version of the hit game sees estranged Street Fighters Ryu (Koji) and Ken Masters (Centineo) thrown back into combat when the mysterious Chun-Li (Callina Liang) recruits them for the next World Warrior Tournament: a brutal clash of fists, fate, and fury. But behind this battle royale lies a deadly conspiracy that forces them to face off against each other and the demons of their past. And if they don't, it will be game over.

	











	The splashy adaptation's teaser was on display at the Game Awards, which took place last night at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. Star presenters included Centino, Momoa, Orville Peck, David Dastmalchian and Liang, who debuted the teaser along with handing out the award for Best Ongoing Game to No Man's Sky.

The six-episode limited series releases on the streamer Jan. 8, 2026. 


							By 

	Lexi Carson


Associate Editor


Jon Bernthal and Tessa Thompson try to uncover the truth in the new trailer for Netflix‘s psychological thriller, His & Hers.


	Released on Thursday, the upcoming six-episode limited series sees Detective Jack Harper (Bernthal) and Anna (Thompson) investigate a murder — but also accuse each other of murder. Additional castmembers include Pablo Schreiber, Crystal Fox, Sunita Mani, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Marin Ireland and Poppy Liu. 




	“I didn't hurt her, Anna. Do you know who did it?” Jack asks. Anna responds, “I didn't do it, if that's what you're asking.”

	Anna later says, “There are two sides to every story. Ours and theirs. Yours and mine. His and hers. Which means someone is always lying.”


	Here is the official synopsis: “Set in the sweltering heat of Atlanta, Anna lives in haunting reclusivity, fading away from her friends and career as a news anchor. But when she overhears about a murder in Dahlonega — the sleepy town where she grew up — Anna is snapped back to life, pouncing on the case and searching for answers. Detective Jack Harper is strangely suspicious of her involvement, chasing her into the crosshairs of his own investigation.”


	The series, from Fifth Season, is an adaptation of the 2020 Alice Feeney novel of the same name. William Oldroyd and Dee Johnson serve as co-showrunners.

	











	Executive producers include Thompson, Oldroyd, Johnson, Kristen Campo for Campout Productions; Jessica Chastain and Kelly Carmichael for Freckle Films; and Kishori Rajan for Viva Maude.


His & Hers drops on the streamer Jan. 8, 2026.

Move over Martha Stewart? 

Chef Gordon Ramsay has partnered with Dr. Dre and Stewart's bestie, Snoop Dogg, on a new HexClad cocktail shaker developed with the rappers' Still G.I.N. liquor brand.

Ramsay started the year collaborating with Pete Davidson on a HexClad Super Bowl ad. 

He's ending it by teaming up with the rap legends and longtime collaborators on a commercial for the booze, just in time for the holidays. 

In the ad, Ramsay raps along to “Gin and Juice,” the hit Dre produced for Snoop's 1993 debut album, “Doggystyle.”

“Sippin' on gin and juice. Laid back,” Ramsay raps in his British accent. “I got my mind on money. Money on my mind,” he added, prompting Dre to encourage him to “stick to cooking.”

We're told the fun actually started behind-the-scenes. Ramsay memorized the lyrics to the track, “and rapped the entire song for [Dre] during the shoot. Everyone was cracking up, especially Dr. Dre,” a source said of the British chef's rapping skills.

Insiders revealed Dre and Ramsay met at a private Holmby Hills estate the night before the shoot, and bonded over swimming?

“It was their first time meeting in person and Ramsay brought Dre smart goggles to track his laps,” a source told Page Six.

In exchange, Dre gifted Ramsay's daughter a signed copy of his debut album “The Chronic.”

(Coincidentally, Ramsay opened his first restaurant within a year of the album's release). 

Snoop is heard, but not seen in their new promo. The “Doggystyle” rapper shared his vocal talent by recording the voiceover for the commercial.

Here's something to consider: All we ever really know about television characters is what their creators choose to show and tell us. So maybe it's not fair of us to make snooty judgments about the choices they make—even though it's only natural to do so.

In Pluribus, for example, we know a little bit about Carol Sturka's tough childhood; but we also know that, as a successful author, she's led a life of relative privilege. Conversely, we know almost nothing about Manousos Oviedo, except for where he's from (Paraguay), what he did for a living (storage-unit manager), and his general attitude toward the alien takeover of humanity (extremely hostile). It's fair to say that we are being led to assume that Carol has had an easier ride in life—and in her post-apocalypse—than Manousos has.

But is that assessment fair? I genuinely don't know. I only know what I've been shown and told, which is just enough to find the contrast between their experiences incredibly funny—at least as they're presented in this week's perfectly titled episode, “The Gap.” It's funny, that is, until—inevitably—a gloom descends.

Before I get into the finer details of this very fine episode, let's take a moment to appreciate the level of craft that went into “The Gap.” Director Adam Bernstein and screenwriter Jenn Carroll are the credited creative team here, and they—along with the rest of the Pluribus crew—have adeptly handled a difficult challenge.

With the exception of two short monologues—both in Spanish—there's not a lot of talking in this episode. Carol mutters to herself occasionally, sings to herself a lot, and places a few calls to the Joined. Manousos repeats phrases in English that he's heard on language-lesson tapes. Otherwise, their stories are told almost entirely in images. All of the hallmarks of the Pluribus visual style—the exaggerated framing that makes the whole world feel out of whack, and the fleeting flashes of unsettling everyday horror—are put in service of delivering narrative.

It's two narratives, really. The more dramatic of the two—as well as the more visually stunning and exotic—is the one with Manousos. As I hinted at last week, Manousos's apparent plan to travel to Albuquerque without the help of the Joined was bound to run into a snag once he hit the Darién Gap (the gap!). That stretch of land is infamously impassable. Sure enough…he can't pass it.

In what amounts to an extended montage, we see him driving up through picturesque South America, siphoning gas along the way (and always leaving money behind to pay for it) and trying to ignore the occasional smiling hive-mind pods. He talks only to one guy, who is trying to warn him away from crossing the Darién, offering instead to transport him—and his car—to New Mexico quickly and safely. Manousos coolly tells the aliens they can't give him what they don't own. He considers them all to be thieves.

When Manousos hits the Gap, he burns his car, sets out on foot with his machete, and hacks his way through the wilderness. But, unsurprisingly, he eventually loses his footing on a loose rock, before falling backward into a spiky, bacteria-laden chunga palm. The Joined have to send in a rescue helicopter.

It doesn't take long to summarize what happens to Manousos in this episode. That's why it's so impressive, the time and effort that went into shooting these scenes. We get a real sense of how long and how arduous this journey is for someone who stridently refuses the collective's help. He has to collect rainwater in empty cans, because he won't drink their water. He sleeps in churches. He catches fish in streams. He's remarkably self-sufficient. Watching Manousos do his thing for the 20 or so minutes he's onscreen this week is like watching a gripping survival drama compressed into a mini-epic. 

Because Vince Gilligan has never been big on cutting restlessly back and forth between storylines and characters, the Manousos sequence is seen in full, flanked by two Carol sequences. In the first, beginning on Day 12, Carol drives back from Vegas and starts taking a new approach to bossing around the Joined—not desperately or indignantly, but instead kind of snottily. She goes on golf outings, visits a hot-springs resort, tours the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, and demands gourmet meals. She never sees the collective, who still steer well clear of her. But they're definitely helping to facilitate her self-indulgent spree.

The starkest example of the gap—the gap!—between Carol's and Manousos' experiences comes early in the episode, when she stops at a gas station and realizes that all of the snacks and drinks have been removed. She calls for a Gatorade (“the red kind… ice cold… real sugar”) and scratches off some lottery tickets while waiting for the telltale buzz of the delivery drone. She then calls back to complain that the Gatorade's “tepid.”

One person gets impaled on spikes. The other endures a disappointing sports drink. Nobody knows the troubles they've seen.

After the Manousos sequence, we return to Carol on Day 48. Initially, she seems to be living the same life of solitary slackerhood. Before, we saw her drinking beer and setting off fireworks. She's still doing all of that, and still working on her golf swing, too, rocketing balls from downtown rooftops into office building windows. (The wanton destruction, I have to admit, looks very cool.)

But in the gap—the gap!—in Carol's life immediately post-Vegas and 36 days later, something has changed. She's stopped singing, instead relying on a boom box and mix CDs for her soundtrack. And she doesn't seem to be taking any pleasure in the decadence any more. In a scene legitimately as alarming as Manousos's chunga wound, Carol notices that one of her firework tubes has toppled in such a way that it's pointed directly at her. Rather than setting it upright, she faces it and waits.

The firework misses her, shooting past her head and torching a nearby house. But the incident seems to jar something within Carol. The next day she picks up a bucket of paint and writes “come back” in big white letters on her cul-de-sac's pavement.

This sets up the moving conclusion to a wild episode, as Zosia drives up to Carol's house and Carol collapses into her arms, sobbing. What struck me about this ending is how it turns the usually fun Pluribus game of “think along with Carol” on its head. It's hard to know what's going through her mind as she heads off to the hardware store. And because we don't see her painted message until the very end, it's hard to predict what she's going to do when Zosia arrives. She approaches slowly, hesitantly…almost ominously. And then: tears.

I keep thinking about the O'Keeffe painting, Bella Donna, that Carol takes from the museum to replace the poster she has on her wall of that same piece. While she waits for Zosia, we see her staring at Bella Donna impassively. It's easy to imagine her returning to that painting, day after day, using it as a kind of tether as the weight of loneliness begins to tug at her sanity.

Again: I don't know. I don't know Carol, really. I only know what I've been shown and told. Just enough to empathize, intensely.

Charlie Puth sent a public plea to Elon Musk to stop launching rockets near his home in Santa Barbara in the middle of the night. The singer, whose wife is currently pregnant, reached out to the X owner on social media yesterday. 


	“Hi @elonmusk…these sonic booms have gotten progressively louder since they started launching the rockets in Santa Barbara,” Puth wrote. “This one at 3am today felt like 150-160 dB, violently shook our whole house, and really frightened my pregnant wife. I hope they do not get louder.” 

Hi @elonmusk …these sonic booms have gotten progressively louder since they started launching the rockets in Santa Barbara. This one at 3am today felt like 150-160 dB, violently shook our whole house, and really frightened my pregnant wife. I hope they do not get louder :/


	So far Musk has yet to respond. As SpaceX CEO, Musk maintains rocket testing bases in California, Florida, and Texas. The California launches take place at the Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara. According to the SpaceX website, a Falcon 9 rocket was launched Wednesday morning at 3:40 a.m. It warned that “there was a possibility that residents of Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura counties may have heard one or more sonic booms during the launch, but what residents experienced depended on weather and other conditions.”

	











	In October, Puth appeared on The Tonight Show to perform his single “Changes.” He also sat down with host Jimmy Fallon to discuss the album and announcing becoming a father in the “Changes” music video.

	“We're expecting a baby in March,” he told Fallon. “I'm gonna be a dad. I was told not to reveal the gender.” He added, “I hope baby likes music, because it's the only thing I'm good at.”

	











	Puth will perform the national anthem at the 2026 Super Bowl, as announced last month. “I can't believe I'm saying this… I will be performing the National Anthem at Super Bowl LX,” Puth captioned a silly post celebrating the news. In the clip, he broke down the difficulty of singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” to a group of football players using game-day terminology — a nod to his social videos where he overexplains music.

Taylor Swift teared up in her new “End of an Era” docuseries while reflecting on the darker moments from her record-breaking tour.

In episode one, an emotional Swift addressed the thwarted terrorist plot that led her to cancel her three scheduled Eras stops in Vienna in August 2024.

“I thought this would be a tour I would be proud of. It's like a force to be reckoned with in global culture. So, never in my life did I think we would have a terrorist plot,” Swift said during a sit-down interview in London, where she would be resuming the tour mere days after the threat.

Noting that this isn't her first concert, she tearfully admitted, “But this was the first one I feel like – I don't know – I'm skating on thin ice or something. We've had a series of violent, scary things happen to the tour. Like, we dodged a massacre situation and so I've just been kind of all over the place.”

“We dodged a massacre situation,” she reflected.

Adding even more weight to the UK shows was the horrific July 2024 stabbing at a Swift-themed dance party in Southport, during which three young girls were killed and 10 people were injured.

Following the tragic attack, the singer reached out to the victims' families to express her condolences and invite them to her London shows.

In the doc, the singer had to take a break as she burst out into tears because she was having “a hard time explaining” the stabbings.

After noting that she would not cry while meeting the families, she promised, “I swear to God. I'm not going to be doing this; I'm going to be smiling, so any of this gets out of the way before you ever go on stage.”

Comparing her job of entertaining 60,000-plus-person crowds to that of an airplane pilot navigating turbulence while keeping passengers calm, Swift said that if she shows any signs of anxiety or alarm on stage, her fans might panic too.

A professional, she said, “For three and a half hours, they don't have to worry about you. It's like you're a pilot flying the plane and if you were like, ‘Oh, there's turbulence ahead, I don't know if we're going to land in Dallas, like I'm going to try hard, but I don't know if I can figure out how to land through this turbulence.' Like everyone on the plane is going to freak out. You just have to have a cool, calm, collected tone …” 

The “Lover” songstress also reflected, “I've been performing for 20 years. From a mental standpoint, being afraid something's going to happen to your fans at any moment. This is a new challenge. I want to keep all the nerves I have away from the crowd because when you're sort of the ringleader of this show, they can sense any kind of shift energetically in you and you have to really focus and factor that in – you're at the Eras Tour and nothing is wrong!”

During the same episode, Swift attempted to soothe “a physical reaction to [her] nerves” by unwinding backstage at Wembley Stadium with an audiobook and a check-in from her mom, Andrea.

As Page Six reported, two people were arrested in Vienna last August for planning an attack on one of Swift's concerts in the Austrian city. She subsequently cancelled all three concerts in Vienna due to safety concerns.

Swift, 35, addressed the foiled terror plot weeks later, telling Swifties that the whole thing was “devastating.”

“The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows,” she wrote on Instagram on Aug. 21, 2024.

“But I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives.”

She also explained why it took her a few weeks to break her silence on the matter.

“Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows,” Swift said.

“In cases like this one, ‘silence' is actually showing restraint, and waiting to express yourself at a time when it's right to. My priority was finishing our European tour safely, and it is with great relief that I can say we did that.”

The first two episodes of “The End of an Era” are available to stream on Disney+.

From the individual journeys of her crew to the guest stars that brought the tour to a new level, here are the insights provided in the first two episodes.

	One year after taking one final bow on the Eras tour stage, Taylor Swift is pulling the curtain back. The End of an Era, a six-part docuseries focused on the biggest tour of the superstar's career, premiered its first two episodes on Disney+ on Friday (Dec. 12), with further episodes rolling out in the coming weeks. 


	And while The End of an Era could have existed as pure fan service — and that is certainly an aspect of the opening episodes, with slow-motion shots of an unstoppable Swift and adoring supporters — the heart of the series is a documentation of singular pop spectacle, unpacking the personalities behind the tour and how they came together to producer something so massive.


	Of course, that starts with Swift, whose attention to detail is both unsurprising and mesmerizing to witness in the context of pushing the Eras show to become more dazzling. The docuseries showcases the germination of the tour, and how it kept changing — including the incorporation of a new era, The Tortured Poets Department, as well as recurring and guest stage presences. 


	Her passion to entertain, to take care of her tour family, to clarify her artistic intent and to also simply enjoy every moment of the tour is presented as a balancing act that she can't help but keep up. Just as there were no half-measures in the three-hour-plus show, Swift does not hold back in The End of an Era, and you finish each episode with a greater understanding of her intent.


	The Eras tour will forever be a special experience for countless attendees, and The End of an Era honors that indispensability — while also tossing out new tidbits that even the super-fans will appreciate. Here are six things we learned from the first two episodes of The End of an Era.








Swift explains how the confluence of her fight for her masters and the beginning of the pandemic at the beginning of the 2020s resulted in a re-examination of her back catalog and the dreams of a sprawling tour at a moment when live shows were shut down. That inspiration is common knowledge among fans, but the footage of Swift hatching the first Eras ideas — beat by beat, moment by moment, unpacking her approach to a crew of future tour mates — is fresh, and thrilling to witness.


Not surprisingly, the Eras dancers, band members and overall brain trust provide plenty of straight-to-camera commentary, both of Swift's work ethic and of various touring details. Yet The End of an Era also digs deep into their pathways toward the biggest stage show of their lives, with their backstories — from the bassist who's been alongside Swift since her teens, to the fan-favorite dancer who was always told ‘no' until Swift told him ‘absolutely' — providing levity at some points, and producing tears at others.


The thwarted terrorist plot that led to the cancellation of a full weekend of Eras tour dates created an understandable sense of unease, and the docuseries showcases how Swift picked up the pieces both practically (with heightened security at the following shows in London) and personally (refusing to buckle to her nerves in the immediate aftermath). The docuseries makes space for the complicated feelings around the incident, from the disappointment of fans in Austria who missed out on the tour to Swift figuring out how to avoid a breakdown as the leader of a positive communal space.


The first two episodes of the docuseries features one guest star each, which we won't spoil here — and their appearances are not treated as an enviable co-sign by Swift on her biggest stage yet, but as a means of support, elevating the tour's artistic value and contributing to its overall vision. Aside from the onstage fireworks, the behind-the-scenes interactions between Swift and her fellow artists are gentle and authentic, with A-list personalities rendered as old friends bouncing ideas off of each other.


If you're a pop nerd, with a curiosity for how something with the scale of the Eras Tour is orchestrated, the docuseries illustrates several elaborate processes that help a mega-tour come together (and evolve) seamlessly. From on-the-fly staging ideas to custom choreography to top-secret rehearsal requirements to stripped-down vocal arrangements, The End of an Era painstakingly explains how it all comes together, and some of the best moments of the first two episodes play out like a step-by-step guide to something that's never been accomplished before.


Yes, we get to hear some conversations between Swift and Travis Kelce. Yes, they are as encouraging and adorable as you'd expect. More than anything, though, those moments ground Swift in the middle of a whirlwind, a larger-than-life idol for millions of concertgoers with the same hopes, fears, need for reassurance and desire to revel in good news as the rest of us. We'll see how the rest of the docuseries incorporates Swift's fianceé, but so far, his presence underlines the humanity of the story's hero.

'Damascus' features the talents of Syrian artist Omar Souleyman and New York rapper and singer Yasiin Bey.

Gorillaz swing into our lives once again with “Damascus,” another new track from their forthcoming album, The Mountain.


	Dropping at the stroke of midnight, “Damascus” is a proper international adventure. 


	The exotic cut was recorded in Damascus, London, Devon, Mumbai and New York, and features the talents of Syrian artist Omar Souleyman and NYC rapper and singer Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def), both of whom are credited as songwriters, alongside Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn.


	Fans got the jump on “Damascus” when it received its live debut at Gorillaz's surprise performance of The Mountain at London's Copper Box Arena in September, ahead of spots at Madrid's Gaia Festival and Together For Palestine at Wembley Arena, when the beloved “cartoon band” was joined on stage by the London Arab Orchestra.

	The collection is described by reps as “an expansive sonic landscape of instruments and sounds, richly layered with voices, melodies and addictive beats,” and boasts an impressive lineup of collaborators and several voices “of friends” that have passed, including Bobby Womack, Dennis Hopper and Mark E Smith.


	“Damascus” is one of 15 songs on The Mountain, which collects previously-released songs “The God of Lying” (feat. IDLES), “The Manifesto” (feat. Trueno and Proof) and “The Happy Dictator” (feat. Sparks).




	Gorillaz will support the release with The Mountain Tour, which gets underway with two warm-up shows in Bradford, England on March 13 and 14 before opening night, March 20 in Manchester. The tour will visit arenas across the U.K. and Ireland, plus a one-off headline show at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday, June 20, for the band's biggest show in their homeland to-date, with support from Sparks and Trueno. European festival slots will follow next summer.


	Gorillaz last released a new album in 2023 with Cracker Island, which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, their fifth top 10 appearance. Cracker Island was nominated for best alternative music album at the 2024 Grammy Awards.

A Palestine benefit single from an ensemble including Brian Eno, Neneh Cherry, and Nadine Shah is out today. Credited to Together for Palestine—the British-based operation that put on a major benefit concert in September—“Lullaby” is a cover of the traditional Palestinian song “Yamma Mweel El Hawa,” which Peter Gabriel has adapted from an English translation. The Palestinian musician Nai Barghouti arranged and recomposed the song with Shards' Kieran Brunt. Watch the accompanying video below.

Upon the song's announcement, Eno said in a press release that they were aiming for the United Kingdom's coveted No. 1 spot on the Christmas singles chart. “After a year defined by unimaginable loss, grief and injustice, we want to end with an act of love for Palestine's children,” he said. “‘Lullaby' reflects their beauty, their longing and their hope. If we rally together and download it, we have a real shot at landing Christmas No. 1—and turning that moment into vital life-saving support for Gaza's families.”

Barghouti added, “This lullaby from our Palestinian musical heritage has been with me since early childhood. Today, it returns at a much-needed time as a reminder of what Palestinians will never lose: hope, defiance, beauty, and dignity.”

Kieran Brunt, Benji B, and Henri Davies produced “Lullaby,” which also features Amena, Lana Lubany, Leigh-Anne, London Community Gospel Choir, Sura Abdo, Tyson, Yasmeen Ayyashi, and Ysee. All proceeds go to Choose Love's Together for Palestine Fund, which supports the Palestinian-led organizations Taawon, Palestine Children's Relief Fund and Palestine Medical Relief Service.

	Billboard cover star ROSÉ looks back at her journey from growing up in Australia and wanting to sing like Beyoncé to making history with her Grammy nominations for her Bruno Mars collaboration “APT.” Plus, she dives into the creation of her solo project ‘Rosie' and what it was like jumping back into BLACKPINK following her solo success.


	ROSÉ:


	Never in a million years would I have thought that this would happen, to be nominated for a Grammy. It means a lot that “APT.” is the one that is being celebrated so much. I'm really, really grateful, and with it like shook don't even know what to say. We were radio people. My dad would have the radio on all the time. And because Australia, like LA, everything's far away — like, everything's 30 minutes away. So we'd always have the radio on. And so I grew up listening to all of that. Britney Spears was on the radio all the time. Madonna was on the radio. I think I was definitely influenced by a lot of pop, I love pop music. When I grew up, YouTube was where I started to listen and watch all these musicians, and naturally, the very beginning of me like starting to sing and play instruments was after I watched ‘Dreamgirls.' I remember watching Beyoncé sing “Listen” and being like, “Oh my God, I really want to be able to sing that.” I am. Yes, and I like printed it on, like, the chords on paper, and I would play it and sing at the top of my lungs. Simultaneously, my sister, because we are Korean, she was very interested in our culture. She had been consuming a lot of Korean music and musicians, and and that's when K-pop was around as well. That's how I got to absorb that thing. It all just was a mixture of things as I am and as I have always been.

“If we want the public to trust what they see, we must have guardrails on digital replicas and synthetic creations,” said SAG-AFTRA national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.

	New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed two bills Thursday to boost AI transparency in the film industry. 


	The first requires entities who produce or create an advertisement to disclose whether the ad includes AI-generated synthetic performers, while the second requires consent from heirs or executors if a company wishes to use the name, image, or likeness of an individual for commercial purposes after their death. Gov. Kathy Hochul described these as “first in the nation” policies and committed to continuing protecting performers.

	“We will have responsible AI policies in the state of New York,” Hochul said at a press conference at the SAG-AFTRA offices in New York City Thursday.

	“It's a time where we do want to embrace innovation,” she continued. “But not to the detriment of people. That has to be the dividing line right there.” She went on to call the use of AI actors in advertisements “fake entertainment.” 


	The Governor hosted a signing at the SAG-AFTRA offices in New York, surrounded by union executives as well as former president Fran Drescher, national executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Linda Powell, executive vice president of SAG-AFTRA. 


	The bill signing came the same day Disney announced a partnership with OpenAI in which users of its AI video creation platform Sora will be able to create clips using iconic characters from Marvel, Pixar and Star Wars franchises. Disney CEO Bob Iger said Thursday that the Sora deal will not include voices, potentially delaying a fight over using actor's voices. The news loomed large in the room, with Chief Labor Policy Officer Rebecca Damon pointing to the announcement and saying the union is thinking about AI every day. 

	











	Crabtree-Ireland, chief negotiator in the most recent SAG-AFTRA negotiations, where AI was a major sticking point, did not speak directly to the Disney deal, but pointed to the union's wider policy in relation to the New York bills. 


	“If we want the public to trust what they see, we must have guardrails on digital replicas and synthetic creations,” Crabtree-Ireland said, adding that the union refers to them as “synthethic figures” rather than “synthetic performers.”  


	The union later issued a statement saying it will “closely monitor the deal” to “ensure compliance with our contracts and with applicable laws protecting image, voice and likeness.”


	“We acknowledge Disney's and OpenAI's independent outreaches to us on this matter and their assurances that they will meet their contractual and legal obligations to performers and continue to implement systems to ensure ethical and responsible use of this technology,” the union said in statement. 


	“This comes after months of frank discussions between SAG-AFTRA and OpenAI about the protection of performers. The ongoing dialogue reflects a significant commitment to taking SAG-AFTRA members' concerns into account in the protective measures applied to image, likeness, voice, performance, and intellectual property rights generally,” the statement continues. 


	SAG-AFTRA had previously established guardrails against the use of OpenAI's Sora 2 in October, after the invite-only release used actor Bryan Cranston's voice and likeness in some of the outputs, without his consent or any compensation. OpenAI then said it was strengthening its guardrails around the replication of voice and likeness, and already requires an opt-in policy. 

	











	“I'm glad that OpenAI has committed to using an opt-in protocol, where all artists have the ability to choose whether they wish to participate in the exploitation of their voice and likeness using A.I. This policy must be durable and I thank all of the stakeholders, including OpenAI for working together to have the appropriate protections enshrined in law. Simply put, opt-in protocols are the only way to do business and the NO FAKES Act will make us safer,” SAG-AFTRA President Sean Astin said at the time.

The album contains 10 songs from the late 1970s through mid-'80s that would be heard on the show's fictional radio station, 94.5 FM The Squawk.

	Following the Nov. 26 premiere of the fifth season of Netflix's Stranger Things, the inspired companion project, Stranger Things: The WSQK Collection, Compiled by Rockin' Robin, makes (air)waves on the charts. The vinyl set, exclusively sold at Target stores, tunes in to the top 10 on six charts, and also arrives on the overall Billboard 200 (all charts dated Dec. 13).


	The album contains 10 songs from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s that would be heard on the show's fictional radio station WSQK (94.5 FM The Squawk), in the also-fictional Hawkins, Ind. The set includes three Billboard Hot 100 No. 1s: Pink Floyd's “Another Brick in the Wall (Part II),” Diana Ross' “Upside Down” and Tiffany's “I Think We're Alone Now.”

	











Stranger Things: The WSQK Collection spends a fifth week atop Compilation Albums, debuts at No. 53 on the Billboard 200 and sold nearly 18,000 copies in the United States in the tracking week ending Dec. 4 (up 268%), according to Luminate. Since its Oct. 24 release, the project has sold 35,000 copies.




	It also impacts Vinyl Albums (rising 13-3, a new peak), Top Rock Albums (No. 5 debut), Top Current Album Sales (20-5, new peak), Top Album Sales (26-6, new peak) and Top Rock & Alternative Albums (No. 7 debut).


	The WSQK Collection album is part of a larger marketing campaign around the fictional radio station, which includes a sizable line of official merchandise with period-appropriate designs. Among the merch available: clothing, posters, car magnets, vanity license plates, a lava lamp, Funko Pop! figures, mugs and a Lego playset.


	Further, for WSQK fans based in the United Kingdom, the radio station has been brought to life for a limited time in partnership with Global. Until Jan. 1, a WSQK broadcast will beam out through Global Player, but only for U.K. residents. Per a press release, “fans can expect local Hawkins updates and news from ‘Squawk of the Town,' chats with the station's resident agony aunt on ‘Talk To Tammy,' there's hot gossip and entertainment news from The Scoop brought to you by Scoops Ahoy, name that backwards playing tune with ‘Rewind at 9' and ‘Dial-a-Dedication' where fans can submit their own dedication to a loved one which could be read out live on air. All of this and more, alongside a non-stop stream of back-to-back 80s hits!”

Ryan Coogler's Sinners will almost certainly be in heavy attendance at the Oscars when they roll around next year, with Coogler's stylish, personal Southern vampire flick already topping lists of expected nominations. But Coogler himself won't be involved in the voting, on account of having turned down an invitation to the Academy way back in 2016. Not, he clarified in a recent interview with The New York Times, out of any animosity toward the Oscar-granting body. But because the man just isn't into passing judgement on other filmmakers' work.

“I'm not good at judging things, bro,” Coogler said in a new Times profile centered on his very good 2025. “The act of ‘Hey, pick the best thing' is very stressful for me, even when there's no stakes involved.” There are, honestly, a lot of directors where we might call bullshit on this—the overlap between people breaking their backs to make movies, and people who like to talk shit about other movies is pretty strong, as Quentin Tarantino has made a pointed note of in recent weeks. But it feels genuine coming from Coogler, a guy who manages, in every interview we've ever read or heard of him, to consistently sound like the world's most humble man, even as he posts an increasingly long and uninterrupted string of box office successes.

THR notes that this isn't the first time Coogler has given commentary about his decision to turn down the invite, which arrived shortly after he directed Creed back in 2015. Back in 2021, he made clear his disinterest in pitting films against each other, and noted that, time being limited, “If I'm going to be a part of organizations, they're going to be labor unions, where we're figuring out how to take care of each other's families and health insurance.” In the Times piece, Coogler noted that, while he tries to get enjoyment out of the awards cycle, it's just not what interests him about making movies. “Most days, I'm wearing coveralls and Columbia gear, trying to find solutions that aggregate up to a story,” he said. “And that enabled me not to engage with any narratives around what it is that we do.”

Ethan Hawke candidly shared regret over his daughter Maya Hawke's “really hard and complicated” upbringing.

“There were a lot of things about her childhood that were really, really hard and complicated, and things I regret for her,” Ethan told Sydney Sweeney during their “Actors on Actors” conversation with Variety, which was released on Thursday.

While he neglected to share how her childhood was difficult, Ethan, 55, admitted that he knew Maya would grow up to “be an artist” when she was just 4 years old.

“I knew that she was gonna be a very good one,” the “Black Phone” star shared. “That was her safe place, watercoloring, dancing, singing all throughout her childhood.”

“Anything that had to do with human communication was something she vibrated to,” he said, reflecting with pride on his daughter's wise beyond years knowledge. 

“I remember some teacher said, ‘Maya, are you happy?' Cause they were worried about her. And she said something to the effect of, ‘Do you really think that's the question?'”

“I thought, ‘I love this kid,'” he continued. “She was about 13. [Maya said] ‘I don't think that's a very interesting question. I think there's a lot more interesting questions than whether I'm happy or not. Am I happy? No. But I don't aspire to be happy.'”

Maya would go on to prove her father's hunch correct as she grew up to star in major hits like Netflix's “Stranger Things” and Quentin Tarantino's “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.” 

She's also set to star in the forthcoming films “One Night Only,” “Wishful Thinking” and “The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping.”

In addition to Maya, 27, Ethan is also dad to son Levon, 23 — whom he also shares with ex-wife Uma Thurman — and daughters Clementine Jean, 17, and Indiana, 14, whom he welcomed with current wife, Ryan Shawhughes.

As Ethan neglected to explain the hardships his daughter faced, the “Dead Poets Society” star has also purposefully avoided discussions on his high-profile divorce from Thurman in 2005.

However, the actor revealed why he doesn't publicly talk about his breakup from Thurman, citing his children as the reason. 

“I can't really talk about this because I vowed to my kids so many times not to talk about the divorce in public,” he said in November while discussing how he feels divorce is “hard” because of “the family elements.”

“Teen Mom” alum Kailyn Lowry shared “really, really sad news” about a beloved family member with her fans.

The mother of seven, 33, took to Instagram on Wednesday, December 10, and revealed that her dog, Buddha, was diagnosed with cancer.

In the video, Lowry sat down in front of the camera as she was getting ready for the day. The former reality star appeared to be holding back tears as she announced the sad news.

“I come bearing some really, really sad news to share with you,” Lowry began. “My dog Buddha has cancer.”

The MTV personality revealed that she got Buddha while pregnant with her fourth child, Creed. Despite Buddha being an older dog, Lowry still treats him like a puppy.

“I know sometimes bigger dogs will get, like, fatty lumps,” she continued. “[He] personally has never experienced the fatty lumps. So I take him to the vet […] and she [the vet] didn't think anything was wrong.”

However, at Buddha's follow-up check-up, Lowry pointed out that one of the fatty lumps attached to his wrist was very tight and close to the bone.

She was later referred to a vet in Pennsylvania, where Buddha was officially diagnosed with cancer.

Lowry revealed that surgery isn't the best option, noting that it'd be incredibly difficult for Buddha to recover from it.

“Because it's so close [to the bone] it would actually probably be a harder time healing after the surgery than it would be if we just sort of left it alone,” the “Teen Mom” star continued.

Lowry gushed about how Buddha is “such a good dog” and that “everyone loves [him].”

Right now, Lowry focuses on making sure that Buddha is “super comfortable” before his time comes. She also asked fans for comfort tips in adult dog life care.

Fans flooded the comments with love and well-wishes for Lowry and Buddha.

One fan wrote, “Sending you so much love and sending that handsome boy love and smooches.”

Another commented, “My friend's Pit Bull got diagnosed with Cancer, and they opted not to do the surgery, and he lived another 5+ years. Enjoy him and just know that he could be around for a lot longer than you think, Mama.”

Someone added, “Cane corso's are the BEST!! Don't know what I'd do without mine. Sending love.”

Jenny Marrs is sharing an emotional message she hopes will help others. As the Marrs family continues to grieve following a heartbreaking year of loss, the HGTV star finds comfort in these powerful words.

On December 8, Marrs took to Instagram to share a powerful message from years ago that still speak to her today.

“Eight years ago, I shared this photo and these words,” she wrote in the caption. “My weary heart needed to read them again today and maybe someone else's does too … “

The photo showed a Christmas tree ornament featuring a photo of her daughter Sylvie. “As I sit by the glow of the tree, steaming coffee in hand, reading about hope and fear and faith … I glance up, right into these eyes,” Marrs wrote.

She continued, “My Sylvie girl … the ornament we hung years ago, with aching, hopeful, anxious, longing hearts. Our first Christmas with a daughter across an ocean. We didn't know of the fight in front of us. We didn't know the days of waiting would turn to months and the months would turn to years. We only knew God called us to say yes to this little girl, yes to an unknown path, yes to hurting and pain and loss and boundless love.”

The HGTV star noted, “He also continually whispered the words I read again just this morning before looking up to the tree and this ornament, ‘Don't be afraid. Just trust me.' (Mark 5:36b)”

Marrs shared her hope that this simple reminder could help her fans in some way. “I don't know what you're facing today, as we enter the season of Advent and walk toward Christmas Day,” she wrote. “But I know when you are grieving or longing for healing or waiting for your baby or hurting deeply, this season can be harder than most.”

Marrs shared, “It can be a reminder, not of the Hope we look to, but of the one miracle or unanswered prayer just out of reach. If you're in the pain, desperate for Hope, hear His words again: Don't be afraid. Just trust me.'”

She concluded with a note about faith and hope. “He is faithful and trustworthy. His story for us is never our story for us but it is always good,” Marrs shared. “He has a plan and a purpose and every tear and every moment of waiting and hurting will someday be redeemed. Maybe this side of eternity, maybe not. But someday, it will all be made new. That is the Hope we can cling to.”

The comments section was flooded with messages from fans who praised Marrs for sharing the important words.

“Look what a beautiful young lady she has turned into. All you faith, love and hope you have changed her world. So blessed,” one fan noted.

Another commenter wrote, “Beautiful! Thank you so much for this important reminder. I needed it today. God bless you and your beautiful family!”

“These words brought tears to my eyes,” one fan shared. “Been going through a whole lot and being reminded of God's words helps. Thank you.”

Others wrote, “A beautiful reminder of God's plans and His faithfulness” and “Thank you for sharing. I needed to read this today.”

A big part of the Wild West (with less water) vibes surrounding Earth's current AI bubble has come from the way governments have been trying to keep the hell out of the whole thing, at least until the dust has settled. Although the EU passed laws last year setting up a framework for regulating artificial intelligence use, American lawmakers have been way more reticent, with legislators looking nervously to the Supreme Court, which has yet to hand down any truly definitive rulings on any of the thousand or so issues pertaining to copyright, fair use, outright theft, dead people's faces being used as digital puppets, etc., that crop up around this technology.

Now, New York has taken a step toward being one of the first states in the nation to attempt at least a bit of regulation on the topic, with Governor Kathy Hochul signing a pair of bills on Thursday designed to bring some small measure of accountability to companies using AI to generate video content. One focuses specifically on ads—sorry, McDonald's—which will force any commercial featuring “AI-generated synthetic performers” to be accompanied by a disclosure. A second law focuses on using famous people's virtual corpses to shill products or pop up in films: It “requires consent from heirs or executors if a person wants to use the name, image, or likeness of an individual for commercial purposes after their death.”

Neither of these laws feel particularly sweeping or ground-breaking, if we're being honest; there are already statutes on the books about likeness rights, and asking companies to run a tiny disclaimer if they want to generate up some homunculi to fill out the back of a Starbucks feels like a pretty tiny ask. But they do represent a state government stating, definitively, that it can regulate this stuff, something the federal government has so far notably declined to do. It was a big enough deal that Hochul announced the signings from the offices of acting union SAG, where she was accompanied by negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland and former union president Fran Drescher—both major figures in the 2023 strikes that saw the union battle, not wholly successfully, to get AI guidelines into its contract with studios. Alluding briefly to today's Disney/OpenAI news, Hochul noted that regulations weren't intended to curtail innovation: “We do want to embrace innovation. We really do. It's who we are as New Yorkers. It's what makes us so fabulous and so great. But not to the detriment of people. That has to be the dividing line.”

Sydney Sweeney denied rumors that she has undergone breast augmentation surgery while taking a lie detector test with her “Housemaid” co-star Amanda Seyfried.

“There's been a question on everybody's minds recently, and I just have to ask, are your boobs real?” Seyfried asked during a segment with Vanity Fair published Thursday.

“Yes,” Sweeney said while laughing. “I've never gotten any work done anywhere.”

The outlet's lie detector proctor confirmed that the “Euphoria” star, 28, was being “truthful.”

“Can I touch 'em?” Seyfried, 40, joked.

“Sure,” Sweeney playfully responded.

The “White Lotus” star responded to plastic surgery rumblings for the second time this week after being questioned during an interview with Allure.

“Let's debunk them all,” she said. “I mean, I have never gotten work done … I am so scared of needles, you have no idea.”

While chatting with Variety in October, Sweeney also shared her plans to “age gracefully.”

When discussing the speculation about her looks, the actress shared that it wasn't fair to be compared to a photo of herself when she was 12 years old.

“Of course I'm going to look different. I have makeup on now and I'm 15 years older,” she said.

Sweeney also confirmed that she didn't have any tattoos.

Elsewhere in the interview, the “Anyone But You” star addressed how fans think they know her based on the diverse characters she plays on screen.

“So when people think, ‘Ah, she's a sex symbol,' or ‘She's leaning into that,' I'm like, ‘No, I just feel good and I'm doing it for myself and I feel strong,'” she explained.

Sweeney shared that her goal is to “inspire other women to be confident and just flaunt what they got.”

When the teaser for “Chrome Alone 2: Lost in New Jersey,” a new short film starring the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, was released, an early complaint on the internet was a brief moment where tech-savvy Donatello consults with ChatGPT on what to get father-figure Master Splinter for Christmas. Cries of character assassination that the super smart Donnie would have to ask an AI algorithm for advice could be found all over Twitter.

As it turns out, Donnie's flirtation with ChatGPT isn't just a throwaway; it's the whole plot of the delightful short, which pits the Turtles against Chrome Dome (voiced by Zach Woods), an AI menace using generative AI to rip off the Turtles' likeness and sell ripoff toy versions of them for profit. Like a lot of “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” media, the short has its tongue firmly planted in cheek, but it also sends a strong message that AI isn't capable of what human creativity can manage.

“Chrome Alone 2,” which will play in theaters before screenings of “The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants” later this month, is the directorial debut of animator Kent Seki, who served as the head of cinematography on “Mutant Mayhem,” the acclaimed 2023 film that introduced this era of TMNT. Seki, a longtime fan of the characters who collected their comics as a kid, said he initially joined the first film Ramsey Naito, former head of Nickelodeon Animation, connected him with the director Jeff Rowe. Seki had met Naito when he worked on “Boss Baby” in 2017, and told her he wanted to eventually direct; she kept that in mind, and offered him the chance to take on the short soon after “Mutant Mayhem” production wrapped.

 










“I've been trying to direct since 2007,” Seki told IndieWire in an interview. “This short film came up, and she found a place for me on it as a director. And it really was through her goodwill and her belief in me that this all happened.”

Below, Seki talks with IndieWire about making the short, tackling the topic of AI through “TMNT,” and how films like “Uncut Gems” and “Panic Room” influenced his directing process.  

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. 

IndieWire: This film explores the intersection of generative artificial intelligence and art. Why did you want to tackle the subject, which is obviously very topical right now, through the turtles?

Seki: For the last three to four years, we've been hearing and seeing the rise of generative AI, like it's all around us. And for anyone that works in a creative industry, it creates a lot of anxiety about what this means for us? You hear things that you're going to be replaced. You see these tools and they are impressive, at the same time, you see some of their limitations and their downfalls. And there's a lot of hyperbole about what it's going to do, so it ended up being a case that doing a film around AI allowed us to channel and funnel all of that anxiety into the film itself. It ended up being extremely productive for us, when we really decided to focus on AI, it informed all the art styles that we used in it. It informed the writing. I was surprised when the teaser came out, how much people agreed with the sentiment. It was an interesting moment to watch something you made a year ago be more relevant now than it was when we made it. We were afraid, actually, a year ago, we were like, “well, this doesn't come out for a year. Maybe this discussion will be over by then.” If anything, it's become even more topical.

 










Can you explain a little more what you mean about how AI informed the visuals and writing?

If you look at the live-action commercial, for example, even the live-action kids have extra fingers. The notion was that everything's off by a little bit, there was this feeling that we wanted to be everything to be a little bit odd, right? It has this gauze of nostalgia over it that like a retro commercial. We went through and treated the footage to make it look like it was shot off of a videotape. We did the little things that make the turtles more commercial in the sense of their giant muscles and crazy veins sticking out of them.

In the backstory Chrome Dome tells the turtles, the writing is a combination of several franchises. There's a moment in which Chrome Dome encounters a magical being that's a combination of Handsome Squidward, Thanos, the Navi from “Avatar,” and Dr. Manhattan, all made into one character. Even in the scoring, I went to our composer Disasterpeace and said “Imagine this is a piece of diegetic music that the turtles are hearing, that everyone in the movie can actually hear, and that Chrome Dome has created because he believes his own backstory.” The fundamental thing about a liar, is they believe their own lie, and he would have listened to all these amazing Hans Zimmer scores and then made his own version like that, but worse. He went to town with that and made this epic score that's kind of overblown. In the sound design from Mark Mangini, he went through and found sound effects from the actual IP that we were riffing on and parodying and peppered that in. Every department was adding to that storytelling and using AI as the punching bag for our feelings about it.

 










The commercial you mentioned nods back to the franchise's heyday in the '80s and '90s. How did you film it?

We originally had them going into the store and handling the toys themselves, but story artist John Jackson said, “you could have a commercial in the window that we would watch.” And I thought that's a great idea, but we can't afford to do that, and we couldn't afford to do that in CG. But we hired this great company, the Brothers Chaps in Atlanta, and basically we contracted them out to make it. We had to be hands off on it. And they got the prototype toys from the toy company and made this commercial. That's one of the things that we wanted to sort draw on, was this idea of using nostalgia as a weapon to draw in parents to buy toys. The turtles have a long tradition of toys, right? That's a lot of people come to that this franchise through the toys, and to use it as a meta narrative, to say something about AI at the same time the franchise itself and the corporatization of an indie comic, we thought was a very clever way of, sort of taking making a nod to all of these different things that the film has in it.

The short begins with Donnie asking ChatGPT a question about gifts to get Splinter. By the end, after fighting Chrome Dome, he deletes the app. Why did that make sense for his character.
 










I know it was controversial that Donnie used ChatGPT [Laughs]. I think what it comes down to is the turtles created by Jeff Rowe and Seth Rogen are authentically teenage. Teenagers are naturally curious, and they experiment with all these things. So it made sense that in their moment in their lives, that would be something that they would experiment with. It was in contrast to the ceramic mug that Mikey made. Do you make something by hand, this lovingly crafted, the ugly mug, or do you rely on this technology to tell you what to give your parent for Christmas? That's the contrast. If you're a parent, you've received that mug in some shape or form and loved it, even though it has many flaws. And sometimes I would say the flaws make it lovable. Or do you go with the answer that technology gives you, right, and which is sort of the easy answer, and I think that's the contrast we're drawing there. Having Donnie learned that lesson throughout the short doesn't mean he rejects technology, but that he can leave with this healthy skepticism of technology.

How did you think of making the short visually distinct from “Mutant Mayhem”?

That was driven by our Art Director, Garrett Lee, who was really interested in sort of finding a new a new look in it that expanded upon what we did in Mutant Mayhem. One thing we did was we shot with two frames of a focal length longer to try and stack the frame, stack the image with as much New York as possible, so that the Turtles, who ended Mutant Mayhem being accepted into society, would now be part of society. We took a lot of inspiration from the Safdie Brothers and “Uncut Gems,” if you can believe it for that opening bit. We looked to it as something that we wanted to do to make it feel more New York, because the Safdies know how to shoot New York. They are amazing at it. We also drew upon David Fincher's “Panic Room” for when they are breaking into the toy factory, And then for the end fight, we looked at James Cameron's “Avatar.” So we had all these cinematic touchstones that we sort of looked at for inspiration, to help influence how we were making the film.

 










The title is a reference to “Home Alone.” Did that come up as a reference during production?

I think that the physical comedy definitely has roots in “Home Alone.” There was a moment in which we were trying to figure out what the title of the movie should be. We were in a lighting review. And there was concern if we want to have Christmas in the title, and we're like, “I don't know if that feels right for this” but it should evoke feelings that people have of Christmas. And I think it was, I think it was Woodrow White, the character designer, or Garrett Lee, the art director. One of them said, “Chrome Alone 2” and the other added “Lost in New Jersey.” That became the genesis of that title, and it felt right, because it's exactly the sort of thing that we're talking about, in terms of a blatant rip off of something else.

There's a sequel to “Mutant Mayhem” scheduled for 2027. Have you started work on it?

Yes, right now, I am working on the sequel as the head of cinematography, and I'm excited about it. It's a dream team of people. Jeff is a master director to work with, and it's really fun. And I can't wait for people to see it. You have a long time to wait. Hopefully this short film tides you over a bit.

“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Chrome Alone 2 — Lost In New Jersey” will premiere in theaters with “The Spongebob Movie: Search for SquarePants” on December 19.

They come in peace.

Steven Spielberg's new UFO movie has reignited speculation within the alien conspiracy theory community, especially after cryptic billboards teasing the upcoming film popped up across the country this week.

“All will be disclosed,” read billboards for the forthcoming flick in New York City and Los Angeles, alongside the “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” director's name and the project's June 12, 2026, release date.

The posters also included a creepy image of what appeared to be a human eye peeking through a mysterious and reflective silhouette.

Spielberg fans quickly rushed to social media after seeing the new billboards to theorize about what the still-untitled movie might be about, while others suggested the “Jaws” director is using the film to disclose the existence of real aliens to the world.

“A conspiracy theory that's so crazy it just might be brilliant!” Chris Ramsay, who has a YouTube channel devoted to UFO theories, wrote on X. “The theory goes like this: Spielberg has been chosen to deliver the next phase of disclosure.”

“Not a leak in the traditional sense, but a carefully constructed big reveal,” he continued. “What if Spielberg has been granted unprecedented access to real UAP footage or better yet, an actual UFO?”

The tinfoil hat wearer added that there is “no better way to get disclosure” than by the “very means which have conditioned us to believe in them in the first place. The silver screen.”

However, Ramsay also speculated that Spielberg's next project might be “another way to control the narrative” around extraterrestrial life.

“Good luck searching ‘UFO Disclosure' after this movie hits the theatres…” he wrote.

The fact that Spielberg's new project was filmed in New Jersey has excited UFO hunters as well.

Last year, hundreds of residents reported seeing mysterious lights flying around the state. 

While several people thought they might be witnessing UFOs, the Trump Administration later confirmed that the mysterious aircraft were FAA-authorized drones.

But this wouldn't be the first time one of Spielberg's movies has ignited alien conspiracy theories.

Back in 2011, while discussing a special screening Ronald Reagan hosted for “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” at the White House in 1982, the “War of the Worlds” filmmaker recalled what the then-president said as the credits rolled.

“There are a number of people in this room who know that everything on that screen is absolutely true,” Reagan reportedly shared.

Spielberg suggested that Reagan wasn't kidding.

“The whole room laughed because he presented it like a joke,” the director said, per The Telegraph. “But he wasn't smiling as he said it.”

Spielberg himself, meanwhile, believes in alien life and has shared his thoughts about the subject several times in the past.

“I don't believe we're alone in the universe,” the “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” director said most recently in 2023. “I think it's mathematically impossible that we are the only intelligent species in the cosmos.”

“I think that's totally impossible,” he added.

A thick layer of more than 12 miles of rock may explain why Bermuda seems to float above the surrounding ocean.

Move aside, Bermuda Triangle: The newest North Atlantic mystery lies beneath this enigmatic archipelago. Scientists have discovered a strange, 12.4-mile-thick (20 kilometers) rock layer below the oceanic crust under Bermuda. This level of thickness has never been seen in any other similar layer worldwide.

"Typically, you have the bottom of the oceanic crust and then it would be expected to be the mantle," said study lead author William Frazer, a seismologist at Carnegie Science in Washington D.C. "But in Bermuda, there is this other layer that is emplaced beneath the crust, within the tectonic plate that Bermuda sits on."

While the origin of this layer is not entirely clear, it may explain an ongoing mystery about Bermuda, Frazer told Live Science. The island sits on an oceanic swell, where the ocean crust is higher than its surroundings. But there is no evidence of any ongoing volcanic activity creating that swell — the island's last known volcanic eruption was 31 million years ago.

The discovery of the new giant "structure" suggests the last eruption may have injected mantle rock into the crust, where it froze in place, creating something like a raft that raises the ocean floor by about 1,640 feet (500 meters).

Bermuda has long had a reputation for mystery, largely because of the Bermuda Triangle, an area between the archipelago, Florida and Puerto Rico where a supposedly unusual number of ships and aircraft have gone missing. (This reputation, however, has been largely exaggerated.) The real mystery, though, is why the Bermuda oceanic swell exists.

Island chains such as Hawaii are thought to exist because of mantle hotspots, which are places in the mantle where hot material rises, creating volcanic activity. At the point where the hotspot meets the crust, the ocean floor often buoys up. But when tectonic movement slides the crust away from that hotspot, the oceanic swell typically subsides.

Bermuda's swell hasn't subsided, despite 31 million years of volcanic inactivity there, Frazer said. There is some debate over what's happening in the mantle beneath the island, but there are no eruptions happening at the surface.

Frazer and study co-author Jeffrey Park, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Yale University, used recordings from a seismic station on Bermuda of distant large earthquakes around the world to get an image of Earth down to about 31 miles (50 km) below Bermuda. They examined places where the seismic waves from these quakes suddenly changed. This revealed the unusually thick layer of rock, which is less dense than the other rock around it.

Their findings were published Nov. 28 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

"There is still this material that is left over from the days of active volcanism under Bermuda that is helping to potentially hold it up as this area of high relief in the Atlantic Ocean," Sarah Mazza, a geologist at Smith College in Massachusetts who was not involved in the work, told Live Science.

Mazza's own research into Bermuda's volcanic history found that the types of lavas there are low in the mineral silica, which is a sign that they come from rock high in carbon. Mazza's examination of variations in zinc molecules in samples from Bermuda, published in September in the journal Geology, found that this carbon comes from deep in the mantle. It was likely first pushed there when the supercontinent Pangea formed between 900 million and 300 million years ago, Mazza said. This is different from what is seen at hotspot-formed islands in the Pacific or Indian oceans, she added. This difference may be because the Atlantic, which opened up when Pangea split apart, is a young ocean compared to the Pacific or Indian oceans, which were at Pangea's edges.

— Mysterious 'blobs' in Earth's mantle are not what we thought, study claims

— Extreme 'paradise' volcano in Costa Rica is like a piece of ancient Mars on our doorstep

"The fact that we are in an area that was previously the heart of the last supercontinent is, I think, part of the story of why this is unique," she said.

Frazer is now examining other islands around the world to find out if there are any similar layers to the one found under Bermuda, or whether the archipelago is truly one of a kind.

"Understanding a place like Bermuda, which is an extreme location, is important to understand places that are less extreme," Frazer said, "and gives us a sense of what are the more normal processes that happen on Earth and what are the more extreme processes that happen."

We have officially entered the conspiracy theory phase of the Philadelphia Eagles season, and honestly, it was only a matter of time. When a team loses three straight games, all of them as favorites, the brain starts reaching for explanations that go beyond missed throws and bad turnovers.

That is how we ended up here, with fans squinting at HBO's Hard Knocks like it is the Zapruder film. Is it convenient that Hard Knocks shows up right when the Eagles looked like they had the NFC East wrapped up and then everything immediately goes sideways? Sure.

Does that mean the league, HBO, and the football gods got together to sabotage the offense? No. After the past few weeks, I understand why people are at least entertaining the thought.

Angry fanbase, star quarterback struggling, offense sputtering, and a weekly primetime microscope courtesy of HBO. ESPN, HBO, and every rage bait outlet in existence is eating this up.

What they fail to realize is that Birds fans are sports psychopaths in the most affectionate sense. We will consume every clip, every rumor, and every half baked theory no matter how ridiculous it is.

After the we crushed the Chiefs in the Super Bowl, this franchise felt like it was becoming the gold standard of the NFL. That made a lot of people uncomfortable. For whatever reason, everyone outside Philadelphia hates the Eagles.

Maybe it is the fans. Maybe it is Jalen Hurts being different than the traditional quarterback mold. Maybe it is Nick Sirianni. I truly do not care. The hate is real, and it always has been.

That is why the Hard Knocks discourse has taken off the way it has. People are watching because the Birds are struggling, not because the league is scripted. If the NFL were scripted, the Chiefs would have already three-peated and we would not even be having this conversation.

Just when you thought it couldn't possibly get any worse, Spike Eskin proposes an ‘Eagles Positivity Pledge' against the Raiders on Sunday which includes standing ovations and no booing >>

At some point, the conspiracy theories stop being fun and start becoming a distraction. We are there now. The mental gymnastics are exhausting. The Eagles are not losing because of cameras, producers, or a hidden agenda. They are losing because they are playing bad football and beating themselves.

The solution is simple. Go out on Sunday, crush the Raiders, and get this thing back on track. Win games and the noise dies down. Win games and Hard Knocks is forced to show the Eagles doing what they do best. Winning.

Enough talk. Beat the Raiders, stabilize the season, and let the rest sort itself out.

Grab a seat in the Impala, buckle up, and enjoy the ride because the Winchesters are back — kind of. In case you missed it, the demon-hunting siblings of Supernatural recently made their return a full 20 years after the debut of the hit series by way of a new comic series. Written by Greg Pak and illustrated by Eder Messias, the first issue hit shelves back in October with the third installment slated for an arrival on December 17. The best part about the new project is that it carries fans back to the glory days of yesteryear as it takes place between the first and second seasons of the TV show when it was just two brothers fighting the forces of evil with their beloved Impala by their side.

The latest to come from the folks at Dynamite, the Supernatural comic returns fans to that sweet spot and takes them along with Sam and Dean while they travel from one American town to the next in search of monsters. Many fans would agree that the first five seasons of the Eric Kripke-created teen drama were the best of the batch and this new, more colorful version sticks to what made the show great in the first place. For those out there who are ready to reconnect with the Winchester brothers, but aren't quite sure they can do a 15-season rewatch, the first few issues are precisely what the doctor ordered.

In the last five years since the fan-favorite series came to an end, fans have questioned whether this was truly the last time that we'd see Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki as Dean and Sam Winchester, respectively. In that time, the pair have joined with several other cast mates to travel around the world and meet fans at special Supernatural conventions, which has certainly kept the hope alive. Right now, both leading men are incredibly busy with their own projects and hustles, but there is still a chance that the gang will get back together again, it just might look a little bit different. While celebrating the pilot's 20 year anniversary, Ackles said, “We're all a lot older than we were 20 years ago. I don't know if I have 22 episodes of Supernatural in me. I think a limited series would be great.”

For now, audiences can continue the story by going back in time to the golden era of Supernatural with Dynamite's new comic series.

Research led by Julia Aspernäs (Linköping University)

Conservatives are more likely than liberals to believe conspiracy theories and share fake science news. But when it comes to bending the truth to support their political team, both sides do it equally.

That's the key finding from a large Swedish study that tracked how people across the political spectrum responded to different types of misinformation. Across three studies with samples of 1,005 (Sweden), 417 (U.K.), and 1,008 (Sweden) — with one Swedish sample analyzed in two separate papers — the research offers a more nuanced picture than the usual “one side is worse” narrative that dominates debates about fake news.

Author Julia Aspernäs, from the Department of Behavioural Sciences and Learning at Linköping University in Sweden, found evidence of both symmetries and asymmetries in misinformation susceptibility. It all depends on what type of misinformation you're looking at.

When researchers asked people about conspiracy theories, like whether the science behind global warming has been invented or distorted, or whether experiments with new drugs are routinely carried out on the public without their knowledge or consent, conservatives consistently believed them more often than liberals. This pattern held up even after accounting for other factors like education level and thinking styles.

The gap extended to sharing behavior too. When participants encountered scientific results in a fictional social media scenario covering controversial topics like gender differences, organized crime, and unemployment, conservatives reported higher willingness to post misleading summaries that twisted the research to match their views.

Aspernäs also tested whether people could spot flawed logic in political arguments. They created puzzles where participants had to figure out if a conclusion actually followed from the evidence presented—like a detective checking if the clues really point to the suspect.

Some arguments had conservative conclusions. Others had liberal ones. The trick was that participants were told to ignore whether they agreed with the content and just check if the logic worked.

Both liberals and conservatives failed this test in the same way. When an argument supported their political views, they'd often accept it even when the logic was broken. When an argument opposed their views, they'd reject it even when the reasoning was sound.

A conservative might nod along to a logically flawed argument for tax cuts. A liberal might do the same for a poorly reasoned argument about wealth inequality. Neither side was better at catching their own bias.

This matters because it suggests that when people have skin in the game politically, they bend facts at similar rates regardless of ideology.

One trait did protect people from some types of misinformation: taking time to think things through rather than going with gut instinct.

Aspernäs tested this with trick questions. Here's an example: “A bat and a ball cost 110 kronor total. The bat costs 100 kronor more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?”

Most people immediately think “10 kronor.” But if you pause and work it out, the answer is actually 5 kronor.

People who caught these tricks were better at spotting logical flaws in political arguments, whether conservative or liberal. Slowing down and double-checking your instincts appeared to help people resist at least some forms of bias.

But analytical thinking wasn't a cure-all. It helped with logic puzzles but didn't stop people from believing conspiracy theories or sharing misleading science posts. Something else was going on there.

Aspernäs uncovered another factor that has been almost completely neglected in misinformation research: what people believe about truth itself.

Some people lean toward thinking truth is objective: either the earth is round or it isn't, regardless of anyone's opinion. Others lean toward thinking truth is personal or subjective. Someone with strong subjectivist beliefs might agree that “truth is nothing more than a person's subjective experience of the world.”

People with stronger subjectivist beliefs about truth were more likely to fall for impressive-sounding nonsense, believe conspiracy theories, and report willingness to share fake science news. This held true across the political spectrum. It wasn't that conservatives believed truth was more subjective, they just happened to believe more conspiracy theories for other reasons.

This finding points to a deeper vulnerability than political bias. If someone thinks truth depends on personal feelings rather than evidence, they may be more susceptible to misinformation that triggers the right emotions, regardless of facts.

The study doesn't fully explain why conservatives show higher rates of conspiracy belief. It's not that they're worse at analytical thinking or more biased in general; the research found them similar to liberals on those dimensions.

One possibility is that conservative ideology attracts people with certain personality traits, like stronger distrust of institutions, that also make conspiracy theories more appealing. Another is that right now, many popular conspiracy theories happen to align with conservative narratives, though this wouldn't explain why the pattern shows up even with politically neutral conspiracies.

Aspernäs stresses that the findings describe group averages, not individuals. Plenty of conservatives reject conspiracy theories completely. Plenty of liberals believe them. The differences, while real, are modest.

Both sides engage in motivated reasoning when their political identity is threatened. But conservatives show an additional vulnerability to conspiracy thinking and science misinformation that appears separate from this bias.

This creates a challenge for fighting fake news. Different problems need different solutions. Teaching people to check their logic might help with motivated reasoning. But conspiracy beliefs might require addressing deeper issues about trust in institutions. And if someone fundamentally believes truth is subjective, fact-checking might not work at all.

It's worth noting that the study was conducted in Sweden and the United Kingdom, where the political landscape differs from the United States. American conservatives might show different patterns than Swedish or British ones. But the finding that misinformation susceptibility isn't one-dimensional — that people can be resistant to some types while vulnerable to others — likely applies across cultures.

Perhaps the biggest takeaway is this: accusations that “the other side” is uniquely prone to fake news miss the mark. Everyone has vulnerabilities. They just show up in different ways depending on what you're measuring.

The research used online surveys where people reported their own beliefs and stated willingness rather than tracking actual behavior. People may not always accurately report what they believe, or their survey responses might not match how they'd act in real situations. The science misinformation measure used hypothetical social media scenarios rather than observing what people actually share online.

One study asked participants to evaluate logical arguments but instructed them not to think too long before answering, which might have accidentally encouraged snap judgments over careful reasoning. An attempt to experimentally manipulate people's beliefs about truth was unsuccessful, preventing conclusions about whether believing truth is subjective actually causes greater susceptibility to misinformation.

All participants came from Sweden or the United Kingdom. Patterns might differ in other countries with different political cultures and media environments.

Thanks to Dynamite, Dean and Sam Winchester have officially returned to Supernatural for a Season 1.5, and yes, this is a canonical return. With the brothers back to small-town monster hunting, the only Supernatural sequel worth making just became more likely: a spinoff that explores Adam's time in Hell.

For those out of the loop, Sam and Dean have returned to the Golden Era of Supernatural in Greg Pak & Eder Messias' Supernatural comic series, set between Seasons 1 and 2 of the TV show.

Part of the official canon, the series returns to the beloved “monster-of-the-week” format. Two issues have been released so far, with Supernatural #3 hitting comic shelves on December 17, 2025. So why does this series make a sequel more likely than ever?

The fact that the Supernatural franchise is once again dipping its toes into comics makes it more likely that this universe will continue to be explored in this format. With Dynamite's Supernatural taking place between Seasons 1 and 2, it's clear the publisher is interested in expanding lore directly connected to the TV series.

Dynamite could truly capitalize on building a comic empire for the Supernatural franchise. If they do, a sequel exploring Adam's time in Hell should be a top priority. Fans have long been curious about the “forgotten Winchester” brother, and now is the perfect opportunity for the comics to explore this previously untold, yet canon, part of the TV series.

For those needing a quick refresher, Adam Milligan was Sam and Dean Winchester's half-brother, introduced in Season 4, Episode 19, “Jump the Shark.” The brothers didn't know he existed until they investigated a case that ended with the discovery that Adam and his mother had been killed by a ghoul.

Adam was eventually resurrected by angels to serve as a temporary vessel for the archangel Michael in the Season 5 finale after Dean refused. However, Michael/Adam falls into Lucifer's Cage along with Sam. While Sam is rescued from Hell the following season, Adam remains trapped, and the fact that he was essentially forgotten has long been a running joke among fans.

Adam is ultimately remembered in Season 15. After a decade trapped in the Cage, he is freed, sharing his body with Michael and switching control with him. When Chuck kills Michael, Adam's soul survives, with the show implying that he finally finds peace, closing a wild chapter in the Winchester saga.

While the show eventually tied up Adam's story, fans were never shown his time in Hell with Michael. With Supernatural returning for Season 1.5 through Dynamite, it would be beyond epic if a spin-off series explored Adam and Michael's full story in Hell, finally giving fans the long-awaited exploration of the “forgotten Winchester” brother's untold journey.

More than seven decades after a mysterious series of light flashes were captured in California's night sky, scientists are still debating what they mean. Two new peer-reviewed papers suggest that thousands of unexplained bursts recorded by the historic Palomar telescope might be linked to Cold War nuclear tests and even UFO sightings — a claim that's igniting controversy in the scientific community.

Back in the early 1950s, astronomers at Palomar Observatory photographed multiple star-like flashes that appeared and vanished within an hour — long before the launch of the first satellite, Sputnik 1. Now, researchers have reanalyzed those vintage sky plates and discovered that many of the transients — brief, glowing points of light — occurred on or near the dates of nuclear weapons tests. They also coincided with a sharp rise in reported UFO sightings. Could that timing be more than coincidence?

While random meteors, variable stars, or camera glitches could explain some flashes, several of the Palomar events display unusual traits — sharp, bright points seemingly aligned in straight lines — that don't match any known natural or technical causes.

“We've ruled out some of the ordinary explanations, which means we have to at least consider that these might be artificial objects,” said co-author Bruehl, an anesthesiologist at Vanderbilt University with a keen interest in UFO research. Bruehl worked alongside Beatriz Villarroel, an astronomer at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in Sweden.

“If these transients are reflective objects orbiting Earth — and they predate Sputnik — who put them there? And why do they seem connected to nuclear testing?” Bruehl asked.

But not everyone is convinced. Michael Garrett, director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at the University of Manchester, praised Villarroel's creative approach but cautioned that the quality of mid-century data makes firm conclusions risky. “Before Sputnik, the data are patchy at best,” he said. “Even the UFO, or UAP, reports from that era are anecdotal and haven't been verified for accuracy.”

Garrett added that while the scientific method is the right tool for exploring such mysteries, it requires “time, replication, and patience.” His hunch? “With better data, those correlations would likely vanish.”

Today, transient light events are well-known in astronomy. Modern observatories — from California's Zwicky Transient Facility to Hawaii's Pan-STARRS — regularly detect thousands of short-lived flashes in the sky. And the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to find millions each night within the next decade.

Most of these transients are tied to known cosmic events: eruptions from comets and asteroids, exploding stars, flickering black holes, or neutron star mergers that create brilliant kilonova bursts.

For now, though, the Palomar flashes remain an open question — a relic of early astronomy that continues to intrigue scientists and fuel speculation about what might really be shining, and vanishing, above us.

The man who has staked his reputation—and billions of pounds—on turning humanity into an interplanetary species has a surprising secret: he doesn't believe in aliens. Elon Musk may be determined to colonise Mars, but when it comes to Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) buzzing Earth's atmosphere, the world's richest man is convinced they have nothing to do with little green men and everything to do with weapons programmes right here on our planet.

This startling dichotomy—the audacious visionary versus the grounded sceptic—was laid bare during his recent appearance on Katie Miller's podcast, where he offered a definitive dismissal of extraterrestrial life visiting Earth. It's a claim that carries considerable weight, given that Musk is, arguably, the person most likely to be tipped off to any cosmic secrets, running the company responsible for more civilian space launches than anyone else.

'I have seen no evidence of aliens,' Musk told Miller, before addressing the notion that a major player like SpaceX might be withholding cosmic knowledge. He confirmed he had directly questioned his highest-level staff. 'No one on the SpaceX senior team has any evidence of aliens. Because I've asked the team, "Guys, am I missing something? Has anyone on the team – has anyone seen any evidence of aliens?"'

This is a promise the fifty-four-year-old billionaire has made before, explicitly stating during a previous interview with Joe Rogan that he is not part of some global celestial cover-up. If any evidence of non-human intelligence were to cross his desk, the public, he insists, would be the first to know.

'I was aware of any evidence of aliens, Joe, you have my word. I will come on your show, and I will reveal it on the show,' he had guaranteed the popular podcast host.

Yet, his dismissal of aliens pivots directly into a far more worrying theory when discussing the prevalence of UFO sightings. For Musk, these mysterious objects aren't vehicles from another star system, but rather terrestrial prototypes developed by governments right here on Earth, likely the US government. His assessment is cold, cynical, and centred firmly on national security, suggesting these are not interstellar explorers but rather advanced military hardware.

'UFOs... it could be like a new weapons programme... or hypersonic missiles. It's just basically a weapons prototype. It's not aliens.'

While he is a sceptic of external threats, Musk remains committed to solving what he views as humanity's greatest existential weakness: having all our eggs in one planetary basket. The solution, he says, is Mars.

Despite the scepticism surrounding the ambitious timelines and technical challenges, Musk has consistently reiterated his goal to turn the Red Planet into a second home. Earlier this year, the entrepreneur claimed there would be a self-sustaining city on Mars in 20 years. He is targeting 2028 for the launch of an unmanned Starship mission, with a crewed flight likely to follow in 2030.

This timeline, however, is subject to the notoriously fluid realities of space engineering, a fact Musk himself acknowledged when discussing the possibility of putting his Optimus robot on the planet. Responding to an X user who asked about the schedule, the billionaire gave a highly detailed, if cautious, projection.

'Slight chance of Starship flight to Mars crewed by Optimus in Nov/Dec next year. A lot needs to go right for that. More likely, first flight without humans in ~3.5 years, next flight ~5.5 years with humans,' he wrote. Regardless of the slight shifts, the ultimate goal remains fixed: the creation of a Martian colony. He later affirmed that Mars will have a 'self-sustaining city in 20 to 30 years.'

Musk's vision for planetary redundancy, however, comes with a terrifying potential consequence for the first generation of true Martians—a consequence that has been scrutinised by the scientific community. Biologist Scott Solomon has previously argued that human colonisation of Mars could 'kill humanity,' suggesting the living conditions would be so 'brutal' that they would spark rapid, catastrophic evolutionary changes.

In his book, Future Humans, the author predicted that children born to Mars settlers would endure drastic evolutionary changes, a process that could result in them developing 'brittle bones,' 'weaker muscles,' and a 'freakishly green colouring' due to the unforgiving combination of low gravity and high radiation. Other predicted mutations include an inevitable change in skin colour and a resulting loss of eyesight.

Musk's refusal to accept the possibility of advanced alien life visiting Earth stands in stark contrast to his readiness to embrace a future where our own species mutates beyond recognition. It presents a high-stakes, deeply compelling choice: to remain on Earth, facing the perceived dangers of covert government weapons programmes, or to flee to Mars, and risk turning into something entirely new.

The future, according to Elon Musk, holds no little green men, only the terrifying spectre of clandestine, hyper-advanced weaponry on Earth, or a biological mutation lottery on Mars. As humanity stands on the cusp of an interstellar jump, the real question is not if we will survive, but what we will become.
