                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intel shares rose about 6% on Friday after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is poised to announce that the U.S. government will take an equity stake in the struggling chipmaker. "They've agreed to do it and I think it's a great deal for them," Trump told reporters Friday at the White House White House official told CNBC that there will be "ongoing discussions" with Intel, adding that nothing has been decided yet and that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan hasn't explicitly agreed to a deal. President Trump and Tan will be meeting later this afternoon. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC this week that the U.S. government was seeking an equity stake in Intel in exchange for CHIPS Act funds. We'll get equity in return for it." Lutnick said that the government's stake would be "nonvoting." Earlier this week, Intel announced another major backer, when SoftBank said it would make a $2 billion investment in the chipmaker, equal to about 2% of the company. Intel is the only American company capable of making the most advanced chips on U.S. shores, although its technology is seen as lagging Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which makes chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD, and even Intel. Intel has been spending billions of dollars to build a series of chip factories in Ohio, an area the company previously called the "Silicon Heartland," where Intel would be able to produce the most advanced chips, including for AI. But in July, Tan said in a memo to employees that there would be "no more blank checks," and that it was slowing down the construction of its Ohio factory complex, depending on market conditions. Intel's Ohio factory is now scheduled to start operations in 2030. Intel said last fall that it had finalized a nearly $8 billion grant under the CHIPS and Science Act to fund its factory-building plans. â€” CNBC's David Sucherman contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The law enforcement investigation of former Trump national security advisor John Bolton is "in the very early stages," Vice President JD Vance said on the heels of the FBI's raid of Bolton's Maryland home on Friday morning. Vance, in a new interview with NBC News' Kristen Welker, said that classified documents are "certainly part of" that probe, but that "there's a broad concern about Ambassador Bolton." Bolton is not being targeted because of his criticism of President Donald Trump, Vance told Welker in the interview, set to air Sunday on "Meet the Press." "If we were trying to do that, we would just throw out prosecutions willy-nilly, like the Biden administration [Department of Justice] did," he said. Bolton served as Trump's national security advisor from April 2018 through September 2019. "I will say we're going to let that investigation proceed," Vance said. "What I can tell you is that, unlike the Biden DOJ and the Biden FBI, our law enforcement agencies are going to be driven by law and not by politics," Vance said. "And so, if we think that Ambassador Bolton has committed a crime, of course, eventually prosecutions will come," the vice president said. "This is all part of gathering evidence, trying to understand something that we're worried about." Trump told reporters Friday morning that he was unaware of the raid on Bolton's home until he saw it reported on television. NBC News reported earlier Friday that the investigation of Bolton is eyeing multiple instances of the use of classified documents in leaks to the news media. The investigation began during the Biden administration but was dropped by the Justice Department at some point before President Joe Biden left office in January, NBC reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender is leaving the Trump administration less than five months after being confirmed by the Senate, the Treasury Department said. Faulkender is the second Senate-confirmed official to leave the Treasury Department this month, following the departure of IRS Commissioner Billy Long, who said he was being tapped as ambassador to Iceland. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent thanked Faulkender for his work at the department but gave no reason for his departure. "Since January, he has played a critical role in overseeing the U.S. Department of the Treasury's operations and executing on President Trump's bold economic agenda," Bessent said in a statement. "His important work has supported the passage of the historic One Big Beautiful Bill and GENIUS Act, and the leveling of sanctions against our adversaries." Trump nominated Faulkender, a University of Maryland finance professor, in December to serve as the No. 2 official at Treasury, where he had been assistant secretary of economic policy during Trump's first term. At the end of the first Trump administration, Faulkender had returned to the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business, where he has been a finance professor since 2008. He had also served as the chief economist for two years at the America First Policy Institute, conservative think tank that has helped shape Trump's policy agenda. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kimbal Musk, the younger brother of the world's wealthiest person, said Elon Musk "deserves to be paid," as Tesla remains locked in a legal saga over its CEO's pay package. "I think my brother deserves to be paid," Kimbal Musk said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday. "He has zero pay for the past six to eight years. Elon Musk isn't paid a salary or any cash bonuses at Tesla. He is compensated through "performance awards" of valuable stock options that are granted based on Tesla hitting certain milestones. Earlier this month, Tesla granted Elon Musk an "interim" pay package of 96 million shares, which would be worth about $29 billion. The pay plan was approved by a "special committee" of the Tesla board, with Elon Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves, board members Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson said in an Aug. 4 letter to shareholders. The award came after a Delaware judge in December ordered Tesla to revoke Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package from 2018, which was the largest compensation plan in U.S. history for a public company executive. Before the Delaware ruling on his 2018 pay plan, in January 2024, Musk said he wanted even more pay and control of Tesla in a post on X, which was formerly known as Twitter. "I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control," Musk wrote at the time. Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla." He was already building products outside of Tesla, including at his newest artificial intelligence venture, xAI, which was formed in Nevada in March 2023. The new pay package was granted to Musk without a shareholder vote, and will only apply if Musk and Tesla lose on appeal in Delaware. An investment group that works with pension funds, the SOC Investment Group, sent a letter this week to Nasdaq asking them to investigate Tesla, saying its board should have attained shareholder approval for the new package under Nasdaq listing policies. In an August letter to shareholders announcing the interim pay package, Tesla board members Denholm and Wilson-Thompson wrote that the special committee is working to "address a longer-term CEO compensation strategy," which it plans to put to a shareholder vote at Tesla's upcoming annual meeting in November. -- CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Friday he will fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she does not resign from her position. "What she did was bad," the president told reporters who asked about Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden who has come under fire from the Trump administration over allegations about her mortgages. "So I'll fire her if she doesn't resign," he said during a surprise visit to The People's House, a museum of the White House. Two of the seven current governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, are Trump appointees. Both dissented from the Fed's most recent decision to hold interest rates steady. Another seat opened up earlier this summer, when Adriana Kugler announced she would step down. If Trump is able to remove Cook, he would appoint her successor â€” potentially ensuring that a majority of the board shares his view on monetary policy. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte this week publicly accused Cook of mortgage fraud related to claims that she took two different properties as her primary residence at the same time. He sent a criminal referral to the Department of Justice, which revealed Thursday that it will investigate Cook. Pulte, a vocal critic of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who has aggressively backed Trump's calls for the central bank to lower interest rates, has continuously attacked Cook on social media since revealing his allegations. Trump previously called for Cook to resign immediately in light of the allegations. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in an X post Friday that Trump is targeting Cook because he is "trying to find a scapegoat for his failure to lower costs for Americans." Cook said Wednesday that she has "no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet." "I learned from the media that FHFA Director William Pulte posted on social media that he was making a criminal referral based on a mortgage application from four years ago, before I joined the Federal Reserve," Cook said in a statement. "I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts," she said. Trump's comments Friday morning came as Powell signaled that economic conditions "may warrant" interest rate cuts. While the economy and labor market remain resilient, downside risks are rising and growth is declining â€” and Trump's tariffs are once again raising inflation concerns, Powell said at the Fed's annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday gave a tepid indication of possible interest rate cuts ahead as he noted a high level of uncertainty that is making the job difficult for monetary policymakers. While he noted that the labor market remains in good shape and the economy has shown "resilience," he said downside dangers are rising. At the same time, he said tariffs are causing risks that inflation could rise again â€” a stagflation scenario that the Fed needs to avoid. With the Fed's benchmark interest rate a full percentage point below where it was when Powell delivered his keynote a year ago, and the unemployment rate still low, conditions allow "us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance," Powell said. "Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance," he added. That was as close as he came during the speech to endorsing a rate cut that Wall Street widely believes is coming when the Federal Open Market Committee next meets Sept. 16-17. However, the remarks were enough to send stocks soaring and Treasury yields tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a gain of more than 600 points following the public release of Powell's speech while the policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury note saw a 0.08 percentage point fall to around 3.71%. In addition to market expectations, President Donald Trump has demanded aggressive cuts from the Fed in scathing public attacks he has lobbed at Powell and his colleagues. The Fed has held its benchmark borrowing rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5% since December. Policymakers have continued to cite the uncertain impact that tariffs will have on inflation as a reason for caution and believe that current economic conditions and the slightly restrictive policy stance allow for time to make further decisions. We will never deviate from that approach," he said. The speech comes amid ongoing negotiations between the White House and its global trading partners, a situation often in flux and without clarity on where it will end. Recent indicators show consumer prices gradually pushing higher but wholesale costs up more rapidly. Powell's position in the speech was that a range of outcomes is possible, with a "reasonable base case" being that the tariff impacts will be "short lived â€” a one-time shift in the price level" that likely would not be cause for holding rates higher. However, he said nothing is certain at this point. "It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks," Powell said. "Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process." At that time, in the midst of the Covid pandemic, the Fed switched to a "flexible average inflation targeting" regime that effectively would allow inflation to run higher than the central bank's 2% goal coming after a prolonged period of holding below that level. The upshot is that policymakers could be patient with slightly higher inflation if it meant insuring a more comprehensive labor market recovery. However, shortly after adopting the strategy, inflation began to climb, ultimately hitting 40-year highs, while policymakers largely dismissed the rise as "transitory" and not needing rate hikes. "As it turned out, the idea of an intentional, moderate inflation overshoot had proved irrelevant. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our 2020 changes to the consensus statement, as I acknowledged publicly in 2021," Powell said. There have been critics on both sides of the issue, with some suggesting the rate is too high and can lead to a weaker dollar, while others seeing a need for the central bank to be flexible. "We believe that our commitment to this target is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored," Powell said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Waymo is getting one step closer to rides in New York City. The Alphabet autonomous vehicle subsidiary received its first permit from the New York Department of Transportation on Friday to start testing in New York City, Mayor Eric Adams announced Friday. Waymo will start testing up to eight vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September with the potential to extend the program. New York state law requires the company to have a driver behind the wheel to operate. "We're a tech-friendly administration and we're always looking for innovative ways to safely move our city forward," Adams said in a release. "New York City is proud to welcome Waymo to test this new technology in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as we know this testing is only the first step in moving our city further into the 21st century." Waymo has hit expansion mode on its services nationwide, launching in Austin this year and expanding its San Francisco area operations in March. Waymo also plans to bring autonomous vehicles to Atlanta, Miami and Washington, D.C. and recently said it will start operations in Philadelphia as it looks to break further into the Northeast market. Waymo's CEO said the company surpassed 10 million robotaxi trips in May. For years, autonomous vehicle companies have sought to introduce their technology to The Big Apple, with Waymo previously taking a crack at it in 2021. At that time, the company rolled out some cars in certain areas of the city for manual driving and data collection. Last year, the Adams administration implemented a series of safety requirements for responsible testing in the city and opened a permit program.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase prides itself on "remote-first" work, but CEO Brian Armstrong said the company was forced to make changes to thwart a foe: North Korea. Coinbase works with law enforcement, but Armstrong said the threat just keeps growing. "It feels like there's 500 new people graduating every quarter from some kind of school they have â€” that's just their whole job," Armstrong told John Collison, cofounder and president of online payment provider Stripe, in an episode of Collison's "Cheeky Pint" podcast posted on Wednesday. Last month, the FBI put out an updated warning about North Korean IT workers who target private companies "to illicitly generate substantial revenue for the regime." The FBI said US-based facilitators have reshipped company laptops, attended virtual interviews on behalf of North Korean workers, and even created front businesses. Armstrong said that in many cases, workers themselves might be a target and are being coerced to participate. He said that Coinbase requires prospective employees to turn on their camera during interviews "to prove they're not AI" or not being coached. Ultimately, Armstrong said that security risks have led Coinbase to build up US-based customer support, pointing to the company's new facility in Charlotte, North Carolina. "It feels like proof of physical presence is going to be become a bigger deal in a world of AI, deepfakes, just higher stakes for all this kind of cyber crime stuff where in a weird way you see certain areas where remote work goes backwards," Collison said. Part of the way Coinbase deters this, Armstrong said, is by locking down the information employees have access to. "And we try to make it very clear that you're destroying the rest of your life by taking this, even if you think, whatever, it is a life-changing amount of money, it's not worth going to jail."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla is once again in the crosshairs of federal regulators. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Wednesday that it is investigating allegations that Tesla is not correctly reporting crashes involving its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems. In the probe notice, the NHTSA said that car companies are required to report crashes involving autonomous or advanced driver assistance systems within five days of being notified of them. The NHTSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dan O'Dowd, founder of The Dawn Project, a tech safety advocacy group, pointed out to Business Insider that according to Tesla's crash-counting methodology listed on its website, the company only counts crashes involving airbag deployments and if Autopilot was engaged within five seconds before the crash. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In 2022, the NHTSA said it was investigating Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y vehicles over an alleged phenomenon known as "phantom braking," which is when the vehicle suddenly slams on the brakes for no reason, often at high speeds. In 2020, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on what was then Twitter that phantom braking would be fixed in a coming software update, but he has not commented further since then. Another lawsuit brought by California's Department of Motor Vehicles alleges that Tesla's use of language in advertising Autopilot and FSD has misled consumers into thinking the vehicles are more autonomous than they really are. The case could see Tesla's right to sell in California suspended for at least 30 days. Attorney Matthew Benedetto, a member of Tesla's legal team, denied the allegations and told an administrative judge last month that the company informed customers that they "cannot fully rely" on FSD or Autopilot.</p>
