            Multiple fatalities and injuries, including children, were reported Friday after a tour bus with about 50 passengers headed back to New York City from Niagara Falls crashed into a ditch, state police said.
    


            The bus rolled over after losing control for “unknown reasons,” New York State Police spokesperson James O'Callaghan said at a news conference.
    


            Several people were entrapped and others were ejected from the bus, O'Callaghan said. Authorities are actively responding to the crash scene and “a lot” of rescues are still ongoing, noting some people who are entrapped may still be alive.
    


            “We believe there is a child that is a fatality,” he said.
    


            Translators are also coming to assist police as most of the people on the tour bus were Indian, Chinese and Filipino, O'Callaghan said.
    


            A list of the passengers provided by the bus company confirms there were 52 people on board, including the driver, police said in a statement.
    


            The accident took place along Interstate 90 eastbound near the town of Pembroke, east of Buffalo, New York, a state police spokesperson said in a statement. The state Thruway is currently closed in both directions near the crash site, state police say.
    


            Helicopters, ambulances and law enforcement swarmed the crash site, where the bus was seen on its side with many people gathered around it.
    


            The state's department of transportation is trying to help people get off the interstate as some remain stranded due to the incident, O'Callaghan said.
    


            “It's a very volatile scene. We have vehicles going the wrong way on the 90,” he said.
    


            Victims are being taken to the Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York, O'Callaghan said.
    


            New York Gov. Kathy Hochul described the crash as “tragic” and said first responders are “working to rescue and provide assistance to everyone involved” in a post on X.

“Our public health system is weaker than ever before,” said the union representing CDC workers.

Hundreds of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) employees are losing their jobs after a federal judge ruled on August 12 that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was barred from terminating employees at only six CDC divisions. The court's prior ruling had protected all CDC staff. 

The litigation stems from HHS Director Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.'s efforts to terminate thousands of HHS employees. In March, Kennedy announced that 10,000 of the department's workers would be laid off, including 2,400 staff from the CDC. Kennedy, who has long peddled health disinformation to the public, has made numerous false claims about vaccines, COVID-19, chronic diseases, and autism.

Shortly after the layoffs were announced, Kennedy said that some people were mistakenly terminated, like the team that worked on preventing lead poisoning, and would be asked back. Court orders prevented the remaining layoffs from taking effect, but the recent federal court's ruling cleared the way for at least 600 CDC employees to lose their jobs. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the union representing more than 2,000 CDC workers, said in a statement on Wednesday that, “Due to a staggering lack of transparency from HHS, AFGE Local 2883 has not received formal notice of which groups are being separated today so we can't even determine the full extent of everything being lost.”  

“However, we know that America is less safe, our public health system is weaker than ever before, and our workforce is less capable of responding to public health threats,” the union continued.

Of those being laid off, the union said: “Some of the offices and divisions now being separated include the very groups that have worked to keep everyone safe from violence and injuries; to track and respond to HIV outbreaks; to form and strengthen public health partnerships to promote immunization; to conduct research and control costly chronic diseases debilitating millions of Americans like Alzheimer's, Arthritis, oral health issues, and others.”

Among the CDC staff who lost their jobs were those who worked in violence prevention. The layoffs come after a gunman shot hundreds of rounds of bullets on the grounds of the CDC campus in Atlanta on August 8, killing DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose before he took his own life. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation found that the gunman “wanted to make the public aware of his public distrust of the vaccines.”

After the shooting, more than 750 former and current HHS staffers demanded that Kennedy stop spreading lies about vaccines. 

“The attack came amid growing mistrust in public institutions, driven by politicized rhetoric that has turned public health professionals from trusted experts into targets of villainization — and now, violence,” they wrote in a letter to Kennedy and members of Congress. “Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is complicit in dismantling America's public health infrastructure and endangering the nation's health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health information[.]”

Kennedy's “dangerous and deceitful statements and actions have contributed to the harassment and violence experienced by CDC staff,” the staffers went on.

In another statement released after the shooting, former CDC staff, including those who worked in the department's Division of Violence Prevention, called on public health leaders to “protect the people who protect the public. The safety of our communities, our colleagues and our country depends on it.”

“As former scientists and public health professionals in CDC's Division of Violence Prevention, our mission was to prevent this exact kind of harm,” they wrote. “The irony is devastating: the very experts trained to understand, interrupt and prevent this kind of violence were among those whose jobs were eliminated in the April 1 federal government reduction-in-force.”

Residents of steel communities say fence-line monitoring for dangerous air pollution must be mandatory.

A deadly explosion at a U.S. Steel coke plant near Pittsburgh has brought renewed attention to the steel industry's aging facilities. Steelworkers and community activists say the Trump administration has put their health at risk by delaying and potentially scrapping pollution monitoring rules meant to protect nearby neighborhoods from dangerous toxins released into the air by the nation's steel and coke plants.

On August 11, a massive explosion at U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works in Clairton, Pennsylvania, left two workers dead and sent at least 10 others to the hospital. It took rescuers hours to find workers still alive in the wreckage after the blast, which shook homes across a tight-knit steel mill community nestled along the Monongahela River valley. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation, but officials suspect a faulty valve and a fatal buildup of gas.

“I could physically feel my body shake. That's how loud it was and that's how alarming it was,” nearby resident Germaine Patterson told reporters on August 21.

U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works is considered the largest coke-producing operation in North America. Workers at the plant bake coal in massive ovens into coke, a hard, grey, porous, carbon-rich substance that is shipped on the river for use in the blast furnaces of plants that make iron and then steel. The facility has a long history of clean air violations and accidents, including an explosion in February that injured two workers, according to the Associated Press.  

Along with postponing the hazardous are toxin rules, President Donald Trump also recently approved the nearly $15 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel by the Japanese company Nippon Steel, raising hopes that new ownership could bring investments in new, cleaner steel-making technology that could reduce pollution in communities such as Clairton while preserving jobs residents have depended on for generations. However, the recent explosion is raising questions about whether Nippon Steel is willing to spend the money necessary to retrofit U.S. Steel's aging infrastructure.

Clairton Coke Works and other coke and steel facilities have a long record of violating the Clean Air Act, according to a report released this week by the Environmental Integrity Project. Over the past five years, the plant racked up $10.7 million in fines while state and federal regulators took 14 enforcement actions to hold the facility accountable to clean air laws.

A top pollutant of concern near coke facilities is benzene, a known carcinogen linked to cancer, anemia, and other health issues. At Clairton Coke Works, the highest six-month average concentration of benzene detected by a series of air monitors at the facility's fence line was nearly 26 micrograms per cubic meter — about eight times higher than is considered safe for public health.

Clairton Coke Works is not alone. One monitor at the ABC Coke plant in Alabama registered six-month average levels of benzene at the facility perimeter from 2022 to 2023 more than four times the recognized limit for protecting human health over the long term, according to the report. In 2023, the 20 steel mills and coke operations investigated in the report released as much carbon dioxide as 10.1 million cars driving for a year, along with nearly 2.4 million pounds of benzene, chromium, and other hazardous pollutants.

Jen Duggan, the executive director at the Environmental Integrity Project, said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data on emissions included in the report is self-reported by the industry, and people living near these facilities are likely exposed to much more pollution on a daily basis.

“These emissions are often the results of leaks in valves and other equipment and flaring … that are impossible to detect all of the time and often go underreported,” Duggan said at a press conference on August 21. “There is a significant difference between reported and actual emissions that communities downwind are breathing in.”

In 2024, the EPA under the Biden administration finalized regulations requiring coke facilities to install air monitors at the fence line to test for benzene blowing in the wind, and requiring steel mills to monitor for chromium, a toxic heavy metal linked to an array of health problems. If the levels of the toxins exceeded certain limits set by the EPA, the regulations would require operators to identify and fix the problem.

The regulations were a massive win for environmental justice activists and residents living near steel and coke facilities and were supposed to go into effect this year, but like a long list of other environmental, climate, and public health protections, the Trump administration recently delayed implementation of the rules on behalf of the industry and may scrap them altogether.

Qiyam Ansari, executive director of Valley Clean Air Now in Pennsylvania, said people living in Clairton and the heavily industrialized Mon Valley already live with some of the worst air quality in the nation. The benzene and chromium from the steel industry are major contributors to the “toxic burden our bodies carry,” he said. 

“It is absolutely having an effect on people, and that's why the fence-line monitoring is a bare minimum, so it will at least tell us what is out there and what we are suffering from and how to take precautions,” Ansari told Truthout.

Mandatory fence-line monitoring would also help environmental justice groups hold the industry and regulators accountable when aging facilities such as Clairton Coke Works consistently have problems. However, beyond rolling back environmental protections, the Trump administration is also slashing funding for government agencies that oversee polluting industries, including the EPA and U.S. Chemical Safety Board.

“Our elders deserve to breathe without fear that every day it shortens their lives,” Ansari said. “Fence-line monitoring is not optional. It is the bare minimum for justice.”

On August 6, just days before the Clairton Coke Works explosion, a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging its decision to delay compliance with the 2024 fence-line monitoring requirements. Duggan said similar requirements were successful in reducing toxic emissions from oil refineries. However, in 2023 Truthout reported that some older oil refineries in states with little oversight are still spewing pollution into nearby communities.

“The explosion last week is a warning that the cost of delay is too high, and I stand here to say that the community in Clairton valley is not disposable.” Duggan said.

Soldiers who had returned from Russia were honoured with a concert and relatives of troops killed in action were among those to attend a banquet

Kim Jong-un has hailed North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia in the war in Ukraine as “heroes”, at a ceremony to honour soldiers who recently returned from the conflict, state media said on Friday.

The North Korean leader said in a speech this week that his troops had displayed “fighting spirit of the heroes” during their operation to retake Russia's Kursk region from Ukrainian forces – which had established a foothold there last year – the state news agency KCNA said.

“The combat activities of overseas operational forces … proved without regret the power of the heroic [North Korean] army,” Kim said.

Kim laid a flower at a memorial for North Korean soldiers who had died overseas, while soldiers who had returned from Russia were honoured with a concert, KCNA said, adding that relatives of troops killed in action had been among those attending a banquet.

The events were the latest public show of gratitude by the regime in Pyongyang, in stark contrast to the secrecy that surrounded North Korea's role in the war when its troops were first sent to Russia last autumn.

Kim met officers of the army's overseas operation and paid tribute to North Korean soldiers killed in Ukraine. He said they had been assigned to carry out the “most important duty” and voiced “warm militant encouragement” to the commanders and troops, KCNA said.

The ceremony comes days after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, used similar language to pay tribute to North Korean troops sent to fight alongside Russian forces.

In a letter to Kim to mark the anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule in August 1945, Putin described North Korean troops as “heroic” and recalled how Soviet units and North Korean forces had also fought together to end Japan's occupation of the Korean peninsula.

“The bonds of militant friendship, goodwill and mutual aid which were consolidated in the days of the war long ago remain solid and reliable even today,” Putin said.

Russia and North Korea forged increasingly close military and diplomatic ties, triggering international concern that the North's troops are acquiring valuable combat experience that could one day be used against the country's neighbour, South Korea.

Kim and Putin signed a mutual defence pact last year, and in April this year, North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had deployed a contingent of soldiers to the frontline in Ukraine to fight alongside Russian troops.

Pyongyang sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia's Kursk region in 2024, according to South Korean and western intelligence agencies, along with artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket systems.

About 600 North Korean troops have been killed out of a total deployment of 15,000, South Korean lawmakers said in April, citing the South's intelligence agency.

This week's official tributes appeared to be intended to “justify the deployment and boost morale”, the South's Yonhap news agency quoted a unification ministry official as saying.

The concrete tomb they built to bury our revolution has become the very ground from which it grows. From behind these concrete walls and steel bars, where time moves differently and hope becomes a revolutionary act, I write to you about Black August — a month that prison administrators would rather see forgotten, but which burns eternal in the hearts of those who understand that freedom is not a privilege to be granted, but a right to be seized.

To understand why this resistance continues, we must first understand its origins. Black August, observed each August since 1979, commemorates the deaths of Black liberation fighters who died in prison. Particularly, Black August pays homage to Jonathan Jackson, who was killed on August 7, 1970, while attempting to liberate his brother George Jackson and other prisoners; and George Jackson himself, who was assassinated by guards at San Quentin on August 21, 1971. This month of remembrance and resistance was born from the recognition that the same forces that murdered our ancestors continue to operate within these walls, using solitary confinement as a weapon of psychological warfare against those who dare to organize, educate, and resist.

The tools of oppression have been passed down like heirlooms from one generation of torturers to the next. The iron fist of solitary confinement that crushes spirits today is the same instrument of torture that crushed George Jackson. It was during his seven and a half years in solitary confinement at San Quentin that George Jackson wrote, “The ultimate expression of law is not order — it's prison.” Jackson understood that solitary confinement was not merely punishment for rule infractions, but a deliberate strategy to break the will of those who possessed the audacity to challenge an inherently unjust system. His words echo through the RHU (Restrictive Housing Unit) cells where I have watched brilliant minds deteriorate, where individuals who dared to educate themselves and others about their conditions are buried alive for years, sometimes decades.

What George Jackson identified decades ago has only been perfected and expanded in our time. The conditions that created the necessity for Black August — the systematic dehumanization of Black bodies, the use of isolation as a tool of control, the denial of basic human dignity — have not only persisted but have been refined into a science of suffering that would make the architects of chattel slavery proud. Angela Davis, who spent months in solitary confinement before her 1972 acquittal, observed that “the prison has become a black hole into which the detritus of contemporary capitalism is deposited.” Nowhere is this more evident than in the modern solitary confinement units that house a disproportionate number of Black and Brown bodies.

The language may have changed, but the violence remains identical in its purpose and effect. The same racist logic that justified the slave plantation now justifies the concrete plantation, where isolation is sold as “administrative segregation” and psychological torture is rebranded as “protective custody.” I have witnessed adults who entered these units as teenagers emerge as broken shells of themselves, their minds fractured by years of sensory deprivation and social isolation. The continuity between the violence of slavery and the violence of solitary confinement is not metaphorical — it is literal, measurable, and intentional, designed to produce the same result: a population so traumatized and demoralized that resistance becomes unthinkable.

But the spirit that George Jackson embodied refuses to be crushed, no matter how sophisticated the machinery of oppression becomes. Resistance persists, because as Assata Shakur wrote, “It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win. We must love each other and support each other. We have nothing to lose but our chains.” These words, written from her own experience with solitary confinement, remind us that Black August is not merely a month of mourning, but a month of mobilization.

Within these walls, we honor Black August by refusing to allow the state to divide us, by sharing resources and knowledge, by maintaining our humanity in the face of systematic dehumanization.

Our commemoration of Black August transforms these spaces of intended destruction into laboratories of liberation. Within these walls, we honor Black August by refusing to allow the state to divide us, by sharing resources and knowledge, by maintaining our humanity in the face of systematic dehumanization. We fast to remember those who died fighting for our freedom, we study to understand the connections between past and present struggles, and we organize to ensure that their deaths were not in vain.

The very existence of our organized remembrance exposes the lie that this system tells about itself. The continuation of Black August observances terrifies those in power because it connects the dots between historical resistance and contemporary struggle, revealing that the same forces that murdered Fred Hampton and tortured George Jackson are still operating under different names and newer technologies. The current administration's escalation of repressive measures within the prison system — from the expansion of solitary confinement to the censorship of books and correspondence — demonstrates exactly why Black August must not be forgotten.

Those who hold the keys to these cages understand exactly what they fear losing. Prison officials understand that knowledge is power, and they particularly fear the power that comes from understanding our history of resistance. They know that when we remember Jonathan Jackson's courage, George Jackson's intellectual development despite isolation, and the countless others who chose death over submission, we are less likely to accept our current conditions as inevitable. The state's investment in forgetting is matched only by our investment in remembering, because memory is the foundation of resistance, and resistance is the foundation of freedom.

Now, as the walls that confine our bodies bear witness to the unbreakable nature of our spirits, I issue this call. From these cells where the echoes of George Jackson's footsteps still resonate, I call upon everyone who believes in human dignity, in the right to education, in the possibility of transformation, to remember Black August not as ancient history but as present reality. The conditions that created the need for Black August — racist policing, unjust sentencing, brutal prison conditions, and the use of solitary confinement as torture — persist today, which means our obligation to remember and resist persists as well.

The choice before us is simple: become accomplices to our own destruction through silence, or become architects of our liberation through action. We must remember — because forgetting is complicity, because silence is violence, and because the same system that murdered our ancestors will continue to murder our descendants until we find the courage to tear it down and build something worthy of our humanity.

Ukrainian President Zelensky is pushing a massive deal for U.S. weapons funded by Europe in what observers call a bid to buy the flighty U.S. President Donald Trump's dedication.

Zelensky wants Europe to pay the U.S. $90 billion for weapons to Ukraine, "that we don't have ourselves: above all, planes and air defense, etc. — we'll leave it at 'etc.' for now," as he said in a briefing after the meeting earlier this week. Kyiv is also proposing a $50 billion drone deal with the U.S. as part of the offer.

There are specific pieces of American military kit that have no European analogs at the moment. But the biggest item on the Ukrainian wish list is the exceedingly rare commodity of Trump's attention. The proposed deal's main purpose is "to entice Trump into political commitment," said John Foreman, a former defense attaché for the U.K. who served in both Moscow and Kyiv.

"Now, fortunately or unfortunately, America still provides those more exquisite capabilities: fast jets — despite capacity issues — missiles, air defenses, sensors, radars, highly protected armored vehicles, those sort of things,” Foreman told the Kyiv Independent.

"But it isn't just about having tanks, it's about signing on to a long-term political rhythm from Trump."

Trump has gone back and forth in public rhetoric regarding Ukraine. His administration has periodically frozen weapons deliveries that had already been approved. Just in the past week of negotiations, he has floated and retracted the prospect of giving Russia more Ukrainian territory.

"How can anybody possibly do diplomacy when the leader of the free world is changing his mind every time he gets out of bed?" Foreman quipped.

The appearance of European political royalty like France's Emmanuel Macron and the U.K.'s Keir Starmer at the White House alongside Zelensky was "about the purity of the relationship with the Americans for Europe and for Ukraine," according to Chatham House associate fellow Timothy Ash.

"I'm sure if you got all those leaders and met them privately and they could say what they actually think, they would say 'we can't trust the Americans and we need to build our own autonomous defense capability,'" Ash told the Kyiv Independent. 

"But that's going to take five to ten years in the interim. We'll still be dependent on U.S. arms supplies, so we hope the Americans continue to supply that kit until we're self-sufficient. That's the game plan."

Massive arms deals are among Trump's favorite tools of foreign policy. The Pentagon in May touted a $142 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia as the largest in history. If completed, it might be true, though the ultimate rollout of a similarly massive $110 billion set of memoranda of intent with Saudi Arabia in 2017 remains in question.

Beyond political concerns, the top item on Ukraine's wishlist is Patriot air defense systems, said Fabian Hoffmann, a missile specialist at the Oslo Nuclear Program.

"As a European, I'd rather keep that money in Europe, but there are just some products that are really difficult to get elsewhere," Hoffmann told the Kyiv Independent. "Patriot batteries and interceptors are probably the number-one product that they're looking to buy because that's just something where the SAMP/T is falling short and there's not really an alternative."

Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted a massive glut in weapons buying. The U.S. State Department tallied a record $117.9 billion in foreign arms transfers in 2024, compared to $47 billion in 2021, the year before. That has left the world's arms producers on backorder.

"The waiting time for a newly produced Patriot Missile right now is something like 4-5 years,” said Hoffmann.

Zelensky's newly proposed drone deal is an expanded version of an earlier "mega deal" to sell Ukrainian drones to the U.S. The $50 billion figure is more than the total amount of cash publicly known to have gone into the Ukrainian drone industry. Ukrainian drone experts are cheering.

"It will bring engineering design to a level even higher than programming solutions from the IT sphere," Vitaliy Zaytsev, an aerospace engineer who runs unmanned aerial vehicle programs at three of Ukraine's top universities, told the Kyiv Independent. 

"It will make the country different, making us exporters of technology and not just raw materials."

Despite EU leaders rallying around Zelensky at this White House appearance, none have publicly signed on to funding the prospective new weapons deals.

"Europe is a $27 trillion economy, $100 billion is small change for Europe," said Ash, using the $100 billion number first reported by the Financial Times before Zelensky's public statement about the deal.

"The question is whether Europe and Ukraine can trust the Americans to honor defense supply agreements when Trump has proved not particularly reliable."

How South Korea turned culture into a booming export (and what Canada can learn from it)

Growing up in Toronto in the 1980s, I was often asked by my classmates, “Are you Chinese or Japanese?”

“I'm Korean,” I would reply.

“What's that?”

I think they know now. The wild success of Korean pop culture is the kimchi slap heard around the world. Audiences are binging South Korean shows on Netflix, second only in minutes watched to American shows. Social media is filled with Korean food, K-pop dance challenges and K-beauty tutorials. The ascendance of Korean pop culture has a business aspect (huge) and cultural influence (also huge).

If you're surprised by this success, imagine me. I grew up preinternet. Besides the bootlegged VHS tapes my parents rented at the Korean grocer, I had zero access to Korean pop culture. Instead, I was clocking every Canadian success story, aware of our underdog status. In the 1990s, we gave the world Alanis, Celine, Shania and k.d.lang. Degrassi was airing in more than 40 countries.

Meanwhile, South Korea was experiencing an economic crisis and emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund.

One Jungkook later (27 years, the age of the BTS superstar), that's all changed. K-Pop Demon Hunters, a surprise Netflix hit, is the obsession of the summer, sparking singalong screenings in cinemas and a soundtrack at the top of the charts. On YouTube, Blackpink and BTS maintain the biggest artist channels (#1 and #2, respectively). In a New York Times' list of the 100 Best Movies of the 21st century, Bong Joon Ho's Parasite tops the list. Squid Game is Netflix's most-watched show of all time.

In a fibre-optic cable world where everything is a click away, borders and gatekeepers hold less power while each fan holds more. After a childhood of never seeing anyone like me or my family in pop culture, I made up for lost time by becoming a boy-band fan in my 40s, falling for BTS, the reigning kings of K-pop. Later, I survived COVID lockdowns with K-drama marathons, watching shows like Crash Landing On You, Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha and My Mister. 

In 2023, hallyu, or the “Korean wave” of culture, was valued at $114-billion, and is forecasted to reach $143-billion on the global market by 2030.

These days, Canadian global successes pale in comparison. We could use some big Korean energy. Where is our bold national brand in a world exploding with more content by the day? Since a near-death experience triggered by Napster and file-sharing 20 years ago, the Canadian music industry is experiencing slow and steady regrowth, but our TV and film industries are currently in a tailspin as they try to weather the overall collapse of cinema box office revenue, cable TV and the advertising revenue that went with it.

Making matters worse, U.S. president Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on our $9.58-billion TV and film industry. This would be ruinous for the Canadian sector. About half the value of our industry is dependent on Hollywood productions coming here to film with our crews and locations.

Adding to this mix, Canada is in the midst of a “once in a generation” regulatory revamp to the Broadcasting Act with the newer Online Streaming Act of 2023, also known as Bill C-11, the first update to the Act since 1991. This is the law that defines what is Canadian content – better known as Cancon.

The implementation of the new Act presents opportunities, including improving how government money flows to our entertainment industries, but TV and film are hanging by a thread as the government bickers with streamers. Industry consultations are taking forever. If results aren't more quick and nimble, there won't be much left of these industries to save. 

The nineties was our last truly analog era, and since then, South Korea has learned that while government funding needs to be a part of the equation, the focus is on building infrastructure and a strong private sector, including boosting new technology, rather than providing support on a project-by-project basis for content. 

I'm also, frankly, jealous of how Koreans aren't afraid to be Korean. We need a lesson in how to make Cancon not only more successful, but more Canadian. Maybe the whole “elbows up” vibe can be more than a passing moment of raised ire. Are we ready to be seen for who we are in our own entertainment, songs and stories, and sell it to the world? If South Korea can do it, and they started from the bottom, we can, too.

Canada and South Korea are comparable by several measures. South Korea has the seventh largest recorded music industry in the world. Canada has the eighth. Our GDP-per-capita is $55,800 and South Korea's is $50,600. Canadians live next door to the U.S., and Koreans also know about big neighbours: Japan and China. 

As for differences, language is the most obvious one. Unlike English, Korean is the official language of no other place on Earth. You would think this would be an obstacle for exporting culture, but according to Canadian TV executive Michael MacMillan, CEO of Blue Ant Media, it's actually an advantage. “They know who they are. They're Korean. They speak Korean.”

Making Korean content for a Korean audience that reflects their own lives was South Korea's first step in a formula for global success. You need a surplus of domestic product in order to export. After building infrastructure for their cultural industries over decades, South Korea has grown a deep, competitive domestic pool of talent and saleable content. 

Canadian talent also runs deep. Our film crews are second-to-none. But it's challenging to get funding to make our own stories. It's especially tough now because Canadian broadcasters are buying fewer programs, especially in the English-language market, having overspent on Canadian programming in an overcorrection after the pandemic. Two Hollywood strikes had an impact, with Canadian crews waiting for work that never arrived. The net of it is a Canadian TV and film industry that shrank by 18.5 per cent from April, 2023 to March, 2024.

Pivoting in this era of rapid transformation is challenging, but South Korea is doing it. They have a history of iterating government policies that aren't working – for example, changing their approach to caps on the import of foreign films (restrictive in the 1960s, scrapped by the 1980s) and quotas on how many could be screened (fluctuating over the decades but most recently halved in the 2000s). 

Responsive policies have allowed their industries to flourish – and Netflix took notice. In 2023, the streamer dropped US$2.5-billion into a multiyear commitment to the Korean film and TV industry.

Netflix's model is to invest locally to give local audiences what they want. If a show breaks out to become a worldwide hit – bonus.

Serving local audiences is a strategy that suits South Korea well, as they are highly invested in learning about their own history and culture. Shin Dong Kim, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, says that a Korean obsession with education has refined their taste.

“In Korean society, after colonialism and war, we were all devastated and the traditional class system was just demolished. Education was the last resort of social mobility,” says Prof. Kim.

He says Koreans' passion for education has meant they increasingly demand more interesting and well-written dramas and movies. 

The high quality of content has in turn led to sales in the global market. When I began to watch K-dramas, I didn't understand all the cultural nuances, but the storylines were so addictive, I kept watching. As I did, I learned more and more about Koreans at work, on dates and at home with their families. And now the world has, too.

In Canada, instead of reflecting our own culture back to us, about half of our TV and film industry caters to American productions. 

American producers love our cheaper dollar, tax credit incentives and world-class crews. For us, the arrangement has been out of necessity. Americans money has kept our production industry competitive and alive. 

“Our local market, our audience size, is tiny,” says Blue Ant's MacMillan. 

But while our audience may be tiny compared with the U.S., compared with South Korea, whose population is 51 million, 40 million Canadians isn't so small, especially not in a market that has been made global by streamers and YouTube.

Canada has already shown in small ways that it can be like Korea when it comes to selling its unique culture. One of this year's buzziest Canadian TV shows is North of North. The sitcom, from Inuk showrunners Stacey Aglok MacDonald and Alethea Arnaquq-Baril, takes place in Iqaluit and was made through a partnership between CBC, APTN and Netflix. Inuit make up 0.2 per cent of the Canadian population, but geographically-based audiences matter less in a streamer world looking for great shows with universal themes (in this case, motherhood and community). 

This spring, North of North became a global Top 10 hit for Netflix, part of their local-to-global hitmaker pipeline.

In the past, our mode was to sell shows by hiding that they're Canadian. Schitt's Creek had “no location, no setting, there is no country,” as star Eugene Levy told Stephen Colbert in 2018. This, about a show starring some of our biggest household names and produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

Government funding for Canadian content is a cornerstone of our system and it boils down to a points systems. Film and TV productions, for example, earn points by employing Canadian citizens in key positions and paying at least 75 per cent of costs to Canadian companies, among other criteria. Ticking enough boxes doesn't necessarily get you the money, it just puts you in the running for a panel to decide.

The promise of tax credits from the Canadian Audio-Visual Certification Office (CAVCO) will form another piece of that budget spreadsheet, with yet another checklist.

Cancon rules aren't just about funding; they dictate quotas for Canadian broadcasters. Songs score points when music, lyrics and recording are entirely done by Canadian citizens – and then performed principally by a Canadian. Radio stations are required to play a minimum of 35 per cent Cancon (50 per cent for the CBC). 

Now that the Online Streaming Act of 2023 has replaced the Broadcasting Act, the CRTC has been tasked with implementing it to reshape the rules for a digital era. So far, no one seems happy. 

“This seemed to be the opportunity to say we are doing something new here,” says Patrick Rogers of Music Canada, which represents major music labels in Canada. Instead, Rogers says outcomes have been disappointing.

One of the first actions the CRTC took under the Act, in 2024, was to require global streamers to pay a 5-per-cent levy to operate in Canada, with revenues being used to support the Canadian broadcasting system, including local news on radio and television, French-language content, Indigenous content and content by and for equity-deserving communities. 

This levy didn't land well. Spotify raised its subscription prices. Netflix stopped funding talent-generating incubators for Canadian creatives. 

Rogers calls the update a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” but at this point, he isn't optimistic. “It appears the CRTC is interested in finding ways to maintain the system of the past.”

South Korea's cultural industries are supported by government, too, but they do it differently. The South Korean government, with a few exceptions, puts the money into infrastructure and sector support rather than funneling it into specific projects. 

When I ask Yoori Kwon, a Seoul-based TV executive, how much government money goes into the dozens of TV shows her studio produces per year, she seems puzzled. 

“None,” she says.

However, her studio, SLL Studios, a top South Korean production company, is based in Digital Media City, a neighbourhood in Seoul with a high concentration of tech and media, a world of hard facilities, as planned by several levels of government. 

Besides infrastructure, Kim says the South Korean government supports cultural industries by encouraging private investment. For example, the K-Content Strategic Fund – announced last year and worth $400-million – is a pool of investments by private companies, including studios and banks, backed by the government. In this way, the South Korean government leverages capital markets to fuel their ambitious global export plans, merging private and public dollars to do it. This content fund is about growing money as much as it is about funneling it back into their industries, building in financial sustainability. 

Clive Kenny, a British economist who has studied K-culture industries, says that private sector business acumen has been integral to the growth of hallyu. “Korea had the chaebols, these family-run conglomerates, who were able to bring their expertise from producing appliances and cars into the entertainment sector.” 

An early example is CJ Group, a South Korean food company, which became a founding investor in Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks SKG in the 1990s. Besides holding a stake, they got distribution rights for Asian countries – but the whole point was to get into the biz. Today, CJ ENM, owned by CJ Group, is one of Korea's biggest entertainment companies. 

Imagine Canada expanding past the telecommunications oligopoly (Rogers, Bell, Telus) with Loblaw or McCain Foods getting into movies ‐ or Canadian export industries like oil and gas or lumber.

“It's very risky to produce high-end content,” Kenny says. Government incentives, like grants, are designed to mitigate some of the risk. Kenny says the South Korean government provides incentives but they're not big relative to other markets like Europe, U.S. or Canada. 

“The structure of the way we do things in Canada is really broken,” says Jennifer Podemski, co-creator and showrunner of mini-series drama Little Bird (above).CRAVE/Supplied

He says government incentives done well can create a virtuous circle, encouraging many players to invest in the local ecosystem, as South Korea has done. Incentives done poorly, however, can go sideways, creating inefficient obstacle courses, a drain of time and effort. “You've already missed the wave of what you're trying to achieve if you add a year of prefinancing discussion,” Kenny says. 

It's also counterproductive, Kenny says, when you have a small group of judges applying their points of view to assess what's worth funding. That's when a process, meant to be an incentive, actually adds risk to the business, by making it more subjective.

Kenny may as well be describing the Canadian grant system. 

Without jumping through hoops to scrape together budgets, no Canadian producer can pay a crew to arrive on-set, and no Canadian audience gets a show like Sort Of, Kim's Convenience, Letterkenny or Little Bird, last year's biggest winner at the Canadian Screen Awards.

“The structure of the way we do things in Canada is really broken,” says Jennifer Podemski, co-creator and showrunner of Little Bird, a drama about the 1960s scoop that was a partnership between APTN and Crave. Working with low budgets, and wearing many hats, requires a very entrepreneurial frame of mind, Podemski says. Her production company has a small core team and, until five years ago, she ran it without a physical office space. 

“The business model didn't work for me and I can see now it's not working for anybody.”

Another driver of South Korea's success is their intense work culture. Koreans work some of the longest hours in the developed world, and take less holiday than the OECD average. You can clearly see it in K-pop, which has endured plenty of scrutiny from fans and detractors for its hard-driving trainee system.

“There's a thing we could call the success theory of K-pop,” says Son Sungdeuk, Executive Creator at Hybe America. “There's the idol, and contact with fans and communication, fans always being the priority. Also, artists produce music that is not just for the ears but also for the eyes. It's performance-heavy, which is different. And then the training process. That's the unofficial formula.”

K-pop groups are assembled by record labels through a long process of training and tryouts. Son began working with BTS as a choreographer during their audition phase, long before they amassed 80 million subscribers on YouTube. They were still a ragtag group of students, assembled by a scrappy, no-profile company called Big Hit, now one of several labels under Hybe.

South Korea's K-pop trainee system is intense, taking years of training and tryouts. The result is on display in Netflix docu-series Pop Star Academy, which produced 'global girl group' Katseye (pictured above in L.A. in 2024), whose members are from around the world.Chris Pizzello/The Associated Press

The bandmates lived in a dorm, training daily for years, posting dance practice videos and livestreams (which they still diligently do) before debuting in 2013. Their hard-driving effort took them all the way to the Grammys stage in 2022. After the show, the team headed home to Seoul while Son stayed in California, where he is working to build Hybe's U.S. endeavour.

Son's contributions to the K-pop trainee system are on display in Netflix's Pop Star Academy, a documentary series on the making of a K-pop group over a year of training and tryouts. The result is Katseye, a global girl group with members from the Philippines, U.S., Switzerland and South Korea.

Does Son think it's possible to take the K-pop trainee system out of Korea and apply it elsewhere?

“No,” Son says. “There's too much of a cultural difference. Figuring this out was my biggest homework. There was no reference for what could be done.”

The K-pop trainee system is an expression of how Koreans work – at school, in the military, in the workplace and in entertainment. 

This method is not a blueprint for what the Canadian system needs. The lesson, instead, is to double down on your culture's strengths.

We might not excel at highly-trained pop groups, but we regularly produce acclaimed solo artists. Our most famous exports are musicians with a strong point of view (think Drake, The Weeknd, Mustafa, Feist, Nelly Furtado, and, going back in time, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Leonard Cohen and Gordon Lightfoot). K-pop has at its heart a pursuit of perfection, whereas Canadian musicians who travel well have a distinct voice. Perhaps storytelling is what's in our cultural DNA.

As a whole, Canadian music is already faring well in a digital world.

Without quotas for streamers yet in place, Canadians choose Canadian music 10 per cent of the time, which is substantial given they are competing with every song of all time and around the world.

Outside our borders, the world is also choosing Canadian, with our artists ranking third (behind the U.S. and U.K.) in worldwide streams of the top 1,000 singles. 

“Canadian music is made by Canadians and it's designed to be shared with the world,” Rogers says. “Some of the top songs in India are made by Canadians. We're net benefiters of this global phenomenon in so many ways.” 

Sharing a perspective is exactly what content creators do – and according to YouTube, Canadian creators on that platform see 90 per cent of their watch time come from outside Canada. Some of this content, like that of MiaPlays (a channel entirely in Farsi with videos like “What I Eat In A Week”) aren't in English or French. It's an eye-popping ratio that shows Canadians are already exporting our pop culture to the world.

During the pandemic, in an attempt to understand the creator economy, the Canadian government ran a survey that found that content creators have low and volatile incomes, prone to fluctuation and reliant on supplementation from live performances and physical sales. It would future-proof our cultural economy if we could provide more stability for creators through accessible infrastructure (studios, gear, mentorship, business administration education and fair artist management, for example). 

The investment would be worth it. In 2023, the YouTube creator economy generated over $1.82-billion to Canada's GDP.

A good case study to look at is CoPilot, a start-up in Winnipeg specializing in LED walls and software, a more advanced version of green screen technology for films. The company began with two friends making travel videos for tourism boards. When the pandemic shut down travel, they spent time levelling up on virtual production technology and started their business.

“Because we're based in Manitoba, we can't compete at the same level of people in markets like Los Angeles, Vancouver, New York. We decided to Hail Mary it and start a YouTube channel,” says Reid Valmestad, CoPilot's director of business development and operations. 

By sharing their growing expertise, they built an audience of niche clientele, and now travel to build LED walls and 3D environments for studios and trade shows. An enthusiastic South Korean client of theirs is LG (yes, the brand best known for making your washer and dryer), who are also in the business of content. 

CoPilot have benefited from several initiatives of the Canadian government, including a trade mission to South Korea and business mentorship through a matching program. This type of support sounds practically South Korean, building the muscle of innovation for a Canadian company while also building infrastructure.

As professor Kim reminds me, no one in Korea watches a show because it's Korean: “They watch it because it's good.” 

Canadian audiences are the same. We don't care about points systems, budgets, levies or even the technology that dazzles us behind the scenes. We just want to see ourselves, too. In Canada, that means true expressions of our diversity – not as a catchphrase or checklist, but in a way that supports every musician, writer, director, content creator to have as strong and richly unique of a voice as they can. 

“Whether I like it or not, I‘m representing Canada wherever I go,” says Polaris Prize-winning musician Lido Pimienta. “I feel like any time I have to access support, I‘m in this constant state of validating my work. You want your work to speak for you but when culture is attached to the government, it limits so much of what you can do.” 

Citing fan bases in her home country of Colombia, as well as Chile, New Zealand, and the U.S., as Pimienta does, is extremely Canadian. Canada's diversity is an obvious advantage that still remains largely untapped by gatekeepers. It's occurring to the powers-that-be too slowly, if at all, that diversity and diaspora connect us directly with audiences around the world.

We don't need a bland mush that flattens who we are as Canadians. No more “there is no country,” in our TV shows. Keep boosting the signal on music with singular, iconoclastic points of view. The whole point of diversity is to recognize that there is no one culture, which isn't the same as saying we don't have a culture. Specificity is a storyteller's best asset. Undoubtedly, Canada is set up incredibly well there.

In a more perfect world, the CRTC wouldn't seem like it's surprised by cord-cutting media habits that are at least a decade old. Folks in government media regulation would be well-versed in TikTok and Spotify and YouTube, so they can inherently understand what the rest of us are doing. And if we're going to be using points systems, we could expand the range for how they're scored. For example, the British system includes points for showing British creativity, heritage and diversity on-screen, as well as British locations, whether or not they're shot in a studio in the U.S. 

South Korea isn't perfect. It's easy to look with envy and oversimplify problems they're working through themselves. A culture of overwork and a record label system that can be exploitative are constant issues. But they did a few key things right, by making bold investments, encouraging private sector business acumen, changing restrictive policies and funneling money into infrastructure. They're also laser-focused on figuring out the future of intellectual property. We can do all of this, too, if there is the political will. 

The timing couldn't be more crucial. The Directors guild of Canada predicts a potential $200-million decline over the next five years for Canadian programming, owing to lost revenue from the migration to streaming. 

We need government support with a light touch, more trade mission-type connections and incentives that are straightforward, not obstacle courses. As we hurtle towards a global future, connecting with fans and audiences around the world and having a strong sense of Canada at the starting block is the only way forward. It's an investment that will pay itself back many times over.

“Once a fandom is formed, it doesn't easily go away,” says Prof. Kim. “Fandom goes along throughout their lives.” 

He's talking about K-pop (and Elvis and Star Wars) but he could very well be talking about our national identity, too. We need to be our own biggest fans to bring the world along with us.

            A transgender woman has been found guilty of sexually assaulting a male partner by failing to disclose her gender status to him, meaning he could not consent to the sexual activity, British prosecutors said on Friday.
    


            Ciara Watkin, 21, performed sex acts on the man, also 21, who she had met on social media site Snapchat in June 2022, but did not disclose her transgender status to him.
    


            The Crown Prosecution Service said Watkin had told the man that she was on her period and meaning he could not touch her below the waist.
    


            A few days later the pair met again, after which Watkin blocked all contact with the man until she eventually got back in touch and told him during an exchange of text messages that she was transgender and had male genitalia, the CPS said.
    


            “It is clear from the evidence in this case that, prior to engaging in sexual activity with the victim, Watkin had made no attempt to inform him of her transgender status,” said Senior Crown Prosecutor Sarah Nelson.
    


            “The victim has made clear in police interview that he would not have engaged in sexual activity had he known that Watkin was transgender and, consequently, these events have had a significant impact on his mental wellbeing.”
    


            Watkin, from Stockton-on-Tees in northeast England, had admitted lying but her lawyers told her trial that it would have been “blindingly obvious” to the man that she was not biologically female, the BBC said.
    


            She was convicted of two charges of sexual assault and one charge of assault by penetration following a trial at Teesside Crown Court and will be sentenced on October 10.

We are getting some news lines from Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, via Reuters, quoting a report from the Russian news agency Ria.

He is quoted as saying that no meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is planned, but insisting that the Russian president remains ready to meet when there's a ready agenda for their meeting.

Speaking to NBC TV's “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” programme, Lavrov also said Russia had agreed to be flexible on a number of points raised by US president Donald Trump, Reuters reported.

… and on that note, it's a wrap!

Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said there were no plans for Vladimir Putin to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the agenda for the meeting was “not ready at all.” “There is no meeting planned,” he said (13:40).

Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said there were active discussions “at many levels” to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, as he insisted that they would offer greater protection than in previous, failed agreements in Minsk and Budapest (14:20, 14:23).

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that guarantees should be structured in a similar way to Nato's core principle in Article 5 that an attack on one member is an attack on all (14:09).

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that “Russia does not want peace,” accusing Putin of ignoring demands to end the war and “just laughing – not stopping the killing, but increase the killing, … the bombings on Ukraine” (9:48).

Hungary and Slovakia urged the European Commission to guarantee security of supplies after they said that oil deliveries through the Druzbha pipeline could be suspended for at least five days following a Ukrainian attack on a linked facility in Russia (10:26).

This hot and dry year has already emerged as the EU's worst on record for wildfires – and there's still one month of the fire season left to go (16:05).

Europe environment correspondent

In other news, this hot and dry year has already emerged as the EU's worst on record for wildfires – and there's still one month of the fire season left to go.

New data from the European Forest Fire Information System (Effis) shows 1,015,024 hectares have burned so far this year, breaking the previous full-year record of 988,544 hectares that was set in 2017.

Across the continent, and particularly in Spain and Portugal, deadly infernos have run riot this month – emptying out villages and forcing farmers to become firefighters.

The blazes have engulfed four times as much land this year as the average for the same period over the past two decades, according to official data, and spewed out extreme levels of toxic smoke.

Overwhelmed and underprepared, several governments have triggered the EU's civil protection mechanism to help fight the flames. The Commission has sent help in the form of water-bombing planes and extra firefighters from neighbouring countries.

Meanwhile, a Russian state-backed messenger application called Max, a rival to WhatsApp that critics say could be used to track users, must be pre-installed on all mobile phones and tablets bought in the country starting next month, the Russian government said on Thursday.

The decision to promote Max comes as Moscow, locked in a standoff with the west over Ukraine, is seeking greater control over the internet.

The Kremlin said in a statement that Max, which will be integrated with government services, would be on a list of mandatory pre-installed apps on all “gadgets”, including mobile phones and tablets, sold in Russia from 1 September. The firm behind Max said this week that 18 million users had downloaded its app, parts of which are still in a testing phase.

State media says accusations from Kremlin critics that Max is a spying app are false and that it has fewer permissions to access user data than rivals WhatsApp and Telegram.

AFP is reporting that an air raid alert sounded in Kyiv during Rutte's visit to Kyiv.

The agency added that:

“Russia has stepped up drone and missile attacks on Ukraine in recent days as a US-led mediation effort to end the three-and-a-half-year war has appeared to falter.”

Rutte was also asked about whether these new security guarantees would include any troops on the ground in Ukraine.

He said:

“These discussions are now ongoing at many levels. So the security advisers are working together. The foreign ministers are working together on this. …

And it is too early to exactly say what will be the outcome, but clearly the US will be involved. Clearly we want, do not want, to repeat of the Budapest Memorandum or the Minsk agreement, these security guarantees should be holding.”

Speaking alongside Zelenskyy, Nato's Rutte said the alliance's support for Ukraine remained “unwavering” and “continues to grow,” with more plans to provide Nato funding to ensure “a crucial flow of lethal US weapons to Ukraine.”

He lauded the outcome of Monday's talks at the White House, saying that Trump made it clear “the United States will indeed be involved in providing security guarantees for Ukraine.”

He continued:

“Robust security guarantees will be essential, and this is what we are now working to define, so that when the time comes you for you to enter that bilateral meeting, you have the unmistakable force of Ukraine's friends behind you, ensuring that Russia will uphold any deal, and will never ever again, attempt to take one square kilometre of Ukraine.”

He then got challenged by a Ukrainian reporter on how the new guarantees would be different from the ones made to Ukraine in the past, including in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, that ended up being ignored by Russia.

Rutte insisted that Europe's and the US's active role will make them different this time.

“The Budapest Memorandum and Minsk did not provide those security guarantees. So we clearly know what it should not be, and we are now working together – Ukraine, the Europeans, the United States – to make sure that the security guarantees are of such a level that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, sitting in Moscow, will never, ever try to attack Ukraine again.”

Nato secretary general Mark Rutte turns out to be in Kyiv today, making a previously unannounced visit to Ukraine.

We are just getting some lines from his joint appearance at a press briefing with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Zelenskyy said the pair discussed possible security guarantees for Ukraine, insisting they should be structured in a similar way to Nato's core principle in Article 5 that an attack on one member is an attack on all.

The Ukrainian president also repeatedly alleged that Russia was trying to make it impossible to end the way and to avoid a leaders' meeting between himself and Putin.

We are getting some news lines from Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, via Reuters, quoting a report from the Russian news agency Ria.

He is quoted as saying that no meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is planned, but insisting that the Russian president remains ready to meet when there's a ready agenda for their meeting.

Speaking to NBC TV's “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” programme, Lavrov also said Russia had agreed to be flexible on a number of points raised by US president Donald Trump, Reuters reported.

A bilateral meeting between President Zelenskyy and Putin is viewed as unlikely and Ukrainians are sure that Putin will do everything possible to avoid one.

Putin has repeatedly questioned Zelenskyy's legitimacy as president and meeting the Ukrainian leader would fly in the face of that stance. But, if we try to imagine how a bilateral meeting might go, logically an easy issue should be dealt with first – a minor question on which agreement could be achieved, paving the way for more difficult topics.

But today, between Ukraine and Russia there are no easy issues.

The exchange of prisoners of war and the return of Ukrainian children and civilians from Russia to Ukraine have long been addressed with a degree of success by a separate team of employees. All other points for discussion are extremely difficult; for example, a mutual ceasefire or a mutual cessation of shelling with missiles and drones, or the status of captured territories and territories that Russia is still planning to capture.

The format of such a tete-a-tete meeting is therefore much more likely to be two short monologues, but certainly not a dialogue. A three-person meeting with President Trump as a moderator could be more productive, but surely Trump will only agree to this if he is confident that at least something will be achieved.

Otherwise, again, as after the Alaska meeting, his reputation will take a beating.

Kim Jong-un has hailed North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia in the war in Ukraine as “heroes”, at a ceremony to honour soldiers who recently returned from the conflict, state media said on Friday.

The North Korean leader said in a speech this week that his troops had displayed “fighting spirit of the heroes” during their operation to retake Russia's Kursk region from Ukrainian forces – which had established a foothold there last year – the state news agency KCNA said.

“The combat activities of overseas operational forces … proved without regret the power of the heroic [North Korean] army,” Kim said.

Kim laid a flower at a memorial for North Korean soldiers who had died overseas, while soldiers who had returned from Russia were honoured with a concert, KCNA said, adding that relatives of troops killed in action had been among those attending a banquet.

The events were the latest public show of gratitude by the regime in Pyongyang, in stark contrast to the secrecy that surrounded North Korea's role in the war when its troops were first sent to Russia last autumn.

Kim met officers of the army's overseas operation and paid tribute to North Korean soldiers killed in Ukraine. He said they had been assigned to carry out the “most important duty” and voiced “warm militant encouragement” to the commanders and troops, KCNA said.

The ceremony comes days after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, used similar language to pay tribute to North Korean troops sent to fight alongside Russian forces.

Pyongyang sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia's Kursk region in 2024, according to South Korean and western intelligence agencies, along with artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket systems.

About 600 North Korean troops have been killed out of a total deployment of 15,000, South Korean lawmakers said in April, citing the South's intelligence agency.

In the last few minutes, Hungary's foreign minister Szijjártó posted the full letter he sent with his Slovak counterpart to the European Commission on gas supplies (10:26).

In the letter, the pair said:

“We regret to inform you that during the last days Ukraine has carried out three attacks against the Druzhba oil pipeline which plays a crucial role in the energy security of Hungary and Slovakia.

These attacks resulted in the suspension of oil deliveries to both of our countries. As a consequence of the latest missile attack, deliveries seem to be suspended for at least five days. 

The physical and geographical reality is that without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries is simply not possible.

Given that in the past years, the EU and its Member States have provided hundreds of billions of Euros worth of support to Ukraine, we find Ukraine's actions, which severely threaten the energy security of Hungary and Slovakia, completely unacceptable. 

To this end, we strongly call on the Commission to immediately uphold the commitments outlined in the above mentioned statement and guarantee the safety of energy supply of its Member States.”

Let's see if we get a response from Ukraine this morning.

French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk will visit Moldova next week to celebrate Moldova's independence day, the French president's office said on Friday.

“The leaders will reaffirm their full support for Moldova's security, sovereignty and European path,” the Élysée Palace said in a statement, reported by Reuters.

Moldova, a small former Soviet republic located between Ukraine and EU and Nato member Romania, will hold parliamentary elections on 28 September. The country's ruling party is seeking to maintain its majority and keep its pro-European trajectory intact.

Moldovan officials have repeatedly accused Russia of meddling in its domestic politics by stoking pro-Moscow sentiment in an effort to topple the government as it aims to strengthen ties with the West, claims Russia denies, Reuters said.

Elsewhere, Hungary and Slovakia urged the European Commission to guarantee security of supplies after they said that oil deliveries through the Druzbha pipeline could be suspended for at least five days following a Ukrainian attack on a linked facility in Russia, Reuters reported.

“The physical and geographical reality is that without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries is simply not possible,” foreign ministers Péter Szijjártó and Juraj Blanár said in a joint letter.

Slovak pipeline operator Transpetrol said on Friday that the flow of oil was interrupted last night, outside the territory of the Slovakia.

Earlier this week, Szijjártó publicly clashed on this issue with Ukraine's foreign minister Andrii Sybiha, who told him to “send your complaints – and threats – to your friends in Moscow” (Europe live on Tuesday).

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier today.

She asserted that “Russia does not want peace,” as she accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of not keeping any promises and “just laughing – not stopping the killing, but increase the killing, … the bombings on Ukraine.”

“You see Europeans, Ukrainians, Americans wanting peace, and doing all the diplomatic efforts to achieve that, whereas Russia is just dragging feet, it's clear that Russia does not want peace.”

She also called for more EU and US sanctions and tariffs against Russia, saying:

“It is very clear that any promises that Putin has been given so far, he hasn't kept, and we have to treat it as such, but [we] also [have to] make all the efforts in really pressuring him to come to the negotiation table.

And there we have different tools. The Americans have leverage with the sanctions or tariffs to pressure Russia into negotiations. We are working on our 19th package of sanctions on the European side to really put the pressure on Russia, the one who is, who is doing the aggression here.”

Kallas also argued that Putin got “what he wanted” from the Alaska summit with Trump, getting not just the picture with the US president, but “so much more, such a welcome in America, and … then he also wanted the sanctions not to be put in place, which he also achieved.”

“So, I think right now his interest is down, because he has achieved what he wanted from this meeting,” she said.

She also rejected speculations about Ukraine giving up parts of its territory, saying “this is exactly the trap that Russia wants us to walk into.”

“[They want] the discussion [to be] all about what Ukraine should give up, what is the concessions that Ukraine is willing to do, whereas we are forgetting that Russia hasn't made one single concession. And they are the ones who are the aggressor here.

They are the ones who are brutally attacking another country and killing people there … So let's keep the focus there, where we have to keep it, to put the pressure on Russia so that they would come to the negotiation table. And also, what kind of negotiation concessions are the Russians making right now? They have just increased their goals and wishes.”

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia's Vladimir Putin of “trying to wriggle out of holding a meeting” to discuss peace arrangements, saying: “They don't want to end this war.”

Zelenskyy pointed to continuing Russian strikes on Ukraine, including on an American company's facilities in Mukachevo, and a growing number of alleged provocations against Nato countries, including Lithuania and Poland. “[These are] not accidents – Russian impudence,” he said.

“We expect our partners to respond in a principled manner. This war must be brought to an end. Pressure must be exerted on Russia to end the war. Putin understands nothing but force and pressure.”

He was also quick to pick up on US president Donald Trump's suggestion of more offensive actions.

Trump on Thursday appeared to vent his frustration at Russia's obstruction. In a post on Truth Social, the US president blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for not allowing Ukraine to “fight back” against Russia.

He said:

“It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invaders country. It's like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia. Crooked and grossly incompetent Joe Biden would not let Ukraine FIGHT BACK, only DEFEND. How did that work out? … Interesting times ahead!!!”

Zelenskyy responded:

Of course, we will continue doing everything to protect our country and people. President Trump is absolutely right—this must be done not only in defense. Meanwhile, we do not slow down in diplomacy, so that negotiations to bring peace closer can finally take place.

Let's see what today brings.

Elsewhere, I will be also keeping an eye on the EU's reactions to the EU-US joint statement on trade, and on wildfires affecting Spain and Portugal.

I will bring you all the key updates here.

It's Friday, 22 August 2025, it's Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live.

            The job market is on such shaky ground that the Federal Reserve may soon need to cut interest rates to support the economy, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday at a key central banking forum.
    


            In one of his most consequential speeches, Powell suggested the labor market could benefit from lower rates, which the Fed has kept unchanged for eight straight months.
    


            “Downside risks to employment are rising,” Powell said in prepared remarks for his keynote speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. He said the possibility of Trump's tariffs having only a short-lived effect on inflation is “reasonable.”
    


            “With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” he added.
    


            The Jackson Hole conference is typically a major event in the world of central banking in which the Fed chair sets the tone for the rest of the year, but it has a radically different backdrop this year.
    


            Powell's Jackson Hole remarks, his last such as Fed chair, come at an inflection point in the central bank's 111-year history. The Fed — and Powell in particular — has been subject to an unprecedented onslaught on attacks from the White House since Trump began his second term in January. But now, the Trump administration is expanding its assault on the central bank.
    


            The Justice Department has signaled it plans to investigate Fed Governor Lisa Cook after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte accused her committing mortgage fraud.
    


Powell set to give key speech as Trump administration ramps up pressure for a Fed overhaul



            Trump continues to demand massive rate cuts as his administration actively searches for who will replace Powell once his term as chair ends in May 2026. At the same time, he is also slowly reshaping the Fed.
    


            Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, whom Trump elevated earlier this year to her current post, is actively reviewing banking regulation and is widely expected to ease rules on the largest banks. Some of the contenders for Fed chair have vowed to downsize the central bank's workforce if they're chosen.
    


            Trump has also nominated Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacant seat on the Fed's Board of Governors after former Fed governor Adriana Kugler resigned earlier this month.
    


            And if Cook is pushed out and Miran is confirmed, that would tilt the make-up of the central bank's board in favor of Trump, with only two Fed governors appointed by a Democratic president. Powell has refused to reveal if he plans to stay on the Fed's board after his term as chair ends in May 2026. He has a separate concurrent term as Fed governor that runs through 2028.
    


            “The Fed board is comprised of seven governors, one of them the chairman. With a four-person majority, the Board can fire regional Fed bank presidents who play a key role in interest rate decisions,” Jon Hilsenrath, senior adviser at brokerage firm StoneX, wrote in a statement on LinkedIn Thursday.
    


            “Each one of these board seats matters a great deal to a president who wants to reshape how the central bank works and what it decides. Getting rid of Cook would be a way for the President to build that four-person majority,” he added.
    


            Fed officials make their decisions on interest rates based solely on what economic figures show in striving for their dual goals of maximum employment and stable prices — not based on what politicians demand of them. Powell reiterated that point in his speech.
    


            “(Fed) members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks,” Powell said. “We will never deviate from that approach.”

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte arrived in Kyiv for a surprise visit on Aug. 22 and met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukrainian Presidential Office Head Andriy Yermak said.

Rutte's visit comes days after a high-level meeting in Washington between Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and European partners aimed at securing security guarantees for Ukraine.

"We are now working together — Ukraine, the Europeans, the United States — to make sure that these security guarantees are of such a level that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin sitting in Moscow will never try to attack Ukraine again," Rutte said at a press conference. 

According to the NATO chief, the security guarantees agreement will consist of two layers: strengthening Ukraine's army and commitments from the U.S. and Europe aimed at deterring Russia in the event of future aggression.

Bloomberg reported on Aug. 19 that the package of security guarantees for Ukraine might be finalized this week. European officials have reportedly discussed sending British and French troops to Ukraine, along with contingents from roughly 10 other countries.

According to Rutte, discussions about deploying foreign troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees are ongoing, but "it is too early to say what will be the outcome."

"It's still too early to say who might provide troops, who will contribute intelligence, who will be present at sea, and who — in the air," President Zelensky added.

French President Emmanuel Macron said on Aug. 18 that guarantees would not involve NATO membership but instead rely on a strong Ukrainian army backed by commitments from the Coalition of the Willing, which includes over 30 countries.

European officials told the Kyiv Independent on Aug. 19 that a series of meetings among the countries participating in the Coalition of the Willing could take place in the coming days to work out the details.

Trump told Fox News on Aug. 19 that Washington could provide air support as part of the guarantees but ruled out deploying U.S. ground troops.

Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that security guarantees for Ukraine can't be discussed without Russia's participation.

"Ukraine needs security guarantees so that we, our children, and grandchildren can be certain that Russia will not attack us. These are guarantees of security against an aggressor," Zelensky said at a press conference in response to Lavrov's remarks.

"When Russia raises the issue of security guarantees, to be honest, I don't know who exactly is threatening them. They're the ones who attacked us."

Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany.

Russia's top military and political officials joined Putin in the closed city of Sarov, which houses the Russian Federal Nuclear Center, on Aug. 22. 



The military aspect of the guarantees will involve weapons deliveries, financial support, intelligence sharing, and joint military exercises and trainings, a Presidential Office source told the news outlet Suspilne. 

Ukrainian anti-aircraft gunners shot down a Russian Orlan drone carrying two first-person-view (FPV) drones under its wings, the 118th Separate Mechanized Brigade reported. 





"How can we meet with a person who is pretending to be a leader?" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told NBC News on Aug. 22. 

The Kyiv Independent's Kate Tsurkan sits down with Oscar-winning director of "20 Days in Mariupol," Mstyslav Chernov, to discuss his new documentary, "2000 Meters to Andriivka" and why he strives to tell universal stories of resilience, bravery and hope against the backdrop of Russia's war on Ukraine.



"Viktor, I do not like hearing about this — I am very angry about it. Tell Slovakia you are my great friend," Trump wrote in response to a complaint about the strikes from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. 

"We are now working together — Ukraine, the Europeans, the United States — to make sure that these security guarantees are of such a level that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin sitting in Moscow will never try to attack Ukraine again," NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said.



"Unlike Russia, Belarus is less restricted by sanctions in the military-technical sphere and could become a channel for restoring Iran's defense capabilities," Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service reported. 

According to the Navy, Ukraine destroyed up to three Mohajer-6 drones and two Forpost drones at the Khersones airfield in the occupied peninsula.

Ukrainian forces downed 46 out of the 55 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported.

Experts call change likely to pose problems for Americans with limited internet access ‘troubling to say the least' 

Current and former Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) officials are concerned over a new agency rule requiring disaster victims to have an email address in order to apply for federal aid.

The policy change, first reported by Wired and confirmed by a Fema official to the Guardian, was “troubling to say the least”, said Jeremy Edwards, former spokesperson for Fema and the White House under Joe Biden's presidency.

Email was an optional means of contacting Fema under previous administrations, but will now be mandatory for those seeking relief amid disasters. The change, which follows a March executive order discontinuing federal paper-based payments, could be a major hurdle for victims in need of financial aid, particularly for those with limited internet access.

“For most people, it's a non-issue, but for people that have either chosen not to have an email or don't have an email for whatever reason, it seems to be a very arbitrary thing to say, no email, no help,” said Craig Fugate, a former Fema administrator during the Obama administration. “It sounds like the clerks are just making the job easier for themselves.”

In the US, an estimated 12% of people lived in households without any internet connection in 2023. Disasters can also make it difficult or impossible for victims to access libraries or other public spaces to get online.

“My question is, why aren't we focused on meeting the survivors where they are, versus making them fit our plan,” said Fugate.

Moving communications about assistance to email is not necessarily a bad thing for everyone, said a Fema official with knowledge of the new program.

“It's a lot easier and sometimes more efficient to be able to communicate via email and send documents back and forth that people might need, for instance,” the worker said. “For the people that do have email addresses and know how to work it, this is going to make their lives a lot easier than having to hop on the phone and call a call center where it's immediately after disaster, so you could be on the phone for hours at a time, just given the volume of calls that come in.”

But for those with limited internet access, as well as elderly people and disabled individuals who are more vulnerable during disasters and may be less likely to have email addresses, the requirement could pose difficulties, the official added.

The policy change is particularly concerning, the person said, because it comes as Fema has also ended door-to-door canvassing during disasters and shuttered some field offices across the country. That will mean agency workers will have less face time with disaster victims to navigate email servers for those who are unfamiliar with them.

“It would be different if we were to have made this a requirement but then built in programmatic checks and the ability to help people get email addresses who might not have it … but we're not doing that any more either,” the official said. “We're dialing back all of the things that we had done to try and make sure we are capturing folks who are already predominantly left behind when it came to receiving Fema assistance.”

The change could pose hurdles to those seeking immediate aid via Fema's critical needs assistance program, which can provide victims with $750 in cash within 24 hours of a disaster to fill immediate requirements for hotel stays, food and other basic needs.

“Any step that you take that is going to just create that little bit of friction that could be a day that that person's not getting that money,” Edwards said. “That is serious when you need baby formula or you need food for your kids and things like that.”

Other recently implemented Fema policies, such as the new requirement of the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, that she personally approves all contracts over $100,000 before funds are disbursed, could further delay urgently needed aid to communities, the anonymous official said.

“That's bureaucracy to the umpteenth degree that never existed at any previous time,” the person said. “So there is a giant concern about timing.”

The Guardian has contacted Fema for comment.

The Trump administration has dismissed 2,000 full-time staff since Trump retook the White House in January, as more than a dozen others in leadership positions have voluntarily resigned. Political leadership was “trying to create solutions for the problem they created” by downsizing their workforce, said Edwards.

“When they fire 2,000 of their 6,000 permanent workforce, that obviously probably created a lot of constraints for them in terms of their ability to effectively deliver assistance,” he said, adding that the issue was not only unethical but possibly “politically short-sighted”, since it could delay aid to Trump voters in communities with technological limitations.

Fema has long struggled to efficiently deliver disaster assistance. The Biden administration took steps to remedy that and “make getting assistance easier, not harder”, said Edwards. But under Trump, “the least charitable view is that they are trying to discourage people from getting disaster assistance”, he said.

“I don't understand how you can look at what they're doing and arrive at any other conclusion,” said Edwards.

            Erin McCanlies was listening to the radio one morning in April when she heard Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promising to find the cause of autism by September. The secretary of Health and Human Services said he believed an environmental toxin was responsible for the dramatic increase in the condition and vowed to gather “the most credible scientists from all over the world” to solve the mystery.
    


            Nothing like that has ever been done before, he told an interviewer.
    


            McCanlies was stunned. The work had been done.
    


            “That's exactly what I've been doing!” she said to her husband, Fred.
    


            As an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which Kennedy oversees, McCanlies had spent much of the past two decades studying how parents' exposure to workplace chemicals affects the chance that they will have a child with autism. Just three weeks earlier, she'd been finalizing her fourth major paper on the topic when Kennedy eliminated her entire division. Kennedy has also overseen tens of millions of dollars in cuts to federal funding for research on autism, including its environmental causes.
    


            For 20 years, Kennedy has espoused the debunked theory that autism is caused by vaccines, dismissing evidence to the contrary by arguing that vaccine manufacturers, researchers and regulators all have an interest in obscuring their harms.
    


            He remains skeptical of the scientists who have been funded by his own agency to study the neurodevelopmental condition. “We need to stop trusting the experts,” he told right-wing host Tucker Carlson in a June interview, going on to suggest that previous studies that found no relationship between vaccines and autism were marred by “trickery” and researchers' self-interest.
    


            In contrast, Kennedy told Carlson that under his leadership, and with a new, federally funded $50 million autism research initiative, “We're going to get real studies done for the first time.”
    


            Some autism researchers fear that the effort will manipulate data to blame the condition on vaccines. “Kennedy has never expressed an open mind, an open attitude towards what are the fundamental causes of autism,” said Helen Tager-Flusberg, a Boston University psychologist who founded a coalition of scientists concerned about his approach to autism. In a June statement, the group said the initiative lacks transparency and that Kennedy “casually ignores decades of high quality research that preceded his oversight.”
    


            As Kennedy promotes his new initiative, ProPublica has found that he has also taken aim at the traditional scientific approach to autism, shutting down McCanlies' lab and stripping funding from more than 50 autism-related studies. Meanwhile, he has stood by as the Trump administration encourages the departure of hundreds of federal employees with experience studying the harm caused by environmental threats and rolls back protections from pollution and chemicals, including some linked to autism.
    


            Kennedy did not respond to requests for an interview, and an HHS spokesperson did not answer specific questions from ProPublica, including those related to the concerns of the coalition of autism scientists. “Under the leadership of Secretary Kennedy, HHS is taking action on autism as the public health emergency it is,” the spokesperson wrote. “NIH is fully committed to leaving no stone unturned in confronting this catastrophic epidemic — employing only gold-standard, evidence-based science. The Department will follow the science, wherever it leads.”
    


            Genetic factors account for a significant portion of autism cases. Research like the kind McCanlies and other government-funded scientists have conducted over the past two decades has established that environmental factors have a role, too, and can combine with genetics. Multiple factors can even converge within the same individual. Some of those environmental risks could be reduced by the very measures the Trump administration is rolling back.
    


            Kennedy would have been well positioned to advocate for researchers looking into the environmental causes of autism while sitting on President Donald Trump's cabinet.
    


            The nephew of President John F. Kennedy and son of his former attorney general, Bobby, Kennedy spent decades as an attorney battling some of the world's most notorious corporate polluters. Once heralded by Time Magazine as one of the “heroes for the planet,” he railed against actions by the first Trump administration, complaining in his 2017 introduction to the book “Climate in Crisis” that 33 years' worth of his work was “reduced to ruins as the president mounted his assault on science and environmental protection.”
    


            But recently he has remained publicly silent as the Environmental Protection Agency halts research and weakens regulations on air pollution and chemicals, including some McCanlies and her colleagues have identified as possible factors in the development of autism.
    


            “I don't think he's aware of my work,” McCanlies said, “or most of the literature that's been published on what the causes of autism are.”
    


            McCanlies was studying how a toxic chemical, beryllium, causes chronic lung inflammation in workers when she began to think seriously about autism.
    


            It was 2005, and her college-age stepson had a job shadowing children with autism. As he described helping them navigate playground dynamics, reminding them to return a wave or a greeting, McCanlies wondered whether their behaviors might be tied to chemicals their parents had encountered on the job. Could the exposures have altered genes their parents passed down? Could they have infiltrated the kids' developing brains through the womb or through breast milk?
    


            The questions remained abstract until McCanlies met another researcher named Irva Hertz-Picciotto, who had a unique data set. She had collected detailed information on the occupations of two large groups of parents: those who had children with autism and those whose kids developed neurotypically. Comparing the groups' chemical exposures before their children were born could help illuminate causes of the condition, McCanlies realized.
    


            Hertz-Picciotto, an environmental epidemiologist based at the University of California, Davis, was a pioneer in the search for the causes of autism. In 2009, she published a much-cited paper highlighting a sevenfold increase in diagnoses in California. While others had asserted the rise was due to increased awareness and broadened diagnostic criteria, Hertz-Picciotto found those factors could only partially explain it. She and others went on to document additional contributors to autism risk, including parental age at the time of birth, a mother's fever during pregnancy and more traditional environmental considerations, such as chemical exposures.
    


            McCanlies hadn't studied autism. But she offered Hertz-Picciotto her experience in genetics and epidemiology as well as the considerable resources of her agency. NIOSH was established in 1970 to investigate the dangers of the workplace, and its statisticians and industrial hygienists were among the world's experts on the health impacts of chemical exposures.
    


            Their first collaboration, published in 2012, used Hertz-Picciotto's data to see if parents of children with autism were more likely to have been exposed to chemicals already thought to be dangerous to the developing brain. The work was technical and time-consuming, but the analysis showed a clear relationship: Mothers and fathers of children with autism were more likely than the parents of unaffected children to have been exposed to solvents such as lacquer, varnish and xylene on the job. These solvents evaporate quickly and can be easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Chemical plant workers, painters, electricians, plumbers, construction workers, cleaners and medical personnel are among those who may be exposed to these solvents.
    


            The sample size was small — just 174 families. But the results lined up with recent findings showing possible links between autism and exposure to metals and certain solvents during pregnancy or early childhood, including a solvent called methylene chloride. They also tracked with studies linking the chemicals to miscarriage, reproductive problems, birth defects and developmental problems other than autism.
    


            McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto followed up with a 2019 study that looked at more than 950 families. It showed that women exposed to solvents at work during pregnancy and the three months leading up to it were 1.5 times more likely to have a child with autism than women not exposed to the chemicals. (The study did not find a link for chemically exposed men.)
    


            Their third study, published in 2023, took the link between solvent exposure and autism as a starting point. Using blood samples to examine the genetic makeup of the parents of children with autism, McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto found that when exposed to solvents on the job, people with specific variants of 31 genes had an especially elevated risk of having a child with autism. Their genetic makeup appeared to increase the risk that solvents by themselves posed. Some of those 31 genes help cells connect with one another; others play a role in helping cells migrate to different areas so they can grow into the various parts of the brain; still others ensure that cells clear away toxic substances.
    


            Researchers were also making strides under the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a division of Health and Human Services, which has financed investigations into dozens of environmental contaminants. Several have been linked to autism, including air pollution, certain pesticides, a plastic additive known as BPA and diesel exhaust, which causes “autism-like behavioral changes” in mice. In 2021, Hertz-Picciotto co-published a study linking “forever chemicals” called PFOA and PFNA with the condition. (In 2023, a second paper also found an association with PFNA.) Other government-funded research has established a link between autism and another solvent, trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, which has been used for dry cleaning, manufacturing and degreasing machines.
    


            Together, the results have shown that many exposures can increase the likelihood of autism, and that there can be multiple causes for any one person.
    


            At least one exposure can have the opposite effect: A study by a researcher named Rebecca Schmidt — and funded by the NIEHS and NIH — found that a B vitamin called folic acid was associated with a significant decrease in the chances of an autism diagnosis. More than a dozen studies have since confirmed the association.
    


            One problem hung over much of autism research. The sweeping diagnosis includes everyone from people who treasure their neurological differences to those with debilitating symptoms, including repetitive behaviors, excruciating sensitivity to touch and sounds, and difficulty responding to social situations. McCanlies and Hertz–Picciotto wondered whether certain chemicals were linked to the most severe cases or to specific symptoms.
    


            In 2023, they set about finding out.
    


            They were preparing to submit their study for publication when newly inaugurated Trump put Kennedy in charge of America's health.
    


            Despite having made chronic health conditions the focus of his agenda, Kennedy has quietly abided environmental policies that will exacerbate these problems, including autism.
    


            The Environmental Protection Agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, is rolling back rules and regulations that will result in an increase in air pollution, which multiple studies have linked to autism. The agency is in the process of reversing bans on several chemicals, including TCE, one of the solvents associated with the disorder, and has told a federal court it won't legally defend certain aspects of a ban on methylene chloride, another of the solvents linked to autism. It also began dismantling its Office of Research and Development, which has funded research into the environmental conditions contributing to autism. According to an EPA spokesperson, more than 2,300 workers have so far elected to leave the agency through Trump administration programs encouraging early retirement and resignation.
    


            The EPA also began canceling grants, including one it had given to Schmidt, the researcher who studied the protective effect of folic acid. Schmidt had been awarded $1.3 million to determine whether air pollution from wildfires might increase the risk of various neurological conditions. Schmidt and her colleagues had just done preliminary analysis and found that there was a significant association between wildfire pollution exposure and autism when she received a letter saying that the grant was terminated because the project was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.” After a judge ruled in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of University of California researchers alleging their funding was unlawfully terminated, her grant was reinstated last month. But the EPA has appealed the judge's ruling, leaving Schmidt unsure about the fate of the project.
    


            Schmidt said there is an urgent need to finish the study and warn people about how to avoid the dangers from wildfire smoke by staying indoors and using air filters and N95 masks. “Millions of pregnant women are getting exposed as we speak,” she said.
    


            Meanwhile, Kennedy has presided over his own gutting of research. Known for sharing videos of his bare-chested workouts, he likened his agency's cuts to getting rid of “unhealthy fat,” but his plan to reduce the staff of HHS by 20,000 amounts to slashing the workforce by roughly a quarter, including veteran scientists. Among the divisions Kennedy eliminated was one that studied air quality and collected data on chemicals found in human blood. Some workers in the division were subsequently reinstated. After a lawsuit and pressure from Congress, HHS has also rehired some NIOSH workers, though none at the division where McCanlies worked. Those whose jobs have not been reinstated remain on administrative leave.
    


            The reorganization plan for HHS involves consolidating the remnants of these parts of the agency, along with several others, into a new division called the Administration for a Healthy America. Asked about the transition, an HHS spokesperson told ProPublica in an email that the reorganization would save taxpayers $1.8 billion a year and that “critical programs will continue.”
    


            Meanwhile, a ProPublica review of federal data found that more than $40 million in grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health for dozens of autism-related research projects were canceled under Kennedy's watch. Some had been awarded to universities the administration is now targeting, while others ran afoul of Trump's “anti-woke” priorities by mentioning gender and other verboten terms. Among them was a grant to Harvard University to use data on nearly half a million Israeli children to evaluate whether men's exposure to air pollution affects the risk of having a child with autism. (A small number of grants have been recently reinstated.) A survey of researchers conducted by the Autism Science Foundation, which tallied cuts to training grants and the anticipated cuts to future grants over the next few years, estimated that the total loss of funding could be tens of millions more.
    


            “We're talking about probably decades of delays and setbacks,” said Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation. “To take money away from all these areas of need to focus on a question that the HHS director considers high priority seems not scientific and not the way that science is done.”
    


            Housed under the National Institutes of Health, Kennedy's new $50-million Autism Data Science Initiative is looking to fund two- to three-year research projects that plumb large public and private datasets to find “possible contributors to the causes of autism” as well as conduct research on existing treatments.
    


            With the deadline for his promised discovery fast approaching, Kennedy recently acknowledged that his initial six-month timeline was overly optimistic. He told Carlson he should have “some initial indicator answers” about the causes of autism by September, his original deadline, and promised unqualified answers within another six months.
    


            While the NIH typically releases the names of the scientists on the committees that review grant applications and the criteria they use to review them, it has not done so in this case. Nor has the agency clarified what role NIH staff will have in awarding the grants, who will make the final selection, or what terms and conditions researchers must agree to if they receive funds. HHS did not respond to ProPublica's questions about who will make the final grant selection and why the agency has not yet made this information public, but a video NIH created for applicants of the funding acknowledges that reviews of the proposals “do not follow the traditional NIH review process.” According to the video, the process was “designed to ensure integrity, fairness and transparency.”
    


            Hertz-Picciotto, who laments the fact that Kennedy is “shutting down good studies,” is among the researchers in her field who have decided to apply for the funding. “Some of his agenda is really ridiculous and very counterproductive,” she said. “But if something good can be done with this money, I'd like to be part of that.”
    


            If her project is approved, she plans to hire McCanlies to consult on it.
    


            McCanlies said she agreed to work on the project because she has complete confidence in her longtime colleague, if not the health secretary. “I don't trust him at all,” she said.
    


            McCanlies had never paid much attention to Kennedy — or to politics. Throughout the seven presidential administrations that governed while she had been at NIOSH, her work had been utterly uncontroversial. But weeks after his confirmation, she knew her job was in peril. She had deleted the first email she received from Trump's Office of Personnel Management. The tone was so strange and disrespectful, hinting that she might be punished if she didn't respond by confirming her email address, that she assumed it was a phishing attempt. By the time she received a second, suggesting that she find a “higher productivity” job in the private sector, firings and budget cuts were rolling across federal agencies.
    


            The 58-year-old, who has short, greying hair, hazel eyes and three graduate degrees, hadn't been ready to leave NIOSH's Health Effects Lab in Morgantown, West Virginia, a place where she had mentored young colleagues, taught a lunchtime meditation class and helped conduct several yearslong research projects. The lab is also where she met Fred, her husband, another Ph.D. scientist who studied workplace chemical hazards. She reluctantly put in for early retirement just days before the entire lab was dissolved.
    


            McCanlies spent her final days at NIOSH finishing her last paper, which explores the association between workplace chemicals and the severity of autism. Normally, she would have her supervisor sign off on her submission to a journal, but he had already lost his job. The rest of her colleagues were gone, too, and the lab's hallways were empty as she gave the manuscript a final edit.
    


            She felt proud of the study, which answered some of the questions she and Hertz-Picciotto had posed years ago. There were indeed links between exposures and the severity of autism. Parents' exposure to plastics was “consistently and significantly associated” with lower cognitive scores in their children who had autism, increases in “aberrant behaviors” and deficits in basic life skills, the study found. The exposure was also linked to particular symptoms of autism, including social withdrawal, hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping and body rocking. Higher autism severity scores and weaker daily living skills were also linked with ethylene oxide. Last year, the EPA imposed stricter limits on the chemical, which is used as a sterilizer. But the agency is now reconsidering those restrictions, and, in July, Trump exempted some of the biggest polluters from them.
    


            The paper, which is now available as a preprint, recommended that regulatory agencies “consider increasing awareness of these hazards and make clear recommendations for implementing protective measures at the worksite.”
    


            Having just watched so many occupational health experts forced to leave their jobs, McCanlies suspected their advice was unlikely to be heeded anytime soon.

Israel's defence minister warned Friday that Gaza's largest city could be destroyed unless Hamas yields to his country's terms, as the world's leading authority on food crises declared that the city is gripped by famine from fighting and an Israeli blockade.

A day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would authorize the military to mount a major operation to seize Gaza City, Defence Minister Israel Katz warned that it could “turn into Rafah and Beit Hanoun,” areas largely reduced to rubble earlier in the war.

“The gates of hell will soon open on the heads of Hamas' murderers and rapists in Gaza – until they agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war,” Katz wrote in a post on X.

He restated Israel's ceasefire demands: the release of all hostages and Hamas' complete disarmament. Hamas has said it would release captives in exchange for ending the war, but rejects disarmament without the creation of a Palestinian state.

Hamas issued a statement that called Katz's comments “a confession of committing a crime that amounts to ethnic cleansing.” The militant group has said it would release captives in exchange for ending the war, but it rejects disarmament without the creation of a Palestinian state.

Netanyahu on Thursday said he had instructed officials “to begin immediate negotiations” to release hostages and end the war on Israel's terms. It was not immediately clear if that meant that Israel would return to long-running talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar after Hamas said earlier this week that it accepted a new proposal from the mediators.

With ground troops already active in strategic areas, the wide-scale operation in Gaza City could start within days.

Israel says Gaza City is still a Hamas stronghold, with a network of militant tunnels, after several previous large-scale raids. The city is also home to hundreds of thousands of civilians, some who have fled from other areas, and contains some of the strip's critical infrastructure and health facilities.

Israel could also accept the latest ceasefire proposal, which would forestall the offensive. It calls for a phased deal involving hostage and prisoner exchanges and a pullback of Israeli troops, while talks continue on a longer-term cease-fire. Israeli leaders have resisted such terms since abandoning a similar agreement earlier this year under pressure from Netanyahu's far-right coalition allies.

Many Israelis fear an assault could doom the roughly 20 hostages who have survived captivity since Hamas-led militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Aid groups and international leaders warn it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian crisis.

The logistics of evacuating civilians are expected to be daunting. Many residents say repeated displacement is pointless since nowhere in Gaza is safe, while medical groups warn Israel's calls to move patients south is unworkable, with no facilities to receive them.

But Netanyahu has argued the offensive is the surest way to free captives and crush Hamas.

“These two things – defeating Hamas and releasing all our hostages – go hand in hand,” Netanyahu said Thursday while touring a command centre near in southern Israel.

Since 251 people were taken hostage more than 22 months ago, ceasefire agreements and other deals have accounted for the vast majority of the 148 released, including the bodies of eight deceased hostages.

Israel has only managed to rescue eight hostages alive and retrieved the bodies of 49 others. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza, about 20 of whom Israel believes to be alive.

The world's leading authority on food crises declared Friday that Gaza City is gripped by famine that is likely to spread if fighting and restrictions on humanitarian aid continue.

A report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification says nearly half a million people in Gaza, about one-fourth of the population, face catastrophic hunger that leaves many at risk of dying. It's the first famine confirmed by the IPC in the Middle East.

Netanyahu's office denounced the IPC report as “an outright lie.”

Israel says it has allowed enough aid to enter during the war, and it eased its blockade in recent weeks after images of emaciated children sparked international outrage. But U.N. agencies say it's not nearly enough, especially after Israel imposed a complete ban on food imports from early March to mid-May.

Gaza City's Shifa Hospital said at least 17 Palestinians were killed Friday as Israel escalates its activity in the area in the lead-up to its broader planned offensive.

An Israeli air strike hit a school in Sheikh Radwan, a Gaza City neighbourhood where tens of Palestinians shelter in makeshift tents in the schoolyard. It killed at least seven people, according to an eyewitness and hospital records.

Israel's military said it wasn't aware of a strike in the area but in a statement said troops were operating on the outskirts of Gaza City and in the Zeitoun neighborhood.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is occurring in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.

The strike is part of Israel's ongoing push in Gaza City, where the military says it is operating and witnesses have reported intense bombardment in the days since Israel approved its plans to take the city.

Amal Aboul Aas, who is now sheltering in Gaza City after being displaced four times, said the explosions were so intense he couldn't sleep, yet she couldn't leave either.

“We do not have the money, the resources, or the energy to evacuate again. I just wish for a quick death right where I am here because I am not going anywhere. Eventually one of these missiles will hit me,” she told The Associated Press.

The Gaza Health Ministry said Thursday that at least 62,192 Palestinians have been killed in the war. Another two people have died from malnutrition-related causes, bringing the total number of such deaths to 271, including 112 children, the Health Ministry said.

The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. It does not say whether those killed by Israeli fire are civilians or combatants, but it says around half were women and children. The UN and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties. Israel disputes its toll but has not provided its own.

Hamas-led militants started the war when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking hostages.

Also on Friday, foreign ministers from European countries, Australia and Britain on Friday jointly condemned Israel's plans to construct a settlement east of Jerusalem, calling it a breach of international law.

The approval of the E1 project would bisect the West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem, fragmenting territory Palestinians seek for an independent state. It was announced last week by far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and received the final go-ahead from a Defence Ministry planning commission on Wednesday.

“We condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms,” said ministers from Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.

Israel immediately dismissed the statement, saying it “rejects the attempt to impose foreign dictates upon it.”

“The Jewish people are the indigenous people of the Land of Israel. At no point in history has there ever been a Palestinian state, and any attempt to argue otherwise has no legal, factual, or historical basis,” Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

BUDAPEST, August 22. /TASS/. Hungary and Slovakia are calling on the European Commission (EC) to force Ukraine to stop attacks on the Druzhba oil pipeline, which carries oil from Russia to Europe, according to a letter from foreign ministers of the two countries, Peter Szijjarto and Juraj Blanar, to Brussels in connection with another attack by the Ukrainian army on the infrastructure of the oil pipeline on Russian territory.

"Without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries [with oil] is simply not possible," the ministers said. Oil supplies to Hungary and Slovakia from Russia may be suspended for at least five days as a result of a new attack by the Ukrainian army on the Druzhba infrastructure that occurred on the night of August 22, they added. Szijjarto and Blanar called on the European Commission to guarantee security of supplies, Reuters reported after seeing the letter received in Brussels.

Szijjarto said earlier on Friday that the Druzhba oil pipeline had been attacked again by the Ukrainian armed forces, after which oil supplies from Russia to Hungary were suspended. The attack was on the pipeline infrastructure on the Russian-Belarusian border, he said, adding that it was the third one in a short period of time. There were also reports from Slovakia about the halt in supplies of raw materials.

Earlier this week, Ukraine launched drone strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline, causing damage that required repairs by Russian specialists. Oil supplies to Hungary were interrupted for two days. Szijjarto was in contact with Russia's First Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin on the issue. Hungary described Ukraine's actions as outrageous and unacceptable, making it clear that it could stop exporting electricity to that country.

BUDAPEST, August 22. /TASS/. The Druzhba oil pipeline was attacked again by Ukrainian armed forces, suspending oil supplies from Russia to Hungary, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto reported.

"Last night, we received news of a new attack on the Druzhba oil pipeline on the Russian-Belarusian border — the third in a short period of time. Oil supplies to Hungary have been suspended again," the top diplomat wrote on his Facebook (a social media site banned in Russia since it is owned by Meta corporation classified as extremist by the Russian authorities).

"This is yet another attack on our country's energy security. It's another attempt to drag us into war. It won't work! We will continue to support peaceful efforts and defend our national interests!" Szijjarto added.

Earlier this week, Ukraine launched drone strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline, causing damage that required repairs by Russian specialists. Oil supplies to Hungary were interrupted for two days. Szijjarto was in contact with Russia's First Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin on this issue. Hungary described Ukraine's actions as "outrageous and unacceptable" and made it clear that it could stop exporting electricity to that country.

TALATAN, China (AP) — Chinese government officials last month showed off what they say will be the world's largest solar farm when completed high on a Tibetan plateau. It will cover 610 square kilometers (235 square miles), which is the size of Chicago.

China has been installing solar panels far faster than anywhere else in the world, and the investment is starting to pay off. A study released Thursday found that the country's carbon emissions edged down 1% in the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier, extending a trend that began in March 2024.

The good news is China's carbon emissions may have peaked well ahead of a government target of doing so before 2030. But China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will need to bring them down much more sharply to play its part in slowing global climate change.

For China to reach its declared goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, emissions would need to fall 3% on average over the next 35 years, said Lauri Myllyvirta, the Finland-based author of the study and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

“China needs to get to that 3% territory as soon as possible,” he said.

China's emissions have fallen before during economic slowdowns. What's different this time is electricity demand is growing — up 3.7% in the first half of this year — but the increase in power from solar, wind and nuclear has easily outpaced that, according to Myllyvirta, who analyzes the most recent data in a study published on the U.K.-based Carbon Brief website.

“We're talking really for the first time about a structural declining trend in China's emissions,” he said.

China installed 212 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first six months of the year, more than America's entire capacity of 178 gigawatts as of the end of 2024, the study said. Electricity from solar has overtaken hydropower in China and is poised to surpass wind this year to become the country's largest source of clean energy. Some 51 gigawatts of wind power was added from January to June.

Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, described the plateauing of China's carbon emissions as a turning point in the effort to combat climate change.

“This is a moment of global significance, offering a rare glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak climate landscape,” he wrote in an email response. It also shows that a country can cut emissions while still growing economically, he said.

But Li cautioned that China's heavy reliance on coal remains a serious threat to progress on climate and said the economy needs to shift to less resource-intensive sectors. “There's still a long road ahead,” he said.

A seemingly endless expanse of solar panels stretches toward the horizon on the Tibetan plateau. White two-story buildings rise above them at regular intervals.

In an area that is largely desert, the massive solar project has wrought a surprising change on the landscape. The panels act as windbreaks to reduce dust and sand and slow soil evaporation, giving vegetation a foothold. Thousands of sheep, dubbed “photovoltaic sheep,” graze happily on the scrubby plants.

Wang Anwei, the energy administration chief of Hainan Prefecture, called it a “win-win” situation on multiple levels.

“In terms of production, enterprises generate electricity on the top level, and in terms of ecology, grass grows at the bottom under the solar panels, and villagers can herd sheep in between,” he said.

Solar panels have been installed on about two-thirds of the land, with power already flowing from completed phases. When fully complete, the project will have more than 7 million panels and be capable of generating enough power for 5 million households.

Like many of China's solar and wind farms, it was built in the relatively sparsely populated west. A major challenge is getting electricity to the population centers and factories in China's east.

“The distribution of green energy resources is perfectly misaligned with the current industrial distribution of our country,” Zhang Jinming, the vice governor of Qinghai province, told journalists on a government-organized tour.

Part of the solution is building transmission lines traversing the country.

One connects Qinghai to Henan province. Two more are planned, including one to Guangdong province in the southeast, almost at the opposite corner of the country.

Making full use of the power is hindered by the relatively inflexible way that China's electricity grid is managed, tailored to the steady output of coal plants rather than more variable and less predictable wind and solar, Myllyvirta said.

“This is an issue that the policymakers have recognized and are trying to manage, but it does require big changes to the way coal-fired power plants operate and big changes to the way the transmission network operates,” he said. “So it's no small task.”

A federal judge on Aug. 21 ordered President Donald Trump and the state of Florida to stop sending detainees to “Alligator Alcatraz,” a detention center for illegal immigrants in the Everglades, and barred new construction there.

U.S. Judge Kathleen Williams, a lower court judge in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida, sided with environmental groups who had brought suit against the facility, saying that it endangers the Everglades and its wildlife.

Flying bomb can hit targets 3,000km away; Trump fumes as Russia puts further hurdles in way of peace talks. What we know on day 1,276

With both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war preparing for further fighting, Ukraine was test-launching a new long-range cruise missile, Zelenskyy said. Ukraine's president announced the huge missile, known as Flamingo, could strike targets as far as 3,000km (1,864 miles) away. “The missile has undergone successful tests. It is currently our most successful missile,” Zelenskyy told reporters. Mass production could begin by February, he added.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday that large Russian attacks in various parts of Ukraine showed Moscow was avoiding negotiations about ending the more than three-year-old war. The latest offensive included 574 drones and 40 missiles, said Ukraine's president, and was one of the largest yet.

A missile strike on the US-owned electronics firm Flex in Ukraine's far-west Zakarpattia region was a “telling” indicator of Russian intentions in peace initiatives led by Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said. “Now the signals from Russia are simply, to be honest, indecent. They are trying to back away from the need to hold meetings. They don't want to end the war. They carry on with massive strikes.”

“We believe [the Flex attack] was a deliberate strike precisely on US property here in Ukraine, on American investment,” Zelenskyy said. “A very telling strike … at the very time when the world waits for a clear answer from the Russians on their move in talks to bring an end to the war.” Nineteen people were injured in the attack. Zelenskyy said both sides were preparing for further fighting, citing Russian troop build-ups and Ukraine's own preparations including the Flamingo missile rollout.

While he has upended a years-long western policy of isolating the Russian leader, Trump has made little tangible progress towards a peace deal. On Thursday, the US president appeared to vent his frustration at Russia's obstruction, and suggested Ukraine should long since have been armed to “fight back” against Russia, writes Pjotr Sauer. In a ramble on social media blaming his predecessor, Joe Biden, Trump said: “It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader's country … There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia.” Trump signed off that there were “interesting times ahead!”.

Moscow attempted on Thursday to further deeply caveat any prospects for talks with Putin, or for peace on any terms other than Russia's. Sergei Lavrov, Putin's foreign minister, said putting European troops in Ukraine to guarantee its security was “foreign intervention” and absolutely unacceptable for Russia. He insisted the Kremlin must have a veto over any postwar support for Ukraine.

Trump set another timeframe – two weeks again – for assessing peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. “After that, we'll have to maybe take a different tack,” Trump told the rightwing media outlet Newsmax. Trump has not met any of his promised or threatened deadlines for securing peace or acting against Russia, which have ranged everywhere from 24 hours to 10 weeks.

In an attack on Ukraine's western city of Lviv, one person was killed, three wounded and 26 homes damaged, said the governor, Maksym Kozytskyi. Authorities in south-eastern Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region reported damage to businesses, homes and gas lines. A later shelling of the city of Kherson killed one person and wounded more than a dozen, a local official said.

In the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine's Donetsk region, two people were killed and at least 21 wounded after a Ukrainian shelling, said a Russian-installed official.

Kim Jong-un held a ceremony decorating North Korean troops who fought for Russia, state media KCNA said on Friday. The North Korean ruler has sent about 15,000 troops into the war, according to South Korea, with about 600 of them killed.

SEOUL, August 22. /TASS/. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has awarded the titles of Hero of the People's Republic to the commanders and soldiers of the Korean People's Army who took part in liberating the Kursk Region from Ukrainian formations, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.

This was the first such ceremony and it took place at the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. The secretaries of the Central Committee of the WPK met the military and gave them flowers. The event was attended not only by commanders and soldiers, but also by the families of fallen servicemen. Kim Jong Un delivered a speech.

"Comrade Kim Jong-un noted the outstanding valor and noble dedication of our servicemen shown in the area of operation under a hail of bullets and shells, calling them incomparable heroes, and the troops of foreign operations - heroic troops," the agency said. Kim Jong-un noted the mass heroism and called the commanders the pride of the Korean people. According to him, the participants in the operation abroad "fought bravely, as befits Koreans and the Korean People's Army."

He noted the high fighting spirit of the fighters. The leader of the DPRK offered to observe a minute of silence for the fallen soldiers and met with the families who suffered such a loss. Commander of the special forces, Colonel-General of the Ground Forces Kim Yong Bok spoke on behalf of the participants in the foreign operation.

"Comrade Kim Jong-un personally awarded the title of Hero of the DPRK to the best military commanders who led the combat units of the Republic's armed forces to victory in the operational zone abroad, as well as distinguished soldiers," the agency reported.

Under a decree of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, orders and medals were awarded. Kim Jong-un noted that the merits of the units of the Korean People's Army on the battlefield abroad have attracted attention of the whole world.

According to the leader of the People's Republic of Korea, fighting abroad "fully confirmed the power of the heroic Korean People's Army."

The Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea believes that the armed forces have demonstrated their readiness for war. According to the party's opinion voiced by Kim Jong-un, the Korean People's Army has passed "the strictest inspection in its 70-year history."

The Trump administration's Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard ordered on July 20 that the U.S. intelligence community halt the sharing of information on ongoing Russia-Ukraine peace talks with so-called "Five Eyes" countries, CBS News reported on Aug. 21.

U.S. intelligence sources told CBS News that Gabbard signed a directive barring the sharing of information with the Five Eye alliance, which includes the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, and New Zealand.

The directive limited the distribution of intelligence to information that had already been publicly released, and compartmentalized intelligence on peace talks within agencies where the intelligence originated from, according to CBS News. 

The directive also does not prohibit the sharing of information obtained through diplomatic means, nor does it affect information sharing on U.S. military planning, including aid to Ukraine.

No rationale was provided for the decision, as peace talks between Russia and Ukraine — brokered by the United States — continue. The White House did not respond to the news agency's request for comment on the matter.

U.S. President Donald continues to attempt to broker peace between Moscow and Kyiv setting out in recent days to broker bilateral talks between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The renewed attempts come days after a meeting between Putin and the U.S. president in Anchorage, Alaska, followed by Zelensky's visit to the White House.

In recent days, Western allies, including member of the so-called "Coalition of the Willing," have pushed to establish security guarantees for Kyiv, with the backing of U.S. support. With the exception of Washington, all Five Eye nations are apart of the 31-nation Coalition of the Willing.

Gabbard has previously been intertwined with matters related to the war in Ukraine, after the U.S. halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine on March 5. The decision, which was reversed soon after, followed a heated exchange between Trump and Zelensky in the White House on Feb. 28.

Gabbard has previously stirred controversy with her comments on Ukraine, having echoed in early 2022 Russian President Vladimir Putin's justification for the invasion of Ukraine, attributing the cause not to Moscow but to the Biden administration's failure to acknowledge "Russia's legitimate security concerns."

Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent. He previously worked in Canadian politics as a communications lead and spokesperson for a national political party, and as a communications assistant for a Canadian Member of Parliament. Basmat has a Master's degree in Political Management from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, and a Bachelor of Arts in Politics and Governance from Toronto Metropolitan University. 

Russia's top military and political officials joined Putin in the closed city of Sarov, which houses the Russian Federal Nuclear Center, on Aug. 22. 



The military aspect of the guarantees will involve weapons deliveries, financial support, intelligence sharing, and joint military exercises and trainings, a Presidential Office source told the news outlet Suspilne. 

Ukrainian anti-aircraft gunners shot down a Russian Orlan drone carrying two first-person-view (FPV) drones under its wings, the 118th Separate Mechanized Brigade reported. 





"How can we meet with a person who is pretending to be a leader?" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told NBC News on Aug. 22. 

The Kyiv Independent's Kate Tsurkan sits down with Oscar-winning director of "20 Days in Mariupol," Mstyslav Chernov, to discuss his new documentary, "2000 Meters to Andriivka" and why he strives to tell universal stories of resilience, bravery and hope against the backdrop of Russia's war on Ukraine.



"Viktor, I do not like hearing about this — I am very angry about it. Tell Slovakia you are my great friend," Trump wrote in response to a complaint about the strikes from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. 

"We are now working together — Ukraine, the Europeans, the United States — to make sure that these security guarantees are of such a level that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin sitting in Moscow will never try to attack Ukraine again," NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said.



"Unlike Russia, Belarus is less restricted by sanctions in the military-technical sphere and could become a channel for restoring Iran's defense capabilities," Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service reported. 

According to the Navy, Ukraine destroyed up to three Mohajer-6 drones and two Forpost drones at the Khersones airfield in the occupied peninsula.

Ukrainian forces downed 46 out of the 55 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones and decoys, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired a general whose agency's initial intelligence assessment of damage to Iranian nuclear sites from U.S. strikes angered President Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the decision and a White House official.

Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse will no longer serve as head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

The firing is the latest upheaval in military leadership and in the country's intelligence agencies, and comes a few months after details of the preliminary assessment leaked to the media. It found that Iran's nuclear program has been set back only a few months by the U.S. strikes, contradicting assertions from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

In a news conference following the June strikes, Hegseth lambasted the press for what he claimed was an anti-military bias but did not offer any direct evidence of the destruction of Iranian nuclear production facilities.

Earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that the Air Force's top uniformed officer, Gen. David Allvin, planned to retire two years early. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence — which is responsible for coordinating the work of 18 intelligence agencies, including DIA — announced that it would slash its staff and budget.

The firing of Kruse was first reported by The Washington Post.

The Justice Department on Friday released transcripts of interviews its No. 2 official did with Jeffrey Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend as the Trump administration scrambles to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose a trove of records from the sex-trafficking case.

The disclosure represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass. By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from President Donald Trump's base even as they continue to sit on other evidence they had suggested was being prepared for public release.

Trump says Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business.

Speaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan — which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.

“I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,” Trump said. “He agreed, and they've agreed to do it.”

The official announcement is expected to come later Friday, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.

After her interview, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida where she had been serving a 20-year sentence to a minimum security prison camp in Texas. 

Neither her lawyer nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move.

The Epstein case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financer's social connections over the years to prominent figures including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Trump, who has said his relationship with Epstein ended years before.

The first batch of Epstein-related files from the department includes 33,000 pages of documents, according to committee staff. 

“The Committee intends to make these records public after thorough review to ensure any victims' identification and child sexual abuse material are redacted,” a spokesperson for Oversight Committee Chair James Comer said. “The Committee will also consult with the DOJ to ensure any documents released do not negatively impact ongoing criminal cases and investigations.”

The committee subpoenaed files related to the late sexual predator following a public outcry over the administration's handling of its promises to release more information related to Epstein conduct and demise. House Democrats seized on the issue and ultimately helped push Comer to subpoena the DOJ for documents along with every living U.S. attorney general as well as Bill and Hillary Clinton. 

“The Trump DOJ is providing records at a far quicker pace than anything the Biden DOJ ever provided,” the committee spokesperson continued.

Maxwell recalled knowing about Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News.

“I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript.

Maxwell said her father was fond of Trump's then-wife, Ivana, “because she was also from Czechoslovakia, where my dad was from.”

Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from jail in Tennessee on Friday so he can rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges.



The Salvadoran national's case became a flashpoint in President Donald Trump's immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported in March. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on criminal charges.



Although Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. Those fears were somewhat allayed by a recent ruling in a separate case, which requires immigration officials to allow Abrego Garcia time to mount a challenge to any deportation order.

Trump is filing an appeal after a judge said his executive order targeting a prominent law firm violated the firm's First Amendment rights.

The executive order forbid the federal government from doing business with anyone who hires the law firm Susman Godfrey, citing the firm's election-related work performed after Trump's 2020 loss. Susman Godfrey was one of several law firms targeted by Trump's executive orders, and the firm sued in April.

In late June, District Court Judge Loren AliKhan granted summary judgment in Susman Godfrey's favor, noting that noting that by that point every court to have considered a challenge to the law-firm-related orders had found “grave constitutional violations.”

Department of Justice attorney Richard Lawson filed the notice of appeal in the D.C. Circuit Court on Friday. The President is also appealing rulings in other cases brought by law firms.

Acknowledging the change announced earlier Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth tweeted a news story about his order for troops to carry guns and said, “Common Sense.”

The Pentagon has released few details about the shift or why it was necessary that about 2,000 troops in the nation's capital for President Donald Trump's law enforcement crackdown needed to be armed.

“We're going to see whether or not they have a meeting,” Trump told reporters. “It'll be interesting to see. If they don't, why didn't they have a meeting, because I told them to have a meeting. But I'll know what I am going to do in two weeks.”

Trump said he had begun making arrangements for a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting on Monday soon after concluding White House talks with Zelenskyy and European leaders and speaking by phone with Putin.

Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, made clear on Friday that Putin won't sit-down with Zelenskyy until Ukraine agrees to certain concessions.

The president said he called earlier this month for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign after reading something written by Arkansas Republican senator.

Trump didn't clarify what he was referring to but said that after he met with Tan, he liked him and felt he was “somewhat a victim.”

He backed off his calls for his resignation after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter and met with Trump.

Muriel Bowser generally avoids directly criticizing President Donald Trump. Even when she is being harshly critical of Trump's decisions — publicly stating that his declaration of a federal crime emergency in Washington “makes no sense” — Bowser sometimes seems to structure her statements so as to avoid actually saying Trump's name.

Trump, meanwhile, seems to be escalating his attacks on Bowser. 

In a 2 a.m. Friday social media post, Trump wrote, “Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen, including a complete and total Federal takeover of the City!”

Hours later in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters, “Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor for long.”

Some members of local government have bristled at the Defense Department's order to arm National Members. 

“Trump is once again putting armed military onto the streets of an American city. These are the actions not of a president, but of someone on the march to an authoritarian takeover,” District of Columbia Council Member Charles Allen said in a statement. 

As a federal district, the local government's powers are broadly delegated to it Congress, leaving local officials few avenues to formally block or protest Trump's plan.

Members of local government have been walking a tightrope of engaging with constituents' concerns without further antagonizing the administration.

City Council Chair Phil Mendelson wrote on social media that he'd discussed “the affects of the so-called crime emergency,” among other topics, with Washington residents at a town hall last night. Council Member Brianne Nadeau posted a link to report police misconduct to city officials shortly after the Pentagon's announcement.

During his event about FIFA, Trump unexpectedly pulled out a photo of him standing next to Putin during their meeting in Alaska.

Trump said Putin sent the picture and “I'm going to sign this for him.” He added that Putin has “very respectful of me and my country, and not so respectful of others.”

Putin invaded Ukraine more than three years ago, and Trump has been frustrated by his inability to resolve the war. 

Speaking of FIFA, Trump suggested that the Russian leader wants to attend the soccer competition in the U.S.

“He may be coming and he may not, depending on what happens,” he said.

Referring to the photo, Trump said, “I thought it was a nice picture of him. OK, of me, but nice of him.”

After Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a pause in providing U.S. visas to commercial truck drivers, the Trump administration says it applies to certain foreign applicants.

The State Department said Friday that the pause affects those seeking permission to drive a truck under visas for H-2B temporary nonagricultural workers, E-2 investors in U.S. businesses or EB-3 skilled workers.

It said the government is launching a review of the way it screens foreign drivers and that “enhanced vetting” will apply to those who don't now hold valid visas.

“Applicants must demonstrate the necessary skills, experience, and English language proficiency required to safely operate these vehicles on America's roads,” the department said.

Touching the World Cup trophy is an honor usually reserved for countries that win it. But organizers of the 2026 World Cup have made an exception for Trump.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino visited the Oval Office on Friday and noted of the trophy, “Only the FIFA presidents, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it because it's for winners only.”Then, he added to Trump, “And, since you are a winner, of course you can as well.”

The president did just that, then responded, “It's pretty heavy.”

He later called the trophy “a beautiful piece of gold” and joked about keeping it and displaying in the Oval Office — which Trump has redone in a gaudy, gold-hued décor.

Trump was subsequently presented with a ticket to next year's World Cup final, which organizers said was the first ticket available for the upcoming tournament.

Trump usually wears a tie in the Oval Office, as do top aides and other officials who visit.

But in an unusual move, not only did Trump not wear a tie but none of the men standing around him did either.

Bare collars were also sported by Vice President JD Vance, FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Kennedy Center interim head Richard Grenell and Andrew Giuliani, who is heading up the president's FIFA task force.

It wasn't clear why they wore the unified look.

The president suggested that other cities will receive similar treatment to D.C.

“I think Chicago will be our next,” he said. “And then we'll help with New York.”

Trump said people in Chicago are “screaming for us to come.”

Vice President JD Vance says it's not the case that the Trump administration is targeting former national security adviser John Bolton because he's a vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

The FBI on Friday searched the home and office of Bolton, who served in the first Trump administration, as part of a criminal investigation into the potential mishandling of classified information.

Vance said in an interview with NBC News's “Meet the Press” that the investigation was in its early stages. He said the inquiry centers in part on classified documents as well as what he said was a “broad concern” about Bolton. He said if no crime is found during the investigation, no prosecution will be brought, but that if a crime is found “Ambassador Bolton will get his day in court.”

He said “no, not at all” when asked if Bolton was being pursued because of his criticism of Trump and, that if that were the case, “we would just throw out prosecutions willy-nilly.”

Speaking from the Oval Office alongside FIFA head Gianni Infantino, the president said the FIFA draw would take place at the Kennedy Center on Dec. 5.

Trump has made the Kennedy Center a focal point for his efforts to remake Washington, visiting it earlier in the day and talking extensively about renovations to the building. He referred to it as the “Trump-Kennedy Center.”

ESPN had previously reported that the draw would be held in Las Vegas.

The Education Department's Office of Civil Rights issued the finding against the public university in Virginia.

The department says the university must review its policies, conduct annual trainings and issue a statement that includes a personal apology from the president. It directs the university to comply within 10 days.University officials did not respond immediately to an email request for comment on Friday.

The federal investigation follows a complaint by multiple professors accusing the university of favoring faculty candidates based on diversity considerations rather than their credentials.

President Trump's announcement Friday that he would seek $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington D.C. will likely be received with ironic eyerolls from the local government. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the D.C. Council have spent most of 2025 (prior to the current federal takeover crisis) dealing with an artificial budget crisis created by this Congress.

An obscure change in a federal government funding bill forced the district's government to revert to its 2024 budget parameters, effectively cutting $1.1 billion from its previously balanced budget midway through the financial year.

The Senate approved the funding bill with the cut but immediately followed up with a separate bill that would make the district's budget whole again. That bill has languished in the House of Representatives for months while Bowser was forced to make drastic moves to avoid layoffs. The hard feelings over the issue remain intense.

Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, a government official familiar with the matter said Friday.

The official said Canada will include the carve-out that the U.S. has on Canadian goods under the 2020 free trade deal that shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly ahead of the expected announcement by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

“We're doing some very detailed renovations, fixing things are broken. Fixing floors that are cracked up and not good anymore, and in many cases, they were done in the 50s and 60s and 70s,” Trump told reporters Friday. “We'll be doing the Lincoln Bathroom which was Art Deco.”

He said of the project, “We're making it actually incredible.”

According to the White House, the refurbishing of the Lincoln Bedroom and the adjoining sitting room — which featured strong period decor derived and adapted from the historical evidence of the Lincoln era — was completed in November 2005.

Trump suggested the Lincoln Bathroom work could “be done in about a week, two weeks” and said he was considering “doing something on the Executive Office Building” across the street from the White House saying it'd be “all cosmetic.”

Trump has already made extensive changes to the White House, including installing patio seating around the Rose Garden and promising to build a ballroom.

“We're going to be raising about $2 billion from Congress,” the president told reporters. “Congress is happy to do it.”

Trump has talked about refinishing the roads and sprucing up light poles around the capital.

“It hasn't been clean,” he said. “Now it's going to be clean.”

The president, for a while, has been covering bruising on the back of his hand with makeup that doesn't match his skin tone.

A large spread of makeup could be seen on the back of his hand on Friday that appeared more pronounced than usual.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Trump's hand bruising is “consistent” with irritation from his “frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin.”

Republican National Committee members elected Gruters on Friday at their summer meeting in Georgia. He had no opposition.

“Mr. President, thank you for your faith in me,” Gruters said after the vote.

Gruters is a Florida state lawmaker and former state party chairman who was a Trump ally even before the billionaire real estate and marketing mogul first ran for president.

Trump has tightened his grip on the RNC since his first presidential term. Gruters succeeds Michael Whatley, who stepped down to run for U.S. Senate in North Carolina.

The Texas Senate has gaveled in for a expected vote on new congressional voting maps for the 2026 midterm elections.

Republicans hope new maps pushed by President Trump will produce five new GOP seats in a bid to hold their slim majority in the U.S. House. Senate approval would send the maps to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to sign into law. Texas' gerrymandering effort has triggered a ripple effect across several states. California on Thursday passed a bill to put new Democratic-leaning districts to voters in November.

Norm Eisen, a former U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic and legal adviser to Democrats during the president's first impeachment, says the search of Bolton's home and office is “an obvious act of intimidation.”

“Raiding the home of a high-profile critic in this way is an attack on the fundamental American right to disagree with the government,” Eisen said in a joint statement with Susan Corke, executive director of the group Democracy Defenders Fund.

He contrasted the operation with the 2022 search on Trump's Florida estate when the president was investigated for keeping classified documents, saying the FBI unsuccessfully negotiated with Trump for a year before executing it.

The president said his crackdown was keeping people safe, claiming it's “the first time in anybody's memory that you haven't had a murder in a week” in the nation's capital.

That's not true, however. There were no killings for one week in July and for another week in May, according to local police statistics.

And it comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city, with the arrival this week of hundreds of troops from several Republican-led states.

The Pentagon and Army said last week that troops would not carry weapons.

The city had been informed about the intent for the National Guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The president called national security and privacy concerns related to TikTok and its Chinese parent company “highly overrated.”

“I used TikTok in the campaign,” Trump told reporters.

“I'm a fan of TikTok,” he said. “My kids like TikTok. Young people love TikTok. If we could keep it going.”

His comments follow the White House's decision to start a TikTok account this week.

Congress approved a U.S. ban on TikTok unless its parent company, ByteDance, sold its controlling stake. But Trump has extended the platform's shutdown deadline repeatedly since taking office for his second term.

“We're gonna watch the security concerns,” Trump said, but added, “We have buyers, American-buyers,” and “until the complexity of things work out, we just extend a little bit longer.”

And, speaking about the Bolton raids, said he “could be the one starting it” if he chose.

The president, in his comments to reporters at the White House Historical Association, said he's told Attorney General Pam Bondi to “do what you have to do” and that he doesn't want to know about their work, but suggested he could be much more involved if he chose, saying, “I could know about it. I could be the one starting it.”

“I'm actually the chief law enforcement officer,” he said. “But I feel that it's better this way.”

“We're going to see if Putin and Zelenskyy will be working together. It's like oil and vinegar a little bit. They don't get along too well for obvious reasons. But we'll see,” Trump told reporters. “And we'll see whether or not I would have to be there. I'd rather not, I'd rather them have a meeting and see how they can do.”

Trump has previously suggested that the White House is working to facilitate a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting in the short term, and that a subsequent, trilateral meeting involving those two leaders and Trump would likely come next.

Fed Governor Lisa Cook is under fire from Trump after an administration official alleged Wednesday that she'd falsely claimed two homes as primary residences in 2021. Primary residences often receive lower mortgage rates than homes purchased for rent or as second homes.

“I'll fire her if she doesn't resign.” Trump said Friday. His comment came as Cook is attending the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with Chair Jerome Powell.

Trump has relentlessly demanded that the Fed cut its key interest rate, which he's said would reduce interest rate costs on the government's massive $37 trillion debt pile as well as boost the housing market.

If Trump is able to oust Cook, he could install a loyalist and extend greater control over the Fed, traditionally independent from day-to-day politics. The president can't fire a Fed governor over a disagreement on rates, but can “for cause,” which typically means malfeasance or neglect of duty.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered that National Guard troops patrolling the streets of Washington for President Trump's crackdown will be armed, the Pentagon said Friday.

The Defense Department didn't immediately offer any other details about the new development.

The president, making a stop that wasn't on his public schedule, arrived at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. He told reporters at an earlier stop that he planned to show them marble that would be used in sprucing up the center, along with other planned renovations such as painting the columns from gold to white.

Trump has taken over the center by installing himself as chair and replacing the board of trustees with loyalists. He has also hinted he'd like to see the venue renamed the Trump/Kennedy Center.

President Donald Trump blasted his former national security adviser John Bolton, calling him “a lowlife” and “not a smart guy” but insisted he knows “nothing about” the FBI raids Friday morning of Bolton's home and office

The president, speaking to reporters during an unscheduled visit to the White House Historical Association, said he saw the raid of Bolton's home on television Friday morning but he didn't know anything about it.

“He is a, not a smart guy. But he could be very a very unpatriotic guy. We're going to find out.”

He said he expected to be briefed later in the day about the search of Bolton's home and office.

“I'm not a fan of John Bolton. He's a real, sort of, a lowlife,” he said.

The president made a surprise visit Friday morning to the White House Historical Association, which sits less than a block away from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue.

It wasn't clear what he was doing there and the visit wasn't on his official schedule.

Trump could be spotted on video posted on social media walking into the building with his chief of staff Susie Wiles.

The association has a gift shop and a replica of the Oval Office as part of its educational center about the White House.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door ever so slightly to lowering a key interest rate in the coming months but gave no hint on the timing of a move and suggested the central bank will proceed cautiously as it continues to evaluate the impact of tariffs and other policies on the economy.

In a high-profile speech that will be closely watched at the White House and on Wall Street, Powell said there are risks of both rising unemployment and stubbornly higher inflation. That puts the Fed in a tough spot, because it would typically cut its short-term rate to boost hiring, while keeping it high — or raising it — to fight inflation.

“The stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,” Powell said in prepared remarks. That suggests the Fed will continue to evaluate jobs and inflation data as it decides whether to cut rates, including at its next meeting Sept. 16-17.

Powell has come under relentless criticism from President Trump for not rapidly cutting rates sooner.

In an overnight social media post, Trump said he was considering “a complete and total Federal takeover of the City!”

He's already seized control of the local police department for 30 days, which could be extended with congressional approval.

Trump has claimed the city is in the midst of a crime crisis despite statistics showing a declining problem. The U.S. attorney in Washington has opened an investigation into the numbers, the latest pressure point in a tug of war between the administration and D.C. government.

“Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen,” the president wrote.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI on Friday searched the Maryland home and Washington office of former Trump administration national security adviser John Bolton as part of a criminal investigation into the potential mishandling of classified information, a person familiar with the matter said.

Bolton, who emerged as an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump after being fired in 2019 and fought with the first Trump administration over a scathing book he wrote documenting his time in the White House, was not in custody Friday and has not been charged with any crimes, said the person who was not authorized to discuss the investigation by name and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. 

The searches, seemingly the most significant public step the Justice Department has taken against a perceived enemy of the president, are likely to elicit fresh concerns that the Trump administration is using its law enforcement powers to target the Republican's foes. They come as the Trump administration has moved to examine the activities of other critics, including by authorizing a grand jury investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe that dogged Trump for much of his first term, and as FBI and Justice Department leaders signal their loyalty to the president.

Speaking to reporters during an unscheduled visit to the White House Historical Association, Trump said he had seen news coverage of Friday's searches and expected to be briefed about it by the Justice Department but also insisted he didn't “want to know about it.”

“I could know about it. I could be the one starting it. I'm actually the chief law enforcement officer. But I feel that it's better this way,” Trump said.




Bolton had said in interviews this year that he was mindful that he could be scrutinized, telling the AP in January shortly before Trump took office, “Anybody who ever disagrees with Trump has to worry about retribution. It's a pretty long list.” 

An FBI search like the one at Bolton's properties requires authorization from a federal magistrate judge. It wasn't immediately clear what information authorities submitted to demonstrate that they had probable cause of a crime, though the Justice Department years ago launched an investigation into whether Bolton improperly disclosed classified information in a book manuscript he had written. The inquiry was later closed.

Vice President JD Vance denied in an NBC News interview on Friday that Bolton was being targeted because of his criticism of Trump, “If there's no crime here, we're not going to prosecute it. If there is a crime here, of course, Ambassador Bolton will get his day in court. That's how it should be.”

Bolton was not home for the search of his home, but after it started, he was spotted Friday morning standing in the lobby of the Washington building where he keeps an office and talking to two people with “FBI” visible on their vests. He left a few minutes later and appeared to have gone upstairs in the building. Agents were seen taking bags into the office building through a back entrance. 

Messages left with a spokesperson for Bolton were not immediately returned, and a lawyer who has represented Bolton had no immediate comment.

The FBI reportedly is investigating an ex-Trump national security adviser. AP correspondent Mike Hempen reports.

The Justice Department had no comment, but leaders appeared to cryptically refer to the searches in a series of social media posts Friday morning.

FBI Director Kash Patel, who included Bolton on a list of “members of the Executive Branch Deep State” in a 2023 book he wrote, posted on X: “NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.” Attorney General Pam Bondi shared his post, adding: “America's safety isn't negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.”

The Justice Department is separately conducting mortgage fraud investigations into Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump and his company, and ex-Trump prosecutor Jack Smith faces an investigation from an independent watchdog office. Schiff and James have vigorously denied any wrongdoing through their lawyers.

The Bolton searches also unfolded against the backdrop of a 2022 search for classified documents at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, an action that produced since-dismissed criminal charges but remains the source of outrage for the president and supporters who insist he was unjustly targeted despite the retrieval of top-secret records. 

Patel said in a Fox Business Channel interview this week that the Mar-a-Lago search represented a “total weaponization and politicization” of the bureau, and Trump himself referenced it on Friday, telling reporters: “I guess his house was raided today, but my house was raided, also.”

Bolton served as Trump's third national security adviser for 17 months and clashed with him over Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea. 

He faced scrutiny during the first Trump administration over a book he wrote about his time in government that officials argued disclosed classified information. To make its case, the Justice Department in 2020 submitted sworn statements from senior White House officials, including then-National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, asserting that Bolton's manuscript included classified information that could harm national security if exposed.

Bolton's lawyers have said he moved forward with the book after a White House National Security Council official, with whom Bolton had worked for months, said the manuscript no longer contained classified information.

The Biden administration Justice Department in 2021 abandoned its lawsuit and dropped a separate grand jury investigation, with Bolton's lawyer calling the effort to block the book “politically motivated” and illegitimate. 

Bolton's harshly critical book, “The Room Where It Happened,” portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy and said he “saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.”

Trump responded by slamming Bolton as a “crazy” warmonger who would have led the country into “World War Six.”

Bolton served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush and also held positions in President Ronald Reagan's administration. He considered running for president in 2012 and 2016.

Trump, on his first day back in office this year, revoked the security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials, including Bolton. Bolton was also among a group of former Trump officials whose security details were canceled by Trump earlier this year.

In 2022, an Iranian operative was charged in a plot to kill Bolton in presumed retaliation for a 2020 U.S. airstrike that killed the country's most powerful general.

The handling of classified information by top government officials has been a politically loaded topic in recent years. Besides Trump, the Justice Department also investigated whether then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, mishandled classified information after serving as vice president in the Obama administration, and the FBI also recovered what it said were classified documents from the home of former Trump Vice President Mike Pence. Neither man was charged.

President Donald Trump on Thursday visited law enforcement and National Guard troops in Washington Thursday evening, praising them for their role in his crime crackdown and saying he'll seek congressional funding for his DC intervention and beautification plans.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard troops to start carrying firearms while patrolling the streets of Washington for President Donald Trump's law enforcement crackdown, the Pentagon said Friday.

The Defense Department didn't offer any other details about the new development or why it was needed. Hegseth referred to it as “common sense” on social media.

No troops have been spotted yet with firearms around the city in the hours after the announcement. The decision is an escalation in the Republican administration's intervention in the nation's capital and comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members have been stationed in the heavily Democratic city.

Some local officials were harshly critical, with D.C. Council Member Charles Allen saying Trump's actions are “not of a president, but of someone on the march to an authoritarian takeover.”

Trump initially called up 800 members of the District of Columbia National Guard to assist federal law enforcement in his bid to crack down on crime, homelessness and illegal immigration. Since then, six Republican-led states have sent troops to the city, growing the military presence.

It's unclear how long the deployment will last.

“If I have to, I'll declare a national emergency, which I don't think I'll have to do,” Trump said. 

He suggested that he could take a similar approach in other cities, such as Chicago and maybe New York. 




“After we do this, we'll go to another location, and we'll make it safe also,” Trump said in the Oval Office. Referring to Chicago as “a mess,” he said, “that will be our next one after this.”

There were no signs that the National Guard's role in D.C. would be changing. The troops have not taken part in law enforcement and largely have been protecting landmarks including the National Mall and Union Station and helping with crowd control. 

Some troops have fed squirrels. One Guard member helped a woman carry her belongings down the stairs in a train station. Others have been seen taking photos with passers-by, standing around chatting and drinking coffee. There have been no overt indications that they have faced threats that would require weapons. 

Trump has boasted that the city is safer than ever because of his intervention. He told reporters Friday that “it's a miracle what's happened.”

“D.C. was a hellhole,” he said. “But now it's safe.”

He suggested that he could prolong the deployment of troops and federal agents in Washington.

“The big question is how long do we stay?” he said. “Because if we stay, we want to make sure it doesn't come back. So we have to take care of these criminals and get them out.”

Trump noted that he would ask Congress for $2 billion to improve the appearance of the city, including resurfacing roads and replacing streetlights. He's previously pledged to improve the grass to look like one of his golf courses.

“It's going to be safe, and it's going to be beautified,” he said.

Trump's decision to seek more money for sprucing up Washington comes months after the Republican-controlled Congress passed legislation that essentially forced a $1.1 billion budget cut on the city. Local leaders have pleaded for a fix, but to no avail. 

The Pentagon and the Army had said last week that troops would not carry guns. The new guidance is that they will carry their service-issued weapons.

Alex Wagner, a former chief of staff to the Army secretary and assistant secretary for the Air Force during Democratic administrations, said asking troops to carry firearms is a “recipe for disaster.”

He said most National Guard members don't have the right training for Trump's law enforcement crackdown and are being put in a “no-win situation.”

“Do they have any role that would require them to have firearms? No,” he said. 

However, Wagner said, if there are confrontations, “the White House can spin that to their political advantage.”

The city's police department and the offices of Mayor Muriel Bowser and Attorney General Brian Schwalb did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

As a federal district, the city government's powers are broadly delegated to it by Congress, providing few avenues to formally resist Trump's plans. Local officials have been walking a tightrope between acknowledging constituents' concerns and antagonizing Trump, who has threatened even more aggressive action toward D.C.

City Council Chair Phil Mendelson wrote on social media that he had discussed the effects of “the so-called crime emergency” and other topics at a town hall Thursday night, while Council Member Brianne Nadeau posted a link to report police misconduct to city officials.

The city had been informed about the intent for the National Guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Spokespeople for the District of Columbia National Guard and a military task force overseeing all the guard troops in Washington did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

Ambulances, choppers on site in Illinois

Multiple people are dead, including children, after a tour bus traveling from Niagra Falls to New York City on Friday crashed and rolled over on the highway in Genesee County, New York.

The crash, which involved a tractor-trailer and a tour bus, happened near mile marker 4039, according to New York State Police.

The tour bus was carrying about 50 passengers, troopers said. A passenger manifest provided by the bus company confirms 52 individuals, including the driver, were on board.

Trooper James O'Callaghan told Fox News Digital at least three people are dead and multiple people are unaccounted for. Some passengers were ejected from the bus and others likely remain trapped underneath it.

Passengers were seen standing near the bus following the crash. (X/ @WBEN)

The FBI is searching the Maryland home and Washington office of John Bolton, who served in President Donald Trump's first administration as national security adviser, as part of an investigation into the handling of classified information, a person familiar with the matter said Friday.

Bolton emerged as an outspoken critic of Trump after being fired in 2019 and feuded with the first Trump administration over a scathing book he wrote documenting his time in the White House.

He was not in custody Friday and has not been charged with any crimes, said the person, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation by name and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. 

The searches, seemingly the most significant public step the Justice Department has taken against a perceived enemy of the president, are likely to elicit fresh alarm that the Trump administration is using its law enforcement powers to go after his foes. The searches of Bolton's home and office come as the Trump administration has taken steps to examine the activities of other critics, including by authorizing a grand jury investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe that dogged Trump for much of his first term.

Touching the World Cup trophy is an honor usually reserved for countries that win it. But organizers of the 2026 World Cup have made an exception for Trump.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino visited the Oval Office on Friday and noted of the trophy, “Only the FIFA presidents, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it because it's for winners only.”Then, he added to Trump, “And, since you are a winner, of course you can as well.”

The president did just that, then responded, “It's pretty heavy.”

He later called the trophy “a beautiful piece of gold” and joked about keeping it and displaying in the Oval Office — which Trump has redone in a gaudy, gold-hued décor.

Trump was subsequently presented with a ticket to next year's World Cup final, which organizers said was the first ticket available for the upcoming tournament.

Trump usually wears a tie in the Oval Office, as do top aides and other officials who visit.

But in an unusual move, not only did Trump not wear a tie but none of the men standing around him did either.

Bare collars were also sported by Vice President JD Vance, FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Kennedy Center interim head Richard Grenell and Andrew Giuliani, who is heading up the president's FIFA task force.

It wasn't clear why they wore the unified look.

The president suggested that other cities will receive similar treatment to D.C.

“I think Chicago will be our next,” he said. “And then we'll help with New York.”

Trump said people in Chicago are “screaming for us to come.”

Vice President JD Vance says it's not the case that the Trump administration is targeting former national security adviser John Bolton because he's a vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

The FBI on Friday searched the home and office of Bolton, who served in the first Trump administration, as part of a criminal investigation into the potential mishandling of classified information.

Vance said in an interview with NBC News's “Meet the Press” that the investigation was in its early stages. He said the inquiry centers in part on classified documents as well as what he said was a “broad concern” about Bolton. He said if no crime is found during the investigation, no prosecution will be brought, but that if a crime is found “Ambassador Bolton will get his day in court.”

He said “no, not at all” when asked if Bolton was being pursued because of his criticism of Trump and, that if that were the case, “we would just throw out prosecutions willy-nilly.”

Speaking from the Oval Office alongside FIFA head Gianni Infantino, the president said the FIFA draw would take place at the Kennedy Center on Dec. 5.

Trump has made the Kennedy Center a focal point for his efforts to remake Washington, visiting it earlier in the day and talking extensively about renovations to the building. He referred to it as the “Trump-Kennedy Center.”

ESPN had previously reported that the draw would be held in Las Vegas.

The Education Department's Office of Civil Rights issued the finding against the public university in Virginia.

The department says the university must review its policies, conduct annual trainings and issue a statement that includes a personal apology from the president. It directs the university to comply within 10 days.University officials did not respond immediately to an email request for comment on Friday.

The federal investigation follows a complaint by multiple professors accusing the university of favoring faculty candidates based on diversity considerations rather than their credentials.

President Trump's announcement Friday that he would seek $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington D.C. will likely be received with ironic eyerolls from the local government. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the D.C. Council have spent most of 2025 (prior to the current federal takeover crisis) dealing with an artificial budget crisis created by this Congress.

An obscure change in a federal government funding bill forced the district's government to revert to its 2024 budget parameters, effectively cutting $1.1 billion from its previously balanced budget midway through the financial year.

The Senate approved the funding bill with the cut but immediately followed up with a separate bill that would make the district's budget whole again. That bill has languished in the House of Representatives for months while Bowser was forced to make drastic moves to avoid layoffs. The hard feelings over the issue remain intense.

Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, a government official familiar with the matter said Friday.

The official said Canada will include the carve-out that the U.S. has on Canadian goods under the 2020 free trade deal that shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly ahead of the expected announcement by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

“We're doing some very detailed renovations, fixing things are broken. Fixing floors that are cracked up and not good anymore, and in many cases, they were done in the 50s and 60s and 70s,” Trump told reporters Friday. “We'll be doing the Lincoln Bathroom which was Art Deco.”

He said of the project, “We're making it actually incredible.”

According to the White House, the refurbishing of the Lincoln Bedroom and the adjoining sitting room — which featured strong period decor derived and adapted from the historical evidence of the Lincoln era — was completed in November 2005.

Trump suggested the Lincoln Bathroom work could “be done in about a week, two weeks” and said he was considering “doing something on the Executive Office Building” across the street from the White House saying it'd be “all cosmetic.”

Trump has already made extensive changes to the White House, including installing patio seating around the Rose Garden and promising to build a ballroom.

“We're going to be raising about $2 billion from Congress,” the president told reporters. “Congress is happy to do it.”

Trump has talked about refinishing the roads and sprucing up light poles around the capital.

“It hasn't been clean,” he said. “Now it's going to be clean.”

The president, for a while, has been covering bruising on the back of his hand with makeup that doesn't match his skin tone.

A large spread of makeup could be seen on the back of his hand on Friday that appeared more pronounced than usual.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Trump's hand bruising is “consistent” with irritation from his “frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin.”

Republican National Committee members elected Gruters on Friday at their summer meeting in Georgia. He had no opposition.

“Mr. President, thank you for your faith in me,” Gruters said after the vote.

Gruters is a Florida state lawmaker and former state party chairman who was a Trump ally even before the billionaire real estate and marketing mogul first ran for president.

Trump has tightened his grip on the RNC since his first presidential term. Gruters succeeds Michael Whatley, who stepped down to run for U.S. Senate in North Carolina.

The Texas Senate has gaveled in for a expected vote on new congressional voting maps for the 2026 midterm elections.

Republicans hope new maps pushed by President Trump will produce five new GOP seats in a bid to hold their slim majority in the U.S. House. Senate approval would send the maps to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to sign into law. Texas' gerrymandering effort has triggered a ripple effect across several states. California on Thursday passed a bill to put new Democratic-leaning districts to voters in November.

Norm Eisen, a former U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic and legal adviser to Democrats during the president's first impeachment, says the search of Bolton's home and office is “an obvious act of intimidation.”

“Raiding the home of a high-profile critic in this way is an attack on the fundamental American right to disagree with the government,” Eisen said in a joint statement with Susan Corke, executive director of the group Democracy Defenders Fund.

He contrasted the operation with the 2022 search on Trump's Florida estate when the president was investigated for keeping classified documents, saying the FBI unsuccessfully negotiated with Trump for a year before executing it.

The president said his crackdown was keeping people safe, claiming it's “the first time in anybody's memory that you haven't had a murder in a week” in the nation's capital.

That's not true, however. There were no killings for one week in July and for another week in May, according to local police statistics.

And it comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city, with the arrival this week of hundreds of troops from several Republican-led states.

The Pentagon and Army said last week that troops would not carry weapons.

The city had been informed about the intent for the National Guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The president called national security and privacy concerns related to TikTok and its Chinese parent company “highly overrated.”

“I used TikTok in the campaign,” Trump told reporters.

“I'm a fan of TikTok,” he said. “My kids like TikTok. Young people love TikTok. If we could keep it going.”

His comments follow the White House's decision to start a TikTok account this week.

Congress approved a U.S. ban on TikTok unless its parent company, ByteDance, sold its controlling stake. But Trump has extended the platform's shutdown deadline repeatedly since taking office for his second term.

“We're gonna watch the security concerns,” Trump said, but added, “We have buyers, American-buyers,” and “until the complexity of things work out, we just extend a little bit longer.”

And, speaking about the Bolton raids, said he “could be the one starting it” if he chose.

The president, in his comments to reporters at the White House Historical Association, said he's told Attorney General Pam Bondi to “do what you have to do” and that he doesn't want to know about their work, but suggested he could be much more involved if he chose, saying, “I could know about it. I could be the one starting it.”

“I'm actually the chief law enforcement officer,” he said. “But I feel that it's better this way.”

“We're going to see if Putin and Zelenskyy will be working together. It's like oil and vinegar a little bit. They don't get along too well for obvious reasons. But we'll see,” Trump told reporters. “And we'll see whether or not I would have to be there. I'd rather not, I'd rather them have a meeting and see how they can do.”

Trump has previously suggested that the White House is working to facilitate a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting in the short term, and that a subsequent, trilateral meeting involving those two leaders and Trump would likely come next.

Fed Governor Lisa Cook is under fire from Trump after an administration official alleged Wednesday that she'd falsely claimed two homes as primary residences in 2021. Primary residences often receive lower mortgage rates than homes purchased for rent or as second homes.

“I'll fire her if she doesn't resign.” Trump said Friday. His comment came as Cook is attending the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with Chair Jerome Powell.

Trump has relentlessly demanded that the Fed cut its key interest rate, which he's said would reduce interest rate costs on the government's massive $37 trillion debt pile as well as boost the housing market.

If Trump is able to oust Cook, he could install a loyalist and extend greater control over the Fed, traditionally independent from day-to-day politics. The president can't fire a Fed governor over a disagreement on rates, but can “for cause,” which typically means malfeasance or neglect of duty.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered that National Guard troops patrolling the streets of Washington for President Trump's crackdown will be armed, the Pentagon said Friday.

The Defense Department didn't immediately offer any other details about the new development.

The president, making a stop that wasn't on his public schedule, arrived at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. He told reporters at an earlier stop that he planned to show them marble that would be used in sprucing up the center, along with other planned renovations such as painting the columns from gold to white.

Trump has taken over the center by installing himself as chair and replacing the board of trustees with loyalists. He has also hinted he'd like to see the venue renamed the Trump/Kennedy Center.

President Donald Trump blasted his former national security adviser John Bolton, calling him “a lowlife” and “not a smart guy” but insisted he knows “nothing about” the FBI raids Friday morning of Bolton's home and office

The president, speaking to reporters during an unscheduled visit to the White House Historical Association, said he saw the raid of Bolton's home on television Friday morning but he didn't know anything about it.

“He is a, not a smart guy. But he could be very a very unpatriotic guy. We're going to find out.”

He said he expected to be briefed later in the day about the search of Bolton's home and office.

“I'm not a fan of John Bolton. He's a real, sort of, a lowlife,” he said.

The president made a surprise visit Friday morning to the White House Historical Association, which sits less than a block away from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue.

It wasn't clear what he was doing there and the visit wasn't on his official schedule.

Trump could be spotted on video posted on social media walking into the building with his chief of staff Susie Wiles.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door ever so slightly to lowering a key interest rate in the coming months but gave no hint on the timing of a move and suggested the central bank will proceed cautiously as it continues to evaluate the impact of tariffs and other policies on the economy.

In a high-profile speech that will be closely watched at the White House and on Wall Street, Powell said there are risks of both rising unemployment and stubbornly higher inflation. That puts the Fed in a tough spot, because it would typically cut its short-term rate to boost hiring, while keeping it high — or raising it — to fight inflation.

“The stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,” Powell said in prepared remarks. That suggests the Fed will continue to evaluate jobs and inflation data as it decides whether to cut rates, including at its next meeting Sept. 16-17.

Powell has come under relentless criticism from President Trump for not rapidly cutting rates sooner.

In an overnight social media post, Trump said he was considering “a complete and total Federal takeover of the City!”

He's already seized control of the local police department for 30 days, which could be extended with congressional approval.

Trump has claimed the city is in the midst of a crime crisis despite statistics showing a declining problem. The U.S. attorney in Washington has opened an investigation into the numbers, the latest pressure point in a tug of war between the administration and D.C. government.

“Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen,” the president wrote.

A few local police cars were stationed across the street from Bolton's house outside Washington as FBI agents passed in and out. The tan-and-brick structure is set back from a two-lane road on a leafy suburban street.

Reporters and curious neighbors gathered across the street, including a man who gave only his first name as David. He said it appears Bolton is being targeted because of his disagreement with the Trump, a “frightening” prospect.

The crowd grew to include prominent Trump critic George Conway as passing cars slowed near the scene. One driver shouted “shame on you!”

The plot was in presumed retaliation for a January 2020 U.S. airstrike that killed the country's most powerful general. Bolton had by then left the Trump administration but tweeted, “Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran.”

In his book “The Room Where It Happened,” Bolton portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy and said he “saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.”

Trump responded by slamming Bolton as a “crazy” war-monger who would have led the country into “World War Six.”

The president is scheduled to make an “announcement” at noon ET in the Oval Office. It's unclear what it will be about.

This is the only event on Trump's public schedule.

Bolton faced scrutiny during the first Trump administration over a book he wrote about his time in government, “The Room Where it Happened,” that officials argued disclosed classified information.

The Justice Department in 2021 abandoned its lawsuit and dropped a separate grand jury investigation.

Bolton's lawyers have said he moved forward with the book, which was published in 2020, after a White House National Security Council official, with whom Bolton had worked for months, had said the manuscript no longer contained classified information.

As the search was ongoing, Bolton could be seen standing inside in the lobby of the Washington building where he keeps an office and talking to two people with “FBI” visible on their vests.

He was spotted by an Associated Press reporter who arrived at the building. Bolton left a few minutes later and appeared to have gone upstairs in the building.

Longtime political adviser Roger Stone, who was prosecuted during the Russia investigation and later pardoned by Trump, was gleeful on social media.

“How does it feel to have your home raided at 6 o'clock in the morning?” he posted.

FBI Director Kash Patel, who in a 2023 book he wrote included Bolton in a list of “members of the Executive Branch Deep State,” posted on X: “NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.” Attorney General Pam Bondi shared his post, adding: “America's safety isn't negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.”

That's according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss the investigation by name and spoke on the condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.

On his first day back in office this year, Trump, a Republican, revoked the security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials, including Bolton. Bolton was also among a trio of former Trump officials whose security details were canceled by Trump earlier this year.

During Trump's first term, Bolton served as the president's third national security adviser for 17 months and clashed with him over Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea. The first Trump administration had unsuccessfully sought to block the publication of a Bolton book that it said contained classified information.

Live Updates


• Search at Bolton's home: The FBI conducted a court-authorized search this morning at the home of John Bolton, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, according to a person familiar with the matter. Trump told reporters he knows “nothing” about the probe but expects to be briefed later today.
    


• Redistricting efforts: The Texas Senate is poised to pass a Republican-drawn congressional map today that would create five more GOP-leaning House districts, a move backed by Trump. And in California, lawmakers passed three bills to temporarily redraw their state's congressional maps — a counterpunch to efforts in GOP-led states.
    


• Trump eyes expanded crackdown: The president said yesterday he would expand the law enforcement and National Guard crackdown he ordered in Washington, DC, this month to other jurisdictions.
    


            Vice President JD Vance deflected when asked today if the FBI search of John Bolton's home and office was retribution for his criticism of President Donald Trump's foreign policy knowledge, saying in part that the media and Americans should “let the investigation unfold.”
    


            “I suspect that if the media and the American people let this case actually unfold, if they let the investigation unfold, as it's currently doing, they're going to find out that what we're doing is being very deliberate and being very driven by the national interest, and by the law here and that's as it should be,” Vance said in an interview on NBC for “Meet the Press.”
    


            The vice president also emphasized that the investigation is in the “very early stages” and that the administration will let the “investigation proceed.”
    


                    “We're in the very early stages of an ongoing investigation into John Bolton. I will say we're going to let that investigation proceed,” Vance said.
                





            CNN observed FBI personnel at Bolton's house in the Washington, DC, area this morning. They were seen speaking to a person on the porch of the house, and at least four to six agents were seen going inside. Some of the agents took bags out of the vehicles to bring inside, but nothing was seen coming out of the residence.
    


            President Donald Trump was asked earlier this morning about the FBI search of his former national security adviser John Bolton's home.
    


            The president said he knows “nothing about it” and he expects to be briefed later on.
    


Here's what else he said:

            Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced he's lifting retaliatory tariffs that were placed on an extensive list of American goods earlier this year. The move is set to take effect September 1.
    


            The tariffs he's dropping include those on goods that comply with the terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Carney said. Carney, however, is not removing the 25% tariff placed on American steel and aluminum, as well as tariffs on American cars.
    


            Carney said Trump specifically told him that removing these tariffs would kick-start trade negotiations. Carney sought to establish throughout a news conference that he's not capitulating to Trump by removing tariffs but rather was “matching” the US, which hasn't charged duties on Canadian goods that comply with USMCA.
    


More context: Canada is America's top export market and has been one of the only countries so far to impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods. The move to lift tariffs could boost the American economy if businesses import more from the United States as a result.
    


            It comes after Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney spoke yesterday.
    


            Carney said he and Trump agreed to “intensify our discussions to address current trade challenges in those strategic sectors and to seize major immediate opportunities for us both in trade, investment and security.”
    


            Today's move was viewed as a goodwill gesture by the White House.
    


                    “We welcome this move by Canada, which is long overdue,” a White House official told CNN.
                





            The official added: “We look forward to continuing our discussions with Canada on the Administration's trade and national security concerns.”

            President Donald Trump is planning to announce this afternoon that the 2026 World Cup draw will occur at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, on December 5, according to a senior White House official.
    


            The World Cup draw is typically in December ahead of the quadrennial tournament and will spell out all the matchups for the group stages for the month-long showcase. This year's World Cup features more teams than ever before as FIFA expanded the tournament to 48 teams for the first time.
    


Why this matters: With the draw being held at the Kennedy Center, the nation's capital will finally have a role to play in next year's tournament. Though it's typical for a host nation's capital to be included as a host city, Washington was not selected as one of the host cities for the tournament.
    


            Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino have developed a close relationship during his two terms in office and Infantino has frequently been spotted at the White House and accompanying the president at other events, including the trophy ceremony at the Club World Cup final earlier this summer.
    


            The Republican National Committee elected Florida state Sen. Joe Gruters as its new chair today at a committee meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, replacing outgoing chairman Michael Whatley, who is running for US Senate in North Carolina.
    


            “Thank you all so much, now the party's in great hands moving forward — the skies are clear,” Gruters joked. “No, I love the chairman, what an incredible honor.”
    


            Gruters, who previously served as the RNC's treasurer, ran unopposed, with the backing of President Donald Trump making his election a formality.
    


            Trump gave Gruters his “Complete and Total Endorsement” in a social media post earlier this month, calling him a “MAGA Warrior.”
    


More background: Gruters succeeds Whatley, who took the helm of the national party in 2024 following former RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel's exit amid tensions with Trump. After announcing his departure, Whatley had also touted Gruters' status as an ally to the president.
    


            The new chair takes over an RNC with an exceptionally strong balance sheet, having amassed more than $80 million in cash on hand — more than five times its Democratic counterpart.
    


A story to watch: Tension between Gruters and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over state politics has emerged as a key subplot in the state senator's elevation to RNC chair.
    


            DeSantis, who has kept the door open to another White House bid, could now find himself running in a future presidential primary partially controlled by an RNC chairman he has repeatedly spurned.

            President Donald Trump declared today that his takeover of DC law enforcement had caused a public safety “miracle” unseen in recent memory: the nation's capital going a week without a single homicide.
    


            But publicly released data from the Metropolitan Police Department shows that the district previously had multiple stretches of one week or longer without any homicides earlier this year.
    


            “DC was a hellhole, and now it's safe,” Trump told reporters this morning. “I hate to say this, because it doesn't sound very good, but there have been no murders in DC in the last week; that's the first time in anybody's memory that you haven't had a murder in a week.”
    


By the numbers: It's correct that there have been no murders in DC over the last week, according to preliminary crime data published on the MPD's crime database as of this morning. Two murders have taken place since Trump signed his executive order wresting control of the police department: one in the evening of August 11, the same day the order was signed, and another on August 13.
    


            A week without homicides is not as rare as Trump claimed, however. There were no murders reported from May 4 through May 11, April 11 to 17, and a more than two-week-long period from February 25 through March 12.
    


            There have been a total of 89 homicides so far in 2025, according to the district's data.
    


            In some cases, murders are confirmed and added into the public MPD database weeks or months after they occur, so it's possible that additional cases will be added.
    


            A separate federal magistrate authorized the search of former national security adviser John Bolton's office in DC, a source familiar with the matter told CNN's Kristen Holmes.
    


            The search of the office came after FBI agents began searching Bolton's home in suburban Maryland as part of a resumed investigation into the possible unauthorized disclosure of classified information.
    


            Law enforcement personnel had waited outside for permission to conduct the office search, the source said.
    


            President Donald Trump made an unscheduled visit this morning to “The People's House: A White House Experience” exhibit, a White House Historical Association-sponsored museum located across the street from the White House that includes miniature replicas of the home's historic rooms and a life-size Oval Office.
    


            The visit comes after CNN reported that tours to the real White House have been temporarily halted as construction is expected to begin next month on a sweeping, 90,000-square-foot ballroom addition to the White House spearheaded by Trump.
    


            Trump's ballroom is expected to expand out beyond the site of the current East Wing, which is home to the Office of the First Lady, the Military Office, the Visitors Office and the Office of Legislative Affairs.
    


            Officials from the White House, US Secret Service, National Park Service and Executive Residence staff are currently assessing how to move the tour screening process and likely truncate the tour while still capturing the essence of a White House visit during the construction.
    


            White House Historical Association President Stewart McLaurin hosted Trump at the exhibit earlier today, where Trump was spotted perusing the gift shop.
    


            “We have this wonderful People's House gallery, so that while the White House is closed for tours for this wonderful ballroom to be built, we have this 33,000-square-foot experience open seven days a week, free to the public. So until that's built and reopened, we're happy to welcome everyone here,” McLaurin said.
    


            The FBI is searching John Bolton's DC office, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            CNN saw several unmarked federal vehicles outside Bolton's office building in downtown Washington this morning. The search is now underway, the source said.
    


            As the FBI conducts searches of John Bolton's home and office, here's a bit about him:
    


            Bolton served as the US ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2006 and as national security adviser from April 2018 to September 2019, when President Donald Trump fired him, saying he “strongly disagreed with many” of Bolton's positions.
    


            Within hours of taking office this January, Trump terminated the Secret Service detail, which was assigned to Bolton due to threats against him from Iran.
    


            Bolton published a book in 2020 in which he claimed the president was woefully under informed on matters of foreign policy, obsessed with shaping his media legacy, and that Trump asked the leaders of Ukraine and China to help him win the 2020 election.
    


            Bolton is also a frequent commentator on CNN. Here's what he discussed with CNN's Brianna Keilar last night concerning Trump's rhetoric on the Russia-Ukraine war:
    


            CNN's Kaitlan Collins contributed reporting.
    


            President Donald Trump referred to himself as the “chief law enforcement officer” today when addressing the FBI search at John Bolton's home and said he expects the Justice Department to brief him later.
    


            “They'll brief me probably today sometime,” Trump said of the DOJ search at the home of his former national security adviser. But he also tried to stress his independence from the department.
    


            The president said he tells Attorney General Pam Bondi and the DOJ, “I don't want to know, but just, you have to do what you have to do.”
    


                    “I don't want to know about it. It's not necessary. I could know about it. I could be the one starting, and I'm actually the chief law enforcement officer. But I feel that it's better this way,” Trump added.
                





Keep in mind: The attorney general is traditionally referred to as the chief law enforcement officer of the federal government, including on the Justice Department website and on the White House's official webpage during the president's first term.
    


            President Donald Trump told reporters today he will speak to China President Xi Jinping “at the right time” about TikTok, as Trump has repeatedly pushed off a deadline for the app's parent company to either divest or face a US ban.
    


            “I haven't spoken to President Xi about it. At the right time, when we're set, I'll do it. In the meantime, until the complexity of things work out, we just extend a little bit longer,” the president told reporters.
    


            Trump said he thought concerns about the app's privacy and national security were “highly overrated.” The White House launched their own account on the platform earlier this week.
    


                    “I'm a fan of TikTok. My kids like TikTok,” the president said. “Young people love TikTok. If we can keep it going, good. We're going to watch the security concerns. And we have buyers, American buyers.”
                





More on TikTok: Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline of a sale-or-ban law passed under former President Joe Biden's administration, with the new deadline less than a month away on September 17.
    


            The latest delay in June kept the app accessible for its 170 million American users, despite legislation that passed last year due to bipartisan concerns that TikTok's Chinese ownership poses a US national security risk. Both the United States and China are seeking leverage in ongoing tense trade talks.
    


CNN's Kit Maher contributed reporting to this post. 



            One week after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump was noncommittal on his ability to arrange a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin, saying that the two are “like oil and vinegar.”
    


                    “They don't get along too well, for obvious reasons, but we'll see,” Trump said. “And then we'll see whether or not I would have to be there.”
                





            The president's remarks came after Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier today that there were no plans for a meeting between the two leaders.
    


            Trump said earlier this week that Putin and Zelensky would meet as part of his push to end the Russia-Ukraine war. But those plans have yet to materialize, and the US has made little apparent progress in convincing the two sides to hold direct talks.
    


            President Donald Trump just made remarks to reporters, saying that he knows “nothing” about the FBI search at his former national security adviser John Bolton's home.
    


            “I know nothing about it, I just saw it this morning, they did a raid,” Trump told reporters.
    


                    “He's a real sort of a low life,” Trump added. “When I hired him, he served a good purpose, because, as you know, he was one of the people that forced (former President George W.) Bush to do the ridiculous bombings in the Middle East. Bolton, he wants to always kill people, and he's very bad at what he does, but he worked out great for me.”
                





            CNN observed FBI personnel at Bolton's house in the Washington, DC, area earlier. The FBI had also planned to search Bolton's office this morning, according to a source familiar with the investigation, though it was unclear when that search would be conducted.
    


            The FBI is also investigating whether former national security adviser John Bolton disclosed classified information outside of his 2020 book, potentially to clients or media members, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            Investigators are focused on the book, but are also exploring other possible leaks as a form of “weaponization,” the source said.
    


Some context: The search of former national security adviser John Bolton's home stems from a now-resumed investigation into whether he disclosed classified information in his 2020 book, the source said.
    


            President Donald Trump had previously threatened to jail Bolton over the book, and the Justice Department launched an investigation into possible mishandling of classified information. But that probe was closed and a related lawsuit was dropped in 2021, when the department was under President Joe Biden.
    


            The book included material that initially was cleared for publication by career officials at the White House, but Trump political appointees sought to overturn that approval.

            The FBI probe is related to the possible retention of national security information, according to a person familiar with the investigation.
    


            John Bolton last served in government in 2019 when President Donald Trump fired him during his first administration. He then became the subject of a yearlong investigation after Trump accused him of disclosing classified information in a 2020 book.
    


            It's not clear whether the current probe is related to the same book dispute or involves other material.

TORONTO (AP) — Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Friday. 

Carney said Canada will include the carve-out that the U.S. has on Canadian goods under the 2020 free trade deal that shields the vast majority of goods from the punishing duties. 

“Canada currently has the best trade deal with the United States. And while it's different from what we had before, it's still better than that of any other country,” Carney said.

Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump spoke on the phone Thursday and Carney met with his Cabinet on Friday before making the announcment. 

The move is designed to reset trade talks between the two countries. The USMCA is up for review in 2026, and Carney called the trade pact a unique advantage for Canada at a time when it is clear that the U.S. is charging for access to its market.

Carney said the commitment of the U.S. to the core of USMCA means the U.S. average tariff rate on Canadian goods remains one of its lowest, and that over 85% of Canada-U.S. trade continues to be free of tariffs.

Canadian and Mexican companies can claim preferential treatment under the USMCA. 

Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau initially put on retaliatory tariffs in response to U.S. tariffs, but before the U.S. tariffs were applied the Trump administration exempted goods covered by the free trade deal.




Most imports from Canada and Mexico are still protected by the USMCA, but U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said, “I think the president is absolutely going to renegotiate USMCA.”

Preserving the free trade pact will be critical for Canada and Mexico. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the U.S. while more than 80% of Mexico's exports go there.

Trump has announced some sector specific-tariffs that do apply for Canada despite the USMCA — known as 232 tariffs — which are having an impact on the Canadian economy. There is a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, for example. 

“Canada and the United States have reestablished free trade for the vast majority of our goods. Canada will retain our tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos as we work intensivily to resolve the issues there,” Carney said. 

Carney previously rescinded Canada's plan to tax U.S. technology firms after Trump said he was suspending trade talks with Canada over those plans, which he called “a direct and blatant attack on our country.”

The prime minister disputed any notion that Canada is appeasing Trump, noting that Canada is matching what the U.S. is doing. 

“The president and I had a long conversation,” Carney said. “There is a review of the free trade agreement in the spring. We're starting our preparations.”

Lana Payne, president of Unifor, Canada's largest private sector union, characterized Carney's announcement as Canada backing down, and said the country shouldn't back down unless the U.S. drops all punitive tariffs. 

“Trump's attacks on auto, steel, aluminum, and forestry sectors are hurting Canadian workers in real time,” she posted on social media. “Walking back counter-tariffs isn't an olive branch. It only enables more U.S. aggression.”

Fox News' David Spunt provides details on the FBI raid at former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton's home in Maryland as FBI Director Kash Patel tweets, 'NO ONE is above the law.'

The FBI launched a raid Friday morning into the home and office of John Bolton — President Donald Trump's national security advisor from 2018 and 2019 — months after Trump yanked Bolton's security clearance in January upon taking office. 

The two men have a long history of trading barbs following Bolton's exit from Trump's first administration — all of which escalated after Bolton sought to publish a memoir in 2020 that included some unflattering details about his time in the White House. 

While Trump has labeled Bolton a "wacko" and a "dope," Bolton has had his fair share of harsh words for the president. 

"I don't think he's fit for office," Bolton said in an interview with ABC News in June 2020, ahead of his memoir's release. "I don't think he has the competence to carry out the job."

"There really isn't any guiding principle that I was able to discern other than what's good for Donald Trump's reelection," Bolton said at the time. "I think he was so focused on the reelection that longer-term considerations fell by the wayside." 

Bolton also characterized Trump as lacking focus on policy while being very fixated on himself — to the detriment of national security matters. 

"His policymaking is so incoherent, so unfocused, so unstructured, so wrapped around his own personal political fortunes, that mistakes are being made that will have grave consequences for the national security of the United States," Bolton also said in an ABC interview in June 2020. 

The first Trump administration sought to block the release of Bolton's memoir, "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," and asserted it contained classified material. 

The book alleged that Trump "pleaded" Chinese President Xi Jinping to support Trump's reelection campaign, and called the president "stunningly uninformed."

While the Justice Department attempted to prevent its publication on the grounds that the book disclosed classified matters pertaining to U.S. intelligence sources and methods, a federal judge signed off on the publication of the book, which ultimately was published June 23, 2020. 

Meanwhile, Trump discredited Bolton's assertions included in the book, and hurled his own insults back at Bolton. 

"Many of the ridiculous statements he attributes to me were never made, pure fiction," Trump said in a social media post June 18, 2020. "Just trying to get even for firing him like the sick puppy he is!"

"Wacko John Bolton's ‘exceedingly tedious'(New York Times) book is made up of lies & fake stories. Said all good about me, in print, until the day I fired him," Trump said in a separate social media post on June 18, 2020. "A disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war. Never had a clue, was ostracized & happily dumped. What a dope!"

Bolton departed his post at the White House in September 2019. While Bolton said that he left due to his own volition, Trump claimed that he fired Bolton. 

Bolton was not arrested or taken into custody following the raid on his home and office Friday.

Trump told reporters Friday that he had no knowledge of the raid and learned about it watching TV. 

"He's a, not a smart guy," Trump said Friday. "But he could be a very unpatriotic. I mean, we're going to find out. I know nothing about it. I just saw it this morning. They did a raid."

A Colorado state lawmaker resigned Thursday ahead of a vote to censure him for taking a picture of a Democratic lawmaker without her knowledge during floor proceedings.

Republican state Rep. Ryan Armagost, the former House minority whip, had been facing a vote to censure him as the photo became the center of a social media harassment campaign.

“Rep. Armagost chose to walk away rather than face accountability for his actions,” said Democratic state Rep. Yara Zokaie, the subject of the picture in question.

He was already expected to resign from his role effective Sept. 1 to pursue a new job and relationship in Arizona. Democrats indicated that they are exploring steps for the censure resolution.

“Resigning may remove him from this chamber, but it does not erase the harm he caused or the responsibility he bears for perpetuating a culture of violence against women,” Zokaie continued.

Armagost shared the picture in a private group chat with fellow Republicans. Some lawmakers compared her outfit to that of a stripper and a prostitute. 

“That's awful,” Republican state Rep. Brandi Bradley wrote in the group chat. “I didn't know it was dress like a stripper day.”

The image was then posted online on an anonymous, conservative social media account. The initial social media post on X was captioned, “Thoughts?” and was followed by a second post reading “Smash or Pass Yara Zokaie.”

The “photograph was subsequently disseminated on social media by anonymous accounts, accompanied by vulgar commentary, and comments to the social media posts quickly escalated into racist and misogynistic attacks, rape threats, and violent threats directed against the colleague and her young children,” according to the resolution to censure.

Democratic leadership in Colorado condemned Armagost's actions ahead of the vote. Assistant House Majority Leader Jennifer Bacon called it “unbecoming” of an elected official.

“It's unbecoming of a legislator to the extent that it harms somebody, it harms somebody in the workplace, and it is not the example that we want to set on behalf of the people who we are elected to represent,” she said.

Armagost has declined to comment on why he took the picture. At the time he took it, he chaired the House Workplace Harassment Committee.

“My trust with a number of Republican colleagues is completely broken and will not be rebuilt,” Zokaie said, according to Colorado Public Radio. “Minority leadership did lie to me.”

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is occurring in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and that it could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.

In the central area of Nuseirat, scores of people scuffled after a military cargo plane dropped dozens of containers of aid. In a scene of desperation and chaos, some of the boys tripped over each other, as men brandishing wooden sticks sought to clear the crowds.

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel's defense minister warned Friday that Gaza's largest city could be destroyed unless Hamas yields to his country's terms, as the world's leading authority on food crises declared that the city is gripped by famine from fighting and an Israeli blockade.

A day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would authorize the military to mount a major operation to seize Gaza City, Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that it could “turn into Rafah and Beit Hanoun,” areas largely reduced to rubble earlier in the war.

“The gates of hell will soon open on the heads of Hamas' murderers and rapists in Gaza — until they agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war,” Katz wrote in a post on X.

He restated Israel's ceasefire demands: the release of all hostages and Hamas' complete disarmament.

Famine now grips Gaza's largest city

Hamas issued a statement that called Katz's comments “a confession of committing a crime that amounts to ethnic cleansing.” The militant group has said it would release captives in exchange for ending the war, but it rejects disarmament without the creation of a Palestinian state.

Netanyahu on Thursday said he had instructed officials “to begin immediate negotiations” to release hostages and end the war on Israel's terms. It was not immediately clear if that meant Israel would return to long-running talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar after Hamas said earlier this week that it accepted a new proposal from the mediators.




With ground troops already active in strategic areas, the wide-scale operation in Gaza City could start within days.

Israel says Gaza City is still a Hamas stronghold, with a network of militant tunnels, after several previous large-scale raids. The city is also home to hundreds of thousands of civilians, some of whom have fled from other areas, and it contains some of the territory's critical infrastructure and health facilities.

Israel could also accept the latest ceasefire proposal, which would forestall the offensive. The proposal calls for a phased deal involving hostage and prisoner exchanges and a pullback of Israeli troops, while talks continue on a longer-term cease-fire. Israeli leaders have resisted such terms since abandoning a similar agreement earlier this year under pressure from Netanyahu's far-right coalition allies.

Many Israelis fear an assault could doom the roughly 20 hostages who have survived captivity since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Aid groups and international leaders warn that renewed fighting would worsen Gaza's humanitarian crisis.

The logistics of evacuating civilians are expected to be daunting. Many residents say repeated displacement is pointless since nowhere in Gaza is safe, while medical groups warn that Israel's call to move patients south is unworkable, with no facilities to receive them.

Netanyahu has argued that the offensive is the surest way to free captives and crush Hamas.

“These two things — defeating Hamas and releasing all our hostages — go hand in hand,” Netanyahu said Thursday while touring a command center in southern Israel.

Since 251 people were taken hostage more than 22 months ago, ceasefire agreements and other deals have accounted for the vast majority of the 148 who were released, including the bodies of eight dead hostages.

Israel has managed to rescue only eight hostages alive and to retrieve the bodies of 49 others. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza, about 20 of whom Israel believes to be alive.

The world's leading authority on food crises declared Friday that Gaza City is gripped by famine that is likely to spread if fighting and restrictions on humanitarian aid continue.

A report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification says nearly half a million people in Gaza, about one-fourth of the population, face catastrophic hunger that leaves many at risk of dying. It's the first famine confirmed by the IPC in the Middle East.

Netanyahu's office denounced the IPC report as “an outright lie.”

Israel says it has allowed enough aid to enter during the war, and it eased its blockade in recent weeks after images of emaciated children sparked international outrage. But U.N. agencies say it's not nearly enough, especially after Israel imposed a complete ban on food imports from early March to mid-May.

Gaza City's Shifa Hospital said at least 17 Palestinians were killed Friday as Israel escalated its activity in the area in the lead-up to its broader planned offensive.

An Israeli airstrike hit a school in Sheikh Radwan, a Gaza City neighborhood where tens of Palestinians shelter in makeshift tents in the schoolyard. The attack killed at least seven people, according to an eyewitness and hospital records.

The Israeli military said it wasn't aware of a strike in the area but in a statement said troops were operating on the outskirts of Gaza City and in the Zeitoun neighborhood.

The strike is part of Israel's ongoing push in Gaza City, where witnesses have reported intense bombardment in the days since Israel approved its plans to take the city.

Amal Aboul Aas, who is now sheltering in Gaza City after being displaced four times, said the explosions were so intense she couldn't sleep, yet she couldn't leave either.

“We do not have the money, the resources or the energy to evacuate again. I just wish for a quick death right where I am here because I am not going anywhere. Eventually one of these missiles will hit me,” she told The Associated Press.

The Gaza Health Ministry said Friday that at least 62,263 Palestinians have been killed in the war. Two more people have died from malnutrition-related causes, bringing the total number of such deaths to 273, including 112 children, the ministry said.

The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. It does not say whether those killed by Israeli fire are civilians or combatants, but it says around half were women and children. The U.N. and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties. Israel disputes its toll but has not provided its own.

Hamas-led militants started the war when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking hostages.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard troops patrolling the streets of Washington for President Donald Trump's law enforcement crackdown to start carrying firearms, the Pentagon said Friday.

The Defense Department didn't offer any other details about the new development or why it was needed.

The step is an escalation in Trump's intervention into policing in the nation's capital and comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members have been stationed in the heavily Democratic city, with the arrival this week of hundreds of troops from several Republican-led states.

Trump initially called up 800 members of the District of Columbia National Guard to assist federal law enforcement in his bid to crack down on crime, homelessness and illegal immigration. Since then, six states have sent troops to the city, growing the military presence.

It was unclear if the guard's role in the federal intervention could be changing. The troops have not taken part in law enforcement and largely have been protecting landmarks including the National Mall and Union Station and helping with crowd control. 

Some troops have fed squirrels. One Guard member helped a woman carry her belongings down the stairs in a train station. Others have been seen taking photos with passers-by, standing around chatting and drinking coffee. There have been no overt indications they have faced threats that would require weapons. 




Trump has boasted that the city is safer than ever because of his intervention. He told reporters Friday that “it's a miracle what's happened.”

“D.C. was a hell hole,” he said. “But now it's safe.”

He suggested that he could prolong the deployment of troops and federal agents in Washington.

“The big question is how long do we stay?” he said. “Because if we stay, we want to make sure it doesn't come back. So we have to take care of these criminals and get them out.”

Trump noted that he would ask Congress for $2 billion to improve the appearance of the city, including resurfacing roads and replacing streetlights. He's previously pledged to improve the grass to look like one of his golf courses.

“It's going to be safe, and it's going to be beautified,” he said.

Trump's decision to seek more money for sprucing up Washington comes months after the Republican-controlled Congress passed legislation that essentially forced a $1.1 billion budget cut on the city. Local leaders have pleaded for a fix but to no avail. 

The Pentagon and the Army had said last week that troops would not carry guns. The new guidance is that they will carry their service-issued weapons.

Alex Wagner, a former chief of staff to the Army secretary and assistant secretary for the Air Force during Democratic administrations, said asking troops to carry firearms is a “recipe for disaster.”

He said most National Guard members don't have the right training for Trump's law enforcement crackdown and are being put in a “no-win situation”

“Do they have any role that would require them to have firearms? No,” he said. 

However, Wagner said, if there are confrontations, “the White House can spin that to their political advantage.”

The city's police department and the offices of Mayor Muriel Bowser and Attorney General Brian Schwalb did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The city had been informed about the intent for the National Guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Spokespeople for the District of Columbia National Guard and a military task force overseeing all the guard troops in Washington did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

Both Republican and Democratic leaders in Virginia are condemning a sign that was shown at a protest in Arlington County that targeted Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.

The Arlington school board was meeting on Wednesday to discuss its transgender bathroom policy in the face of threats of federal funding cuts, and transgender rights protesters were outside. One person at the protest was holding a sign that is being condemned as racist.

“Hey Winsome, you have a gender neutral bathroom in your house,” one side of the sign read, with the other side reading, “Hey Winsome, if trans can't share your bathroom, then Blacks can't share my water fountain.”

Earle-Sears, the Republican candidate for governor in the 2025 election, said on social media that she was “disgusted, but not surprised.”

“I'm an immigrant, a Marine, and above all, a human being. There is no place for this disgusting hatred in our Commonwealth. Anyone who doesn't condemn this sign is complicit in approving it,” she continued.

Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, condemned the sign in a statement, calling it “racist, abhorrent, and unacceptable.” 

Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) said in a social media post, ​​“The hypocrisy of the liberal left on display again. Winsome is so much bigger than this idiocy.”

Republican groups are using the sign to target Democrats on social issues, on which they poll poorly.

“The sign was the least of the obscenities from the trans activists' display,” Virginia Project, a conservative PAC, wrote on social media.

The Arlington GOP posted a letter from Chairman Matthew Hurtt supposedly sent to the protester, thanking her.

“I couldn't have ever dreamed that someone would boost our efforts quite like you have,” the note read.

The woman behind the sign, who was not identified, told Fox 5 her message was meant to be satirical.

“It was satire meant to provoke conversation around the absurdity of prejudice. If anyone thinks we are actually supporting separate drinking fountains based on race, they are mistaken,” she said. “In the same way that drinking fountains should be usable by all races, bathrooms should be non-discriminatory.”

Other elected officials in Virginia have condemned the language. 

“This is wrong. @winwithwinsome — and Virginia — deserve better,” Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares said on social media.

“Two wrongs don't make a right. Been teaching my kids – and students – that for years. In the age of Trump it's easy to get in the gutter. We should insist on betting the better angels of our nature,” Democratic state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg said in a social media statement.

In the 2025 Virginia gubernatorial election, Spanberger is polling well ahead of Earle-Sears.

Both Republican and Democratic leaders in Virginia are condemning a sign that was shown at a protest in Arlington County that targeted Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.

The Arlington school board was meeting on Wednesday to discuss its transgender bathroom policy in the face of threats of federal funding cuts, and transgender rights protesters were outside. One person at the protest was holding a sign that is being condemned as racist.

“Hey Winsome, you have a gender neutral bathroom in your house,” one side of the sign read, with the other side reading, “Hey Winsome, if trans can't share your bathroom, then Blacks can't share my water fountain.”

Earle-Sears, the Republican candidate for governor in the 2025 election, said on social media that she was “disgusted, but not surprised.”

“I'm an immigrant, a Marine, and above all, a human being. There is no place for this disgusting hatred in our Commonwealth. Anyone who doesn't condemn this sign is complicit in approving it,” she continued.

Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, condemned the sign in a statement, calling it “racist, abhorrent, and unacceptable.” 

Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) said in a social media post, ​​“The hypocrisy of the liberal left on display again. Winsome is so much bigger than this idiocy.”

Republican groups are using the sign to target Democrats on social issues, on which they poll poorly.

“The sign was the least of the obscenities from the trans activists' display,” Virginia Project, a conservative PAC, wrote on social media.

The Arlington GOP posted a letter from Chairman Matthew Hurtt supposedly sent to the protester, thanking her.

“I couldn't have ever dreamed that someone would boost our efforts quite like you have,” the note read.

The woman behind the sign, who was not identified, told Fox 5 her message was meant to be satirical.

“It was satire meant to provoke conversation around the absurdity of prejudice. If anyone thinks we are actually supporting separate drinking fountains based on race, they are mistaken,” she said. “In the same way that drinking fountains should be usable by all races, bathrooms should be non-discriminatory.”

Other elected officials in Virginia have condemned the language. 

“This is wrong. @winwithwinsome — and Virginia — deserve better,” Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares said on social media.

“Two wrongs don't make a right. Been teaching my kids – and students – that for years. In the age of Trump it's easy to get in the gutter. We should insist on betting the better angels of our nature,” Democratic state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg said in a social media statement.

In the 2025 Virginia gubernatorial election, Spanberger is polling well ahead of Earle-Sears.

‘Ruthless' podcast co-hosts discuss the response to President Donald Trump's crime crackdown in Washington, D.C. on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

Thursday's arrests in Washington, D.C. amid the Trump administration's federal crime crackdown included a suspected member of the brutal Salvadoran street gang MS-13.

"Just yesterday we made 40 arrests, took 5 more illegal firearms off our streets, and had 36 ICE arrests—including a suspected MS-13 gang member," Attorney General Pam Bondi said on X on Friday morning. 

Thursday's arrests bring the total to 719 since President Donald Trump announced his effort to federalize the D.C. police on Aug. 11, according to Bondi. She thanked Trump for his "unwavering support to make DC safe again!"

TRUMP ADMIN ASSIGNS MILITARY ATTORNEYS TO PROSECUTE DC CRIMES AMID FEDERAL CRACKDOWN

Approximately 800 National Guard troops have descended upon the city since the order, along with countless federal agents from the FBI, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), ICE and the DEA. 

On Aug. 15, Bondi said the total number of arrests was 189, meaning that over the past week, federal authorities have arrested 530 suspected criminals, an average of almost 76 per day.

The suspects have been charged with crimes including homicide, drug trafficking, possession of illegal firearms and child sex crimes. 

With mounting criminal cases in the nation's capital, the Trump administration said Thursday that it was deploying Judge Advocate General (JAG) attorneys, who are military lawyers, to prosecute misdemeanors.

The Trump administration is cracking down on crime in D.C. and mobilizing National Guard soldiers and airmen.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized almost 2,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen to be armed in Washington, D.C. if their mission requires it, a U.S. official confirmed to FOX News. 

"At the direction of the Secretary of Defense, JTF-DC members supporting the mission to lower the crime rate in our nation's capital will soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their mission and training," a U.S. defense official told FOX News.

"The Interim Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard retains the authority to make any necessary force posture adjustments in coordination with the D.C. Metropolitan Police and Federal law enforcement partners. The D.C. National Guard remains committed to safeguarding the District of Columbia and serving those who live, work, and visit the District," the official added.

The troops could start carrying weapons in the coming days, though they will not be able to make arrests. Additionally, they will still be under orders to temporarily detain people if needed before transferring them to law enforcement as soon as possible.

NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS FROM SIX RED STATES HEAD TO DC TO HELP TACKLE CRIME

On Thursday, President Donald Trump met with law enforcement and National Guard personnel on the front lines of his crime crackdown. The president also said he was flooded with calls thanking him, telling the law enforcement personnel that it was "a great tribute to you."

"We want to make this absolutely perfect. It's our capital. And, I guess it used to be many years ago, safe, but it's certainly not had a, a very good run. And you got to be strong. You got to be tough. You got to do your job. Whatever it takes to do your job, you got to do your job," Trump said.

Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins reports on the Trump administration's latest efforts to combat Latin American drug cartels on 'Special Report.'

A Navy sailor may face life in prison after a San Diego jury found him guilty of selling military secrets to China on Thursday. 

Prosecutors said Jinchao "Patrick" Wei, 25, used his position as a machinist's mate on the amphibious assault ship USS Essex at Naval Base San Diego to collect sensitive information and offer it to a Chinese intelligence officer who recruited him in February 2022. Wei held a security clearance and had access to information about the weapons systems aboard the Essex. 

In exchange, the officer paid Wei $12,000 over a year and a half.

A jury convicted Wei on six of seven charges: espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act and three counts of violating the Arms Export Control Act.

The espionage-related charges carry life sentences and a $250,000 fine. 

Conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act and each count of violating the act carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison and a $1 million fine.

The Chinese intelligence officer approached Wei and posed as a naval enthusiast working for the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, a state-run yard.

Wei suspected the officer of being linked to Chinese intelligence. 

"Wei told his friend that he is ‘no idiot' and that ‘this is quite obviously f***ing espionage,'" according to the Department of Justice (DOJ). 

Still, Wei began spying for the officer, sending pictures of the Essex and describing the vulnerabilities of ships at the San Diego Naval Base. 

An attorney for Wei did not deny that his actions were wrong but characterized him as young and naive, arguing he "never intended to harm the United States."

"It was never disputed that Jinchao made numerous errors in judgment. He was young and naive and regrettably agreed to share some very low-level information in exchange for easy money," attorney Sean Jones said in a statement Thursday.

From March 2022 to August 2023, when Wei was arrested, he sent photos, offered the locations of various Navy ships and described the defense weapons on the Essex, the DOJ stated.

He sent the Chinese agent "thousands of pages of technical and operational information about U.S. Navy surface warfare ships like the Essex that he took from restricted U.S. Navy computer systems." 

U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon said Wei's actions showed an "egregious betrayal of the trust placed in him as a member of the U.S. military."

"By trading military secrets to the People's Republic of China for cash, he jeopardized not only the lives of his fellow sailors but also the security of the entire nation and our allies," Gordon said. "The jury's verdict serves as a crucial reminder that the Department of Justice will vigorously prosecute traitors."

Wei is scheduled to be sentenced on December 1.

"If there is only one thing I can make clear, it is that Jinchao loves America. He has no allegiance to China," his attorney said. "He made a stupid decision to make some easy money by selling outdated maintenance manuals to a broken and obsolete steam-powered ship. I firmly believe his actions had absolutely no effect on national security.

Multiple Chinese nationals have been arrested for spying on U.S. military bases. Just last month, two were detained in Houston for allegedly trying to collect intelligence about U.S. Navy service members and bases and recruiting other military members to carry out tasks for the country's main foreign intelligence service, the Ministry of State Security (MSS).

The teen suspect accused of killing Austin Metcalf at a Frisco, Texas, track meet in April is facing a first-degree murder charge.

The judge in the murder trial of Karmelo Anthony, accused of stabbing Frisco, Texas, teen track star Austin Metcalf to death in April, has issued a gag order in the case. 

Collin County Judge John Roach issued the order, citing pre-trial publicity that could affect the outcome of the case, according to FOX 4. 

The public will not hear from attorneys, witnesses, law enforcement or any other entities related to the case until after the trial, scheduled for June 2026, is over.

The alleged murder and the events thereafter set off a firestorm nationwide, sparking outrage over Metcalf's death. 

Metcalf, 17, a student at Memorial High School, was participating in a track championship event at Kuykendall Stadium in Frisco when he was stabbed to death. 

Anthony, then 17, was taken into custody almost immediately and charged with murder. His bond was set at $1 million, and he was initially held in the Collin County Jail.

Anthony was a student at Centennial High School but did not participate in the track meet that day. 

The stabbing was allegedly preceded by a dispute inside the Memorial High School tent. Metcalf died in the arms of his brother, Hunter. 

"My son is gone, and he'll never come home again," Jeff Metcalf said on the program. "Austin was the light of my life."

Metcalf discussed the bond between Austin and his twin brother, Hunter. 

"They were so tight. They had the best bond. They were best friends," Metcalf said of the pair. "And now, I have to focus on taking care of Hunter."

Fox News Digital obtained Anthony's arrest report, which detailed the circumstances under which he was detained. 

A school resource officer was the first on scene and detained him without incident. 

"I gave the suspect instructions to keep his hands up in the air. During this time, the suspect said verbally out loud, ‘I was protecting myself,'" the report from the responding resource officer said. "It should be noted that I had not questioned him about the incident when he made that comment."

Anthony said Metcalf "put his hands on him."

When Anthony overheard a group of officers saying he "allegedly" killed Metcalf, he said, "I'm not alleged; I did it," according to the report. 

He asked officers if Metcalf would be OK and whether what he did could be considered self-defense. 

In the wake of the stabbing, Anthony's mother, Kayla Hayes, established a GiveSendGo campaign for her son's defense. 

Less than a week after the stabbing, the fund had reached about $150,000. The crowdfunding campaign has been a source of contention since it was created as tensions have flared in the case.

"As a family of faith, we are deeply grateful for all of your support during this trying period," the Anthony family said in a statement on GiveSendGo. "Your prayers and assistance mean more to us now more than ever."

The fund has garnered just shy of $550,000. Its goal is more than $1.3 million.

Fox News Digital obtained an arrest report describing a heated seating dispute in the Memorial High School track tent. 

A witness told police that Metcalf ordered Anthony to leave the team's tent before Anthony said he "grabbed his bag, opened it and reached inside it" and said, "Touch me and see what happens."

"Austin stood up and pushed the male to get him out of the tent," the arrest report said.

That's when police allege Anthony pulled out a knife and stabbed Metcalf to death.

Anthony's then-attorneys, Bill Clark of the Clark Law Firm and Kim Cole of K Cole Law, asked for a reduction of the $1 million bond, calling it "excessive."

Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis announced that Anthony could not face the death penalty or life without parole under Texas state law because he was a juvenile at the time of the alleged crime.

Anthony's family hired his current attorney, Mike Howard, who successfully argued for Anthony's bond to be reduced to $250,000. 

Anthony was released on bond and required to wear an ankle monitor and remain on house arrest unless granted permission to leave by a judge. 

"Every Texan has the right to defend themselves when they reasonably fear for their life," Howard said. "Self-defense is a protection that applies to each and every one of us. There are two sides to every story.

"This is a tragedy all the way around for both families," he added. "Rushing to judgment, trial by public perception, and trial by media is not how we ensure justice is done. We are confident that, after a full investigation, that the truth will come out."

The Anthony family retained the New Generation Action Network (NGAN) to speak on their behalf. The group is headed by Dominique Alexander, a stalwart Black Lives Matter and defund the police activist with a prior criminal history.

NGAN largely injected race into the conversation about Anthony's arrest. 

At the April 17 news conference, Jeff Metcalf showed up. The event was open to the public. 

However, he was removed by Dallas Police under the threat of criminal trespass charges. 

Alexander blasted the elder Metcalf during the conference.

"What we've seen at the beginning of this press conference, of the father being at this press conference, these are my words — don't quote anybody — is a disrespect to the dignity of his son," Alexander said. 

SUSPECT IN AUSTIN METCALF KILLING MOVED TO 'UNDISCLOSED LOCATION' FOR PROTECTION: FAMILY SPOKESMAN

"Next Generation Action Network from the beginning has respected the loss of life, no matter our opinion of it. We have kept our opinion close," he said. "We have not attacked. We have not shared the information that was shared with us about Austin Metcalf because we respect the dignity of life and loss.

"That was disrespectful and just shows you all the character," Alexander said. "He was not invited. He knows that it's inappropriate to be near this family, but he did it. So, I say to people, actions speak louder than words.

"What he has felled [sic] into is the political operatives that want to make this thing a political thing of hate and yet bigotry and yet racism," he said. "We have conservative operatives that have been posting nonstop about this case." 

Citing people loitering near the Anthony home, mailing them flyers and unwanted pizza deliveries, the Anthony family moved to a new location. 

"We are sharing images and documentation of the threats the family has faced this past weekend to make the public aware of the dangerous atmosphere that has been created — an atmosphere fueled by organized hate, systemic racism and intentional misinformation," NGAN said.

Collin County Judge Angela Tucker, who lowered Anthony's bail, was doxxed, with people posting personal information about her.

"Due to the nature of the situation, we are coordinating with the FBI and our Fusion Center to monitor for any concerning rhetoric or propaganda that could incite violence," the Collin County Sheriff's Office said at the time.

After Alexander and NGAN verbally attacked Jeff Metcalf for a second time, Austin's father responded.

"I don't allow [Alexander] to live rent free in my mind," he told Fox News Digital. "It really doesn't matter about the lies this man spreads. He just wants more attention. Don't give it to him. Justicer [sic] will prevail." 

Alexander returned to discussing the April 17 news conference via a video posted to his social media account.

"This press conference wasn't organized by him," Alexander said. "This press conference wasn't about him. This press conference didn't invite him. Yet at the end of the day, it's a criminal case y'all."

Alexander then launched into a tirade about those online who have criticized him for his past criminal behavior and posted his past mugshots.

"I really don't care what no one says about me, I really don't," he said. "I don't care about the racist p----- who want to say something about Dominique and say something about my past. I really, quite frankly, don't. If you know me, you know your attacks towards me only do one thing: boost my ego. The reality is, I really don't, quite frankly, give a damn."

Frisco ISD said that despite first-degree murder charges, Anthony would be allowed to graduate on May 22, though he would not be allowed to attend the ceremony. 

He was not expelled from school despite allegedly stabbing another Frisco ISD student to death. 

Superintendent Mike Waldrip took offense to social media rumors that Anthony would be able to attend the graduation ceremony. 

"Frisco ISD has learned that misinformation is being shared regarding Centennial High School's graduation via several media outlets and perpetuated through social media," he told WFAA. "It is disheartening that the incredible accomplishments and achievements of our Centennial seniors may be dampened by needless fearmongering, attention-seeking and media vitriol. Our students, staff and community deserve better."

NGAN also weighed in. 

"We are proud to share that Karmelo Anthony will graduate and receive his high school diploma and that his academic achievements will not be disrupted," Alexander said.

Anthony was indicted for his alleged murder of Metcalf.

"For weeks, my team has been presenting evidence to the grand jury. Today, I summarized that evidence, and I asked the Grand Jury to return a first-degree murder indictment against Karmelo Anthony — which they did," Collin County District Attorney Greg Willis said. 

Jeff Metcalf told Fox News Digital that though he was pleased with the indictment, nothing will bring his son back.

"I am pleased that we are moving forward," he said. "With the first-degree murder indictment, it now goes into the court system. I fully believe that justice will be served for Austin Metcalf. I look forward to the forthcoming trial. But it will never bring my son back."

Howard, Anthony's attorney, downplayed the indictment. 

TEXAS PRESS CONFERENCE IN AUSTIN METCALF KILLING DEVOLVES INTO CHAOS OVER TRACK MEET STABBING

"Today's indictment is an expected and routine step in the legal process," he said, adding that there is an indictment in nearly every felony case. 

"To the racists, the bigots, and those filled with hate who've targeted Karmelo, his family, and even myself – you do not intimidate us. We are not backing down," Alexander said. 

"This case is yet another example of what it means to be Black in America, where even our self-defense is questioned, scrutinized and politicized. My involvement – like many others – came as a direct response to the overwhelming hate, threats and outside influence that have surrounded this case since day one."

He then asked Anthony's supporters for prayers, to support due process, and to "[s]tand with us in the fight against White supremacy."

Anthony's trial date was set for June 1, 2026. 

Roach, the Collin County judge on the case, issued a gag order amid concerns that continued press coverage might jeopardize a fair trial.

Trump's new fee will make the USAID cuts look like a rounding error in some countries.

Immigrant rights activist Guerline Jozef can't count the number of frantic texts, calls, and emails she gets daily from Haitians in the United States terrified that some day soon, they won't be able to feed their families anymore.

Not just those in the US, but their “mother, sister, niece, a cousin, a church member” back in Haiti, who heavily depend on their breadwinner abroad to survive.

“Entire neighborhoods are being provided for by the diaspora,” said Jozef, co-founder of the Haitian Bridge Alliance in San Diego. “Haiti is literally being held together by those of us who are outside of the country and sending money back home.”

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

Haiti's decades-long humanitarian crisis deepens each day, forcing immigrants to send record-high payments back home in recent years. Each Haitian immigrant living abroad supports a dozen or so friends, family, or community members in their home country, many of whom rely on those payments to survive, Jozef says.

But that money — formally called remittances — is about to get more expensive to send, thanks to a new tax tucked into President Donald Trump's new spending bill. The 1 percent tax passed as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill enacted by Congress last month and will go into effect starting January 1, 2026.

Though 1 percent might not sound like much, it could mean billions of dollars that never reach grandparents who need medical care, homes that fall into disrepair, and girls unable to stay in school.

About 200 million immigrant workers support about 800 million family members in their home countries each year — together, that's roughly one in eight people worldwide. For every dollar that a wealthy nation sends in foreign aid, immigrants send almost four times as much back home, totaling over $700 billion worldwide — enough to buy up every home for sale in the US and still have billions to spare. In over 60 countries, remittances make up more than 3 percent of GDP, and in some places, they make up well over a quarter of the entire economy, the equivalent share of the entire manufacturing, retail, and health care industries in the United States combined.

When the tax goes into effect next year, Haitians could lose about $61 million annually in direct payments for food, shelter, and health care, according to the Center for Global Development. Globally, the losses will add up to about $4.5 billion.

This economic pain is on top of the absolute gutting of USAID, which around the world, once paid for almost half of all food aid, roughly 70 percent of the global response to HIV/AIDS, and contraceptive care for almost 50 million women and couples each year. The agency's sudden demise has left a multibillion-dollar vacuum for peace building, humanitarian relief, and health infrastructure in dozens of low- and middle-income countries where those funds made a tremendous difference.

But as big of a deal as USAID was, remittances are actually an even bigger deal. And the US is targeting immigrants' hard-earned cash at a moment when the world can afford it least. Many countries — like India, Guatemala, and the Philippines — will lose way more money from this 1 percent tax on remittances than they will from foreign aid cuts. Losing yet another lifeline will be beyond catastrophic — it could further destabilize countries already steeped in crisis.

If remittances fall, “it will mean more famine,” Jozef said. “It will mean more people dying.”

Immigrants in the US sent almost $100 billion overseas last year, mostly to low- or middle-income countries, making it the world's largest source of remittances. Every family is different, but most immigrant workers send about 15 percent of their salary or upward of $300 per month back home.

Let's say you're an immigrant from Honduras trying to send some extra money home this month to help cover your brother's back-to-school fees. One option is to ask your bank or use an app to initiate an international transfer — but the teller might not speak your language, you get paid in cash, and like most Hondurans, your family doesn't have a bank account to transfer to anyway.

So instead, like most immigrants, you walk up the block to your local money transfer shop. Say, a Western Union nestled in your neighborhood pharmacy, and tell the agent how much money you want to send. You hand her your ID, a form, and a few hundred dollars over the counter. Right away, they take out about $15 in fees — plus an extra couple of dollars once the tax kicks in.

After a bit of paperwork, they process the rest, and in a few minutes, voilà. In Honduras, your mom walks to the Western Union shop up the street from your elementary school and picks up her cash.

It's hard to overstate the importance of these payments. Remittances have been proven to reduce infant mortality, boost school enrollment, and fuel housing construction around the world. Studies show that they play a significant role in helping countries achieve sustainable development goals like clean water for all. Manuel Orozco, director of the Migration, Remittances, and Development Program at the Inter-American Dialogue, has been trying to get Americans to care about remittances for the past 30 years.

“I feel like I'm preaching the gospel of remittances and financial inclusion,” he said. “And all administrations, including the Biden administration, just didn't want to pay attention to these issues.” But in many countries, “GDP growth basically depends on remittances.”

For example, Nepal's tourism industry raked in a hefty $2.5 billion in 2023, but it was no match for the $11 billion Nepalese workers abroad sent home that year. Honduras relies twice as much on remittances as it does on agriculture, its next largest chunk of GDP. Guatemala's economy is 10 times as dependent on remittances as it is on bananas, the country's largest export.

And in places without food stamps or Medicaid, those payments function as a vast, invisible, global social safety net, ensuring that the world's poorest don't fall through the cracks.

More often than not, remittances directly support families' basic needs like food, housing, education, and medical care, filling gaps that traditional aid programs might not reach, said Dulce Guzmán, executive director of Alianza Americas, a network of immigrant-serving groups based in Chicago. “They're a huge pillar for sustaining life in our countries of origin.”

When remittances do get attention, it's usually from Republicans, and it's almost never a good thing.

“The purpose is not to be mean,” said Ira Mehlman, who works at the anti-immigrant Federation for American Immigration Reform, which the Southern Poverty Law Center defines as a hate group for its hardline stance. The group lobbied hard for the 1 percent tax, which he hopes will encourage immigrants to self-deport.

“It's no different than if you're cruising along on the highway at 80 miles an hour and you see somebody else getting pulled over for speeding,” he argued. “You change your behavior, take your foot off the gas.”

Only it is very, very, very different. Because taking your foot off the gas here means cutting off millions of vulnerable people from the money they need to survive.

Under normal circumstances, remittances rise when foreign aid is cut, but that won't be easy this time around with so many countries hit by both aid cuts and the tax on money transfers. The tax — which to Mehlman's chagrin, a hodgepodge of fintech, free market, and pro-immigrant lobbyists haggled down from 5 percent in an initial proposal — will require senders to pay a 1 percent fee on all cash transfers.

Money transfer agents or bank tellers will be required to apply the tax on any cash, money orders, or cashier's checks sent overseas, similar to a restaurant collecting a sales tax on the food and beverages it serves. If businesses fail to collect the tax as required, they're on the hook for paying it themselves along with any penalties or interest fees.

Digital transfers will be exempt from the tax. But sending money between foreign bank accounts is not as simple as using Venmo or Zelle, which require a US bank account to use — something many immigrants and their families don't have. Despite the rise of app-based providers like Remitly, which is tailor-made for overseas transfers, many immigrants still make the monthly trek to Western Union to send money home because that's what they and their recipients — often elderly parents or grandparents — back home are used to and trust.

So let's take a look at what this looks like for a family in El Salvador, for example. Without the $1,600 that Damaris Ortega sends home from Texas each month, her mother and three children in El Salvador could never afford to eat meat. Just the basics there — rice, beans, eggs, vegetables — cost “basically your entire salary” each month, she said.

“It harms industry. It harms individuals. It harms our national security.”

There would be no new clothes to wear to school. No money to pay tuition. No savings to go to college. If they ever got sick or hurt, her family couldn't afford the gauze, bandages, or medications they'd need to bring to local hospitals that rarely have those on hand.

“The contributions we send from here to there — many families there live off of that,” Ortega, an organizer at the immigrant rights group CRECEN Houston, said in Spanish. “In fact, they subsist on it there. They need that money to survive.”

For Ortega, the tax will mean paying an additional $16 each month on top of the 6 percent fee many already pay on average to businesses like Western Union or MoneyGram.

Those fees add up in El Salvador, where the minimum wage is less than $2 per hour or $13 per day. With a new tax on top of existing fees, it means $112 less money for Ortega's family each month, or $1,344 each year.

Or zooming out, El Salvador, which is set to be hit hardest per capita by the tax, will lose about $198 million annually when it goes into effect. That's roughly 0.62 percent of the country's entire GDP or a gobsmacking 1.1 percent if you count the $150 million it's projected to lose from USAID cuts too. It's as if the entire US agricultural industry were to disappear overnight.

“If it weren't for the support of the community that sends remittances, I think there would be extreme poverty, more than there already is, in our countries,” Ortega said.

The good news is that even if the tax reduces remittances to an extent, “people are still going to send that money. It's just going to take a different channel,” said Ananya Kumar, who studies the future of money at the Atlantic Council, a think tank focused on international security.

That's especially true for those from rural, poorer, more vulnerable places with less digital and banking infrastructure — and the new tax specifically targets those cash-based transfers. More than one in five adults worldwide still don't have a bank or mobile money account, and that's especially true for women and those living in sub-Saharan Africa, where only about half the population has an account. Many immigrants in the US don't have bank accounts either.

While someone who's savvy with a smartphone may be able to send money tax-free, for those without banking or regular internet access, cash is still king — and it will be taxed.

Some of those senders could soon begin “moving into the shadows versus having legitimate businesses do it,” said Kumar, which would make them more vulnerable to scammers or criminal networks promising to send the money for less.

And that's not good for anybody. “It harms industry,” Kumar said. “It harms individuals. It harms our national security.”

If the tax holds, The US is poised to make about $10 billion over the next decade. That'll cover just 0.15 percent of the federal US budget for a year at most.

“It's really a drop in the bucket for this country,” said Guzmán, the executive director of Alianza Americas. But elsewhere, that kind of money, “it's transformative.”

Likewise, if we're calculating generously, the gutting of USAID could save US citizens maybe $5 — one matcha latte pre-matcha shortage — per month. But at what cost?

Mexico, which receives the most US remittances, will lose over $1.5 billion per year from the tax, the steepest loss projected anywhere.

In Liberia, for example, aid cuts from the US alone have been so steep that they're projected to lead to a full 2.6 percent decline in gross national income, the highest rate of any country, on top of which the remittance tax will shave off another 0.16 percent. That's a total of over $100 million lost, more than the Liberian government allocated for education this year, in a country where the average salary is less than $3,000 per year.

In Mexico, remittances have already plunged by double-digit percentages in recent months, thanks in part to Trump's immigration crackdown, a growing problem for low-income Mexicans who rely on remittances for up to 30 percent of their income and may soon struggle to afford basic goods. At a recent press conference, President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico quipped in Spanish that if the US “wants to charge taxes, they should go somewhere else — not to Mexico's poorest people” who “receive and live off these remittances.”

Her country, which receives the most US remittances, will lose over $1.5 billion per year from the tax, the steepest loss projected anywhere. In an attempt to minimize the damage, she promised to reimburse Mexicans for the tax, and last month, launched a low-fee government debit card that can facilitate tax-free digital transfers.

But those solutions are probably too expensive or out of reach for poorer countries, where these payments make the biggest difference.

Still, remittances have proved remarkably resistant to crises in the past, like the Covid-19 pandemic, and some immigrants may manage to quickly move to tax-free digital platforms, a transition that Guzmán's group plans to encourage in the year ahead.

But there's no question that taken as a whole, these policies are “going to further destabilize these countries and push more people to leave,” Guzmán said. “These changes have deadly consequences.”

The United Nations has lobbied for years to decrease the cost of sending remittances precisely because they are so important to global development and because, frankly, it is greedy for wealthy countries to try to take a chunk of the all-important money that immigrants send home.

In Jozef's words,“the people of Haiti need that money more than President Trump.”

But this was never about the money. It's about “flooding the zone.” It's about throwing a billion strands of spaghetti to the wall at once and seeing what sticks. If millions of people starve as collateral, then that's because the system was broken to begin with.

And well, the system was broken to begin with. No country should be so vulnerable, so reliant on income from its citizens employed abroad, that a 1 percent tax could push them over the edge.

Yet, remittances and foreign aid remain many countries' best bet for leveling the global playing field and “addressing those root causes” of forced migration in the first place, said Guzmán. For creating the conditions needed so that one day, countries like Haiti and El Salvador won't need remittances anymore. Their citizens won't need to leave at all.

“Even in the middle of all the chaos,” Jozef said, “that is still the goal.”

            The FBI conducted a court-authorized search at former national security adviser John Bolton's home and office as part of a renewed investigation into whether he disclosed classified information in his 2020 book, according to two people familiar with the matter.
    


            The investigative step immediately drew criticism that Trump was using the muscle of the US government to target a political foe, though the specific basis for the searches was not clear.
    


            Bolton served as President Donald Trump's national security adviser in his first term 2019, but the president fired him and the two have been at odds ever since. Trump had previously threatened to jail for Bolton over the 2020 book, which was critical of Trump's foreign policy knowledge, and the Justice Department investigated him in Trump's first-term. That probe was closed under President Joe Biden.
    


            CNN observed FBI personnel at Bolton's house in the Washington, DC, area on Friday morning. They were seen speaking to a person on the porch of the house, and at least four to six agents were seen going inside. Some of the agents took bags out of the vehicles to bring inside, but nothing was seen coming out of the residence.
    


            The FBI also was searching Bolton's office on Friday morning, according to a source. CNN saw several unmarked federal vehicles the building in downtown Washington.
    


            While the searches stemmed from the Justice Department reopening the years-old investigation involving the book, investigators are also exploring other possible leaks as a form of “weaponization,” a source said.
    


            Asked about the search on Friday, Trump told reporters he knew “nothing about it.” He added that he expected the Justice Department to brief him likely later in the day and suggested he had the power to initiate law enforcement moves.
    


            But Vice President JD Vance later said in an interview for Meet the Press with Kristen Welker that “classified documents are certainly part of it, but I think that there's a broad concern about, about Ambassador Bolton.”
    


            Vance denied that the search was politically motivated, characterizing it as part of an evidence-gathering operation “driven by the law and not by politics.”
    


            “If they ultimately bring a case, it will be because they determine that he has broken the law,” he said. “We're going to be deliberate about that, because we don't think that we should throw people — even if they disagree with us politically, maybe especially if they disagree with us politically — you shouldn't throw people willy-nilly in prison.”
    


            Reached by CNN earlier on Friday, Bolton said he was unaware of the FBI activity and was looking into it further. His attorney didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
    


            The search at Bolton's house was first reported by the New York Post. The FBI declined to comment on it.
    


            “I don't want to know about it. It's not necessary. I could know about it. I could be the one starting it, and I'm actually the chief law enforcement officer. But I feel that it's better this way,” he said.
    


            He also took aim at Bolton, calling him a “low life.”
    


            “When I hired him, he served a good purpose, because, as you know, he was one of the people that forced Bush to do the ridiculous bombings in the Middle East. Bolton, he wants to always kill people, and he's very bad at what he does, but he worked out great for me,” Trump said.
    


            Trump has repeatedly gone after his former national security adviser while in office, including most recently saying this month that the media was “constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton.”
    


            The president also terminated Bolton's Secret Service detail within hours of starting his second term in January.
    


            During his first term, the president threatened to jail Bolton after his 2020 book, “The Room Where It Happened,” claimed Trump was woefully under-informed on matters of foreign policy and obsessed with shaping his media legacy. The book also reported that Trump asked the leaders of Ukraine and China to help him win the 2020 election.
    


            The book included material that initially was cleared for publication by career officials at the White House, but Trump political appointees sought to overturn that approval.

            The Justice Department investigated Bolton over the possibility that he “unlawfully disclosed classified information” in his memoir, though officials under former President Joe Biden closed the investigation and dropped a related lawsuit in 2021 connected to the publication of the book.
    


            Trump and his government have carried out a campaign of retribution in recent months against a wide swath of the president's perceived political enemies, ranging from former Trump officials to members of Congress to the prosecutors who brought cases against the president while he was out of office.
    


            Last week, FBI Director Kash Patel declassified and released internal FBI interview notes from a former House Intelligence Committee staffer who first accused former Rep. Adam Schiff in 2017 of directing illegal leaks of classified information about Trump and Russia, in an escalation of Trump's long-standing feud with Schiff.
    


            The Justice Department also opened a grand jury investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James this month over the civil actions she brought against Trump and the National Rifle Association.
    


            The public nature of the FBI search on Friday at Bolton's house – with agents wearing prominently identifiable “FBI” jackets while entering and exiting the house throughout the morning and key officials appearing to telegraph it on social media – has already led neighbors and friends of Bolton to say the search may be related to political retribution.
    


            Top FBI officials posted on social media Friday morning just after 7 am. FBI Director Kash Patel wrote on X, “NO ONE is above the law … @FBI agents on mission.” The FBI's co-deputy director Dan Bongino posted, “Public corruption will not be tolerated.”
    


﻿Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi also reposted Patel's comment, with Bondi adding, “America's safety isn't negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.”
    


            If the officials are cryptically referring to Bolton, it would be a notable departure of the Bureau's practice of not commenting publicly on investigations, especially as FBI agents are still at the scene.
    


            For instance, the hours-long FBI search of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago for classified records in 2022 was conducted with officials in plain clothes, and with the public largely unaware of the search until it was nearly concluded. Patel has since called the Mar-a-Lago search a “total weaponization and politicization by the FBI and DOJ.”
    


            Trump was indicted by a grand jury for mishandling several national security documents he retained after his first term in office, keeping boxes of classified records in a bathroom, a ballroom and other rooms at his Florida resort, until a Florida-based judge dismissed the case in 2024.
    


            Bolton, a longtime conservative who had previously served in the Reagan and both Bush administrations, has been a political foe of Trump's since he left the White House in the first term.

When President Donald Trump announced his plans to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department earlier this month, he included a clear warning to liberal cities beyond Washington: either clean up or face a federal takeover.

“We're going to have a tremendous success on what we're doing,” Trump said regarding the enlistment of the National Guard to patrol the nation's capital before warning blue-leaning cities. “They're all watching, and maybe they'll self-clean up, and maybe they'll self-do this, and get rid of the cashless bail thing and all of the things that caused the problem.”

The president then blasted Chicago and Los Angeles, cities within blue states led by Democratic mayors, Brandon Johnson and Karen Bass, respectively. The states are led by two of his biggest Democratic foes: Govs. JB Pritzker (D-IL) and Gavin Newsom (D-CA).

“If we need to, we're going to do the same thing in Chicago, which is a disaster. We have a mayor there who's totally incompetent,” Trump said of Johnson. “And we have an incompetent governor there. Pritzker is an incompetent. His family threw him out of the business, and he ran for governor.”

“Hopefully, LA is watching,” Trump added as he spoke about the devastating fires that blazed through the city earlier this year. “I watched people on television; they want to go, they want to leave. They've lost their spirit. They've lost their heart because the mayor is incompetent. And Gavin Newscum [Trump's nickname for Newsom] is incompetent. Got a good line of bull****, but that's about it.”

On Thursday, the president was again direct about his desire to move beyond Washington when asked about homicides in Memphis, Tennessee, another blue-controlled city. “We're doing a sort of a test right now in D.C.,” he told the Todd Starnes Show. “It's working unbelievably.”

He later visited the U.S. Park Police Anacostia Operations Facility on Thursday evening, highlighting the National Guard's work to combat crime and homelessness.

“The crime numbers are way down,” Trump told the crowd. “I feel very safe now, and I'm hearing people are very safe, but I know within two weeks … it's going to be at a level that's even far superior.”

He again threatened to take his efforts to crack down on crime to other cities. “We're not playing games. We're going to make it safe, and we're going to then go on to other places,” he said. “But we're going to stay here for a while.”

Trump's attacks on these blue cities and their leaders are part of a yearslong pattern of slamming urban enclaves as crime-infested places in need of law and order. His recent takeover of Washington escalates his previous feuds with Democrats, who claimed that crime rates have fallen in many of these cities.

“President Trump sees that American cities are failing, and part of why they're failing is a leadership deficit and a lack of will to do what needs to be done to fix these once great American cities,” said Brian Seitchick, a national Republican strategist. “So Trump is taking it upon himself to make cities safer again and to make them a place that is hospitable to all Americans.” 

In his first visit to Chicago as president in 2019, Trump said the Windy City was “embarrassing to us as a nation” due to its crime problems. “All over the world, they're talking about Chicago. Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison,” he said.

During a visit to Detroit, Michigan, last year while campaigning for the presidency, Trump said the nation would end up like the city if former Vice President Kamala Harris were president.

“The whole country will be like — you want to know the truth? It'll be like Detroit,” Trump said. “Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president.”

However, in his second term, Trump no longer relies on harsh rhetoric. He's now using the federal government's full might to enforce his will.

“President Trump wants every innocent, law-abiding American across the country to be safe – no matter what city they live in or who is in charge,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, in a statement to the Washington Examiner. 

“President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to make DC Safe and Beautiful by using his lawful authority to stop dangerous criminals and enforce the law,” Rogers continued. “The left and the media can coddle criminals, but our nation's capital will not be a safe haven for violent criminals under President Trump's leadership.” 

Members of the Trump administration have applauded the National Guard for helping clean up the city's homeless crisis and violent crime problems, as well as pointed to the effect it could have on the nation after Trump declared a national emergency to take over the police department for 30 days.

“We do not have to allow our cities to be taken over by violence,” Vice President JD Vance said during a surprise visit to Union Station on Wednesday. “We can bring law and order to our communities, you've just got to have the political willpower to do it.”

Rep. James Comer (R-KY), a key Trump ally on Capitol Hill, publicly supported the takeover of other cities' police forces. 

“We're gonna support doing this in other cities if it works out in Washington, D.C.,” he told Newsmax. Our military has been in many countries around the world for the past two decades, walking the streets trying to reduce crime in other countries. We need to focus on the big cities in America now, and that's what the president is doing.”

Democrats are in a bind on how to counter Trump's attacks on blue-leaning cities, said one Republican strategist.

“This puts Democrats in a corner, and so in that way, I think Trump loves it,” said Matt Dole, a GOP strategist based in Ohio. “I think Trump loves it when he can sort of corner the Democrats. And really, whatever they decide is a problem for them. And I think he has them in the corner. Crime nationally is worse in big cities. Big cities nationally are unanimously controlled by Democrats.”

FBI crime statistics from 2024 show that 13 of the 20 cities with the highest murder rates were in Republican-run states. But 19 of the 20 cities with the highest murder rates, with at least 100,000 residents, were led by Democratic mayors. Trump's feud with these Democratic leaders may have some basis for his threats to move beyond Washington, but the crime statistics also lend credence to the argument that Democrats are not tough on crime.

“I believe he is targeting cities that are failing, and that these cities fail the eye test on a regular basis,” said Seitchick. “If they were led by Republicans, with Republican mayors, and they were failing, Trump would still be trying to fix them. The fact that Democrats leave them at the city level and the gubernatorial level is a reality that everybody understands.” 

TRUMP'S TAKEOVER OF DC POLICE RENEWS THE 51ST STATE DEBATE

Dole pointed out that Washington is unique in that it lacks statehood and is, therefore, more easily subject to federal jurisdiction.

“I don't think Trump goes, ‘Look, this worked in D.C., so now I'm going to nationalize the LAPD or the Chicago Police or something else, ‘” said Dole. “I think Trump explores limits, but I believe he knows that that's probably a step too far and would certainly be struck down in court relatively quickly.”

Former DEA special agent Michael Brown warns that Mexico's popular tourist zones may look safe, but behind the beaches and resorts, cartels and predators pose serious threats to unsuspecting travelers.

The U.S. State Department has issued an updated travel advisory for Mexico, warning Americans about potential dangers in the popular vacation destination.

Released on Aug. 12, the advisory raised Mexico to a Level 2 alert, urging travelers to "exercise increased caution" due to the threat of violent crime, including terrorism, kidnapping and other criminal activity.  

U.S. officials also warned that in certain areas they may have limited ability to assist travelers in emergencies.

"Violent crimes such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery are widespread," the advisory notes. "There is also a risk of terrorist violence, including potential attacks."

The alert comes as Mexico continues to attract millions of international travelers.

According to RoadGenius, in 2024, Mexico received approximately 45.04 million international tourists, including about 13.5 million visitors from the United States, making it the top international destination for U.S. travelers. Popular hot spots include Cancún, Tulum, Cabo San Lucas, and Mexico City.

Despite the heightened warning, one expert emphasized that Americans don't necessarily need to cancel their trips.

Robert McDonald, a retired supervisory Secret Service agent and a lecturer in criminal justice at the University of New Haven, told Fox News Digital the advisory should be viewed as a reminder rather than a deterrent.

"It's really a lot of situational awareness, a lot of common sense," McDonald said. "If you can avoid traveling into a hot zone, do so. Otherwise, just be smart about your surroundings."

With more than 20 years in executive protection and intelligence, McDonald has coordinated security for U.S. and foreign dignitaries. He said that while most resorts are generally safe, venturing off-property is where risks increase.

McDonald explained that resorts and cruise lines work hard to maintain reputations for safety, often downplaying incidents to reassure guests. While most tourist hubs remain stable, travelers who leave resort areas may face exposure to cartel activity, gang violence, robbery, or drink tampering.

"Stay on the resort. Enjoy what's on the property. Don't go off — that's where problems can occur," McDonald said. 

McDonald also highlighted how resorts and cruise ships alike are motivated to maintain a reputation for safety, even if that means underplaying incidents, adding that guests can still have safe and enjoyable vacations by being cautious and limiting exposure to risky situations.

"Resorts don't want problems advertised because it hurts business, but dangers exist once you step off," he explained. 

According to McDonald, safety largely depends on where you're going. 

"Tourist-friendly areas haven't seen a significant spike in violent crime," McDonald noted. "But you should avoid areas dominated by drug cartels or where violence is common."

For those still planning trips, McDonald recommends the following precautions:

Avoid street taxis: There have been reports of extortion involving unregulated taxis. Instead, book transportation in advance through reputable companies offering vetted services.

US RENEWS TRAVEL ADVISORY TO POPULAR DESTINATION AMID 'TERRORISM FEARS': 'EXERCISE INCREASED CAUTION'

Stay on resort grounds: Resorts typically provide 24-hour security. If you plan to leave the property, avoid going out alone or after dark.

Stay vigilant: Avoid distractions like using your phone while walking, and keep an eye on your drink when out socializing.

Dress modestly: Avoid wearing flashy or expensive jewelry that could draw unwanted attention.

Communicate safety: Check in with people back home and travel with trusted groups.

Be prepared for emergencies: Always know exit strategies and how to "get off the X" (escape dangerous situations quickly).

McDonald stressed that these tips apply not only to Mexican resorts but to any crowded environment.

"Travelers must be vigilant. Whether at a resort, a ball game, or any crowded venue, it's important to always identify exit routes and have a plan to ‘get off the X' if danger arises, since law enforcement often arrives only after the fact," McDonald said.

Ultimately, he advised travelers to balance enjoyment with preparation.

"Enjoy the trip, but don't let your guard down — safety relies on awareness, preparation, and smart choices," McDonald said. 

"A little bit of preparation, knowing where the consulate, police, or hospital are located can make a big difference. So plan ahead, and always be ready to remove yourself quickly from unsafe situations."

            At least ten cities in states whose Republican governors are deploying National Guard troops to Washington, DC, had higher rates of violent crime or homicide than DC last year, according to a CNN review of FBI data.
    


            Governors from Ohio, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia announced this week that they're sending troops to assist President Donald Trump's crackdown on crime in the nation's capital. Violent crime was already falling in DC, though it still ranks 17th among major cities.
    


            In the past week, Trump federalized DC's police force, surged federal law enforcement agents into the city, and deployed the DC National Guard.
    


            Military officials said there were nearly 2,000 soldiers and airmen mobilized in DC as of Thursday afternoon. Governors from the six states previously said they're contributing about 1,000 troops. And yet, their home states have cities with worse crime rates than DC – like Cleveland, Nashville, and Jackson, Mississippi, which was No. 1 in homicides per capita last year.
    


            DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, said she wants “to make the most of the additional officer support that we have… to drive down crime.” And DC police chief Pamela Smith said, “We have to get illegal guns off of our streets, and if we have this influx or enhanced presence, it's going to make our city even better.”
    


            Still, many Trump critics – including Democratic lawmakers, liberal activists and criminal justice advocates – have blasted his federal takeover of DC. And they've pointed out that some of the states sending National Guard troops have their own crime challenges.
    


            “It speaks to their lack of genuineness,” said Rena Karefa-Johnson, a vice president at FWD.us, a DC-based national criminal justice reform group. “Public safety is being used – as it often is – as a pretext to attack, target and terrorize specific communities. I don't think any of this really makes any communities safer.”
    


            Sen. Thom Tillis, a retiring North Carolina Republican, said in a CBS News interview that GOP governors were “100%” deploying troops to please Trump.
    


            “DC has a crime problem … do we honestly think DC has the worst crime problem in the United States? No,” Tillis said, flagging red-state cities with higher crime rates like Memphis, and criticizing Trump's federal “micromanaging.”
    


            Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said he was sending 150 military police from the Ohio National Guard to DC after a getting request from the secretary of the Army.
    


            Cleveland had the 2nd-highest overall crime rate last year among US cities with more than 250,000 people, according to a CNN review of FBI statistics from 2024. DC was tenth for overall crime and 17th for violent crime in 2024.
    


            When it comes to violent crime specifically – which the FBI defines as murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault – two additional Ohio cities had higher rates than DC last year: Toledo and Dayton.
    


Trump says law enforcement crackdown will ‘go on to other places' during appearance at police facility in DC



            “We need those troops here because of what we're going through,” said Walter Patton, founder of Ghetto Therapy, which connects residents from some of Cleveland's poorest communities with free mental health services.
    


            A fourth-generation Cleveland resident, Patton lives in Outhwaite Homes public housing and said more resources are needed to keep people safe. This year, Patton noted, the Trump administration canceled a $2 million federal grant for an anti-gang organization that his group partners with in the city.
    


            “We had 13 homicides in my front yard in 2020,” Patton told CNN. “We're losing the focus on crime in Ohio because of DC's issues. My heart goes out to DC. But DC should be focused on DC, and Ohio should focus on Ohio.”
    


            A spokesman from DeWine's office told CNN in an email that “Ohio has traditionally helped the District of Columbia, Ohio mayors, and other states when they request assistance,” including requests from Democratic officials.
    


            The spokesman, Dan Tierney, also said the cities of Cleveland, Toledo and Dayton had all previously requested and received assistance from the Ohio State Highway Patrol “to assist with resource surges to address rising crime.”
    


            Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee confirmed Tuesday that he was sending about 160 members of the state's National Guard to aid Trump's deployments in DC.
    


            Two cities in Tennessee with populations over 250,000 had higher violent crime rates than DC, according to a CNN review of FBI data. Memphis ranked 1st and Nashville was 12th on the list, five spots ahead of DC.
    


            “Washington, DC, is a creation of the Congress, and I believe it's within the president's constitutional purview,” Tennessee GOP Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN's Dana Bash on Wednesday, adding that he doesn't believe any troops are needed in Memphis because “it's not a federally created environment.”
    


            Lee's office didn't respond to a request for comment from CNN.
    


            Jeff Warren, a Democratic member of the Memphis City Council, criticized the decision to send Tennessee troops to DC. He conceded that parts of Memphis are dangerous, but said public safety was improving because of Biden-era grants for local anti-violence programs, which the Trump administration is slashing.
    


            “Putting a bunch of troops in the streets will stop violence for now, but it won't interrupt the cycle,” Warren said. “I'm more worried about them taking away all this money from violence intervention programs in major cities, just as these things have been gearing up and are starting to work.”
    


            Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry on Monday approved sending 135 troops to DC.
    


            Shreveport and Lafeyette are smaller cities, but they both had a higher violent crime rate than DC last year, according to a CNN review of FBI statistics.
    


            Landry's office did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            “It's crazy,” Michael McClanahan, president of the NAACP Louisiana State Conference, told CNN in an interview. “We are the incarceration capital of the country. We have so much work to do in our state. And it's hurricane season. The troops need to be here. Why not address the problems in Louisiana?”
    


Hurricane Erin moves away from the East Coast, but it remains a coastal threat



            California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a leading Democratic critic of Trump's moves, used this data in a recent interview to accuse Trump of authoritarianism.
    


            “He should start with Shreveport,” Newsom said. “What about the carnage, Mr. President, in Shreveport? Why aren't you protecting the folks there?”
    


In response, Shreveport's mayor said Newsom “doesn't know what he's talking about, and that we're in much better shape” than portrayed. The Shreveport police chief said, “California needs to worry about California.”
    


            Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves is also sending about 200 troops to DC.
    


            Jackson had the nation's highest homicide rate in 2024 for cities with at least 100,000 people, according to a CNN analysis of FBI statistics and local reports of police data. Last year, Jackson had about 77 homicides for every 100,000 residents, while DC only had about 27, according to the statistics.
    


            Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat who represents parts of Jackson, said Reeves' deployment was a taxpayer-funded “political stunt” that pulls brave Mississippi troops “away from their homes, families, and critical missions.”
    


            Reeves' deputy chief of staff Cory Custer told CNN in an email that “it's wrong to imply that Mississippi cannot support President Trump's efforts to clean up Washington, D.C., while also working to keep Mississippians safe.”
    


            He said it was a “ridiculous premise” because Reeves signed legislation doubling the size of Mississippi Capitol Police and has presided over an estimated 43% drop in homicides in Jackson compared to this point last year.
    


            West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced that, at the request of the Trump administration, he would be sending 300 to 400 “skilled personnel” from the state National Guard to help “restore cleanliness and safety” in DC.
    


            The two largest cities in West Virginia – Charleston and Huntington – each have only about 45,000 residents and are much smaller than DC, which has about 702,000 residents. But statistically, they both had a higher violent crime rate per capita than DC last year, according to CNN's review of FBI data.
    


            Morrisey's office did not respond to CNN's inquiries about the deployments.

            Every superhero has an origin story and Scottie Scheffler's narrative arc can be traced back to November 15, 2020 – a series of events that barely anybody noticed at the time.
    


            That was the day Scheffler and Tiger Woods played together in the Masters tournament: the first and only time that they've ever played together. Despite the fact Woods was defending champion, he was out of contention on the final day.
    


            It was the year of Covid, the tournament was being played in winter instead of the traditional spring, and the galleries were as barren as the Augusta trees, social distancing protocols had kept the patrons at bay. And yet, this was arguably the moment when the torch of greatness was handed from one American golf star to the next.
    


            Scheffler says that what transpired over those 18 holes changed his career. “I've only played one round of tournament golf with Tiger Woods,” he said this week at the Tour Championship in Atlanta, “and it completely changed the way I play tournaments.”
    


            With Ireland's Shane Lowry making up the threesome, the group was one of the first to tee off at 8:12 AM on that Sunday in 2020. At the time, Scheffler, who is now mentioned routinely in the same breath as the 15-time major winner, was still 15 months away from his first professional win.
    


            “I can't tell you,” he explained, “the look on his face when we got to the first green. We're in 20th place, kind of playing yada, yada, yada, and this guy is just locked in. I was taken aback, I was like, ‘Holy smokes, this guy is in it right now!'”
    


            Both men parred the opening hole, Scheffler then described Tiger's approach to the second: “He had this chip shot, and he looked at it like it was an up-and-down to win the tournament. I'm like, ‘This is incredible! I've never seen anything like this before in my life.'”
    


            Scheffler is now a four-time major winner and an Olympic gold medalist with a total of 18 PGA Tour wins to his name, although he's winning with such frequency these days that the number might have changed by the time you are reading this. He's been the world No. 1 player since May 2023 and he's the first golfer since Tiger Woods in 2007 to win at least five tournaments in consecutive seasons.
    


            But on this particular day, he hadn't yet been able to convert any of his considerable promise into a trophy. “The question was always, ‘Hey, how come you haven't won?'” he said.
    


            “The reason I felt like I hadn't won yet is I hadn't put myself in position enough times and that's one of the things I learned from playing with Tiger. My biggest takeaway was the amount of intensity that he took to every shot, it was like the last shot he was ever going to hit.”
    


            Having both birdied the second hole at Augusta, Scheffler and Woods headed in different directions; Woods had dropped three strokes by the time they walked off the 11th green, Scheffler had made two bogeys but recovered with a birdie and what happened next is etched into his memory – Woods played the worst hole of his PGA Tour career.
    


            With his tee shot on 12, Woods found the water at Rae's Creek. He incurred a penalty stroke and ended up in the water again. Another penalty, and with now a fifth stroke, Woods made sure to avoid the Creek, sending his ball to the back of the green and into the bunker.
    


            From there, he thinned an awkward pitch out of the sand, over the green and back into the water. By now he was playing like a weekend hacker, his next shot from the bunker was his eighth and a subsequent two-putt resulted in his first double digit score on a PGA Tour hole, a 10. On a par-three hole, he'd dropped an incredible seven strokes for a disastrous septuple bogey.
    


            Woods' chances of a sixth green jacket were already remote, but now they were completely and utterly dashed. But that's not what Scheffler remembers.
    


            Many golfers would have gone into a tailspin after such a nightmare, not Tiger Woods. He immediately punched back with a birdie on 13. In fact, he finished his round with five birdies in his last six holes. With a ringside seat to an extraordinary recovery, Scheffler was taking notes.
    


            “It was like, ‘What's this guy still playing for?'” he wondered. “He's won the Masters four or five times, best finish he's going to have is like 20th at this point. I just admired the intensity that he brought to each round and that's something I try to emulate.”
    


            Scheffler has always been a strong iron player, and in recent years, he's dramatically improved his putting. But his secret sauce seems to be his ability to quickly recover from a setback; his biggest strength is mental.
    


            Scheffler has made fewer bogeys than anyone else on tour this season; he only fumbled four holes at The Open Championship at Royal Portrush, but he makes a habit of mitigating the damage with a birdie or eagle on the very next hole.
    


            At The Open, Scheffler's recovery rate was 50%. At the PGA Championship, it was an extraordinary 60%. He won both majors.
    


            Sports psychologist Dr Phil Hopley explained to CNN Sports how Scheffler makes something so difficult look so simple.
    


            “He stays focused in the present moment,” he said. “He lets go of what's happened and recognizes that the more time he spends thinking about things that haven't gone well, the more potentially nervous, anxious, fearful or negative he's going to feel.
    


            “If you're still simmering, even small things like a minor increase in the tension in your forearms because you've released too much cortisol and adrenaline, is going to have a potentially disastrous effect on your swing pattern and your execution.”
    


            Scheffler witnessed first-hand how Tiger Woods was able to do it, and now it's become the foundation for his own dominant game. Just two years later, he won the first of his two Masters titles, and he's hardly stopped winning since. Even many of his rivals now admit that he's almost untouchable.
    


            “The things that I do on the golf course, other people can do,” Scheffler surmised. “I don't hit the ball the furthest. I think it's just the amount of consistency and the intensity that I bring to each round of golf, not taking shots off, not taking rounds off, not taking tournaments off. I'm here for a purpose and that's to complete hard on every shot.”
    


            Scheffler's prolific success has led to inevitable comparisons with Woods himself, which he dismisses as “very silly.”
    


            “I don't like comparisons to other players because I'm doing the best I can to be the best version of myself. He completely transcended the game. I think Tiger is a guy that stands alone in the game of golf, and I think he always will. Tiger inspired a whole generation of golfers. Watching what that guy did week in, week out, it was pretty amazing to see.”
    


            So, he doesn't want to be known as the next Tiger Woods, but he's pretty amazing himself, and as fans of the Marvel comics will tell you, there's always room for more than one superhero in the universe.

The Department of Homeland Security, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, arrested two illegal immigrants from Angola this week who were involved in two separate car crashes in Maine, which resulted in two pedestrians being killed. 

On Aug. 16, a vehicle driven by Mukendi Mbiya struck and killed Stacy Strattard, a 64-year-old resident of Gray, Maine. She was pronounced dead at the scene as first responders arrived, according to DHS. 

Mbiya first arrived in the United States on a B-2 tourist visa on Dec. 23, 2018, DHS reported in a press release. He was supposed to depart the country on June 22, 2019, but he overstayed his visa. ICE officials arrested him on Aug. 18 after his driving resulted in an American's death. 

In Lewiston, Maine, there was another tragedy involving an illegal immigrant driving and a pedestrian dying. Elizabeth Camacho was killed after Lionel Francisco hit her with his vehicle in Kennedy Park. The car reportedly “jumped the curb” of a street before hitting and killing Camacho, who was a Massachusetts resident. 

The local jurisdiction is reportedly pursuing any criminal charges against Francisco for killing Camacho, according to a statement from DHS.  

According to DHS, Francisco entered the country on Jan. 30, 2025, on a B-2 tourist visa, which expired on July 30, but Francisco did not leave. He was reportedly operating his vehicle while using a learner's permit. ICE arrested him on Aug. 15. 

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin commented on the crashes. She noted the tragic trend of illegal immigrants being involved in car crashes that end the lives of American citizens. 

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT FACES HOMICIDE CHARGES AFTER FATAL HIGHWAY CRASH

“It seems to be almost a daily occurrence where an illegal alien driving kills innocent Americans,” McLaughlin said. “All of these deaths are preventable because these illegal aliens should have NEVER been in our country. These two illegal aliens in Maine came to the country on B-2 tourist visas that allowed them to remain in the country for six months. Both overstayed their visas and never left the U.S.

“President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem are committed to restoring integrity to our visa programs to ensure they are not exploited by illegal aliens as one-way tickets to remain in the U.S.,” she added.

My brain hurts.

Late Thursday afternoon, the Supreme Court handed down an incomprehensible order concerning the Trump administration's decision to cancel numerous public health grants. The array of six opinions in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association is so labyrinthine that any judge who attempts to parse it risks being devoured by a minotaur.

As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson writes in a partial dissent, the decision is “Calvinball jurisprudence,” which appears to be designed to ensure that “this Administration always wins.”

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

The case involves thousands of NIH grants that the Trump administration abruptly canceled which, according to Jackson, involve “research into suicide risk and prevention, HIV transmission, Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular disease,” among other things. The grants were canceled in response to executive orders prohibiting grants relating to DEI, gender identity, or Covid-19.

A federal district court ruled that this policy was unlawful — “arbitrary and capricious” in the language of federal administrative law — in part because the executive orders gave NIH officials no precise guidance on which grants should be canceled. As Jackson summarized the district court's reasoning, “‘DEI'—the central concept the executive orders aimed to extirpate—was nowhere defined,” leaving NIH officials “to arrive at whatever conclusion [they] wishe[d]” regarding which grants should be terminated.

According to Jackson, “the court found, as a factual matter, ‘an unmistakable pattern of discrimination against women's health issues' and ‘pervasive racial discrimination'—indeed, ‘palpable' racial discrimination of a sort the judge had ‘never seen' in 40 years on the bench.”

The question of whether this judge was correct to deem the Trump administration's policy arbitrary and capricious, however, was not before the Supreme Court. Instead, the case hinged on a jurisdictional dispute.

As a general rule, lawsuits alleging that a federal policy is illegal are heard by federal district courts, while suits alleging that the federal government breached a contract are heard by the Court of Federal Claims.

In NIH, the plaintiffs alleged that the broader policy that led to their grants being canceled was illegal, so that suggests that this case should have been brought in a district court (which is where it was actually brought). But the case also bears some superficial similarity to a breach of contract suit, because it involved the government's decision not to pay money that it had previously agreed to pay.

Four justices — the three Democrats plus Chief Justice John Roberts — concluded that these plaintiffs were right to bring their suit in the district court. Four other justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh — concluded that the case must be brought in the Court of Claims. That would mean that these plaintiffs would have to start over again in the claims court, and possibly that they would have to bring individual suits seeking to reinstate individual grants, rather than seeking a broad order attacking the entire grant cancellation policy.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, meanwhile, cast the deciding vote. She claims that this suit must be split between the two courts. In her view, the district court was the proper venue for the plaintiffs to argue that the overall policy is illegal, but the claims court is the proper venue for them to actually seek the money they would have received if the grants are not canceled.

If that sounds confusing, it gets worse. Barrett's opinion states that federal law bars the claims court from hearing “claims pending in other courts when those claims arise from ‘substantially the same operative facts.'” So these plaintiffs likely must wait until after they have fully litigated the question of whether the Trump administration's broad policy is illegal in district court, before they can actually try to get any money in the claims court.

That could take years, especially if the first question is heard by the justices again. Moreover, as Jackson warns in her opinion, by the time the first round of litigation is finished, the plaintiffs may be unable to seek relief in the claims court because the statute of limitations for doing so will have expired.

The bottom line is that, because there are five votes for the proposition that some parts of this case go to the district court, and also five votes for the proposition that other parts of it go to the claims court, Barrett's opinion controls the case. By the time this mess gets sorted out, it is likely that most — if not all — of the research at issue in NIH will be lost, even if the plaintiffs do prevail.

As Jackson writes, without any money to fund their operations, the grant recipients will need to “euthanize animal subjects, terminate life-saving trials, and close community health clinics.”

There are actually even more complexities in this case, but rather than engage in the Sysiphean task of trying to list all of them, I will simply repeat Jackson's summary of what appears to be going on here:

In a broader sense, however, today's ruling is of a piece with this Court's recent tendencies. “[R]ight when the Judiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law's constraints,” the Court opts instead to make vindicating the rule of law and preventing manifestly injurious Government action as difficult as possible. This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.

Godspeed to the poor lawyers and judges who now have to untangle the mess this Court just created.

In this article

Intel shares rose about 6% on Friday after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration is poised to announce that the U.S. government will take an equity stake in the struggling chipmaker.

Following the report, President Donald Trump said the government should get about 10% of the company, which has a market cap of just over $100 billion.  

"They've agreed to do it and I think it's a great deal for them," Trump told reporters Friday at the White House

White House official told CNBC that there will be "ongoing discussions" with Intel, adding that nothing has been decided yet and that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan hasn't explicitly agreed to a deal. President Trump and Tan will be meeting later this afternoon.

A representative for Intel declined to comment.

The move would mark the latest example of a distinct shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the government taking an active role in the corporate America. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC this week that the U.S. government was seeking an equity stake in Intel in exchange for CHIPS Act funds.

"We should get an equity stake for our money," Lutnick said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." "So we'll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We'll get equity in return for it."

Lutnick said that the government's stake would be "nonvoting."

Earlier this week, Intel announced another major backer, when SoftBank said it would make a $2 billion investment in the chipmaker, equal to about 2% of the company.

Intel is the only American company capable of making the most advanced chips on U.S. shores, although its technology is seen as lagging Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which makes chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD, and even Intel.

Intel has been spending billions of dollars to build a series of chip factories in Ohio, an area the company previously called the "Silicon Heartland," where Intel would be able to produce the most advanced chips, including for AI.

But in July, Tan said in a memo to employees that there would be "no more blank checks," and that it was slowing down the construction of its Ohio factory complex, depending on market conditions. Intel's Ohio factory is now scheduled to start operations in 2030.

Intel said last fall that it had finalized a nearly $8 billion grant under the CHIPS and Science Act to fund its factory-building plans. The CHIPS Act was passed in 2022, under the Biden administration.

The law enforcement investigation of former Trump national security advisor John Bolton is "in the very early stages," Vice President JD Vance said on the heels of the FBI's raid of Bolton's Maryland home on Friday morning. 

Vance, in a new interview with NBC News' Kristen Welker, said that classified documents are "certainly part of" that probe, but that "there's a broad concern about Ambassador Bolton."

Bolton is not being targeted because of his criticism of President Donald Trump, Vance told Welker in the interview, set to air Sunday on "Meet the Press."

"If we were trying to do that, we would just throw out prosecutions willy-nilly, like the Biden administration [Department of Justice] did," he said.

Bolton served as Trump's national security advisor from April 2018 through September 2019.

FBI agents searched his office in Washington, D.C., in addition to his Bethesda home, on Friday.

"I will say we're going to let that investigation proceed," Vance said.

"What I can tell you is that, unlike the Biden DOJ and the Biden FBI, our law enforcement agencies are going to be driven by law and not by politics," Vance said.

"And so, if we think that Ambassador Bolton has committed a crime, of course, eventually prosecutions will come," the vice president said.

"This is all part of gathering evidence, trying to understand something that we're worried about."

Trump told reporters Friday morning that he was unaware of the raid on Bolton's home until he saw it reported on television.

Trump also called Bolton a "lowlife."

NBC News reported earlier Friday that the investigation of Bolton is eyeing multiple instances of the use of classified documents in leaks to the news media. 

The investigation began during the Biden administration but was dropped by the Justice Department at some point before President Joe Biden left office in January, NBC reported.

U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender is leaving the Trump administration less than five months after being confirmed by the Senate, the Treasury Department said.

Faulkender is the second Senate-confirmed official to leave the Treasury Department this month, following the departure of IRS Commissioner Billy Long, who said he was being tapped as ambassador to Iceland.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent thanked Faulkender for his work at the department but gave no reason for his departure.

"Since January, he has played a critical role in overseeing the U.S. Department of the Treasury's operations and executing on President Trump's bold economic agenda," Bessent said in a statement. "His important work has supported the passage of the historic One Big Beautiful Bill and GENIUS Act, and the leveling of sanctions against our adversaries."

Trump nominated Faulkender, a University of Maryland finance professor, in December to serve as the No. 2 official at Treasury, where he had been assistant secretary of economic policy during Trump's first term. He was confirmed by the Senate for the role on March 26.

At the end of the first Trump administration, Faulkender had returned to the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business, where he has been a finance professor since 2008.

He had also served as the chief economist for two years at the America First Policy Institute, conservative think tank that has helped shape Trump's policy agenda.

In this article

Kimbal Musk, the younger brother of the world's wealthiest person, said Elon Musk "deserves to be paid," as Tesla remains locked in a legal saga over its CEO's pay package.

"I think my brother deserves to be paid," Kimbal Musk said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Friday. "He has zero pay for the past six to eight years. I don't think that's right. I'll let Tesla shareholders make that decision, but I believe that it does need to be. He needs to be paid."

Elon Musk isn't paid a salary or any cash bonuses at Tesla. He is compensated through "performance awards" of valuable stock options that are granted based on Tesla hitting certain milestones.

Earlier this month, Tesla granted Elon Musk an "interim" pay package of 96 million shares, which would be worth about $29 billion. The package includes shares that vest in two years as long as he continues as CEO or in another key executive position.

The pay plan was approved by a "special committee" of the Tesla board, with Elon Musk and Kimbal Musk recusing themselves, board members Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson said in an Aug. 4 letter to shareholders.

The award came after a Delaware judge in December ordered Tesla to revoke Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package from 2018, which was the largest compensation plan in U.S. history for a public company executive.

Before the Delaware ruling on his 2018 pay plan, in January 2024, Musk said he wanted even more pay and control of Tesla in a post on X, which was formerly known as Twitter.

"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control," Musk wrote at the time. "Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned. Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla."

He was already building products outside of Tesla, including at his newest artificial intelligence venture, xAI, which was formed in Nevada in March 2023.

The new pay package was granted to Musk without a shareholder vote, and will only apply if Musk and Tesla lose on appeal in Delaware.

An investment group that works with pension funds, the SOC Investment Group, sent a letter this week to Nasdaq asking them to investigate Tesla, saying its board should have attained shareholder approval for the new package under Nasdaq listing policies.

In an August letter to shareholders announcing the interim pay package, Tesla board members Denholm and Wilson-Thompson wrote that the special committee is working to "address a longer-term CEO compensation strategy," which it plans to put to a shareholder vote at Tesla's upcoming annual meeting in November.

President Donald Trump said Friday he will fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she does not resign from her position.

"What she did was bad," the president told reporters who asked about Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden who has come under fire from the Trump administration over allegations about her mortgages.

"So I'll fire her if she doesn't resign," he said during a surprise visit to The People's House, a museum of the White House.

If Trump were to successfully remove Cook "for cause," he would get the chance to reshape the central bank's governing board, potentially for years to come.

Two of the seven current governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, are Trump appointees. Both dissented from the Fed's most recent decision to hold interest rates steady.

Another seat opened up earlier this summer, when Adriana Kugler announced she would step down.

If Trump is able to remove Cook, he would appoint her successor — potentially ensuring that a majority of the board shares his view on monetary policy. Board members serve 14-year terms.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte this week publicly accused Cook of mortgage fraud related to claims that she took two different properties as her primary residence at the same time.

He sent a criminal referral to the Department of Justice, which revealed Thursday that it will investigate Cook.

Pulte, a vocal critic of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who has aggressively backed Trump's calls for the central bank to lower interest rates, has continuously attacked Cook on social media since revealing his allegations.

Trump previously called for Cook to resign immediately in light of the allegations. Ed Martin, a Justice Department lawyer who is widely seen as a loyalist to the president, urged Powell to promptly remove Cook — even though the central bank chief cannot do so under the law.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in an X post Friday that Trump is targeting Cook because he is "trying to find a scapegoat for his failure to lower costs for Americans."

Cook has consistently voted in line with Powell. She sided with the majority to keep rates unchanged following the Federal Open Market Committee's most recent meeting last month.

Cook said Wednesday that she has "no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet."

"I learned from the media that FHFA Director William Pulte posted on social media that he was making a criminal referral based on a mortgage application from four years ago, before I joined the Federal Reserve," Cook said in a statement.

"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts," she said.

Trump's comments Friday morning came as Powell signaled that economic conditions "may warrant" interest rate cuts.

While the economy and labor market remain resilient, downside risks are rising and growth is declining — and Trump's tariffs are once again raising inflation concerns, Powell said at the Fed's annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday gave a tepid indication of possible interest rate cuts ahead as he noted a high level of uncertainty that is making the job difficult for monetary policymakers.

In his much-anticipated speech at the Fed's annual conclave in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the central bank leader in prepared remarks cited "sweeping changes" in tax, trade and immigration policies. The result is that "the balance of risks appear to be shifting" between the Fed's twin goals of full employment and stable prices.

Watch Powell deliver his remarks live

While he noted that the labor market remains in good shape and the economy has shown "resilience," he said downside dangers are rising. At the same time, he said tariffs are causing risks that inflation could rise again — a stagflation scenario that the Fed needs to avoid.

With the Fed's benchmark interest rate a full percentage point below where it was when Powell delivered his keynote a year ago, and the unemployment rate still low, conditions allow "us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance," Powell said.

"Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance," he added.

That was as close as he came during the speech to endorsing a rate cut that Wall Street widely believes is coming when the Federal Open Market Committee next meets Sept. 16-17.

However, the remarks were enough to send stocks soaring and Treasury yields tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a gain of more than 600 points following the public release of Powell's speech while the policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury note saw a 0.08 percentage point fall to around 3.71%.

In addition to market expectations, President Donald Trump has demanded aggressive cuts from the Fed in scathing public attacks he has lobbed at Powell and his colleagues.

The Fed has held its benchmark borrowing rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5% since December. Policymakers have continued to cite the uncertain impact that tariffs will have on inflation as a reason for caution and believe that current economic conditions and the slightly restrictive policy stance allow for time to make further decisions.

While not addressing the White House demands for lower rates specifically, Powell did note the importance of Fed independence.

"FOMC members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach," he said.

The speech comes amid ongoing negotiations between the White House and its global trading partners, a situation often in flux and without clarity on where it will end. Recent indicators show consumer prices gradually pushing higher but wholesale costs up more rapidly.

From the Trump administration's view, the tariffs will not cause lasting inflation, thus warranting rate cuts. Powell's position in the speech was that a range of outcomes is possible, with a "reasonable base case" being that the tariff impacts will be "short lived — a one-time shift in the price level" that likely would not be cause for holding rates higher. However, he said nothing is certain at this point.

"It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks," Powell said. "Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process."

In addition to summarizing the current conditions and potential outcomes, the speech touched on the Fed's five-year review of its policy framework. The review resulted in several notable changes from when the central bank last performed the task in 2020.

At that time, in the midst of the Covid pandemic, the Fed switched to a "flexible average inflation targeting" regime that effectively would allow inflation to run higher than the central bank's 2% goal coming after a prolonged period of holding below that level. The upshot is that policymakers could be patient with slightly higher inflation if it meant insuring a more comprehensive labor market recovery.

However, shortly after adopting the strategy, inflation began to climb, ultimately hitting 40-year highs, while policymakers largely dismissed the rise as "transitory" and not needing rate hikes. Powell noted the damaging impacts from the inflation and the lessons learned.

"As it turned out, the idea of an intentional, moderate inflation overshoot had proved irrelevant. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our 2020 changes to the consensus statement, as I acknowledged publicly in 2021," Powell said. "The past five years have been a painful reminder of the hardship that high inflation imposes, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of necessities."

Also during the review, the Fed reaffirmed its commitment to its 2% inflation target. There have been critics on both sides of the issue, with some suggesting the rate is too high and can lead to a weaker dollar, while others seeing a need for the central bank to be flexible.

"We believe that our commitment to this target is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored," Powell said.

Waymo is getting one step closer to rides in New York City.

The Alphabet autonomous vehicle subsidiary received its first permit from the New York Department of Transportation on Friday to start testing in New York City, Mayor Eric Adams announced Friday. The rollout is the city's first autonomous vehicle testing launch.

Waymo will start testing up to eight vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September with the potential to extend the program. New York state law requires the company to have a driver behind the wheel to operate.

"We're a tech-friendly administration and we're always looking for innovative ways to safely move our city forward," Adams said in a release. "New York City is proud to welcome Waymo to test this new technology in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as we know this testing is only the first step in moving our city further into the 21st century."

The news comes just two months after the company said it filed permits to test its cars in the city with a trained specialist behind the wheel.

Waymo has hit expansion mode on its services nationwide, launching in Austin this year and expanding its San Francisco area operations in March. Waymo also plans to bring autonomous vehicles to Atlanta, Miami and Washington, D.C. and recently said it will start operations in Philadelphia as it looks to break further into the Northeast market.

Waymo's CEO said the company surpassed 10 million robotaxi trips in May.

For years, autonomous vehicle companies have sought to introduce their technology to The Big Apple, with Waymo previously taking a crack at it in 2021. At that time, the company rolled out some cars in certain areas of the city for manual driving and data collection.

New York City has also expressed interest in bringing autonomous vehicles to the city. Last year, the Adams administration implemented a series of safety requirements for responsible testing in the city and opened a permit program.

As part of the permit, Waymo must regularly meet and report data to DOT and work closely with law enforcement and emergency services.

In this article

When Texas Instruments announced a $60 billion manufacturing megaproject in July, it was a bold bet that companies would want to mass produce foundational microchips on U.S. soil. In August, Apple vowed to do just that.

During the same Oval Office press conference where President Donald Trump announced a 100% tariff on chips from companies not manufacturing in the U.S., Apple CEO Tim Cook upped his companies' U.S. spending commitment to $600 billion over the next four years, up from an original $500 billion announcement in February.

Part of that spending, Cook said, will go toward making "critical foundation semiconductors" for iPhones and other devices at Texas Instruments' new chip fabrication plants in Utah and Texas.

In July, CNBC became the first news organization to see the inside of TI's newest fab in Sherman, Texas. There, full production is on schedule to start by the end of 2025. It's one of seven new factories the chipmaker is building in the U.S. to provide chips to major customers like Nvidia, Ford Motor, Medtronic and SpaceX.

Although Texas Instruments doesn't make the world's most advanced chips, its essential components are found almost everywhere, from smartphones to the graphics processing units powering generative AI.

"If you have anything that plugs into the wall, or has a battery in it, or has a cord in it, you probably carry more than one TI chip in it," said Mohammad Yunus, TI's senior VP of technology and manufacturing.

But just one month after TI announced the $60 billion project, its shares plummeted 13% following weak guidance and tariff concerns raised in its July 23 earnings call. 

"The worry is their end customers. Like in the wake of tariff uncertainty, they don't know what to expect. Are they stockpiling?" said Stacy Rasgon, senior analyst at Bernstein Research.

It remains to be seen whether demand will remain high once tariff uncertainties calm. Still, shares did recover some ground in August.

"I would position them as more of a tariff winner than a tariff loser," said Timothy Arcuri, managing director at UBS. Arcuri said TI's U.S. foundry will allow it to undercut the pricing of its rivals' Taiwan-made chips.

The market for TI's chips, however, is not a guarantee. After TI had trouble keeping up with demand during the chip shortage in 2020, Arcuri said TI's share of the analog market "fell off a cliff." It went from a high of 19.8% in 2020 to a low of 14.7% in 2024, according to UBS.

TI's $60 billion megaproject includes four fabs in Sherman, Texas, one in Richardson, Texas, and two in Lehi, Utah. The new fabs will give TI five times the capacity it has today, Yunus told CNBC.

"They're making a big bet on the fact that they regain share and that demand comes rocketing back," Arcuri said. "If you don't regain that share, it's hard to justify building this much capacity."

While TI is well known for its graphing calculators, the company is also responsible for helping revolutionize the electronics industry. In 1958, TI engineer Jack Kilby filed the first patent for an integrated circuit. That paved the way for miniaturizing chips by building all the components of a circuit, not just the transistors, directly into a single piece of silicon.

The majority of TI's business today comes from automotive and industrial customers that buy the company's analog and embedded chips. Analog chips process signals like sound, light and pressure, like the temperature on a thermostat or voltage on power management chips that keep electronics safe when plugged in. Embedded chips are typically signal processors and microcontrollers for operating everyday devices, like telling the toaster to ding, the dishwasher to end a cycle or anti-lock brakes to engage.

Unlike the costly bleeding edge 2 and 3 nanometer chips made by giants like TSMC,  TI's chips are made on cheaper, legacy nodes: 45 to 130 nanometers. 

That size "is the sweet spot for analog and embedded because they provide the right performance, the power, the voltage that our portfolio needs," Yunus said.

While each TI chip costs about $0.40, according to Arcuri, they play crucial supporting roles for the world's most advanced technologies. In a new partnership with Nvidia, for example, TI is developing a chip to drive efficiency in power-hungry data centers.

In 2009, TI made another bold move to help bring the cost of its chips down further. It opened the world's first 300 millimeter fab for analog chips, re-purposing a memory fab from Qimonda after the chipmaker went bankrupt in the financial crisis.

"That's what really was the catalyst for TI to have such a cost advantage," Arcuri said.

The new wafer size gives TI "tremendous cost efficiency" because 300mm can fit "2.3 times more chips in it versus a 200mm wafer," Yunus said. TI's been closing and selling off some of its 200mm fabs, and all of its seven new fabs will produce on 300mm wafers.

TI told CNBC it's the country's biggest analog and embedded semiconductor manufacturer, selling tens of billions of chips each year. About 60% of revenue comes from customers based outside the U.S., with China making up about 20%. 

About 75% of TI's capital spend happens in the U.S., but it also makes chips abroad at fabs in Germany, Japan and China, the company told CNBC. It does testing and assembly in Mexico, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia, where it's spending $3 billion on two new sites, one of which is now in production. 

TI's global footprint is a benefit in the "dynamic situation" of tariffs right now, Yunus said.

"Our manufacturing across 15 different sites provides us the position to be able to support our customers, no matter where they are and in any political or economic environment," he said.

Although TI considered building its new sites internationally in places like Singapore, the company ultimately settled on Sherman, Texas. The small city 65 miles north of Dallas has a population of just 50,000 people. It's also home to a GlobalWafers factory. The Taiwan-based company manufactures the bare silicon wafers that chips, including TI's, are made on.

Sherman Mayor Shawn Teamann said the city is now "the hub of the Silicon Prairie."

Teamann's grandfather worked alongside Kilby at TI in the 1950s. TI first came to Sherman in 1966, but when it announced plans to close its outdated 150mm fab, the city enticed TI to stay with incentives like tax breaks and water discounts.

The plan worked, and in 2021, TI announced it would stay in Sherman with a campus of new 300mm fabs. Now, the first of four 300mm fabs is complete in Sherman. Teamann said the 300mm project has more than doubled the city's rate of population growth since it was announced in 2021.

As for federal support, TI got $1.6 billion of CHIPS Act funding, and a whopping 35% investment tax credit from Trump's big bill passed in July. 

At the state level, Gov. Greg Abbott has long offered incentives to chip companies willing to build in the state, from low taxes to the $1.4 billion Texas CHIPS Act passed in 2023.

Samsung is the other chip giant in Texas since 1996. The South Korean company is building a $17 billion advanced chip fab near Austin. That's also where Apple, Amazon and AMD design many of their chips. Other chip companies in Texas include Infineon, NXP, X-Fab, Micron, GlobalFoundries, and tool supplier Applied Materials. 

Making chips takes an immense amount of water, and about a quarter of Texas is in drought. 

Luckily, Sherman has water rights to nearby Lake Texoma.

"It was about acquiring more rights, ramping up our production and being able to provide for the mass quantities of water it takes to run a semiconductor facility," said Teamann, adding that the fab has almost doubled the amount of water Sherman uses.

TI will use about 1,700 gallons of water per minute when the new Sherman fab is complete, with plans to recycle at least 50% of that, Yunus said.

Chip manufacturing is also a power hungry process, so it helps that Sherman has a power plant that recently increased capacity. TI's new Sherman fab will run entirely on renewable energy, said Yunus, adding that making chips on 300mm wafers also helps with energy efficiency.

"You use pretty much the same amount of energy but produce 2.2 to 2.3 times more chips," he said.

Texas' uniquely independent grid largely cuts the state off from borrowing power across state lines. In 2021, that grid failed during an extreme winter storm, causing at least 57 deaths and halting production at chipmakers like Samsung and NXP. TI told CNBC it maintained "critical operations."

"We built redundancy into this facility," Yunus said. "We have multiple transmission lines that feed power into the site. We also have large diesel storage tanks that we're able to use, and generators that can continue to power the site for a few days."

Highly skilled chip engineers are another scarce resource. It's a talent pipeline that's been stymied by the dramatic decline of U.S. global semiconductor manufacturing. The U.S. went from holding a 37% share of the market in 1990 to just 10% in 2022, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association.

But TI has developed partnerships with various universities, community colleges and the military to fill the talent gap necessary to fill the roles at its Sherman fab.

"There's a lot of younger people moving to the area. I actually think it's going to be easier for them to get the talent now than it would have been 5 to 10 years ago," Arcuri said.

With the full $60 billion project, TI said it expects to create 60,000 U.S. jobs, but the company could not give an expected completion date when asked for one.

"It's hard to predict when exactly that will take off," Yunus said. "We're hopeful that we'll continue to build out at a pretty brisk pace, but it really depends on the market."Watch the video for an in-depth look at TI's first completed fab in Sherman: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/22/apple-will-make-chips-at-texas-instruments-60-billion-us-project.html

FBI agents on Friday morning raided the Maryland home and Washington, D.C. office of John Bolton, the former national security advisor to President Donald Trump and a staunch critic of the president.

The raids are part of a "national security investigation in search of classified records," a person familiar with the matter told NBC.

The probe is eyeing multiple instances of the use of classified documents in leaks to the news media. The investigation began during the Biden administration, but did not go further before President Joe Biden left office in January.

Ten FBI agents were seen exiting Bolton's office on M Street, with boxes in hand, around 1:40 p.m. ET.

A person close to Bolton told NBC News they believe the raids are in response to Bolton's frequent criticism of the Trump administration, which includes his book "The Room Where it Happened."

"It's retribution, pure and simple," that person told NBC.

Bolton served as Trump's national security advisor from April 2018 through September 2019.

An FBI official told NBC on Friday, "The FBI is conducting court authorized activity in the area. There is no threat to public safety."

That statement indicates a judge signed a search warrant for Bolton's residence in Bethesda, just outside of Washington.

It was not known if Bolton was home at the time of the raid there, which began at around 7 a.m. ET. A woman who appeared to be Bolton's wife was at the residence. He showed up at the home mid-afternoon Friday.

About a half hour after the raid began, Bolton tweeted about Russia and its war on Ukraine, writing that Trump will continue pushing for meetings on the conflict "because Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but I don't see these talks making any progress."

FBI Director Kash Patel tweeted, "NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission" at the same time his agents were raiding Bolton's home.

Attorney General Pam Bondi retweeted Patel's tweet, writing, "America's safety isn't negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always."

And Patel's deputy director at the FBI, Dan Bongino, in his own post on X wrote, "Public corruption will not be tolerated."

Trump later told reporters that he did not know about the raid, but that he expected to be briefed about it later Friday.

The president also said he is "not a fan of John Bolton," and called him a "lowlife."

The New York Post first reported the raid.

Patel ordered the investigation into Bolton, according to the Post, which cited a Trump administration official.

Trump lashed out against Bolton on Aug. 13 after his former advisor criticized the president for agreeing to host a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss how to end Russia's war against Ukraine.

"Very unfair media is at work on my meeting with Putin. Constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton, who just said that, even though the meeting is on American soil, 'Putin has already won,'" Trump wrote on Truth Social that day. "What's that all about? We are winning on EVERYTHING."

On Aug. 17, after he met with Putin, Trump wrote, "This war can be ended, NOW, but stupid people like [Sen.] Chris Murphy, John Bolton, and others, make it much harder to do so."

Trump canceled Bolton's protective detail from the U.S. Secret Service after he was sworn in for his second term in the White House in January. Bolton had been under Secret Service protection because of plots by Iran to kill him.

Trump was previously indicted in federal court in Florida on charges related to his retention of classified government records at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach after leaving the White House in January 2021, and with his efforts to thwart their recovery by government officials.

Trump said on Sept. 10, 2019, that he had effectively fired Bolton the prior evening.

"I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration," Trump wrote in a tweet that day. "Therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service."

The Justice Department dropped that case in late 2024, shortly after Trump was elected president, because of a department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.

The Justice Department sued Bolton in 2020 in an effort to block the publication and sale of his book "The Room Where it Happened," which was a damning account of his time as Trump's national security advisor. The lawsuit was filed during Trump's last year of his first term.

A Justice Department lawyer told a judge that year that the book was "a flagrant breach of" Bolton's agreement not to write about classified matters.

The department dropped the lawsuit in June 2021, five months after Biden took office.

Bolton served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the administration of President George W. Bush.

Coinbase prides itself on "remote-first" work, but CEO Brian Armstrong said the company was forced to make changes to thwart a foe: North Korea.

Armstrong said that North Korean IT workers have tried to leverage the company's remote work policy to gain employment and then access to the crypto exchange's sensitive systems. Coinbase works with law enforcement, but Armstrong said the threat just keeps growing.

"It feels like there's 500 new people graduating every quarter from some kind of school they have — that's just their whole job," Armstrong told John Collison, cofounder and president of online payment provider Stripe, in an episode of Collison's "Cheeky Pint" podcast posted on Wednesday.

Armstrong said that Coinbase is requiring all workers to come to the US for in-person orientation and that anyone with access to sensitive systems must hold US citizenship and submit to fingerprinting.

Last month, the FBI put out an updated warning about North Korean IT workers who target private companies "to illicitly generate substantial revenue for the regime." The FBI said that the IT workers work with both "witting and unwitting" people within the US.

The FBI said US-based facilitators have reshipped company laptops, attended virtual interviews on behalf of North Korean workers, and even created front businesses.

Armstrong said that in many cases, workers themselves might be a target and are being coerced to participate. He said that Coinbase requires prospective employees to turn on their camera during interviews "to prove they're not AI" or not being coached.

Ultimately, Armstrong said that security risks have led Coinbase to build up US-based customer support, pointing to the company's new facility in Charlotte, North Carolina.

"It feels like proof of physical presence is going to be become a bigger deal in a world of AI, deepfakes, just higher stakes for all this kind of cyber crime stuff where in a weird way you see certain areas where remote work goes backwards," Collison said.

Armstrong said Coinbase has also made aggressive efforts to deter internal threats to sensitive information. In some cases, "threat actors" have offered hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to customer service agents to take photos of sensitive information.

Part of the way Coinbase deters this, Armstrong said, is by locking down the information employees have access to. It's also by making it clear what the consequences will be.

"When we catch people, we don't walk them out the door, they go to jail," Armstrong said. "And we try to make it very clear that you're destroying the rest of your life by taking this, even if you think, whatever, it is a life-changing amount of money, it's not worth going to jail."

In this article

Nvidia is in talks with the U.S. government about shipping a new, more advanced chip to China, CEO Jensen Huang said on Friday.

Earlier this week, Reuters reported the U.S. tech giant is developing a new artificial intelligence chip for China, dubbed the B30A, that will be more powerful than the H20 — the only semiconductor Nvidia is allowed to sell in the country at present. The U.S. has grown concerned in the past few years that advanced American chips could be used in Chinese military applications.

A journalist asked Huang about the B30A during a trip to Taiwan.

"Offering a new product to China for the data center, AI data centers, the follow on to H20, that's not our decision to make. It's up to of course the United States government. And we are in dialogue with them. But it's too soon to know," Huang said in response.

Last month, Huang said he hopes that Nvidia can sell more advanced chips in China than the H20 during a visit to the country.

Nvidia's position in China has become a headache for Huang. The company created a special, less-advanced chip for China called the H20, which this year the U.S. government restricted for export. In July, Nvidia said it had given permission to sell this chip again in China. Later, it was revealed that Nvidia will give 15% of its China chip sales to the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses.

Just as it appeared that Nvidia was back in China, it hit other roadblocks, with Chinese authorities raising concerns this month about potential security vulnerabilities in the company's chips. Nvidia said its products do not have "kill switches and backdoors" built into them.

Several reports this month have suggested that the Chinese government has urged local companies not to use Nvidia chips.

Huang has argued that Nvidia should be allowed to sell its chips to China, so that the country's AI is built on American technology and domestic tech giants like Huawei don't fill the void.

That message appeared to get through to Washington. In July, when the H20 was approved for export again, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the move was allowed because Nvidia would not be giving over its best technology.

"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best," Lutnick said.

However, the Financial Times reported on Thursday that these comments were seen as "insulting" by Chinese officials and that local regulators are moving to dissuade domestic firms from buying the H20.

A report by the The Information on Friday said that Nvidia has asked some of its component suppliers to stop production related to the H20 graphics processing units.

The company's shares were down 1.34% in premarket trading at 5:53 a.m. E.T.

Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek has hinted that China will soon have homegrown "next generation" chips to support its AI models, while announcing an update to one of its large language models. 

In a comment under a post on its official WeChat account, DeepSeek said the "UE8M0 FP8" precision format of its newly released model V3.1 is tailored for the next-generation domestically built chips that will be launched soon.

FP8, or 8-bit floating point, is a data processing format that can boost the computational efficiency for training and inference of large deep learning models.

DeepSeek's mention of China's coming next-generation chips may signal plans to work more closely with China's emerging AI chip ecosystem in the face of Washington's advanced semiconductor export restrictions and Beijing's push for chip self-sufficiency.

The comments come about two weeks after Beijing reportedly urged Chinese AI developers to use domestic alternatives to Nvidia's graphics processing units used in AI training. While analysts say China's domestic AI chipmakers lag behind Nvidia in technological advancement and scale, players like Huawei have been making progress.

In its Thursday post, DeepSeek did not disclose the chips it used to train the V3.1, or what local chips the UE8M0 FP8 might be compatible with.

DeepSeek shook up the tech world earlier this year after it released its R1 reasoning model, which demonstrated capabilities comparable to those of Western competitors like OpenAI, despite U.S. export controls restricting it from using Nvidia's most advanced AI training chips.

Prior to that, in December, the company released its V3 model, which it said had been trained on about 2,000 of Nvidia's less advanced chips.

Following DeepSeek's model breakthroughs, the U.S. further tightened export restrictions in April, effectively banning Nvidia's H20 chips, which had been specially designed to meet prior export restrictions on China. 

Last month, officials from the Trump administration said they planned to allow Nvidia to resume shipping the chips to China. However, the H20s are now being met with scrutiny in China, with regulators reportedly mandating companies against buying the chips until a national security review is completed.

Chip analysts have told CNBC that companies like Huawei that have been seeking to build an alternative AI chip ecosystem in China could benefit from a lack of Nvidia's H20s in the market. 

DeepSeek said Thursday that its V3.1 came with "major changes," including faster response times, and a hybrid reasoning architecture that allows the model to support both reasoning and non-reasoning modes. Reasoning models can execute more complicated tasks through a step-by-step logical thought process.

Starting Sept. 6, the company will also adjust the pricing for using the model's API, which allows developers of other apps and web products to integrate DeepSeek on their platforms.

Shares of Chinese electric carmaker Nio surged after the company unveiled one of its most affordable vehicles yet, underscoring the fierce price war in the domestic market.

Nio's U.S.-listed shares rallied, climbing 9.27% to close at $5.54 on Thursday. In Hong Kong, shares rose as much as 10% in Friday morning trading.

The company late Thursday unveiled its latest ES8 SUV, aggressively priced at 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan. The program lowers upfront costs while allowing customers to swap or upgrade batteries through a monthly fee. Deliveries are set to begin in late September.

"The new generation ES8 is priced at very competitive levels with some attractive features, "Vincent Sun, a Senior Equity Analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC.

"We believe that the stock surge is due to the market factoring in strong new orders for the model (together with Onvo L90 launched earlier)."

Nio has historically targeted the high-end market, but has struggled as other companies rolled out vehicles that offer similar features at lower prices. To broaden its reach, the Tencent-backed carmaker has launched two cheaper brands: Onvo, aimed at the mass market, and Firefly, targeting young urban buyers.

The ES8's pricing makes it one of the most aggressively priced premium SUVs, which typically cost between 338,000 yuan and 768,000 yuan.

However, Nio's ET5T sedan holds the title for being the most budget-friendly Nio model, starting at 298,000 yuan.

This rollout of the ES8 comes as China's electric vehicle sector faces mounting pressure. Nio and its EV peers Li Auto and BYD saw a dip in their car deliveries with 21,017 units in July, from 24,925 units in June, while competitors such as Xpeng, Xiaomi, Leapmotor, and Aito reported growth.

Intense competition at home, higher tariffs on exports and regulatory pressure in markets such as the EU have pushed Chinese EV makers, including Nio, to accelerate their global expansion plans.

Nio announced Monday that it would expand into three new markets between 2025 and 2026, including Singapore — its first entry into Southeast Asia — where it will debut its first right-hand drive model under the Firefly brand.

Major Japanese automakers have denied to CNBC that they have raised prices in the U.S. because of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

That comes after a Nikkei Asia report on Thursday that stated that Japanese automakers are "passing some of the expense of U.S. tariffs through to American car buyers, a change from their strategy of absorbing the impact."

Japan was hit with 25% tariffs on automobiles in April, but that was lowered to 15% under a deal reached with the Trump administration on July 22.

Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, told CNBC on Thursday that when its U.S. affiliate raised prices in July, it was "not in response to the tariffs or prospects of increases, but rather a regular, annual price increase to reflect increases in various operational costs."

"We have said that we would observe the situation concerning the tariffs as governments were still negotiating then, but our general stance was not to increase prices to avoid making our cars unaffordable for the customers waiting for their vehicles," the company added.

Reuters reported in June Toyota's plan to increase prices by an average of $270 in July, but a Toyota spokesperson also denied then that the hikes were a direct result of U.S. tariffs.

In its financial results for the first quarter ended June 2025 — Toyota had estimated the impact of U.S. tariffs to be 450 billion yen ($3.03 billion) in its first quarter, and projected it would be 1.4 trillion yen for the full year, taking the U.S.-Japan trade deal into account.

Similarly, Honda told CNBC it has been able to avoid passing tariff costs directly on its products, saying the brand has been able to do so because it has more vehicles in the top 20 of Cars.com's American-Made Index than any other brand.

The index says it ranks models by "how American your prospective car or truck might be," taking into account factors such as location of final assembly and percentage of U.S. and Canadian parts.

Honda said, "Any price changes for the 2026 Honda models now on sale are tied to added feature content that enhances value for the customer and boosts the competitiveness of our products."

As for Nissan, the company said prices have not been increased because of U.S. tariffs, adding that it was leveraging vehicles produced at its U.S. plants as much as possible to help offset tariffs."At the same time, we are managing inventory to meet consumer demand while maintaining competitive pricing. We continue to monitor the market and will make adjustments as needed," its response to CNBC added.

Chocolate lovers face another run of price rises as a lag impact from the cocoa market hits retailers — but better news may be in store by next Easter.

Cocoa prices have soared in recent years, hitting record highs amid adverse weather conditions, pest outbreaks and supply tightness in West Africa, which produces around three-quarters of global supply.

That trend has combined with broader retail price inflation around the world which is pushing up costs for consumers and denting demand for sweet treats in the process. A 2024 survey by U.K. consumer group Which? found chocolate products were the category with the highest average annual inflation rate in grocery stores last year, at 11%. In the U.S., the price of popular products such as Hershey's Kisses similarly jumped around 12% year-on-year.

Adalbert Lechner, head of Swiss giant Lindt & Sprüngli, told CNBC in April he doesn't think cocoa prices "will ever come down to the levels where they have been before."

Cocoa futures have remained choppy but overall eased this year, falling from $8,177 per metric ton at the start of January to around $7,855 in August. That compares with $2,374 three years ago.

And the recent decline won't show up in chocolate prices in the near-term, according to Tracey Allen, agricultural commodities strategist at J.P. Morgan.

"We've got a bit of a hangover happening here," Allen told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Thursday.

Chocolatiers are still dealing with the heightened cocoa prices from the fourth quarter of 2024 when they saw record highs, she said.

"These heightened prices have really had this flow-on, lagged impact for the industry as a whole," she said, with a higher cost of doing business being passed through to the consumer. "There is this ongoing deficit in the market, big depletion of availability of cocoa beans and availability of products. So higher prices for longer here, I'm afraid," she continued.

Lydia Toth, spokesperson for the association of Swiss chocolate manufacturers Chocosuisse, said the quadrupling of cocoa prices over the past two years had significantly increased production costs, squeezing manufacturers' margins, particularly given that retail prices tend to lag.

"The impact is being felt across the industry, from smaller businesses to large international exporters. While some of these cost increases have been passed on to consumers, further price adjustments remain likely. A return to earlier price levels is unlikely," Toth told CNBC.

However, the outlook may be slightly brighter in time for the busy Easter season, J.P. Morgan's Tracey Allen noted.

Industrial demand from manufacturers is softening just as supply is improving, with production ramping up, better weather conditions and new plantings in Ecuador and Brazil reaching maturity, according to J.P. Morgan analysis, though cocoa prices are seen remaining structurally higher for longer at $6,000 per metric ton.

Hamad Hussain, climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC that longstanding productivity challenges such as diseases and years of underinvestment in Ivory Coast and Ghana – the world's two largest cocoa producers – mean that global supply will remain tight, even if weather conditions in West Africa improve over the coming months.

"That will keep prices elevated at historically high levels. Historically high cocoa prices could support chocolate prices," he said.

He also noted other factors that could push up costs on both sides of the Atlantic.

In the U.K., businesses face higher costs from hikes to the minimum wage and employee contributions, which Hussain said appeared to be feeding into the price of foodstuffs including chocolate.

Meanwhile, in the U.S. he said the impact of tariffs could add upward pressure to the price of chocolate over the coming months.

"The upshot is that consumers are likely to face high chocolate prices for some time," he said.

In this article

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Friday showered praise on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. on a visit to Taiwan, saying that anybody looking to take a stake in the company would be "very smart."

This comes at a time when the U.S. administration has signaled interest in acquiring stakes in tech companies, especially those in receipt of funding under the U.S. CHIPS Act.

Huang, who said the main purpose of his trip was to thank TSMC for work related to Nvidia's Rubin, its next-generation AI chip architecture, made the remarks in response to a query on Washington looking to take a stake in the Taiwanese chip foundry.

"Well, first of all, I think TSMC is one of the greatest companies in the history of humanity, and anybody who wants to buy TSMC stock is a very smart person," he said. 

Huang also said TSMC was making six new products for Nvidia, including a new central processing unit, a hardware component used for computation, and a new graphics processing unit, used for advanced computation, especially AI.

Earlier this week, Reuters had reported that U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was looking at equity stakes in exchange for CHIPS Act funding for companies such as Micron, TSMC and Samsung. 

The 2022 CHIPS Act, passed with bipartisan support under the Joe Biden administration, has seen grants and loans awarded to chipmakers expanding production in the U.S. as part of efforts by Washington to revitalize U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing. TSMC had been promised $6.6 billion under the act to help build its three cutting-edge chip fabrication plants in Arizona.

Lutnick confirmed in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that the government was in talks to take a 10% equity stake in troubled semiconductor company Intel, and said the administration might consider stakes in other firms as well.

A report from the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, however, said the government had no plans to seek shares in semiconductor firms that were increasing their U.S. investments, citing a government official. TSMC, in March, announced an expansion of its Investment in the United States to $165 billion.

Separately, Huang said that Nvidia was eager to begin work on "NVIDIA Constellation" — a recently announced new Taiwan office for the company to house its growing Taiwan workforce.

Huang said the company was still working with the local government to resolve some issues to start its construction. 

"We have many, many employees here in Taiwan, and we're growing here in Taiwan because our supply chain is so busy here." 

"We're working with chip companies, system vendors and system makers all over Taiwan, and everybody is working so hard for us and so we need a lot of engineers to work alongside them," he added.

Shares in TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, have gained 6.5% so far this year.

Separately, news reports on Friday said Nvidia had asked some of its component suppliers to stop production related to its made-for-China H20 graphics processing units, after China raised security concerns over the chips. 

Last month, Nvidia said it expected to receive an export license for its H20 chips, which had been effectively banned in April. However, Beijing has reportedly placed a freeze on local companies' ability to buy them.

According to Reuters, one of the companies told to pause their work in relation to the H20 chips was Taiwan's Foxconn — also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry. Foxconn did not respond to an inquiry from CNBC on the matter.

Huang on Friday said that the company had responded to Beijing's concerns regarding its H20s and was hoping that the issue would be resolved.

Tesla is once again in the crosshairs of federal regulators.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Wednesday that it is investigating allegations that Tesla is not correctly reporting crashes involving its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems.

In the probe notice, the NHTSA said that car companies are required to report crashes involving autonomous or advanced driver assistance systems within five days of being notified of them. The regulator alleged that Tesla submitted reports months after the incident, sometimes in batches or on a rolling basis.

"Preliminary engagement between [Office of Defects Investigation] and Tesla on the issue indicates that the timing of the reports was due to an issue with Tesla's data collection, which, according to Tesla, has now been fixed," according to the NHTSA's notice. "NHTSA is opening this Audit Query, a standard process for reviewing compliance with legal requirements, to evaluate the cause of the potential delays in reporting, the scope of any such delays, and the mitigations that Tesla has developed to address them."

The NHTSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dan O'Dowd, founder of The Dawn Project, a tech safety advocacy group, pointed out to Business Insider that according to Tesla's crash-counting methodology listed on its website, the company only counts crashes involving airbag deployments and if Autopilot was engaged within five seconds before the crash.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2022, the NHTSA said it was investigating Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y vehicles over an alleged phenomenon known as "phantom braking," which is when the vehicle suddenly slams on the brakes for no reason, often at high speeds.

In 2020, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on what was then Twitter that phantom braking would be fixed in a coming software update, but he has not commented further since then.

On August 1, a Florida judge ordered Tesla to pay $242 million in damages after finding the EV partly to blame for a 2019 crash that killed a 22-year-old woman and seriously injured her boyfriend. The driver was using Autopilot and had briefly looked away when the crash took place.

Musk said on X that the company would appeal the decision.

Another lawsuit brought by California's Department of Motor Vehicles alleges that Tesla's use of language in advertising Autopilot and FSD has misled consumers into thinking the vehicles are more autonomous than they really are. The case could see Tesla's right to sell in California suspended for at least 30 days.

Attorney Matthew Benedetto, a member of Tesla's legal team, denied the allegations and told an administrative judge last month that the company informed customers that they "cannot fully rely" on FSD or Autopilot.

Bitcoin BTC$116,686.28 bounced off the $111,800 support level on Friday, sharply rising by 2.6% to $114,800 after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell hinted at potential rate cuts during a speech at Jackson Hole.

The swift move, preceded by a sell-off leading up to the speech, resulted in the liquidation of more than $375 million worth of crypto derivatives positions, according to CoinGlass. The majority of those losses are attributed to traders holding short positions.

Ether (ETH) positions were the hardest hit, with $150 million liquidated over the past four hours as the price rose from $4,200 to $4,650, marking a 10% gain.

Bitcoin's level of support was critical as it was a record high set in May. The bounce indicates a bullish reversal following a one-week downtrend from $124,500.

Despite fears that Powell's speech would have a hawkish tone, he said "the downside risks to employment are rising," and "If those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment."

The comments suggest rate cuts could be on the table next month, which would directly benefit risk assets like bitcoin and ether.

The market remains volatile following the speech, with BTC pulling back slightly from $115,700 to $114,800. While liquidations have taken derivatives positions out of the market, open interest has risen to its highest point in four days, suggesting that the bounce is also being backed by leverage, according to Coinalyze.

The altcoin market is lagging behind ether with the exception of lido (LDO) and ethena ENA$0.7346, which are both continuing their upside ascent after the SEC clarified rules around staking earlier this month.

Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings.

Ether treasury firm SharpLink Gaming (SBET) has authorized a stock purchase program of up to $1.5 billion.

SharpLink, which is helmed by Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin, said it will make the repurchases at a time and in amounts that depend on market conditions and share price in an announcement on Friday.

"Should there exist periods where our stock trades at or below the net asset value of our ETH holdings, it would be dilutive on an ETH per share basis to issue new equity through our capital raising efforts," co-CEO Joseph Chalom said in the announcement.

"In this scenario, the accretive course of action may be to repurchase our common stock."

The Minneapolis-based company holds 740,760 ETH, worth $3.19 billion at current prices. Numerous companies have unveiled ether treasury strategies in recent months to capture the upside from generating passive yield through ETH staking. 

SharpLink shares traded over 10% higher at $19.85 on Friday morning following the buyback program announcement and as bitcoin surged after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments opened the door to a September rate cut.

Over $800,000 worth of “blue chip” NFTs are still being held in contracts of Parallel Finance, despite it pulling support for its NFT lending product after a six-month notice period.

With no front end support for NFT lending, non-technical users are unable to withdraw their tokens manually, and the Parallel team is reportedly charging a $500 fee to return the assets.

Yuga Labs' 0xQuit highlighted the predicament on X, as well as posting a step-by-step guide on how to manually withdraw assets using the Etherscan block explorer.

Users were warned that support would be withdrawn in plenty of time; the Parallel Finance website contains a banner linking to an “Important Product Closure Notice.”

Published on January 31, the notice informs users that various services, including NFT lending, will be closed on August 1. “You will have six months from today to withdraw your funds. After this period, you won't be able to withdraw,” it read.

It appears that some users didn't heed the warnings, however. This is unsurprising, given the drop-off in the NFT sector since its peak in Spring of 2022.

Even a recent Pudgy Penguins promo push was seemingly forgotten within 24 hours.

0xQuit identified a number of NFTs from high-value collections still locked up on the platform. These included 11 Bored Ape Yacht Club, 39 Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and two Doodles.

According to current floor price data of the collections listed, the NFTs are worth in excess of $800,000, though tokens with specific traits may be worth more.

Screenshots appear to show a Telegram conversation with Parallel CEO Yubo Ruan in which a user is informed “there will be a $500 late fee for the asset withdrawal.”

Even without a user interface, it's possible for users to withdraw their tokens by interacting with the contract directly. Manual withdrawal requires tracking down a user-specific proxy contract address as well as other info, and encoding a withdrawal transaction for each NFT collection.

0xQuit recognises that the “steps to recover aren't intuitive, but they're doable with some effort.” They add, “If you run into issues, drop a reply below and I'll be happy to help (for free).”

Ruan told Protos, “Please withdraw using [0xQuit's] tutorial, as the platform has officially closed on August 1, 2025.

“Otherwise, all remaining NFTs will be liquidated to provide lender liquidity.”

- MetaWin launches MetaWin Create, offering free AI tools to MetaWinners NFT holders, enhancing NFT utility through blockchain and AI integration.

- The platform hosts a $1.3M exclusive NFT holder event, with a $1M top prize, reinforcing community-driven value and real-world NFT applications.

- MetaWin's 10,000 NFTs, designed by Terraform Labs, have seen tenfold price growth and millions in prize distributions since 2024.

- AI integration boosts productivity threefold internally, with plans for full AI-powered game development, redefining NFTs as functional assets.

MetaWin has launched a new initiative called MetaWin Create, which offers free access to a suite of premium AI tools exclusively for holders of MetaWinners NFTs. This announcement marks a significant step in integrating AI technology with NFT utility, positioning MetaWin as a pioneer in leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence to enhance community value. The tools are categorized into productivity, creative, and developer platforms, aiming to empower NFT holders with resources to boost efficiency, creativity, and technical development. MetaWin Create will be available in phases and requires no additional cost for verified NFT holders[2]. The platform's founder, Skel, emphasized the importance of AI in shaping the future, stating that access to these tools could transform the way users interact with Web3 technology[2].

The MetaWinners NFT collection consists of 10,000 unique digital art pieces, designed by Terraform Labs, a studio known for major Hollywood and gaming projects. These NFTs serve as more than just collectibles; they are integral to the holder's identity within the MetaWin ecosystem and act as a badge of honor across the broader Web3 community. Since its launch in December 2024, the project has delivered millions of dollars in prizes to NFT holders, while the floor price of the collection has increased tenfold. This growth highlights the strong utility and value proposition associated with the NFTs[1][3][4].

MetaWin is also set to host the MetaWinners Millionaire event on September 30, 2025, offering a total prize pool of $1.3 million. A single NFT holder will win $1 million, with the remaining $300,000 distributed among other winners. The event is entirely exclusive to NFT holders, with no entries for sale, meaning only the 10,000 NFT owners can participate. This structure ensures that the competition remains community-driven, with odds of winning the top prize standing at 1 in 10,000. The event is considered a groundbreaking move in NFT utility, offering the largest guaranteed cash prize to an NFT holder in the industry[1][3][4].

The integration of AI tools and exclusive events like the MetaWinners Millionaire reflects MetaWin's broader strategy to enhance the value of NFT ownership beyond speculative investment. By embedding real-world applications such as productivity, creative development, and competitive prize pools, the platform is creating a more functional and engaging NFT ecosystem. The move also aligns with the growing trend of blockchain platforms leveraging AI to streamline operations and improve user experiences. For instance, MetaWin's internal teams are already reporting three times higher productivity due to AI integration, and its game studio is transitioning to full AI-powered development[2].

MetaWin's approach to NFT utility is setting a benchmark in the digital asset space. By combining exclusive rewards, real-world tools, and competitive elements, the platform is redefining how NFTs can serve as more than just digital collectibles. The MetaWinners project has already demonstrated significant traction, with substantial increases in both prize distributions and NFT value. As the event and AI initiatives unfold, MetaWin aims to further solidify its position as a category-defining project in the blockchain and NFT landscape[1][2][4].

The EU is weighing Ethereum and Solana for its digital euro, a move that could redefine how central banks approach blockchain.

The European Union is weighing a surprising move regarding its long-discussed digital euro. Officials are now exploring whether to run it on public blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH-USD) or Solana (SOL-USD). That means shifting away from private, closed systems and opening the door to networks that anyone can access.





This is a big change in tone. Until now, most central banks, including China, have favored private blockchains that restrict access to authorized players. If Europe breaks from that approach, the digital euro could resemble U.S. stablecoins rather than China's tightly controlled digital yuan.

The pressure is not only about technology. U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins now dominate with more than 98 percent of the market. European policymakers worry that such heavy reliance on American products could erode Europe's financial independence. In April, ECB board member Piero Cipollone argued that cutting down the use of stablecoins might require a digital euro that people can trust and adopt.

Choosing Ethereum or Solana would be a strategic signal that Europe intends to compete directly with U.S. private sector innovation instead of playing catch-up.

Public blockchains bring clear benefits. A digital euro built on Ethereum or Solana could connect instantly with existing crypto infrastructure such as DeFi platforms, wallets, and global payment rails. This would make adoption smoother and reduce the friction that usually slows central bank digital currencies.

The risks are equally clear. A public blockchain could give governments a stronger role in how these networks are governed. Juan Ignacio Ibañez of MiCA Crypto Alliance put it bluntly when he said, the upside is better integration, while the downside is a stronger state interest in influencing blockchain governance.

For now, nothing is final. An ECB spokesperson declined to confirm whether Ethereum or Solana are officially under review and instead pointed to the central bank's FAQ page. The ECB maintains that no model has been chosen. The Governing Council is expected to decide by the end of 2025 whether a digital euro will even be issued.

That means the project is still in the exploratory phase. What has changed is the nature of the debate. Europe is no longer asking if it should launch a digital euro. The question is what kind of system will power it, private and controlled or public and interoperable.

 Beijing's consideration of a yuan-backed stablecoin could mark a new front in the global financial system, but experts say dollar dominance, liquidity and trust are high hurdles. 

China appears to be weighing the launch of a yuan-backed stablecoin, with an initial rollout in Hong Kong and Shanghai, a surprising shift after years of cracking down on crypto while promoting its central bank digital currency, the digital yuan.

In the latest episode of Byte-Sized Insight, Cointelegraph spoke with two leaders analyzing China's potential move into stablecoins: Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Patrick Tan, CEO of blockchain intelligence firm ChainArgos. 

The news, first reported on Wednesday, highlighted Beijing's ambitions to strengthen the yuan's role in international finance. Still, experts say the path forward is anything but certain, especially with the track record of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan. 

According to Chorzempa, the dominance of Alipay and WeChat Pay in everyday transactions has left little room for China's CBDC experiment. 

That leaves a yuan stablecoin with a different potential role. “I tend to think that probably the most interesting applications of a renminbi [yuan] stablecoin is going to be cross-border payments,” Chorzempa said.

Still, cross-border utility doesn't erase the credibility gap between the yuan and the US dollar. Chorzempa said:

“And if the answer is yes,” he said, “it's probably not going to be that attractive in comparison to something in USD, which is really freely usable.”

From a market perspective, the hurdles are just as steep. “Ninety-eight percent of all stablecoins and stablecoin transactions are dollar-based,” said Tan. 

For Tan, the real issue is systemic: “If China wants to make the digital yuan attractive, it needs to make the yuan attractive first. And to make the yuan attractive requires significant, large systemic political and economic changes and reforms, which, given the current climate in China, I think would be extremely challenging at best.”

Whether China's stablecoin push succeeds or stalls, it signals one thing clearly: Stablecoins are no longer just crypto plumbing; they've become tools in a larger geopolitical contest over the future of money.

 Andrew Tate is back on the memecoin bandwagon but hasn't nailed the trading game as his wallet approaches losses of $700,000 on Hyperliquid. 

Former kickboxing champion and controversial influencer Andrew Tate is among the latest celebrities to dive into Kanye West's newly launched YZY token, but his bets are already deep in the red.

A wallet address linked to Tate opened a 3x leveraged short position on the recently launched, West-linked YZY token at $0.85 and was sitting on a $16,000 loss on the position.

Tate “doesn't seem to be good at perps trading,” as his cumulative losses are nearing $700,000 on this single Hyperliquid account, wrote blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain in a Friday X post. “So far, he's made 80 trades on #Hyperliquid — only 29 were profitable (win rate: 36.25%) — with total losses of $699K.”

The YZY token was launched on Solana on Thursday by the rapper, with the top 13 wallets profiting a total of $24.5 million as they dumped the token, which spiked 1,400% within the first hour before dropping over 74% since.

With growing celebrity interest in cryptocurrencies, more influencers are realizing losses, showing that not all financial advice or investment endorsements should be treated equally. 

The losing trade comes more than a year after Tate was hit by insider trading allegations related to his memecoin, the Daddy Tate (DADDY) token, which saw insiders scoop up 30% of the supply at launch before Tate started promoting the token on X, Cointelegraph reported at the time.

Tate joined waves of celebrities who jumped on the Solana memecoin bandwagon on June 7, 2024, endorsing more than 10 tokens known for having no intrinsic value.

Most of the tokens lost around 99% of their value shortly after Tate's endorsement, with multiple tokens allegedly having up to 30% insider supply allocation, Bubblemaps warned in an X post in October 2024.

These included Roost (ROOST), the Germany Token (GER), Fuck Tristan (FTRISTAN), TopG (TOPG), RNT (RNT) and Daddy Tate (DADDY).

Over 30 celebrity-endorsed tokens launched on Solana in June 2024 and have seen prices fall by no less than 73.23%.

Other celebrities who promoted Solana-based meme tokens include 50 Cent, Caitlyn Jenner, Iggy Azalea and soccer legend Ronaldinho Gaúcho.

UFC contender Khamzat Chimaev-linked Smash (SMASH) token was also hit by insider allegations after it was revealed that up to 78% of the token's supply was bought by team and developer-related wallets, Cointelegraph reported in July 2024.

Three days after the token launch, Chimaev's manager, Majdi Shammas, claimed that the martial artist “wasn't involved” with the SMASH memecoin and “[knows] just as little as you do,” alleging that he promoted the coin without the fighter's input.

When US President Donald Trump took office in January, he brought with him an ambitious set of campaign-trail promises made to the crypto industry.

One of the few — and one of his earliest pledges — still on the table is his vow to block a US central bank digital currency. 

“Such a currency would give the federal government absolute control over your money,” Trump warned last year. “They could take your money, and you wouldn't even know it was gone.”

Those efforts took a step forward this week when the House of Representatives passed the annual National Defense Authorization Act, which includes a provision to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar.

The language, closely resembling Representative Tom Emmer's CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, would bar the Fed from offering accounts or digital tokens directly to individuals or through intermediaries.

It isn't the first time the House has acted on CBDCs. In May 2024, lawmakers passed a standalone financial services bill with the same aim, but it stalled in the Senate. 

While the measure marks progress toward a campaign pledge that resonated strongly with Trump's crypto supporters, no US CBDC has ever been issued, and the provision must still clear the Senate before it becomes law.

Trump has already checked off several of his campaign vows to the crypto industry. 

Just two days after his inauguration, he pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road marketplace, following through on a promise that had become a cause célèbre among libertarians and Bitcoiners. 

Trump had also pledged to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, though he never had to. Gensler announced his resignation ahead of Inauguration Day, ending a tenure defined by aggressive enforcement actions against the industry. 

The president has since appointed crypto supporter Paul Atkins as the new head of the SEC.

In March, Trump established a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Though in its current iteration, the reserve consists only of coins seized by federal authorities rather than taxpayer-funded purchases. Treasury officials recently confirmed no additional buying is planned.

In August, Trump signed an executive order aimed at curbing “debanking” by directing regulators to remove guidance seen as pressuring banks to avoid crypto companies, though experts question how much practical impact it will have.

Other pledges remain unfinished. 

Trump moved quickly in January with an executive order on digital assets that affirmed Americans should be free to hold their own crypto in self-hosted wallets and transact peer to peer without interference. 

But only Congress can make that protection permanent. The Clarity Act, which would formally enshrine these rights, passed the House in July but has yet to clear the Senate.

Lower interest rates, another key Trump campaign pledge, have so far remained out of reach. Though they haven't gone higher, either.

The Fed has kept its benchmark range pinned at 4.25% to 4.5% all year, leaving markets to look to central bank chair Jerome Powell's upcoming Jackson Hole remarks for clues on whether cuts are finally coming.

Traders had put the odds of a September rate cut as high as 83% on Wednesday, but that has slipped to just above 71% on Friday. 

For crypto, which thrives on looser liquidity, the outcome could set the tone for crypto and traditional markets through the rest of the year.

And then there is Trump's most far-fetched promise: to ensure that all remaining Bitcoin is mined in the United States. 

No serious policy effort has been made toward that goal, and even industry insiders saw this as more campaign rhetoric than an achievable target.

 SBI partners with Circle, Ripple and Startale to launch stablecoin ventures and a tokenized asset trading platform in Japan. 

Japanese financial conglomerate SBI inked new blockchain partnerships with USDC issuer Circle, XRP developer Ripple and the Web3 company Startale.

SBI Group announced the three separate partnerships on Friday, including stablecoin-related collaborations with US companies Circle and Ripple, and a new tokenization project with Singapore-based Startale.

In cooperation with Startale, SBI plans to build an onchain trading platform for tokenized stocks and real-world assets (RWAs) to enable 24/7 trading.

As part of stablecoin collaborations with Ripple and Circle, SBI will explore new ways to promote adoption of Circle's USDC (USDC) and Ripple's Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin.

While the Circle announcement mentions the establishment of a joint venture with SBI, the partnership with Ripple aims to establish RLUSD distribution in Japan through SBI's crypto subsidiary SBI VC Trade.

“The establishment of this joint venture aims to promote the use of USDC in Japan and create new use cases in the Web3 and digital finance domains,” SBI said.

The Ripple announcement refers to a new memorandum of understanding with Ripple Labs on distributing RLUSD in Japan, with SBI VC Trade aiming to make the stablecoin available during the fiscal year ending March 2026.

“The introduction of RLUSD will not just expand the option of stablecoins in the Japanese market, but is a major step forward in the reliability and convenience of stablecoins in the Japanese market,” SBI VC Trade CEO Tomohiko Kondo said.

SBI previously announced similar partnerships with both Circle and Ripple, with SBI VC Trade completing registration to support USDC operations in March. The Japanese conglomerate has maintained a long-standing partnership with Ripple, facilitating various XRP (XRP) services across its platforms over the past several years.

As part of a joint venture with Startale, SBI secured “milestone-based committed funding” to build an onchain tokenized platform in Japan.

The development echoes many tokenization initiatives globally, with companies like Gemini, Kraken and Robinhood introducing similar 24/7 trading platforms offering tokenized stocks of companies like Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) earlier this year.

“As tokenized RWAs enable 24/7 real-time settlement and achieve unprecedented liquidity and capital efficiency, the convergence of traditional finance and DeFi will likely accelerate,” SBI CEO Yoshitaka Kitao said.

“We predict that this movement will eventually lead to the digitalization of capital markets themselves, including exchanges,” the executive said, adding:

The announcement did not specify either the expected launch date for the platform with Startale or what blockchain network would be used in the venture. Startale is known for co-developing Sony's layer-2 blockchain Soneium and Astar Network.

“We're not ready to reveal the technical architecture just yet,” Startale Group CEO Sota Watanabe told Cointelegraph.

“What matters is the joint venture's mission: to deliver an always-on, compliant trading platform for tokenized assets,” Watanabe said, adding that the timeline will be announced at a later date.

Cointelegraph approached SBI for comment regarding the joint tokenization project but had not received a response by publication.

SBI's move comes as major financial players globally are experimenting with the tokenization of traditional assets. Earlier on Friday, Bloomberg reported that Eric Trump plans to visit Tokyo in September as part of his family's expanding push into the cryptocurrency industry.

Today the Financial Times ran an article saying EU officials are accelerating plans for the digital euro central bank digital currency, spurred on by the passage of the US GENIUS Act for stablecoins. It also asserted that officials are mulling launching the digital euro on the public Ethereum or Solana blockchains, “rather than a private one, which had previously been expected, due to privacy concerns.” 

While the first statement is undoubtedly accurate, the second one deserves examination as it potentially conflates several topics. As part of the ECB retail digital euro work, it is currently exploring potential innovations involving at least 70 organizations. A few of these are blockchain firms. This is likely the source of these ‘discussions'. But the retail digital euro never planned to use blockchain, certainly not at the base layer. Blockchain is not sufficiently performant. On the other hand, a wholesale CBDC for use only by banks would almost certainly use blockchain. The one piloted by the Banque de France leverages blockchain.

Even on the retail front, there's also the question of how blockchains might be used. Potentially someone could lock digital euros with a custodian and issue permissionless blockchain tokens linked to the digital euro. Unlike the real thing, that involves counterparty risks. But there are other avenues to use blockchain. China's digital yuan does not use blockchain at the base layer, but supports the use of blockchain applications and smart contracts tied to its CBDC. However, those are permissioned blockchains.

European Union policymakers are discussing ramping up efforts to introduce a digital euro as the U.S.' new stablecoin law intensifies pressure on the bloc to keep up the pace in the fast-moving world of digital money, the Financial Times reported, 

The U.S. Congress last month approved the GENIUS Act, a framework for the $288 billion stablecoin sector dominated by dollar-pegged tokens like Tether's USDT and Circle Internet's (CRCL) USDC. The move caught many in Europe off guard, according to people familiar with the talks, and sparked concerns that dollar-pegged tokens could tighten America's grip on cross-border payments if the EU doesn't accelerate its own plans.

In a notable shift, officials are now weighing whether to launch the central bank digital currency (CBDC) on public blockchains like Ethereum or Solana rather than the private infrastructure previously envisioned.

Until recently, the European Central Bank (ECB) had been leaning toward a private, centrally controlled system, citing privacy and security. But sources say the U.S. legislation has shifted the conversation, with some policymakers now open to decentralized networks that could help the euro circulate more freely and compete with dollar-based digital assets globally, according to the FT.

The ECB has been studying a digital euro for several years, pitching it as a public alternative to privately issued payment systems as cash use dwindles. Yet U.S. momentum is raising concerns that euro deposits could increasingly flow into dollar-denominated assets abroad.

With China piloting its digital yuan and the U.K. considering a digital pound, Europe faces mounting pressure to deliver. A handful of euro-backed stablecoins already exist,  Circle's EURC among them, but a central bank-issued token would carry far more weight.

The ECB confirmed to the Financial Times it is still evaluating both centralized and decentralized technologies, leaving open the possibility of a blockchain-powered euro as officials race to protect the single currency's relevance in a digitizing world.

U.S. President Donald Trump signs the GENIUS Act, a bill that regulates stablecoins, on July 18. Regulatory inaction is pushing Canadians toward U.S. dollar-based stablecoins.Evan Vucci/The Associated Press

Ori Freiman is a post-doctoral fellow at McMaster University's Digital Society Lab. Rafael Morales-Guzman is a doctoral candidate at the University of Saskatchewan and a fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation's Digital Policy Hub.

As the U.S. Senate passed landmark legislation to regulate the digital American dollar, Canada's slow response is an economic neglect, practically surrendering our economic future. Meet “stablecoins,” the technology underlying future payments.

Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value. They are primarily distinguished by two fundamental characteristics: the link that gives them value and how they maintain their stability.

Their value is usually pegged to a currency – commonly the U.S. dollar, a precious metal such as gold, or a mix of assets. The methods used to prevent value fluctuation range from holding one-to-one cash reserves to deploying smart algorithms that control the supply. This is how stablecoins avoid the price volatility that characterizes cryptocurrencies, making them more suitable for everyday payments and transactions.

For consumers and small businesses using stablecoins is like upgrading from snail mail to e-mail, but for money. Payments can be sent and received instantly, any time, including weekends, and across the globe – just like texting someone.

The crypto irony: Trump's new laws for stablecoins will only reinforce U.S. dollar dominance

Crypto industry pushing Canada to follow U.S. lead in embracing stablecoins

The operational fees are expected to be much lower than those of traditional bank transfers. These reduced costs would finally enable micropayments on a large scale, so, for example, you could pay a few cents for just one news article instead of buying a subscription.

For buying products or sending money to other countries, stablecoins reduce expenses and time by cutting out costly middlemen and their processing times. Stablecoins facilitate near-instant cross-border transfers with fees, often below 1 per cent. All one needs is a digital wallet app and sound regulations to protect them. 

For businesses and financial institutions, stablecoins represent a major upgrade to the traditional, slow and expensive plumbing of the global financial system. Instead of waiting days for large international payments to clear through traditional banking networks, companies can move millions of dollars nearly instantly, 24/7.

Stablecoin issuers will likely increase competition, meaning funds will no longer be “stuck in traffic,” allowing smarter, efficient, cheaper and more immediate money management. Beyond these, stablecoins are also “programmable money,” meaning they can be used to automate tasks like payroll or more complex payment workflows, leading to innovative financial products and services.

For Canada's economy to become stronger and more independent, it's time to rethink how regulation is done. Currently, the Canadian Securities Administrators classifies stablecoins as securities, similar to stocks or bonds, rather than a means of payment. This creates major roadblocks for digital payment innovations and for our economy to flourish.

First, it puts Canadian companies at a competitive disadvantage since they can't easily accept stablecoin payments like their global counterparts. Second, it is a classic example of Canadian “innovation drain,” as promising Canadian fintech startups move elsewhere to grow. Third, this approach is out of sync with other jurisdictions that regulate stablecoins as a new form of payment. Fourth, this is a threat to our economic independence: the inaction pushes Canadians toward U.S. dollar-based stablecoins, an unnecessary capital drain.

This trend will likely accelerate because the Bank of Canada has no immediate plans to issue a public digital dollar. While a Bank of Canada-run digital currency comes with its own potential drawbacks, the policy vacuum leaves our market to foreign alternatives.

By treating stablecoins like investment products instead of a payment tool, Canada is essentially handing over the future of digital money to other countries. Canada's top financial regulatory agencies are aware of this, collaborating on a framework for stablecoins. 

For this effort to succeed, our regulators should start by legally defining stablecoins as a payment tool, bringing them under the watch of an updated Retail Payment Activities Act. Under this plan, only registered Canadian financial institutions could issue a stablecoin, and they would be required to back every digital coin with 100-per-cent cash-equivalent reserves.

To build public trust, these reserves must be regularly audited by reputable independent firms. Crucially, strong consumer protection rules would hold issuers legally and financially accountable for any funds lost to fraud, cyberthefts or operational failures.

Such a framework would provide the clarity needed to adopt new payment technologies responsibly. It would boost innovation and competition, allowing a privately-issued digital Canadian dollar to become the trusted choice for Canadians. Ultimately, this approach will secure Canada's monetary sovereignty in the digital age.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Kraken said it has fully deployed distributed validator technology (DVT) for its Ethereum staking service using SSV Network, becoming the first major crypto exchange to put the fault-tolerance setup into production at scale.

DVT lets a single Ethereum validator key be split into secure “shares” and run by several operators who must jointly sign duties. The design aims to improve resilience to outages and correlated failures.

Meanwhile, SSV Network operates as an open protocol purpose-built for DVT. It's designed to enhance validator liveness and safety by adding geographic and client diversity. In that way, no single operator holds the whole key, and multiple independent nodes must participate to validate blocks.

In a Thursday statement, Jonathan Marcus, Kraken's head of strategy, custody, and staking, said the rollout “has fundamentally improved the performance reliability of our ETH validators.”

A major positive touted by the deployment is focused on reducing correlated slashing risk. Validator slashing penalties can occur if nodes go offline or behave inconsistently. By distributing responsibilities across distinct operators, DVT can mitigate single points of failure and help exchanges and custodians meet uptime and risk-management requirements. Kraken's move is expected to encourage secure staking participation and harden Ethereum's network security, according to SSV Labs Founder Alon Muroch. His firm claims to secure over $18 billion in staked assets across more than 126,000 validators.

Kraken has been expanding its product set alongside its staking business. The exchange is rolling out “xStocks,” tokenized representations of equities for select non-U.S. markets, and plans to support issuance on additional chains such as Tron, part of a broader industry push toward tokenized traditional assets.

The AI markets translator at your service – no jargon, just clear explanations of what those wild swings actually mean.

- 2025 crypto market faces dual challenges: evolving U.S. regulations (SEC/CFTC) and AI-powered fraud surging 200% per Chainalysis.

- SEC's Project Crypto and CFTC's "crypto sprint" aim to integrate digital assets into mainstream markets via clearer rules and spot trading.

- AI-driven risks include deepfake scams, synthetic identities, and algorithmic market manipulation, demanding enhanced cybersecurity and hedging strategies.

- Investors must balance regulatory compliance (e.g., SEC-approved ETPs) with tech vigilance (MFA, AI monitoring) to mitigate fraud and volatility.

 

The cryptocurrency sector in 2025 is at a crossroads, where evolving regulatory frameworks and AI-driven fraud are redefining the risk profiles for both retail investors and institutional asset managers. While U.S. regulators like the SEC and CFTC are pivoting toward innovation-friendly policies, the rise of sophisticated cyber threats—powered by artificial intelligence—has created a volatile environment. This duality demands a recalibration of investment strategies to balance regulatory compliance with technological vigilance.  

The past year has seen a marked shift in regulatory priorities. The SEC's Project Crypto initiative, launched in July 2025, aims to modernize securities laws to foster innovation, signaling a departure from the aggressive enforcement stance of previous years. For example, the SEC's August 2025 clarification on liquid staking activities—declaring them non-implicated under securities laws—has provided much-needed clarity for market participants. Similarly, the CFTC's “crypto sprint” to enable spot crypto trading on federal exchanges underscores a collaborative effort to integrate digital assets into mainstream markets.  

However, these developments come with caveats. The dismissal of the SEC's case against Coinbase in February 2025, while reducing immediate legal risks for crypto platforms, has raised questions about the consistency of enforcement. Retail investors, in particular, must now navigate a landscape where regulatory guidance is evolving rapidly, yet enforcement remains inconsistent. For asset managers, the challenge lies in aligning portfolios with these shifting rules while avoiding exposure to unregistered or ambiguous products.  

 

While regulatory clarity is emerging, technological risks are escalating. Chainalysis' 2025 Crypto Crime Report reveals a 200% surge in AI-powered fraud, with personal wallet compromises accounting for 23.35% of stolen funds. Attackers are leveraging large language models (LLMs) to craft hyper-personalized phishing schemes, deepfake voice scams, and synthetic identities to infiltrate crypto platforms. For instance, deepfake-aided wire fraud targeting businesses has surged, with AI-generated voices mimicking executives to authorize fraudulent transfers.  

Retail investors are especially vulnerable. Many lack the technical expertise to detect AI-generated social engineering tactics, such as fake customer service calls or AI-driven chatbots impersonating support agents. Meanwhile, asset managers face risks from algorithmic market manipulation, including wash trading and pump-and-dump schemes orchestrated by AI tools. The report also notes that cybercriminals are using AI to optimize laundering strategies, such as timing sales of stolen assets to avoid detection.  

The interplay of regulatory and technological risks demands a proactive approach to portfolio management. Here are key strategies for investors:  

Avoid unregistered tokens or platforms operating in regulatory gray areas, such as meme coins or decentralized exchanges lacking compliance frameworks.  

Enhance Cybersecurity Protocols 

Asset managers should integrate AI-based monitoring systems to detect anomalies in trading patterns or wallet activity, mitigating risks from both external fraud and internal mismanagement.  

Leverage Regulatory Tailwinds 

Stay informed about the SEC's Project Crypto updates, which could unlock new investment vehicles, such as tokenized real estate or securitized crypto assets.  

Mitigate AI-Driven Market Volatility 

The crypto sector's evolution in 2025 is defined by a delicate balance between regulatory progress and technological peril. While initiatives like Project Crypto and the CFTC's “crypto sprint” aim to create a more structured market, the rise of AI-driven fraud underscores the need for heightened vigilance. For investors, the path forward lies in combining regulatory compliance with cutting-edge cybersecurity measures. By adopting a dual focus on policy alignment and technological resilience, both retail and institutional players can navigate this dynamic landscape with greater confidence.  

As the sector matures, the mantra for success will be adaptability: staying ahead of regulatory curves while outpacing the ever-evolving threats of the digital age.

TRON is outperforming other altcoins, mainly driven by user growth.



TRON outpaced altcoins in BTC performance, with Kraken expanding xStocks to Tron. MetaMask adding TRX support and growing USDT adoption, boosting its user base and exchange partnerships.

Justin Sun's blockchain, TRON [TRX] is still making waves not only in terms of price performance but also in major partnerships around the crypto space.

The altcoin has outperformed its peers when evaluating their ratio changes against Bitcoin [BTC].

The altcoin has been among the best performers for the year, with returns of more than 115%, per CoinMarketCap. Its user growth has been one of the main drivers of price performance.



That said, Justin Sun is looking to adjust the transaction cost on the blockchain. As the unit price of TRX rises, the fees follow.

This would let TRON remain competitive in as a layer for stablecoin issuance, DeFi activities and tokenization.

Evaluating the weekly gains for the major altcoins against Bitcoin, the charts showed that TRON led with 2.66%.

It was closely followed by Solana [SOL] and Ethereum [ETH], which barely had 1%. For Ripple [XRP], the change was negative 2.28% over the same period.

Following this performance, some users were regretting not to have bought TRX in the previous bear market. This bull market has made TRX have the best returns since 2021.

On the TRX valuation against the US dollar, the altcoin traded at $0.35 per Trading View. Since the 23rd of July, when it traded at $0.24, TRX has stayed above the trendline support with timely bounce of it.

The MACD has flipped bullish after the bounce, but the Stochastic RSI is still at overbought levels. Still, the altcoin shows urge to reclaim $0.37 which was its previous peak as users continue to rise.

User growth is the standout driver of TRON's price growth, driven by the surge in chain activity. Kraken users will now trade their xStocks on the TRON blockchain.

The tokenization of stocks on TRON brings another bunch of traditional participants of the markets. Kraken's tokenized equities include Apple, Tesla, among others.

Additionally, TXR is being integrated on MetaMask per CoinMarketCap. This will bring more than 100 million users on board. Recently, MetaMask also integrated Sei Network [SEI] and Solana.

Also, institutions have been heavily relying on the blockchain in moving their USDT. Most of the USDT is transacted on TRON blockchain, with more than $860 million flowing into exchanges.

This has been the case since 2022, with USDT accounting for 61% of total transactions on TRON.

Among the exchanges, OKX led this inflow of stablecoins through the network. Bitfinex came second, but its volume, in reality, was about a fifth of what was moved on OKX.

John Gilpatrick and Jackie Appel discuss how the James Webb Telescope picked up a strange chemical on a distant world—one that only living things make.

Could we really be on the verge of discovering life on other planets? Maybe. And the case is growing stronger by the day.

It's not just a hunch—there's hard data to back up the claim that we may not be alone in the universe after all, thanks to what's being beamed across space by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

One of the most mind-blowing recent scientific developments is the repeated detection of something called dimethyl sulfide (DMS) on a faraway exoplanet called K2-18b. DMS is a gas that, on Earth, is only produced by living organisms. In 2023, JWST's instruments picked up hints of DMS alongside methane and carbon dioxide. 

Then, earlier this year, JWST's follow-up observations provided updated evidence for DMS and/or its cousin, DMDS. When we reported on the finding, we literally said, “This Is Not a Drill,” because even though no one is using the “aliens” word just yet, this biosignature might be our first solid clue that something—something!—is alive on another world.

Ever since that news broke, we haven't been able to stop thinking about what it could mean. Watch Pop Mech editors John Gilpatrick and Jackie Appel geek out over the mysterious DMS and K2-18b, and how this signal—if confirmed—would change everything we thought we knew about life elsewhere in the universe.

John and Jackie discuss how Webb was able to detect such faint traces of gas across billions of miles, and why scientists are proceeding with cautious excitement.

Can SpaceX Solve Its ‘Exploding Starships' Problem?

After a string of fiery failures, SpaceX's biggest rocket faces another test flight with sky-high stakes for U.S. space ambitions

By Adam Rogers edited by Lee Billings

SpaceX's Starship soars through the sky during the rocket's ninth test flight on May 27, 2025. Both the “Super Heavy” booster and the Starship upper stage suffered spectacular failures before the flight's completion, marking the rocket's third unsuccessful test in a row.

Joe Marino/UPI/Alamy Live News

“Kaboom” is not the sound you want a rocket ship to make, as a rule. Yet that's the problem facing the private aerospace company SpaceX and its leader, Elon Musk. Instead of going to space, their newest rocket ship keeps going kaboom.

The last three flights of Starship, a two-stage, 400-foot tall behemoth, ended in fiery disaster—what Musk has sometimes jokingly called a “rapid unplanned disassembly.” In January and again in March the launch vehicle's Super Heavy booster stage made it back to a massive, pincer-equipped gantry, but Starship's upper stage didn't. In May the booster exploded just before splashdown, and Starship broke up spectacularly in the atmosphere, raining debris that commercial aircraft had to dodge. As a bonus, in June the upper stage detonated on the launchpad while Starship was getting fueled for a test firing of its engines. The tally for 2025 thus far is: explosions, four; SpaceX, zero.

Today Starship's Super Heavy booster and upper stage are on the launchpad yet again. The 10th test flight is scheduled for liftoff on Sunday, circa 7:30 P.M. EDT, from SpaceX's Starbase launch site in South Texas. If all goes to plan, the booster will use its 33 rocket engines to push the whole shebang to the edge of space, then drop off, somersault, execute a “boost-back burn” and descend to a soft splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile Starship's upper stage should be firing its rockets to reach orbit, where it will deploy some cargo before flying itself back down through the atmosphere to its own splashdown about an hour and 15 minutes after launch. “Excitement guaranteed,” a SpaceX announcement promises.

But there's excitement and there's excitement. Look, going to space is hard. It's even harder to do in the way SpaceX is attempting. “It's one of the biggest rockets ever. It's, for sure, the biggest rocket that has attempted reuse,” says Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, who tracks space launches in his spare time. “Developing a vehicle this big and launching it repeatedly ain't easy.”

Starship isn't just an oligarch's folly. It's a launch system meant to revolutionize spaceflight by flying cargo and crews to orbit at a cost that's almost too cheap to meter. It's supposed to take NASA astronauts back to the moon and human settlers to Mars. And it represents the kind of gleaming, hardware-forward future that Silicon Valley's techno-optimists are always promising. Starship is the linchpin of a lot of plans and schemes.

Over the past few months, SpaceX has acknowledged which pieces of the ship broke with each flight but hasn't gone into any great detail about why. The company didn't return requests for comment from Scientific American. But SpaceX's very online rocket-spotting fans—and the half-dozen aerospace engineers I talked to—have been willing to speculate what the problems might be. Mostly, they believe the company has some brilliant people who stand every chance of solving them. But they also wonder what will happen if SpaceX can't figure out what's wrong—or, even worse, if some fundamental engineering issue means the idea of a reusable, reliable, workhorse spaceship stays confined to science fiction.

Though SpaceX characterizes this differently, Starship had essentially the same types of mishap in all three of the most recent flights—leaks, fires and explosions in the fuel system. On flight seven, there was a flash and then a fire in the unpressurized “attic” below the bottom of Starship's liquid oxygen tank. On flight eight, that happened near one of the rocket engines. On flight nine, fuel leaked into the nose cone.

That fuel, and the plumbing to move it around, might be the problem. It's a mix of liquid methane and liquid oxygen—a volatile cryogenic cocktail that's still, by rocket science standards, experimental. To stay liquid, methane has to be below –259 degrees Fahrenheit (–162 degrees Celsius), and oxygen has to be even colder—below –297 degrees F (–183 degrees C). That means a lot of mechanical effort to keep it cold, to move it around on the ground and on the vehicle and to accommodate it as it shifts from liquid to gas and gets lit on fire. Going back and forth from supercold to hot is called thermal cycling; without careful design and maintenance, almost anything under those conditions will break.

In a Muskian science-fiction future, that's all worth it. Cryogenic fuel is a pain in the asteroid, but it has more oomph per pound as go juice—what engineers call “specific impulse.” And fuels like methane offer the tantalizing possibility that they could be harvested “in situ” on another world—that they could be synthesized from carbon dioxide and frozen water in Martian regolith or, say, slurped up from the roiling methane seas of Titan. That makes “living off the land” in space seem feasible, even though nobody really knows how to do it yet. “Methane is a new rocket propellant for space launch, so we're still learning how to do the methane plumbing. The fact that they've had leaks, the fact that they've had overheating, doesn't really surprise me,” McDowell says. “It's a different-sized molecule, bigger than liquid hydrogen but smaller than kerosene, so it leaks differently in different circumstances. Its chemistry is different.”

But the cryogenic chemistry here might be less relevant than cold mathematics. Anything going to space has to carry its own fuel, but that fuel itself has mass. “That's the tyranny of the rocket equation,” says Hassan Saad Ifti, an aerospace engineer at Texas A&M University, referring to the calculation that vexes every would-be space jockey. “You need to carry more to deliver what you want, but more fuel means more fuel for the fuel.”

That's why rockets often have stages or external boosters: when they run out of fuel, you drop those components so that the rockets will have less mass to lift. Musk's ambitious goal is for Starship to carry between 110 and 165 tons of payload to orbit—five times what a NASA space shuttle could handle, by way of comparison. But to make that work, the vehicle itself—the “dry mass,” without propellant, rocket engines and all the plumbing—has to be extraordinarily light. SpaceX is aiming for a structural ratio—the dry mass divided by the sum of the dry mass and the propellant—of 0.05 for both stages. “Most typical rocket designs, that ratio is around 0.1,” says John Dec, an aerospace engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology. In other words, Starship is on a pretty extreme weight-loss regime.

Some observers and engineers speculate that diet might be the problem. After the failure on flight seven, SpaceX's official blog reported that the cause of the leaks and fire was a “harmonic response several times stronger than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system.” That is, some of Starship's hardware shook itself apart.

Dec was previously at NASA, and his specialty there was entry descent—bringing space probes down to the surface of Mars. It's one of aerospace engineering's hardest challenges. For one thing, the atmosphere gets thicker as you get closer to a planet's surface. So the force of drag on a descending vehicle changes depending on both the density of the air and the speed of the vehicle; drag becomes, in the language of engineering, a dynamic load. “If dynamic loads are changing fast enough, they can cause the vehicle to start to vibrate,” Dec says.

Vibrate all that complicated cryogenic plumbing too much, and very bad things happen. After flight seven, SpaceX hardened fuel lines to the engines and added vents and a nitrogen-gas purge system to the attic where the leaks happened to deal with the possibility of fires. After flight eight, SpaceX insisted that the problems that Starship faced were completely different—but bloggers and Redditors passed around a purported leak from an insider saying that the root issue hadn't changed. It was “harmonic oscillations”—vibrations, again, this time busting methane lines running through the liquid oxygen tank again: When the tank was full of liquid oxygen, it dampened the vibrations. But as the tank emptied, the shaking got worse.

Starship's two stages have to structurally support nearly 11 million pounds of fuel; the upper stage is meant to carry as much as 330,000 pounds of payload. So the vessel itself has to be as light as possible—yet still withstand the buffeting forces of launch and reentry. So far, it has not. “They've designed their structure light enough to perform when the rocket ignites and wants to fly, but maybe—and this is speculation—when they're loading the fuel, that's causing cracking,” Dec says. “When a structure is cooled, it shrinks. If it's rigid and can't move, that's going to cause a stress, and it's going to break.”

A couple other pieces of evidence fit this theory. One reason the booster may have survived flights that the upper stage did not is that the booster doesn't go all the way to space, and it comes back to the ground at only about 4,600 miles per hour. Starship's upper stage goes all the way to orbit and reaches 17,500 mph. That's a lot of kinetic energy to get rid of on reentry—usually as heat. “This is the physical constraint,” Ifti says. “We can't get away from it. We have to manage this energy being generated through heating.”

An early version of Starship tried to bleed off that kinetic energy with a kind of aerodynamic belly flop that ended in a catastrophic loss of control. Now the vehicle uses its control surfaces and rockets to slow its descent and relies on heat-resistant tiles (which, of course, add weight). One persistent critic of SpaceX, Will Lockett, has argued that Starship simply must use more propellant than its builders expected for its return flights, adding even more weight. “This puts incredible pressure on SpaceX to save weight anywhere they possibly can,” Lockett wrote in his newsletter in March. “SpaceX is having to make the rockets too light, resulting in them being fragile, meaning that just the vibrations from operation with a fraction of its expected payload would be enough to destroy the rocket.”

Kaboom.



Maybe this build-test-destroy-rebuild cycle is what you'd expect from a cutting-edge company like SpaceX, which owes much of its astonishing success to iterating like a software start-up. The version of Super Heavy that's set to launch on Sunday has some major design changes, increasing the size and strength of the winglets called “grid fins” but reducing their number from four to three and aiming for a more controlled, higher angle-of-attack descent. Starship's upper stage will also test several new kinds of tiles to protect against the ferocious heat of reentry. This is what coders call “agile.”

In practice, though, this Silicon Valley–style approach forces SpaceX to play a very expensive game of Whac-A-Mole. “The way I read what Elon's trying to do, wow, is it complicated. And when you deal with a very complicated device, there's multiple modes of failure,” says Joseph Powers, an aerospace engineer at the University of Notre Dame and editor in chief of the Journal of Propulsion and Power. “With a rocket, that almost always results in detonation.”

Each failure is supposed to be an opportunity to learn to avoid disaster the next time. “They're facing challenges, but I don't see any showstoppers,” McDowell says. “I don't want to minimize the problems they're having. It is embarrassing for SpaceX, and they do have to fix these things, but they are making progress.”

So there's an easy solution: reduce the weight of the payload Starship can carry and charge more per pound. But even if SpaceX and its customers can absorb the higher price, not all of Starship's planned missions can necessarily wait for a more reliable spacecraft. NASA's Artemis III is supposed to use Starship to land astronauts on the moon's south pole in 2027. That's practically tomorrow, in aerospace time. Plus, even if you didn't already think that ionizing radiation and toxic regolith make Musk's dreams for Mars settlement about as likely as finding canals there, a reduction in Starship's cargo capacity and rapid reusability would seem to doom the plan. One model for making the trip in three months instead of the usual six or nine requires four cargo Starships and two crew Starships and assumes a total of 45 launches—a mere fraction of the 1,000 Starship launches per year SpaceX foresees.

Even McDowell, who's more sanguine about the tech, acknowledges the possibility that there's something more existential at play. “Every time you add a widget to fix something, you increase the mass and decrease the payload capacity,” he says. “That's the key question we don't know in the public domain: To what extent are the fixes causing performance losses?” Musk and SpaceX share a reputation for bold technological wins—they blew up a lot of Falcon 9 rockets before that vehicle became the ultrareliable, game-changing satellite launcher it is today. But investors and customers won't wait for Starship forever. For a would-be rocket builder, the only thing worse than a kaboom is silence.

Analysis of lipids - fat molecules that perform many essential functions in the body - in the blood found there was a noticeable loss of unsaturated fats, such as those that contain omega fatty acids, in the blood of women with Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy women.

Scientists found no significant difference in the same lipid molecule composition in men with Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy men, which suggests that those lipids have a different role in the disease according to sex. Fats perform important roles in maintaining a healthy brain, so this study could indicate why more women are diagnosed with the disease.

The study, published on August 20 in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association by scientists from King's College London and Queen Mary University London, is the first to reveal the important role lipids could have in the risk for Alzheimer's between the sexes.

Senior author Dr Cristina Legido-Quigley, from King's College London, said: "Women are disproportionately impacted by Alzheimer's Disease and are more often diagnosed with the disease than men after the age of 80. One of the most surprising things we saw when looking at the different sexes was that there was no difference in these lipids in healthy and cognitively impaired men, but for women this picture was completely different. The study reveals that Alzheimer's lipid biology is different between the sexes, opening new avenues for research."

The scientists took plasma samples from 841 participants who had Alzheimer's Disease, mild cognitive impairment and cognitively health controls and and were measured for brain inflammation and damage.

They used mass spectrometry to analyze the 700 individual lipids in the blood. Lipids are a group of many molecules. Saturated lipids are generally considered as 'unhealthy' or 'bad' lipids, while unsaturated lipid, which sometime contains omega fatty acids, are generally considered 'healthy'.

Scientists saw a steep increase in lipids with saturation - the 'unhealthy lipids' - in women with Alzheimer's compared to the healthy group. The lipids with attached omega fatty acids were the most decreased in the Alzheimer's group.

Now, the scientists say there is a statistical indication that there is a causal link between Alzheimer's Disease and fatty acids. But a clinical trial is necessary to confirm the link.

Dr Legido-Quigley added: "Our study suggests that women should make sure they are getting omega fatty acids in their diet - through fatty fish or via supplements. However, we need clinical trials to determine if shifting the lipid composition can influence the biological trajectory of Alzheimer's Disease."

Dr Asger Wretlind, first author of the study from King's College London, said: "Scientists have known for some time that more women than men are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Although this still warrants further research, we were able to detect biological differences in lipids between the sexes in a large cohort, and show the importance of lipids containing omegas in the blood, which has not been done before. The results are very striking and now we are looking at how early in life this change occurs in women."

Dr Julia Dudley, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK says: "In the UK, two in three people living with dementia are women. This could be linked to living longer, or other risk factors like social isolation, education, or hormonal changes from the menopause being at play.

"While this study shows that women with Alzheimer's had lower levels of some unsaturated fats compared with men, further work is needed. This includes understanding the mechanisms behind this difference and finding out if lifestyle changes, including diet could have a role. Future research should also be carried out in a more ethnically diverse population to see if the same effect is seen.

"Understanding how the disease works differently in women could help doctors tailor future treatments and health advice. Alzheimer's Research UK is proud to be funding this work that will bring us a step closer to a cure."

The research was supported by funding from LundbeckFonden and Alzheimer's Research UK.

The newly-discovered ecosystem surrounding a hydrothermal vent could give scientists clues as to how life began on Earth.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The ocean covers about 70% of Earth's surface, yet less than 30% of the sea floor has been explored and mapped. So, it isn't surprising that scientists are frequently making new discoveries deep beneath the waves. This time, researchers discovered a vast hydrothermal system that they have since dubbed the Kunlun system. Published in the journal Science Advances, their recent study details just how extraordinary the newly-discovered deep sea network really is. 

The Kunlun hydrothermal field is a tectonically active site in the Pacific Ocean. It sits roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of the Mussau Trench on the Caroline Plate, located just north of New Guinea. A crewed submersible explored the area and discovered that the system consists of 20 circular craters in the sea floor, with some exceeding one kilometer (half a mile) in diameter. The entire field spans a whopping 4.3 square miles (11.1 square kilometers).

In the ocean, hydrothermal systems occur when seawater seeps down through cracks in oceanic crust and rapidly heats as it nears Earth's mantle. And while they are often associated with the briny depths of our oceans, hydrothermal vents aren't exclusive to the sea. In fact, one of the most well-known hydrothermal systems is the network of geysers at Yellowstone National Park. Each geyser is a small piece of (or a feature in) the larger system. 

So, why should we care about nature's jacuzzis jets? According to some scientists, they could be key to understanding how life began on Earth. Deep sea hydrothermal vents are surrounded by water that is rich in hydrogen—an element that serves as a building block for the organic molecules that make up life as we know it. But just because you have flour and water doesn't mean you'll end up with a loaf of bread. The conditions surrounding hydrothermal systems give scientists the perfect natural laboratory to research what that precise recipe for life was when it began millions of years ago. 

Not only is the Kunlun hydrothermal field exciting because it's newly-discovered, but it also isn't your average hydrothermal system—according to Sun Weidong, corresponding author on the study, the field has several abnormal characteristics. 

“The Kunlun system stands out for its exceptionally high hydrogen flux, scale, and unique geological setting,” he explained in a press release. 

Researchers say that the location of the field in particular is “challenging long-held assumptions,” as it shows that hydrogen generation—and extremely rich generation, at that—can occur far from mid-ocean ridges. 

The Kunlun system's discovery comes years after researchers found the “Lost City” system in the Atlantic Ocean. While the Lost City hydrothermal field is no lost city of Atlantis, it's still remarkable—in fact, it may be the longest-lived venting environment in history. But what the Lost City has in years, the Kunlun system has in size. The newly-discovered field is over 100 times larger than the Lost City and, according to the research team, the Kunlun system may get us even closer to confirming how and where life began.  

“Compared to the carbonate towers formed in the Lost City,” the paper reads, “these pipes/pits provide a more sustained and stable evolutionary time frame, offering a potentially more suitable environment for the evolution of early life.” 

Scientists spend a lot of time researching what life must have looked like around hydrothermal vents in their earliest days, but that doesn't mean the deep sea systems are devoid of residents now. In fact, the Kunlun system is crawling with enough creatures that it could be considered the next “lost city.” 

“What's particularly intriguing is its ecological potential,” Sun said in the press release. “We observed diverse deep-sea life thriving here—shrimp, squat lobsters, anemones, and tubeworms—species that may depend on hydrogen-fueled chemosynthesis.”

Pastel Pink Lobsters, Goofy-Looking Squid Among Deep-Sea Oddities Discovered in Ocean Abyss

Researchers spied a wild array of life, including dozens of suspected new species, in an underwater gorge

Two miles below the ocean's surface, off the coast of Argentina, an underwater gorge plunges nearly twice as deep as the Grand Canyon. The trench and the nearby ocean floor are crawling with creatures that seem like they belong in an alien carnival, including a see-through squid with a hornlike appendage, pale pink lobsters, a lumbering king crab carrying 100 hitchhiking barnacles and a ghostly squid that hovers somewhere between goofy and grotesque.

In July and August scientists onboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute's research vessel Falkor (too) spotted the oddities through the eyes of an underwater robot as they explored the Mar del Plata Canyon. Over the course of three weeks, the team recorded many strange and startling sights, including more than 40 species that may be new to science.

“The deep sea is a place full of life, not only in terms of abundance but also in the variety of species,” says the expedition's chief scientist Daniel Lauretta of the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences. One of his favorite areas was a large stretch of seafloor he nicknamed the “Beet Field” because it was covered in spidery red octocorals. A fan favorite for the millions who livestreamed the dives was a cheeky seastar that looked like the SpongeBob SquarePants character Patrick Star.

The researchers had visited the Mar del Plata Canyon in 2012 and 2013 but were then only equipped with trawls and fishing nets. They found hints of unique ecosystems and identified new species at that time. In revisiting the area with state-of-the-art technology, however, the scientists can develop a far more complete understanding of the region.

The area, situated about 190 miles off Argentina's northeastern coast, is shaped by two converging currents: one is salty and flowing down from the tropics, and the other is cold, full of nutrients and swelling up from Antarctica. Deep-sea canyons such as Mar del Plata act like funnels, channeling and concentrating the waters. “This confluence creates one of the most energetic oceanic regions in the world, fueling high productivity and supporting remarkable biodiversity,” says Jonathan Flores, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina. Flores was not part of the expedition but reviewed livestreamed footage of it as an independent expert.

Some creatures found there might not exist anywhere else in the world. “Deep-sea canyons are biodiversity hotspots and play key roles in ecosystem functioning, yet we still know very little about them,” Flores says. “Continued exploration is essential to document species before they are lost—to understand how these ecosystems respond to environmental change and to inform conservation and management decisions.”

The expedition set out to establish a baseline of what life inhabits Mar del Plata. When the underwater robot dove deep, the science team saw red. A mother octopus clutched her eggs in a protective embrace as she sheltered behind pink and orange corals, blush-toned lobsters ambled around in a tight pack, spiky scarlet crabs scuttled around, and a crimson comb jelly glittered with bioluminescence. Peachy corals of a potentially new species clung to the canyon wall.

Though the area looks like a deep-sea Barbie wonderland to human eyes, these creatures are actually clad in stealthy camouflage. Red light doesn't travel far in the deep sea, which means reddish animals can more easily avoid predators.

Scientists scooped up several of the organisms to study back in laboratories on land to verify whether they're new species.

Brenda Doti, an associate researcher at CONICET, works with a specimen of a crustacean in the main lab of research vessel Falkor (too). The science team documented rich biodiversity, including deep-sea coral reef environments filled with sea anemones, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, snails, and others.

“One way to confirm is by bar coding—sequencing a piece of mitochondrial DNA,” says Mike Vecchione, a research zoologist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who was not involved in the expedition. Vecchione has cataloged many new species over the course of several decades. “But for some deep-sea organisms, this can take years,” he says. “Some species are so poorly known that their mitochondrial DNA has not been sequenced, although the species have been described.”

Such painstaking work is par for the course in deep-sea biology, where entire ecosystems remain unexplored. “Discovering multiple candidate new species in such a short exploration window is not unusual in deep-sea research,” Flores says, “precisely because these ecosystems remain so poorly sampled.”

If This Asteroid Hits the Moon, Watch for Shooting Stars and Stricken Satellites

The 60-meter asteroid 2024 YR4 has a 4 percent chance of hitting the moon. Could such a lunar collision create a dangerous new meteor shower?

For a brief few weeks in early 2025, astronomers were worried about the asteroid 2024 YR4.

Discovered in late 2024 by an automated telescope in Chile as part of the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) sky survey, it's a not only a near-Earth asteroid but one that astronomers feared could get too close for comfort to our fair planet and pose a potential impact risk. At 60 or so meters in diameter, 2024 YR4 wouldn't cause global damage if it fell to Earth, but it would explode upon impact with the energy of an eight-megaton bomb, so local damage would be considerable. Thus, astronomers were right: it was something to worry about.

Initial observations indicated the asteroid might hit Earth on December 22, 2032. Calculating the trajectory of an asteroid is tricky, and the further ahead the prediction goes, the fuzzier the numbers get. By mid-February 2025, astronomers had refined that Earth-impact probability to around 3 percent, which wasn't high but was still somewhat concerning.

Happily, follow-up observations tightened the uncertainties in the projected orbit, effectively ruling out a late-2032 impact.

They ruled out an Earth impact, that is. Amazingly, a chance remains that 2024 YR4 will hit the moon!

As it stands now, the chance of a lunar impact on December 22, 2032, is actually higher than the mid-February probability of the asteroid hitting Earth on that date: about 4 percent. That's still small but not zero.

If 2024 YR4 does whack into our lone natural satellite, what will happen? Is Earth (or, more to the point, those of us who live on it) in any danger? In a preprint paper accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, astronomers investigated the potential fallout. The answer they got is reassuring—mostly.

Given the uncertainties in the asteroid's exact trajectory, the scientists found that—if the asteroid were to hit at all—its chance of striking the moon's near side would be around 86 percent, meaning we'd likely get a good view of the fireworks. If so, Earth-based observers could see a brief flash as 2024 YR4's immense kinetic energy—its energy of motion—would convert into light and heat, though it's difficult to predict just how bright this would be.

In January 2019, however, a meteoroid impacted the moon during a lunar eclipse, so we can use that as a comparison.

That flash was bright enough to be seen by eye, reaching about magnitude 4.2, and came from an object estimated to be less than half a meter across. The asteroid 2024 YR4 is more than 100 times wider, so its volume is well more than a million times larger, which means the energy of its impact would be that much more powerful. If the amount of light released were to scale in a similar way, the flash could be brighter than the full moon! But it would be concentrated in a single point on the surface, so it would be exceedingly bright as seen from Earth.

The astronomers calculated that 2024 YR4's impact would carve out a crater approximately one kilometer in diameter—small for a lunar crater but big enough that the material excavated and ejected would total about 100 million metric tons. That's a considerable amount, but even the moon's low gravity would pull most of the material back down to the surface; 99.8 percent or more of the debris wouldn't have enough speed to escape. Given the uncertainties in the researchers' calculation, however, this still means that some 10,000 to 100,000 metric tons of lunar rock would be ejected, and a lot of it could be headed our way. How much?

That would depend on many factors, including the location of the asteroid's impact on the moon. It's possible that all the ejected debris could be flung into deep space, missing Earth entirely. But for other scenarios, it's possible that approximately 10 percent of the material could be thrown into an Earth-impacting trajectory. In the latter case, that material would hit us within three to five days of the lunar impact, so around December 25 to 27, 2032. Happy holidays!

But this potential blow could be softened considerably if most of the ejecta were small particles rather than bigger chunks. How big would these lunar particles be? The paper's authors caution that their calculations are rough and only yield an order-of-magnitude estimation, meaning it could be too high or low by a factor of 10. Still, their results are illuminating.

According to the astronomers' back-of-the-envelope reckoning, it's likely that the ejecta would be small. The researchers predict that many trillions to quadrillions of pieces of the ejected debris would be larger than a tenth of a millimeter. Of those, something like 100 billion to 10 trillion particles would be larger than a millimeter in size (roughly that of a grain of sand), and 100,000 to a billion would be bigger than a centimeter.

Happily, at these size ranges, they would all burn up safely in our atmosphere, dozens of kilometers above the surface. At the high end, and averaged out across the globe, these numbers mean that a sugar-cube-size moon rock would burn up over every square kilometer of the planet! Something that size would make for a pretty bright meteor, and thousands of them might be visible from a given location over the course of several days.

The smaller sand-grain pieces would streak through Earth's atmosphere in much larger numbers—10 to 1,000 times the usual background level of meteors that we see—which means an observer might witness as many as one per second. They would fall to Earth far slower than normal meteors coming in from interplanetary space, however, so they wouldn't be nearly as bright. And the smallest particles wouldn't be visible at all. In total, somewhere between 1,000 and 10,000 metric tons of debris could burn up in Earth's skies from the lunar impact. For comparison, our planet typically sops up about 50 to 100 metric tons of space debris each day.

The bottom line, though, is that we'll be safe because our air protects us.

But what about our assets in orbit, essentially above our protective atmosphere? What are the chances that a satellite will be hit?

There are more than 12,000 working satellites in orbit right now. By 2032, that number will increase ferociously because SpaceX and other companies plan to launch tens of thousands of additional satellites into orbit. Looking at the standard sizes of satellites and the number of meteoroids raining down, the paper's co-authors estimate that if 2024 YR4 were to make lunar impact, hundreds to thousands of sand-grain-size impact fragments could strike satellites within a few days. That number is big enough to do damage but not necessarily to destroy satellites. The probability that any satellite would get hit by the bigger, centimeter-size pieces is only about 10 percent (taken, of course, with a sand-size grain of salt due because of the various uncertainties).

At the moment, we don't know the trajectory of 2024 YR4 well enough to make better predictions. During its next close approach to our planet in 2028, more observations will likely nail down the impact probability even better.

So if the asteroid does strike the moon—and that's still a big if—we'll get quite the light show, but our satellites could be at risk. This shows us that while we rightly are concerned about mitigating Earth impacts from larger asteroids, even smaller ones hitting the moon are a cause for concern and may be worth trying to prevent as well. The good news is that such 2024 YR4–size lunar impacts are extremely rare, and the chance of one in 2032 is still slim. It would make for a spectacular event, but we'd be far better off if the asteroid missed.

The Mystery of America's Peanut Allergy Surge—And the Promising Science behind New Treatments

Peanut allergies more than tripled in U.S. kids between the late 1990s and late 2000s, and the prevalence has risen even more since then. Scientists are still searching for answers—and new ways to treat them.

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

An estimated one out of every 10 people in the U.S. has some kind of food allergy, which adds up to more than 33 million Americans. Peanut allergies are among the most common and certainly take the lead as the most visible.

But peanut allergies weren't always so prevalent. In the late 1990s a nationwide survey found that peanut allergies were reported in 0.4 percent of American children. Just over a decade later that number had more than tripled.

Scientists still aren't completely sure what led to this big uptick, but it could stem in part from parental anxiety over peanut allergies—and misguided advice about how to keep kids safe.

Here to tell us more about the latest research on peanut allergies, including new avenues for treatment and prevention, is Maryn McKenna, the author of a recent article on the subject for Scientific American. Maryn is a journalist who covers food policy and public health.

Thank you so much for coming on to chat with us today.

Maryn McKenna: Thanks for having me.

Feltman: So what do we know about the origins of peanut allergies?

McKenna: This is a really interesting mystery still. No matter how much study and how much research funding has gone into the problem of peanut allergy—and food allergies more broadly—a lot of it still remains kind of opaque.

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: We know the biological mechanisms of what makes an allergy happen, but why peanut allergy in particular came on the scene 20, 30 years ago or so and why it blew up to such a major public health problem—people are still working that out.

Feltman: So I guess let's start with the easier question, then, which is: What is a food allergy? How does it work, both genetically and in the moment in a person's body?

McKenna: I think most people are familiar with the concept of our having an immune system that, through a variety of mechanisms, defends our bodies against the outside world, broadly speaking—against things that are not us. Most of the time the immune system works really well to adapt its reactions, its defenses of us, to the way we continue to live our lives.

Sometimes its reactions get wildly out of scale, and that's what happens in food allergy and peanut allergy. The immune system recognizes proteins in these foods as being sort of not self, not part of us, and mounts an extraordinary reaction that expresses itself in the kind of symptoms that, if you're allergic, you've experienced or that you may be familiar with from hearing about them from other people: hives, itchiness, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing; in the worst presentations depressed blood pressure, inability to breathe and sometimes, in, in the worst case, a heart attack.

Feltman: And what are the actual rates of nut allergy? It's definitely one of the ones we hear about a lot, but how prevalent is it?

McKenna: This can be a frustrating question to try to answer because what we know about people being allergic depends on their telling researchers that they're allergic ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: So it's all self-reported. There are biological markers for allergy, but we don't apply tests for those biological markers to the entire population, so all of the data relies on people telling researchers who have asked that an allergy is present in themselves or in their kids, if they're parents answering for children.

All of that said the numbers are really big. It's estimated that one out of every 10 individuals just in the United States has some kind of food allergy ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: That's more than 33 million people. And one of the folks I spoke to for this story said: “If you think of the average size of a classroom in elementary school, for instance, that means in every classroom two to three kids are going to have food allergy ...”

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: And peanut is one of the most common food allergies. It's actually probably not the most common, but it tends to be the one that we hear about the most: if we have kids in school and they're aware that in, in the lunchroom there's a peanut-free table, or if you get on an airplane and realize that you can't have peanuts on the airplane because there might be an allergic person on the plane with you that day. So peanut's very sort of front of mind ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: For a lot of people.

Feltman: Yeah, and why is that? Why do you think it's the one that we hear about the most? Is that to do with the, like, typical degree of the allergy?

McKenna: The funny thing is that, according to the best data, the number-one food allergy, the most commonly experienced food allergy in the United States, is actually against shellfish ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: And it affects, in the most recent data, more than eight million people, whereas peanut and milk allergies, which are two and three, affect a little bit more than six million. But most people don't stroll around their lives eating shrimp, right?

Feltman: [Laughs] Sure.

McKenna: This is not a thing that, for most of us, that we munch walking down the street or eat in a protein bar. But peanuts are incredibly portable, they're a favorite food for kids—peanut butter is pretty much ubiquitous, and so peanuts are just present in our lives a lot.

But why peanuts cause such reactions is one of those enduring unanswered questions. There are a lot of hypotheses advanced for why that is, ranging from the way that allergy happens in general; that there are things in the environment that are more present than they used to be or that the environments that we grow up in are cleaner and so we tend to overreact to them; to the ubiquity of ultraprocessing in food, which might be distributing these proteins more broadly so that kids are exposed to them when they aren't aware that they're exposed to them; or it could just be that we like peanuts [laughs].

Feltman: [Laughs]

McKenna: But as a result, for all of those reasons and probably others as well, peanut allergy is very present in the lives of families, and it can be very serious.

Feltman: And speaking of the top food allergies in general, what are the “big eight”?

McKenna: So the “big eight,” that's an actual legal term, and it indicates the allergens, the proteins, that are present in food that, when it's a processed food, have to be declared ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: On the label. Up to 90 percent of food allergies are caused by these eight things; that's why they were made the subject of legislation back in 2004. So peanuts, milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts—so things like almonds, for instance—wheat and soybeans, and there's actually a ninth, a sort of footnote to the “big eight” that was added just a few years ago, which is sesame.

So those nine allergens are responsible for an enormous amount of food allergy in the United States, and sometimes they're linked allergies, like someone who has an allergy to peanut might also be allergic to egg or to milk, but as a category they cause a great deal of distress.

Feltman: And I know you touched on this a bit a minute ago, but how much do scientists know about how we got to the point we are now with food allergies? Why are they so prevalent?

McKenna: The question of why food allergies, and peanut allergy within that, is so common and seems to be getting more common, at the base—like, why this starts—is still really an unanswered question. But that it's increasing, no one disputes that.

You can go by some sort of qualitative measures, like if you are an adult who's been flying on airplanes for 30 years, 30 years ago you might have been able to have a peanut snack inside an airplane, and you would not have heard a member of the cabin crew saying, “If you brought peanut snacks on board, please do not eat them because there's an allergic person sitting somewhere near you.”

A set, a sort of nested set, of surveys of the population done over a couple of decades made it really clear how food allergies are increasing. The first was done in 1997; these were all done by researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. And 11 years from the first study—1.4 percent of kids in the U.S. were allergic to peanut. So that's a threefold increase across just 11 years, starting in the late 1990s. That's really remarkable.

Feltman: Yeah. So your piece really focuses on treatments. You know, even with all the remaining uncertainty around peanut allergies, what did you find out about where science is making the most progress and how they're doing that?

McKenna: Reporting this story was really a journey because I went into it being interested in one particular therapy that had been advanced just a [few] years ago. It was the first [Food and Drug Administration]-approved therapy ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

McKenna: For peanut allergy, not a cure—a method of desensitization. This method of desensitization is a drug called Palforzia, and what it actually is, is minutely powdered peanut protein ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: That's given to kids in very precisely measured doses by mouth over a period of time, and it's meant to desensitize them. I was interested in it because I felt that it hadn't done very well in the marketplace, and I wasn't sure if that was because of the dosing regime or because it happened to be introduced to the market at the start of COVID, but I wondered, “If this [allergy] was such a big problem, why hadn't this [medication] taken off?”

So I started to look at this, and it turns out that there was a bunch more science that I was not aware of. And this one particular FDA-approved therapy, Palforzia, was only a small part of the story.

Feltman: Hmm.

McKenna: So the bigger story is that there have been really remarkable advances in desensitizing people to the allergy ...

Feltman: Right.

McKenna: So that they can go from being in danger of anaphylactic shock to actually being safe to eat a small amount of peanut or peanut protein or peanut butter. And exactly how small that small amount is depends in part on how allergic they were to begin with.

Some people have been made relatively safe from accidental exposures ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

McKenna: Like cross-contamination in food manufacturing. Some people who were less allergic to start with have actually been made safe enough to be able to eat peanuts or peanut butter if they want to.

Feltman: Wow.

McKenna: Now, some researchers in this field will say, “Well, you still aren't getting all that far. We are making people safe in their lives, but they still have to be careful about what they're eating; they can't go face first into a jar of peanut butter.” And therefore, I found as I was working on this story, there are other really interesting efforts going on to try to keep the allergy from developing and to effectively nullify the allergy once it has developed. And those are sort of like the far horizons of food-allergy science, [but] as it says in the story they are things that people are beginning to explore.

Feltman: Yeah, what's your sense of where things are going in the next few years?

McKenna: So right at this moment a clinical trial is starting that is really unusual, and it's extremely early days; they are getting to just a phase 1 at this point—only one patient has actually been reported out. But what it does is it uses a combination of drugs made by a company called Regeneron, to essentially reset or rewrite the body's understanding of what it's supposed to react to.

And there was research into the effect of one of these drugs; the name for it is Dupixent. And researchers gave this drug and then tested people with their allergy, with the food they were allergic to, which was peanuts, and discovered that though it seemed promising it didn't actually have a long-term effect.

And then they decided to try adding in a second drug, which has just been approved for a particular cancer, a cancer of the cells that make the antibodies that cause the body to overreact in an allergic situation. They believe they can use that combination to cause the body to forget that it's overreacted to a particular thing ...

Feltman: Hmm.

McKenna: To essentially set the allergy back to zero—again, very early. But if that trial, which will take a number of years, if that trial proceeds, that's a really promising avenue of inquiry.

The other thing that's really interesting and that's beginning to get traction is that there is a school of thought based on a set of studies that were done in England that asks: Well, maybe food allergy, especially peanut allergy, maybe it's kind of our fault because maybe we, as a society, are not introducing children ...

Feltman: Hmm.

McKenna: When their immune systems are developing to peanuts at a time when their immune systems could handle them and not overreact to them.

And where this came from was an accidental finding by a British pediatrician who was speaking to a group of pediatricians in Israel and asked them how many of them were treating food-allergic kids, expecting every hand to shoot up ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

McKenna: And in fact, almost no one did. Very few people in the audience were actually treating allergic kids. And this was a fascinating difference between the U.K., where the scientist had come from, and Israel, where he was speaking at the time.

And through a set of very clever experiments they discovered that the difference was that there's a ubiquitous snack in Israel called Bamba. That was what ...

Feltman: Yeah, it's also ubiquitous in Germany [laughs] ...

McKenna: Oh, interesting.

Feltman: I love Bambas, yeah [laughs].

McKenna: So they, they—there's—here in the United States, in Trader Joe's, they make a Bamba equivalent; I saw it the other day.

So Bambas are kind of—for people who have not experienced them—Bambas are kind of like Cheetos. They're a puffy, extruded product, but instead of cheese on the outside they have peanut butter on the outside. And they're very light and wispy, and they collapse, and they're easy to chew; they're not as tough as a Cheeto.

And Israeli kids, it turned out, get them quite early in life, and so they were getting an exposure to peanuts at a time when the British kids were being held strictly away from peanuts ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: Because that was the dominant advice at the time—this is just a few years ago—for any child in a family with a history of allergy was: keep them away from allergenic foods.

And so this pediatrician who led the study, Dr. Gideon Lack, proposed that if we sort of abandoned our current guidelines, if we started to introduce kids to peanuts very early—which takes some doing because they have to be introduced to solids in time to be able to swallow peanut butter or peanut powder safely—then it seemed likely that they would be at less risk of developing allergy.

And, and his research proved that was correct. And now the public health establishment and pediatrics and pediatric nutrition are struggling with this conundrum of the excellent advice that seemed to keep kids safe for so long may actually have set some kids up for allergy instead ...

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: And how do we implement the new findings now that they exist?

Feltman: Yeah, that's really interesting. My last question is just that, you know, you were really careful with the word “cure” in your story for Scientific American, but do the [researchers] that you talk to seem to think that that's a possibility in the future?

McKenna: Everyone is extremely careful around the word “cure” in this situation, and I respect that. They're careful about it for a couple of reasons.

First, even the most optimistic researchers to whom I spoke are clear in saying that when they do these various new modalities of desensitization, that's all they're doing; they are not curing the allergy, but they are making it safer for people to live everyday lives.

And the second is: these other avenues in which the allergy might actually be remodeled, those are such early days that whether it's actually going to work in broad populations, either the very early feeding or this drug administration, it's way too early to make confident statements about them.

But I think, also, the reason that they're so careful about this word “cure” is because there are so many families out there—you know, families of millions of kids in the U.S. have had their lives disrupted by food allergy, especially peanut allergy. It really profoundly changes the life not just of a child, but the life of a family.

Feltman: Mm.

McKenna: And therefore, families are very eager for something dramatic to happen, and no one wants to overpromise. Even though they believe they see real hope coming over the horizon it's too early for them to say with confidence that it will really change the game.

Feltman: Thank you so much for coming on to talk us through this story. I'm sure our listeners will enjoy checking it out in the magazine.

McKenna: I hope they read it. Thank you so much for having me.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We'll be back on Monday.

COVID-19 and long COVID are characterized by a dysregulated immune response. However, the role of macrophages during viral infection is poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in increased macrophage numbers and extensive formation of enlarged lipid-laden macrophages or foam cells using humanized mice, rhesus macaques and post-mortem human lung tissue. Notably, infection by other coronaviruses tested, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and two bat coronaviruses (SHC014-CoV or WIV1-CoV), did not result in macrophage proliferation or foam cell formation. Foam cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung tissue display a pro-fibrotic and pro-thrombotic phenotype as they are enriched for genes associated with platelet activation and aggregation, as well as extracellular matrix organization and collagen synthesis. After viral clearance, macrophage numbers remain elevated, and lung fibrosis and thrombi persist. Importantly, we show that pre-exposure prophylaxis or early treatment with a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, EIDD-2801, prevents increases in macrophage cell numbers and foam cell formation, and reduces fibrosis markers. These observations highlight the contribution of macrophages to lung inflammation and tissue injury leading to the pulmonary fibrosis observed in COVID-19 patients.

We're often told it is "unscientific" or "meaningless" to ask what happened before the Big Bang. But a new paper by FQxI cosmologist Eugene Lim, of King's College London, UK, and astrophysicists Katy Clough, of Queen Mary University of London, UK, and Josu Aurrekoetxea, at Oxford University, UK, published in Living Reviews in Relativity, in June 2025, proposes a way forward: using complex computer simulations to numerically (rather than exactly) solve Einstein's equations for gravity in extreme situations. The team argues that numerical relativity should be applied increasingly in cosmology to probe some of the universe's biggest questions-including what happened before the Big Bang, whether we live in a multiverse, if our universe has collided with a neighboring cosmos, or whether our universe cycled through a series of bangs and crunches.

Einstein's equations of general relativity describe gravity and the motion of cosmic objects. But wind the clock back far enough and you'll typically encounter a singularity-a state of infinite density and temperature-where the laws of physics collapse. Cosmologists simply cannot solve Einstein's equations in such extreme environments-their normal simplifying assumptions no longer hold. And the same impasse applies to objects involving singularities or extreme gravity, such as black holes.

One issue might be what cosmologists take for granted. They normally assume that the universe is 'isotropic' and 'homogeneous'-looking the same in every direction to every observer. This is a very good approximation for the universe we see around us, and one that makes it possible to easily solve Einstein's equations in most cosmic scenarios. But is this a good approximation for the universe during the Big Bang?

"You can search around the lamppost, but you can't go far beyond the lamppost, where it's dark-you just can't solve those equations," explains Lim. "Numerical relativity allows you to explore regions away from the lamppost."

Beyond the Lamppost

Numerical relativity was first suggested in the 1960s and 1970s to try to work out what kinds of gravitational waves (ripples in the fabric of spacetime) would be emitted if black holes collided and merged. This is an extreme scenario for which it is impossible to solve Einstein's equations with paper and pen alone-sophisticated computer code and numerical approximations are required. Its development received renewed focus when the LIGO experiment was proposed in the 80s, although the problem was only solved in this way in 2005, raising hopes that the method could also be successfully applied to other puzzles.

"You can search around the lamppost, but you can't go far beyond the lamppost, where it's dark-you just can't solve those equations. Numerical relativity allows you to explore regions away from the lamppost," says Eugene Lim.

One longstanding puzzle that Lim is particularly excited about is cosmic inflation, a period of extremely rapid expansion in the early universe. Inflation was initially proposed to explain why the universe looks the way it does today, stretching out an initially small patch, so that the universe looks similar across a vast expanse. "If you don't have inflation, a lot of things fall apart," explains Lim. But while inflation helps explain the state of the universe today, nobody has been able to explain how or why the baby universe had this sudden short-lived growth spurt.

The trouble is, to probe this using Einstein's equations, cosmologists have to assume that the universe was homogeneous and isotropic in the first place-something which inflation was meant to explain. If you instead assume it started out in another state, then "you don't have the symmetry to write down your equations easily," explains Lim.

But numerical relativity could help us get around this problem-allowing radically different starting conditions. It isn't a simple puzzle to solve, though, as there's an infinite number of ways spacetime could have been before inflation. Lim is therefore hoping to use numerical relativity to test the predictions coming from more fundamental theories that generate inflation, such as string theory.

Cosmic Strings, Colliding Universes

There are other exciting prospects, too. Physicists could use numerical relativity to try to work out what kind of gravitational waves could be generated by hypothetical objects called cosmic strings-long, thin "scars" in spacetime-potentially helping to confirm their existence. They might also be able to predict signatures, or "bruises," on the sky from our universe colliding with neighboring universes (if they even exist), which could help us verify the multiverse theory.

Excitingly, numerical relativity could also help reveal whether there was a universe before the Big Bang. Perhaps the cosmos is cyclic and goes though "bounces" from old universes into new ones-experiencing repeated rebirths, Big Bangs and big crunches. That's a very hard problem to solve analytically. "Bouncing universes are an excellent example, because they reach strong gravity where you can't rely on your symmetries," says Lim. "Several groups are already working on them-it used to be that nobody was."

Numerical relativity simulations are so complex that they require supercomputers to run. As the technology of these machines improves, we might expect significant improvement in our understanding of the universe. Lim is hoping the team's new paper, which outlines the methods and benefits of numerical relativity, can ultimately help get researchers across different areas up to speed.

"We hope to actually develop that overlap between cosmology and numerical relativity so that numerical relativists who are interested in using their techniques to explore cosmological problems can go ahead and do it," Lim says, adding, "and cosmologists who are interested in solving some of the questions they cannot solve, can use numerical relativity."

The world will warm more than expected due to future changes in ozone, which protects Earth from harmful sun rays but also traps heat as it is a greenhouse gas.

While banning ozone-destroying gases such as CFCs has helped the ozone layer to recover, when combined with increased air pollution the impact of ozone could warm the planet 40% more than originally thought.

A new study led by the University of Reading found that from 2015 to 2050, ozone is expected to cause 0.27 watts per square meter (Wm⁻²) of extra warming. This figure -- which measures how much extra energy gets trapped per square metre of Earth's surface -- would make ozone the second largest contributor to future warming by 2050 after carbon dioxide (1.75 Wm⁻² of extra warming).

Professor Bill Collins, lead author from the University of Reading, said: "Countries are doing the right thing by continuing to ban chemicals called CFCs and HCFCs that damage the ozone layer above Earth. However, while this helps repair the protective ozone layer, we have found that this recovery in ozone will warm the planet more than we originally thought.

"Air pollution from vehicles, factories and power plants also creates ozone near the ground, causing health problems and warming the planet."

Simulating the atmosphere 

The research, published on August 21 in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, used computer models to simulate how the atmosphere will change by the middle of the century. The models followed a scenario with low implementation of air pollution controls, but with CFCs and HCFCs being phased out as mandated by the Montreal Protocol (1987).

The findings show that stopping CFC and HCFC production -- done mainly to protect the ozone layer -- provides less climate benefit than previously calculated. CFCs and HCFCs are greenhouse gases that warm the planet. Countries banned them to save the ozone layer, expecting this would also help fight climate change. But as the ozone layer heals, it creates more warming that cancels out most of the climate benefits from removing CFCs and HCFCs.

Countries that reduce air pollution will limit some ozone formation near the ground. However, the ozone layer will continue repairing itself for decades regardless of air quality policies, creating unavoidable warming.

Protecting the ozone layer remains crucial for human health and preventing skin cancer. The ozone layer shields Earth from dangerous ultraviolet radiation that can harm people, animals and plants. However, the research suggests climate policies need updating to account for ozone's larger warming effect.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr wants a study about vaccines retracted.Credit: Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Sipa US via Alamy

US health secretary and vaccine sceptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr has called for the retraction of a Danish study that found no link between aluminium in vaccines and chronic diseases in children — a rare move for a US public official. Aluminium has been used for almost a century to enhance the immune system's response to some vaccines. But some people claim the ingredient is linked to rising rates of childhood disorders such as autism.

Public-health officials in Kennedy's position rarely request that studies be retracted, says Ivan Oransky, a specialist in academic publishing and co-founder of the media organization Retraction Watch. Through this request, “Secretary Kennedy has demonstrated that he wants the scientific literature to bend to his will”, says Oransky.

The study1 in question, published in Annals of Internal Medicine in July, is one of the largest of its kind, looking at 1.2 million children born over more than two decades in Denmark. The authors reported that no significant risk of developing autoimmune, allergic or neurodevelopmental disorders was associated with exposure to aluminium compounds in vaccines. 

In an opinion piece published on TrialSite News on 1 August, Kennedy called into question the study's methodology, analysis and results. Since his appointment as head of the US Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has bypassed normal scientific review processes to change vaccine recommendations and terminated grants for projects on mRNA vaccines.

Annals of Internal Medicine says it stands by the study and has no plans to retract it. Christine Laine, editor in chief for the journal, wrote in a comment on the study's web page on 11 August that “retraction is warranted only when serious errors invalidate findings or there is documented scientific misconduct, neither of which occurred here”.

The Department of Health and Human Services said that Kennedy's article spoke for itself, and that the department did not have any further comment in response to Nature's questions about Kennedy's request for a retraction.

Aluminium, in the form of salts, such as potassium aluminium sulfate, have been administered in vaccines — for diseases ranging from whooping cough to pneumonia — to millions of people worldwide, and the vaccines have been widely studied for safety issues2,3. Gary Grohmann, an independent virologist in Canberra, says there is no evidence of significant side effects caused by the small amount of aluminium in vaccines.

But in 2011, a study4 published in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry claimed to show a causal relationship between rising autism diagnoses in children and increased exposure to aluminium-containing vaccines. In 2012, the World Health Organization's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety said the study and another by the same authors were “seriously flawed” because they used inappropriate study designs, incorrect assumptions and questionable data.

Since then, Grohmann says, the claim that aluminium in vaccines causes autism has been debunked “again and again”. “If there was a mechanism of action where a particular vaccine caused autism, we'd see it in 80, 90, 100% of people receiving the vaccine, and we don't,” he says. Any association between autism and vaccines is probably a coincidence of timing, he says. “In other words, vaccines might be given at the age of two, and autism genetically might also kick in at the age of two,” he adds.

Allen Cheng, an epidemiologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, says the Danish study adds to the evidence that vaccines containing aluminium are safe.

Among Kennedy's criticisms of the Danish study are that the analysis excluded children who had died before the age of two. According to Kennedy, this means that the children “most likely to reveal injuries” associated with aluminum exposure were excluded.

Kennedy also criticized the fact that the authors did not compare vaccinated and unvaccinated children to determine whether any aluminium exposure causes harm, even though they had some data on unvaccinated children.

Other critiques posted on the journal website overlapped with Kennedy's criticisms, says Anders Hviid, the senior author and an epidemiologist at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark's public-health agency. Hviid says he and his colleagues addressed the critiques “one by one”. He also published a rebuttal of Kennedy's article on TrialSite News on 3 August.

Apple is falling behind in the race to transform Siri into an AI assistant that's as powerful as its competitors. As consumers grow more impatient, Apple is considering using another company's tech instead of developing its own.

Apple is now exploring a partnership with Google, its most direct competitor in the smartphone business, according to Bloomberg editor and Apple insider Mark Gurman.

The company previously approached OpenAI and Anthropic for similar discussions about using their technology to power Siri, and reportedly, Google has begun training a model that could run on Apple's servers.

Apple is not expected to make a decision about whether to bring on a partner for the Siri revamp for another several weeks.

Microsoft and protesters offered sharply conflicting accounts of a demonstration that led to 20 arrests on the company's Redmond campus Wednesday, with organizers alleging police brutality, and the company saying the vast majority of those arrested were not employees.

“We want to be clear that the destructive and aggressive protest that took place on our campus on August 20 does not represent our workforce,” the company said in a statement Thursday afternoon. 

At a press conference Thursday, members of the group No Azure for Apartheid described what they called “unnecessary and unjustifiable violence” by police. 

The dueling statements followed two days of escalating protests over Microsoft's technology contracts with Israel. The group is demanding the company cut all ties with Israel over its alleged use of Microsoft technology against Palestinians in Gaza. 

After disbanding on Tuesday, demonstrators returned Wednesday to again take over a portion of the plaza at Microsoft's East Campus. They poured red paint on a company sign to symbolize blood, and blocked a bridge, leading to arrests on charges including trespassing, malicious mischief, and resisting arrest. 

Microsoft has pledged to continue upholding human rights standards in its tech contracts. Last week, the company announced a review of a recent report by the Guardian and others that its Azure cloud platform is used in the surveillance of Palestinians. 

In its statement Thursday, the company said the 20 people arrested in the Wednesday protest included one current employee, and three former employees. (The total increased from initial reports of 18 arrests.) 

“Almost all of those arrested [Wednesday], including some carrying fake company ID cards, have never worked at Microsoft,” the company said. 

The statement added, “While we support employees' rights to political expression, our employees know that our campuses are places for business and demonstrations on our private property are not permitted.”

No Azure for Apartheid held a press conference Thursday evening at a public transit station near the Microsoft campus, calling again on the company to cut ties with Israel.

Hossam Nasr, an organizer of the group and a former Microsoft employee who was among those arrested, said he was “violently tackled” and suffered a shoulder injury when a driver slammed on the brakes after he was placed in a police vehicle without a seatbelt. 

Another protester at the press conference said he was shot at point-blank range in the back with pepper balls. Near the scene of the protest Wednesday afternoon, GeekWire reporters saw the protester with large welts on his back after his arrest.

Jill Green, public information officer for the Redmond Police Department, said via email that the police haven't received any claims from protesters.

The police said in a post on X on Wednesday that no injuries were reported. 

An initial version of that post on Wednesday by the Redmond Police included a photograph of four officers arresting a protester on the ground. That post was removed and the photo was not included when an updated post was published later. 

Microsoft released surveillance video that shows protesters taking over the space in front of the Microsoft sign on their bikes; attempting to corral a police officer inside a portable fence; confronting a DJ who was there for a local farmers' market for employees; and ultimately causing the market to be shut down.

This could be the reason why Noctua has never made a flagship graphics card (yet).


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The RTX 5080 Noctua Edition is one of the most overbuilt RTX 50 series graphics cards on the market, featuring three NF-A12x25 G2 fans installed above a massive heatsink boasting 11 heatpipes. Such a design would logically have been perfect for an RTX 5090 model, and according to Kitguru, Noctua thinks so as well. However, it turns out Nvidia is the bottleneck preventing an RTX 5090 Noctua Edition from existing.

KitGuru talked with Noctua's Jakob Dellinger, who divulged that Nvidia does not have enough GB202 chip production "at the moment" to build an RTX 5090 Noctua Edition graphics card. This problem is likely why Noctua has never built an xx90-series RTX graphics card so far. The only graphics cards it has built with Asus are cards based on the RTX 5080, RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4080, RTX 3080, and RTX 3070.



However, Dellinger did discuss what an RTX 5090 Noctua Edition could look like if events ever change. Noctua would allegedly focus on changing the heatsink design to be more optimized for the RTX 5090, potentially using a vapor chamber design similar to the Asus ROG Astral. The RTX 5080 Noctua Edition model's 11 heatpipes could also potentially be switched to 8mm heatpipes entirely for this theoretical RTX 5090 version. By comparison, the RTX 5080 model comes with four 6mm heatpipes and seven 8mm heatpipes.

Nvidia's difficulty producing GB202 dies is something it has been struggling with since Blackwell debuted, thanks to the RTX 5090's insane market demand since its release earlier this year. Even to this day, RTX 5090 AIB partner cards are regularly priced hundreds of dollars above MSRP. This problem has been compounded by Nvidia releasing more GB202-powered GPUs recently, including the Nvidia RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell workstation and server edition graphics cards.

It's a real shame we probably won't see an RTX 5090 Noctua Edition graphics card for the foreseeable future. Noctua and its partnership with Asus have produced some of the most overbuilt air-cooled Nvidia graphics cards ever created, with cooling performance that can compete with AIO and water-block cooled GPUs. The RTX 5090's sky-high 575W TDP makes it the perfect candidate for Noctua to put its cooling experience to good use.

The RTX 5080 Noctua Edition is the latest GPU to come out of Noctua's partnership with Asus, featuring a first-ever triple-fan cooler design for a Noctua GPU cooling solution. As a result, combined with the aforementioned NF-A12x25 G2 fans, Noctua's RTX 5080 variant allegedly produces some of the most competitive cooling and acoustical performance behavior out of any RTX 5080 to date. Noctua's own testing claims the RTX 5080 Noctua Edition produces 1.7C lower VRAM, 6.2C lower GPU, and 14.5C lower dB(A) temperatures and noise compared to the Asus RTX 5080 ROG Astral.

Cooling performance is so good on the RTX 5080 Noctua Edition, that Noctua benchmarked its card at just 500RPM, achieving 74.6C GPU temperatures, which is more than acceptable temperatures for modern Nvidia GPUs. By contrast, the Asus ROG Astral model is barely able to keep GPU temps under 90C at the same RPM.

If Noctua gets around to making an RTX 5090 version with the same cooler design, it could very well be the best air-cooled RTX 5090 on the market.

You can never have enough ports.

I primarily use my desktop when working from home. And I have am Anker dock at the office so I can plug my laptop into my 4K monitor and peripherals with just one cable. But I also use my laptop at home at my standing desk, where it's also handy to have a dock so I can plug into my TV and any peripherals I might be testing. That's where something like Baseus' Joystar 9-in-1 docking station could come in handy. It doesn't have all the ports or the built-in power of a more traditional, more expensive docking station. But at $39 at Amazon, it has all the ports and functionality I need, and then some.

This 10 Gbps USB-C hub / dock supports two HDMI monitors (or one at 4K and 120 Hz), PD power passthrough for charging your laptop, plus Ethernet and SD and microSD card slots. It would make a great minimal or secondary dock for laptop users who only have USB-C ports.

The Baseus dock is also compact, making it easier to transport than a larger dock. And the inclusion of an Ethernet port makes it dead-simple to get on your home or corporate network without having to deal with Wi-Fi if you don't need or don't want to. The main limitation with this hub is that it only has a single USB-C port. For those who need more, the company also sells a 10-in-1 hub that's also on sale for $47 at Amazon.

Reports claim that Nvidia's AI chip for China is ending


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Following a turbulent summer that saw sales of Nvidia's China-only HGX H20 AI chip banned and then unbanned in China, the AI GPU now faces an uncertain future. A new report suggests that Nvidia is abruptly stopping production of the HGX H20, which Nvidia has responded to in a statement provided to Tom's Hardware. This comes soon after reports earlier this week that Nvidia is preparing a successor to the chip, the Blackwell Ultra-based B30A.

A report from The Information claims that Nvidia has asked suppliers to wind down production of H20-related work. According to the report, Nvidia sent these communications to Amkor Technology, which handles packaging for the H20, and Samsung Electronics, which provides the High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) for the AI chip. This could potentially signal that production of the H20 is winding down, but that leaves the door open to more questions.

When quizzed on whether or not the H20 would remain in production, an Nvidia spokesperson told Tom's Hardware, "We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions". While this isn't an exact response to our question about whether or not the H20 is still in production, it implies that some degree of the communications from Nvidia to Amkor and Samsung do indeed hold some weight.



Nvidia also insists that the H20 is not a political tool or has security backdoors, with a spokesperson for the company stating, "As both governments recognize, the H20 is not a military product or for government infrastructure". Cybersecurity was also on the mind, with Nvidia once again insisting that the H20 has no security backdoors, despite the CAC's claims: "NVIDIA does not have 'backdoors' in our chips that would give anyone a remote way to access or control them. The market can use the H20 with confidence."

This is a sentiment echoed by CEO Jensen Huang, who spoke to journalists in Taipei, Taiwan: "We have made very clear and put to rest that H20 has no security backdoors, there are no such things, there never has, and so hopefully the response that we've given to the Chinese government will be sufficient".

In between rumors of the H20 seemingly winding down production, and the perceived highlighted risk of security backdoors, another factor has emerged: A potential successor to the H20 itself, a new high-powered chip, specifically for China.

Earlier this week, reports emerged that the company was working on a de facto successor to the H20, which will comply with existing export control rules, and could be sold on the Chinese market. The Blackwell Ultra-based B30A is a substantially more powerful chip than the H20, which beats the full-fat H100 in many ways, but remains significantly slower than the B300. Samples are expected to land in September. But the product has yet to be greenlit by the U.S. Government. The earliest that commercial units could be shipped would be by the end of 2025, to early 2026.

Huang further stressed: "Offering a new product to China for the data center, AI data centers, the follow-on to H20, that's not our decision to make. It's up to of course the United States government, and we're in dialogue with them, but it's too soon to know".

Nvidia is caught between two global superpowers: The U.S. Government and the People's Republic of China. It's an unenviable situation, with complex factors at play, including the race to develop the most advanced AI models and local fabrication. China is making moves to reduce reliance on U.S. hardware with a new strategic alliance to reduce fragmentation, and the open-sourcing of CANN, in a bid to reduce reliance on Nvidia's CUDA.

Nvidia's HGX H20 has long been a point of contention for the company, the U.S. Government, and the People's Republic of China. As the H20 is commonly used to develop AI applications in China, Nvidia's chips are likely being used for training leading AI models, such as DeepSeek R2.

The HGX H20 itself is a significantly scaled-down version of Nvidia's H100 GPU, which is approximately 3.3 to 6.6 times faster than the H20. China has access to rapid hardware, such as Huawei's rack-scale CloudMatrix 384, but a reliance on Nvidia's CUDA-shaped moat has thrown a wrench into China's AI aspirations.

Despite attempts to switch to Huawei platforms for training the new DeepSeek R2 model, the company has reportedly now switched back to using Nvidia hardware instead, highlighting the strategic importance of high-powered AI hardware. However, in April 2025, sales of the H20 to China were banned, causing Nvidia to write off $5.5 billion in inventory.

This decision was later reversed in mid-July 2025. China's access to Nvidia's H20 chips was no longer hampered. With the floodgates opened, the inventory of existing H20 stock quickly became limited. So, Nvidia reportedly put in an order for 300,000 AI GPUs with TSMC in late July. This deal is believed to be worth around $3.9 billion, if each H20 GPU is valued between $12,000 - $14,000 per unit (via Reuters).

Then, the U.S. wanted a slice of the pie, with the government requesting that 15% of each GPU sold to China be diverted into federal coffers. Days later, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) asked major companies to pause new H20 purchases, as it investigated potential security risks, a claim which Nvidia has since rebuffed.

Whether China's efforts will be successful remains to be seen. However, one thing is clear. The demand for high-powered chips remains strong, but whether or not Nvidia will be able to provide them for Chinese customers is a question only the U.S. Government can answer.

Seattle startup Electric Era is raising more cash to fund its DC fast-charging systems that include giant batteries to help deliver and store power. A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shows that the company has raised nearly $8.9 million in debt. 

Startups raise capital via debt financing to help pay for operations without giving up equity. An Electric Era spokesperson declined to comment on the new funding.

Electric Era launched in 2019 and previously raised $20.5 million from investors. Last summer the business moved into a spacious, 18,000-square-foot facility located south of Seattle's downtown.  

This past June, Electric Era and Washington state officials celebrated the opening of an eight-port, electric vehicle charging system at an A1 Gas and Food off State Route 530, north of Seattle near the town of Arlington. The station was co-funded by the Washington Electric Vehicle Charging Program, which is supported by the state's Climate Commitment Act. 

The company is steadily deploying its charging stations across the U.S. despite efforts by the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers to curb the EV sector. President Trump took steps in February to halt the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, but last week his administration issued new guidance to states eager to apply for $5 billion worth of NEVI grants. 

The GOP's “Big Beautiful Bill” ends tax credits after Sept. 30 for consumers purchasing EVs, and it eliminates a tax break for EV charging infrastructure by the end of next year.

Electric Era's strategy is to pair its stations with existing businesses. It has installed chargers at a Costco in Ridgefield, Wash., mini-marts in Oregon, a shawarma shop outside of Boston, and locations in California, Florida, New Mexico, Kentucky, Delaware, Tennessee and Missouri. Dozens of additional sites are in the works according to the company's station map. 

CEO and co-founder Quincy Lee touts the speed at which Electric Era stations are built and installed, and their affordability and reliability. 

Fast-charging stations gulp electricity, but Electra Era's inclusion of a battery storage system eliminates the need for new high-power grid connections for the chargers. It can also slash operating costs by up to 70%, the company reports, by drawing power from the batteries instead of the grid during times of high demand. 

Each Electric Era charging device, which has ports for two vehicles, can deliver as much energy as is consumed by 200 homes. A typical station will have four chargers and serve about 150 cars per day.

Joe Nguyễn, director of the Washington State Department of Commerce, praised the Electric Era installation at the A1 Gas and Food site. Its opening was the first of 136 new public DC fast charger installations funded through the state's program. 

“This charging station is a result of collaboration between Washington state, private industry and local leaders to solve real-world challenges,” Nguyễn said in a statement. “It's about cleaner air, stronger communities, and creating a more reliable EV experience for Washington drivers.”

Google announced Friday that it's enhancing the editing experience for Drive videos with a new shortcut button for Vids, the tech giant's AI-powered video-creation tool. 

The new feature allows Workspace users to initiate a video edit using Vids directly from the Google Drive interface. Now, while previewing a video in Drive, users will see an “Open” button in the top right corner that opens the video in the Vids app. Vids will automatically launch the video file, allowing further edits such as trimming the clip or incorporating music and text. 

This new shortcut, which is activated by default, suggests that the company is integrating the app more closely with Google's Workspace suite. Launched last year, Vids aims to streamline video production, including the ability to generate videos from basic text prompts, automatically craft scripts, rearrange video clips, add transitions, and more. 

This comes on the heels of the company introducing another Gemini AI feature for Workspace users in May, which allows them to use AI to summarize video files stored in Google Drive.

Hey YC! We're Jonathan and Jeffrey.

tl;dr We've built the best computer use foundation models in the world.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGht355DYzY







Today's foundation models are great at generating text, but they can't reliably act. We're building foundation models that can use computers, using human behavior data rather than text. In two months, we've beaten OpenAI's GPT-5, o3, and Anthropic's Claude 4 Sonnet computer use at OSWorld, an industry standard computer-use benchmark.



Our model also has 16x lower latency to action at better performance and lower compute spend:



Examples of the model in action at https://inductionlabs.com/news/axiom-1!

Our ask

The field of computer use is still in its early days, and one of the biggest gaps is rigorous, real-world evaluation. We want to partner with teams building computer use agents to train models and create benchmarks that reflect real workflows, and we're willing to fund these efforts.

Reach out at founders@inductionlabs.com if you want to work with us to build the next benchmark for your use case!

The team

Jeffrey and Jonathan were the owners of Cohere's reinforcement learning infrastructure, unlocking RL for Cohere's reasoning models. They touched the entire training stack, improving long context performance, reasoning post-training, and model inference.

At 17, Jonathan joined Cohere as the youngest member of the modeling organization, where he was promoted two levels to a full-time role within his first six months. In high-school, he published machine learning research to top-tier NLP venues such as ACL and EMNLP. Jeffrey built reasoning models at Cohere for two years. His natural habitat is in mathematics research, where he worked on Lie Algebras at the University of Ottawa.

It's been over two months since Trump Mobile announced the T1 Phone was being “Made in the USA” designed “with American values in mind,” and it seems that anyone deciding to preorder it still can't be sure exactly what phone they might receive.

In posts on X and Instagram on Wednesday, the Trump Mobile account encouraged followers to place their preorder, promising them that “the wait is almost over.” This was joined by an image that looks nothing like the one of the T1 phone that's currently on the Trump Mobile website. It instead looks rather suspiciously like the rear side of a Samsung Galaxy S25.

Not just that, it actually appears to be the back of a third-party S25 phone case from Spigen that has been photoshopped gold and stamped with the T1 logo and trademark American flag. Still visible, just behind the flag, is the Spigen company logo.

Spigen's social media account commented under the post on X with an apt “??? bro what” before writing on its own page that it had a “lawsuit incoming.” WIRED has reached out to Spigen for comment.

This isn't the first time questions have been raised about what the T1 Phone will actually turn out to be. Not long after it was announced in June, the specs of the phone changed on the Trump Mobile website, and claims that it would be made in the USA were deleted.

Currently, the Trump Mobile website claims the T1 Phone will have a 6.2-inch punch-hole AMOLED screen with 120-Hz refresh rate, 50-MP main camera with a 16-MP selfie camera, and a 5,000-mAh battery. There's also 256 GB of internal storage, an in-screen fingerprint sensor, and “AI face unlock.”

It's priced at $499, which includes a $100 deposit that apparently covers shipping and handling as well as your first month of Trump Mobile service. This suggests buyers will be required to use Trump Mobile with their T1 Phone, with no clear details before you authorize payment of any ongoing commitment to the service.

Users can, at least, wait to receive the phone before activating the service and can request a full refund “at any time prior to the shipment of the phone.”

As to what the phone will look like when (and if) that ever happens, it's impossible to know—and Trump Mobile seems as unsure as the rest of us. All of which isn't helping to curb suspicions that, right now, the T1 Phone—initially pegged to arrive in August—probably doesn't exist in any shape or form.

In an effort to cut down on abuse and fake engagement, Elon Musk's X is removing access to two key features of its developer API for those on the free plan. Now, free users will no longer be able to use the API to like posts on behalf of a user, nor follow other users.

The company says these changes will help protect X's platform from “spam, bots, and manipulative activities” that degrade the user experience.

Developers on paid plans like the Basic, Pro, or Enterprise tiers will be unaffected. These plans also include access to more capabilities, higher rate limits, and support for a broader range of features.

While restricting access to some of the most common actions on X could help cut down on programmatic abuse, it could also push developers with legitimate businesses or projects who want to continue to move toward paid plans. 

X has made a number of significant changes to its API platform under Musk, initially ending free access with little developer warning, then later changing its mind to support some free usage. When its new API pricing arrived in spring 2023, it was clear the company had revenue generation in mind, as its most bare-bones, basic plan would do little more than support those that were offering “good bots” — that is, automated accounts that provided useful information, like weather alerts.

Last October, X increased the prices for its basic tier as well, from $100 to $200 per month, and added higher limits.

A former software developer has been sentenced to four years in prison for sabotaging his former employer's network after leaving the company.

Davis Lu, 55, was convicted of installing a “kill switch” on the network of his former employer by planting malicious code designed to crash its servers in the event that he was fired.

The kill switch was activated when the company terminated Lu's employment and deactivated his credentials, causing the kill switch, “IsDLEnabledinAD” — referring to whether Lu's account was still active in the company's Active Directory. The incident locked out thousands of employees from accessing the company's systems.

The Justice Department, which prosecuted the case, said Lu's employer, which was not named but reportedly was the power tech company Eaton, said the incident caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. 

Lu was discovered in part through his internet search history, the Justice Department said, which included searches researching “methods to escalate privileges, hide processes, and rapidly delete files.”

The road to startup success is often a bumpy one. Aatish Parson prefers it that way, for now, as the cracks and potholes on roads in the Seattle area provide key data for something called CivicScan.

A Redmond, Wash., native and recent computer science graduate from the University of Washington, Parson has been spending the summer working on the project he first started in school, with the goal of expanding it and making it more usable.

CivicScan is an AI-powered app that works via a mobile device pointed at the road from a vehicle windshield or dashboard. Parson's platform scans the road ahead, using computer vision and machine learning models to automatically detect pavement defects, providing visual evidence and location data for more streamlined maintenance planning.

In a post on LinkedIn this week, Parson said his tech identified more than 13,000 cracks after just an hour of driving around Redmond. His vision is for municipal road departments to use such technology to head off bigger nightmares around failing pavement and the cost associated with such upkeep.

Parson did a software engineering internship at Amazon last summer, in which he worked on expanding map data coverage of road conditions and vehicle maneuverability to enhance safety for delivery drivers.

Asked whether anything else in his background created an interest in transportation or city infrastructure and made him want to address the problem of deteriorating roads, Parson offered up an answer that plenty of drivers can relate to.

“Maybe frustration,” he said. “To be honest, my car suspension has been pretty rocky. I was like, ‘I keep hitting these potholes.'”

Driving a 2009 Acura MDX with a $15 magnetic mount off Amazon holding his phone in place, Parson feels like it's his civic duty to help his hometown — and any other cities or counties which might be interested.

On the CivicScan website, users can view a live “Pavement Defect Map” showing roads in Redmond that Parson has scanned. His model doesn't just paint a box around a crack in the surface, but accurately traces the outline of the defect.

Certainly every flaw in the surface of every road doesn't rate as a priority for fixing. But Parson worries that cracks left unattended will just invite water to seep in and more deterioration to occur, causing the price of an eventual fix to rise.

Across Lake Washington, the Seattle Department of Transportation relies on a lower-tech system for keeping an eye on roadways.

Residents can report potholes through a number of channels, including the “Find it, Fix It” app, SDOT's website, or by calling 206-684-ROAD. Maintenance crews also identify potholes during routine work, and requests can come in via the Mayor's Office and City Council. Pothole crews respond with a first reported, first repaired method as the prioritization model, according to SDOT.

The agency does not use AI or computer vision for any pothole detection at this time, but it does have its own map — called the “Pothole Status Map” — where the public can track repair requests in real time. It's updated nightly with both open and completed reports. 

More broadly across Washington state, the County Road Administration Board (CRAB) deals with many of the intricacies of preserving and enhancing the transportation infrastructure of the state's 39 counties.

In order to be eligible for arterial road repair funds, counties must have a Pavement Management System in place to help analyze pavement life cycles and pavement ratings to determine the best timing and cost-effective method for pavement preservation.

Parson just pictures workers from a city or county road department driving around now and then with a phone on their windshield scanning the roads ahead of them, collecting useful data. He'd be happy to have CivicScan process it all and build an action dashboard or any other necessary visualization to help with repair decisions.

“I want to give everyone the data to make a more informed decision, because budgets are already tight, right?” he said. “I think that'd be pretty cool. And our roads would all be quite smooth.”

Waymo has been granted a permit to test its autonomous vehicles in New York City, the first such approval granted by the city. The company told TechCrunch it plans to start testing “immediately.” 

The company is allowed to deploy up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace SUVs in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September. Waymo's vehicles must have a trained safety operator in the driver's seat, with at least one hand on the wheel at all times. The company cannot pick up passengers (since it would need a license from the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission) and it has to regularly meet with and report data to the city's Department of Transportation (DOT), according to the mayor's office.

The permit brings Waymo one step closer to launching a robotaxi service in the city, which would be arguably its most challenging to date. The company currently operates in San Francisco, Austin, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. All of those are warm-weather cities, and only San Francisco comes close to the complexity of operating in New York City.

Waymo has spent years poking at the Big Apple, starting in 2021 when it used its Chrysler Pacifica minivans to manually map the city. And receiving this permit was no sure thing. The company applied in June, and has spent the last few months meeting with lawmakers and local organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 

The permit is part of a new autonomous vehicle safety regime launched by Mayor Eric Adams in 2024. To apply, Waymo had to coordinate with first responders, as well as submit a testing plan to the local DOT, along with a safety plan that documented the qualifications of the vehicle operators, among other things. Waymo has also obtained the “necessary permits” from the New York state Department of Motor Vehicles, according to the mayor's office.

When Waymo's trial period ends in late September, it will have to apply for an extension if it wants to keep testing.

Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


AM5 and subsequent X870 and B850 motherboards have been a good generation for ASRock boards. From its fair pricing to boards packed with features like its flagship X870E Taichi, there's a lot to like. We recently covered the B850 Steel Legend and walked away from there feeling positive overall as well. Sliding one level down the company's product stack is the B850 Livemixer ($189.99).

The brightly colored B650-based Livemixer is long gone, replaced by a more mature black and silver look. Still focused on content creators, it offers a wide range of USB connectivity “...for streaming devices and multiple other auxiliary devices.”

ASRock packs 14 USB ports on the rear IO, offering more than some boards costing twice as much. Realtek chips manage the audio (last-gen flagship ALC1220) and networking duties (2.5 GbE and integrated Wi-Fi 7). While the power delivery isn't the most robust we've seen, you can still drop a Ryzen 9 9950X (or X3D) in it and get every MHz out of your CPU. The reserved appearance still offers some bling with an RGB strip under the extended M.2 heatsink across the bottom.

The Livemixer performed adequately in most tests, demonstrating competence in both gaming and other functions. Similar to the Steel Legend, the Livemixer encountered issues with our Kingston memory kit. We had to substitute it with a different DDR5-6000 kit, which, while having the same speed, featured slightly looser (slower) timings. However, this difference would generally be imperceptible without a direct benchmark comparison. Overall, the motherboard is more than capable of any typical use case, offering room for additional tweaking if desired.

Below, we'll examine the board's details and determine whether it deserves a spot on our Best Motherboards list. But before we look at test results and discuss the details, check out the specifications below, provided by ASRock.

You receive the bare essentials in the box: two SATA cables, a Wi-Fi antenna, and a thermistor cable. This minimal accessory package is standard for motherboards in this price range.

The B850 Livemixer features an 8-layer black PCB. Large silver heatsinks with a wavy-line pattern cover the VRMs, chipset, and all M.2 sockets, aesthetically integrating with the PCB. The sole RGB element, located under the extended bottom M.2 heatsink, is sufficiently bright, giving this budget-friendly motherboard an appealing and non-obtrusive appearance sure to blend in with most build themes.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.



Starting in the upper left corner, we get a better look at the reflective and matte-finished VRM heatsink, featuring Livemixer branding. Between the two oversized heatsinks are an 8-pin (required) and a 4-pin EPS connector to power the processor. Nothing special here.

To the right of the socket are four unreinforced DRAM slots, with locking mechanisms on both sides. Like the Steel Legend, ASRock lists support for up to 256GB of RAM with two sticks running at speeds of up to DDR5-8000+, which is very fast for this cost-conscious chipset. Again, we experienced some issues with our Kingston DDR5-6000 kit and this BIOS, but our other, faster test kit, DDR5-7200, ran without any problems. Our best advice is to ensure your memory is on the QVL list for the best chance of compatibility.

Above the DRAM slots are the first three (of five) 4-pin fan/pump headers. Like the Steel Legend, it's the CPU_FAN1/2 and the AIO pump. All headers work with DC- or PWM-controlled fans. The CPU_FAN1 header outputs up to 1A/12W, while the remainder outputs up to 3A/36W. CPU_FAN2, CHA_FAN1-3, and the AIO_PUMP header auto-detect whether they are connected to 3- or 4-pin devices.

Turning attention down the right edge, we first run into the Post Status Checker (PSC) LEDs, which light up during POST and remain lit if an issue occurs. Next are two 3-pin ARGB headers, followed by the 24-pin ATX connector to power the board. Last up here are the front panel 19-pin USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) and 3.2 Gen 2x2 Type-C (20 Gbps) headers, adding to the total on the rear.



Power delivery is the same as that of the B850 Steel Legend, consisting of 17 phases, with 14 dedicated to Vcore. Power heads from the 8-pin EPS connector(s) to the Richtek RT3678BE controller (for Vcore, there's another for the SOC/MISC). From there, it's on to the 80A Vishay SiC659 Dr. MOS VRMs. While not the most robust, it's still sufficient for a flagship-class processor, with cooling being the limiting factor.



At the bottom of the board, starting from the left, we can easily see the last-generation flagship Realtek ALC1220 audio chip. Flanking it are three dedicated audio capacitors and the audio separation line. It's not the latest and greatest audio solution, but for the price, it's a solid option. If it's not good enough, there are enough PCIe slots to add a PCIe-based sound card.

Speaking of PCIe, the Livemixer offers three full-length slots, with the top slot reinforced for added stability. The top is the primary slot for graphics, connecting through the CPU, and supports up to PCIe 5.0 x16. The bottom two slots are connected via the chipset and operate at PCIe 4.0 x4 (M.2 supports RAID 0/1/10). The bottom slot, PCIe_3, does share lanes with an M.2 socket (M.2_3), so it's one or the other.

Just above the PCIe slot is the large M.2 heatsink, featuring a DIY-friendly one-push latching mechanism. The socket supports up to PCIe 5.0 x4 (128 Gbps) and accommodates devices up to 80mm in length. The bottom two slots also support up to 80mm modules, but are the ‘slower' PCIe 4.0 x4 (64 Gbps) speeds. Again, M.2_3 shares bandwidth with PCIE_3, so be aware if you need to use that bottom PCIe slot and a third M.2.

Past the chipset and along the right edge is another 19-pin USB 3.2 Gen 1 connector, and below that, four SATA ports (support RAID 0/1).

Across the bottom are several useful headers. From left to right, you get:



The rearIO is laid out logically and labeled clearly, which makes things easy (if you can see behind your chassis). On the left is the HDMI video output for integrated graphics, and next to that are the standard Wi-Fi 7 antenna connections. A small BIOS Flashback button is next, followed by two stacks of four USB ports. On the left are four USB 2.0 ports, with two additional ports located on top. The USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) Lightning Gaming ports (on their own controller, free from other USB traffic) at the bottom, indicted by the orange ports. Next to these are the two 10 Gbps Type-C ports and another 5 Gbps Type-A port, both in light blue. Last but not least is the Realtek 2.5 GbE and audio stack, featuring two 3.5mm (mic in/line out) ports and an SPDIF port.

Spawn of the Living Dead is shuffling forward with some new cast members. The third season of Percy Jackson has found its Olympian huntress. Plus, get a look at what's coming on Peacemaker. Spoilers, away!



During a recent interview with People, Kirsten Dunst jokingly pitched her participation in the upcoming sequel to Minecraft, adding, “maybe I can just make a movie where I don't lose money?“

According to Deadline, Casper Van Dien, Bill Moseley, Michael Berryman, Kane Hodder, and Trina Parks are attached to star in no less than two movies from director Ani Kyd Wolf, Spawn of the Living Dead and Organism 46-B: The Unseen. Based on a script by Night of the Living Dead‘s John A. Russo, Spawn is said to be set at the end of the “1968 zombie plague” and concern Dr. Harold Ormsby and his team “collecting zombie specimens” in hopes of “finding out what caused the plague and how it can be cured.” Meanwhile, Organism 46-B: The Unseen will concern a group of scientists “trapped beneath four kilometers of Antarctic ice” who accidentally awaken “an ancient predator, a shape-shifting horror who mimics its prey and controls the mind.”

Deadline also reports Victorian Psycho, starring Maika Monroe, Jason Isaacs, and Thomasin McKenzie, is scheduled to begin filming in Ireland next week for a planned nationwide theatrical release through Bleecker Street next year.

Tricia Helfer talks Vietnamese dinosaurs in a new clip from Primitive War, in theaters today.

A ten-year-old time traveler from 3,000 years in the future visits 2075 via rainbow in the trailer for Arco, starring the voices of Will Ferrell, America Ferrera, Flea (of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame), Natalie Portman, Mark Ruffalo, and Andy Samberg.

 

TV Line also reports Dafne Keen and Saara Chaudry have joined the third season of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. Keen will play Artemis, the Greek goddess of the moon and the hunt, while Chaudry has been cast as the “immortal hunter” Zoë Nightshade, “who serves as Artemis' lieutenant.”

Finally, HBO Max has released a new “this season on…” trailer for Peacemaker season two.

In a market that is becoming increasingly more crowded (for the better, as getting more people on bikes is good for all of us), Seattle-based Rad Power Bikes has planted its flag as a brand that offers the fun and utility of an ebike at a lower cost than its competitors, thanks in large part to its direct-to-consumer model.

What started as a single-product brand quickly grew into what it is today: North America's largest ebike manufacturer, with a line that includes off-road bikes, cargo bikes, folding bikes, and even a trike. The RadRunner Max takes one of the brand's cornerstone models and jacks it up with plenty of upgrades, new styling, and cutting-edge battery technology aimed at keeping its owners safe.

As a certifiable bike nut and a bit of a wrencher myself, I was not very concerned about assembling the bike when its massive, cartoon-adorned cardboard box arrived on my doorstep a few months ago. Armed with my portable bike shop (a fishing tackle box full of small bike tools and parts), my trusty torque wrench, and a rag or two, I cut open the box and emptied everything onto my garage floor and discovered that a Rad bike is no different than a piece of Ikea furniture. All I needed to build the bike was a trio of Allen keys and a small adjustable wrench, all of which were included in the packaging. Of course, a torque wrench wouldn't hurt, as the bike's assembly guide offers helpful torque recommendations for anything a user needs to tighten.

Going from a sealed box to a rideable bike took about 25 minutes, since all that required assembly was mounting the handlebars, front wheel, kickstand, front fender, and 450-lumen headlight. Everything else was ready to go straight out of the box.

The only knock I had during assembly is how, in an effort to protect the bike's paint while in transit, much of its frame was covered in masking tape. While the tape did its job perfectly, it did leave plenty of residue on the RadRunner's stunning hunter green finish (unfortunately the bike's only color option). That left me reaching for my bottle of Goo Gone to scrub away all those would-be magnets for dirt and grime once out on the road.

Eager to try the bike, I forgot to add air to the tires once I had it fully built. I thought what's what led to the overly cushy ride feel, but then I realized that the bike came loaded with a front suspension unit that boasts 80 millimeters of travel. You may feel different, but unless I'm riding off road, I hate suspension. The first thing I did on realizing this was lean over and click the suspension setting to rigid. I did this while rolling down the street—that's how easy it is to change the fork's setting. Then I turned back up to my garage and added air to the tires.

Speaking of the tires, the only big issue I had with the rideability of the RadRunner was the absolutely massive fat tires that give the bike bit of a lumbering feel, especially when riding with any bit of speed. Granted, between the massive amounts of rubber beneath the bike and the front suspension, you can easily dial the RadRunner so as to not feel anything beneath you as you roll around town.

A major concern for ebike owners (current and prospective alike) is the notion of thermal runaway, which is the official terminology for “lithium-ion batteries catching fire.” It's been a concern for some time. Rad Power Bikes has been at the center of at least a few of these incidences over the years, but the RadRunner Max has the brand's Safe Shield batteries, which debuted last year and which remedy any potential for thermal runaway.

Safe Shield earns the batteries a UL-2271 certification. It encapsulates the batteries' cells in a heat-absorbing resin so that any fire remains localized and will (hopefully) extinguish itself. The battery is also semi-integrated into the frame, giving the bike a much sleeker and more high-minded look than iterations past.

The bike's Dutch-style step-through design, combined with its telescoping seat post, makes it an easy family vehicle, as both my wife (5'6”) and I (6'4”) can easily adjust and climb on the RadRunner Max. That said, when I adjust the RadRunner Max to my riding specs, it requires pulling the seat tube to its maximum height setting. Even then, my legs felt a bit jammed in during rides. If only I had checked before heading out, I would have taken note of the range—from 4'11” to 6'2”. Still, I was able to cover plenty of miles with no pain or discomfort. Still, I would not recommend the RadRunner Max to anyone taller than me.

Where it might fall short in height accomodation, however, the 750-watt, 90 newton-meter motor housed in the bike's rear hub—which can power the bike to a maximum 28 miles per hour—provided plenty of juice to get me and all of my 260 pounds easily up and over any of Chapel Hill, North Carolina's endlessly undulating bumps. With a combination of pedal assist and hand-grip throttle, an eight-speed rear derailleur covering a wide-enough 11- to 34-tooth cassette, the RadRunner Max handled riding around with aplomb over the few weeks I spent testing it.

The pedal assist features five modes that range from completely off to full power, but there were definitely times where I cranked the throttle and treated the RadRunner more like a moped than anything else. Though it's scientifically impossible to prove, this is probably when the smile on my face was at its biggest.

Of course, the more power used, the faster I watched the battery run down on the RadRunner's massive, full-color display. Hoping to get anywhere near the bike's claimed 60 miles of range, I did my best to keep the motor set between 1 or 2 on flats and completely off on descents. Thanks to the bike's manageable thumb buttons, switching between settings became second nature within seconds.

And, as stopping is equally important as riding, the RadRunner's massive 180-mm rotors, which boast 2.3 mm of thickness and are operated by hydraulic brakes, gave me plenty of stopping power, even as I was rolling down a 12-percent hill one rainy afternoon.

On the safety and security front, the RadRunner Max features two major upgrades beyond its new battery. First, its rear light not only boasts turn signals but also radar, which alerts riders to traffic coming up on them within 100 meters, even displaying the vehicle's speed. It also alerts drivers: Its rear light will blink when it detects traffic.

Second, the RadRunner Max is loaded with redundant safekeeping measures which include a key fob, Bluetooth connectivity to your phone, an option for passcode unlock (and the ability to assign multiple passcodes for multiple users), and even a built-in Apple Find My feature, which will help you track down your bike if anyone lifts it. Me? I'm old-school, so I simply wound my U-lock and cable through the bike's rear rack, which not only boasts a reported 120-pound capacity but also has an additional battery mount, where a second unit can double the bike's claimed 60-mile range.

Is the RadRunner Max perfect? Hardly. Then again, no bike is (other than, of course, a hand-painted Dario Pegoretti, but I still can't convince WIRED to let me test one of those. While it may fall a bit short in height (no pun intended), ride feel (at least for me), and color options (though the hunter green finish with Rad's signature orange badging certainly pops), the RadRunner Max more than compensates in utility, ease of use, cool new safety features, and, perhaps most importantly, fun factor.

Companies all over the world are currently racing to shrink their workforces and replace them with AI. Often, it seems, this isn't working out for the firms involved. Case in point: A bank in Australia recently did so, but then had to ask its workers to come back after it turned out that the chatbot that it had launched to replace them couldn't cut the mustard.

Last month, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced that it would be laying off 45 customer service workers as it rolled out a new AI-powered ‘voice bot' that could supposedly do their job, Bloomberg reports. The bank claimed that the chatbot reduced the bank's call volume significantly. However, the workers' union got involved and says it has determined that wasn't the outcome.

Australia's Finance Sector Union, which represents workers in the banking industry, called BS on the bank's claims and engaged CBA in a workplace relations tribunal. Now, it appears that the bank has admitted it made a grievous mistake, telling Bloomberg that its initial assessment that the customer service reps were no longer needed “did not adequately consider all relevant business considerations and this error meant the roles were not redundant.”

“We have apologized to the employees concerned and acknowledge we should have been more thorough in our assessment of the roles required,” a bank spokesperson told the news outlet. The same spokesperson said that the fired workers were being offered several options, including continuing in their old positions. Gizmodo reached out to CBA for more information.

FSU put out a statement on Thursday, sharing details about the situation. “CBA last month announced the jobs would be made redundant due to the introduction of a new AI-powered ‘voice bot', which they claimed had led to a reduction in call volumes. Members told us this was an outright lie and did not reflect the reality of what was happening in Direct Banking,” FSU writes. “Call volumes were in fact increasing and CBA was scrambling to manage the situation by offering staff overtime and directing Team Leaders to answer calls.”

“Getting CBA to rescind these job cuts is a massive win – but the damage has already been done for our 45 colleagues who have had to endure the stress and worry of facing redundancy, some of whom have been with the bank for decades and were suddenly confronted with the prospect of being unable to pay their bills,” the union added.

While the particulars of this whole episode aren't readily available, it certainly seems like yet another example of a company putting the cart before the horse with AI. Ultimately, AI is still an experimental technology, and its results are hit or miss. A much-publicized MIT study recently claimed that 95 percent of AI pilot programs at companies have, so far, been failures. With numbers like that, companies would be wise to keep their headcount high for the time being.

Forks have been made, making it hard for AMD to do much about it.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD has commented on the leak of its FSR 4 source code along with the release of its new FidelitySDK earlier this week, confirming that it was indeed accidental. It has since pulled the files down from the GPUOpen Github, but that may not matter. When they were originally released, it was under the MIT license, effectively allowing anyone who downloaded them to use, copy, or modify them as they wish. Taking the files down doesn't change the license, it merely prevents others from downloading the files.

On August 20 AMD updated its FidelitySDK on Github, adding support for FSR 4 and FSR 3.1.5 frame generation. This is the toolset used by game developers to add FSR upscaling and other related technologies to their games. AMD also plans to use this as the base for future machine learning neural rendering technologies, including FSR Redstone.

But alongside the SDK update, AMD also accidentally released the source code for FSR 4, exposing all of its techniques to the entire Github community.

This was confirmed by Chips and Cheese editor System360Cheese on X.

So, I just got an update from @AMD and @GPUOpen about the FSR4 situation that occurred yesterday (8/20/25) with FSR4's Github repo debacle...AMD's Official Statement:Some of our development code was posted on GPUOpen GitHub in error. It has since been taken down.August 21, 2025

Although AMD swiftly deleted the files when it realised the error, it was far too late to undo the damage. VideoCardz and various Github members grabbed screenshots of the files, and other members made forks of their own, essentially securing those files as publicly available in perpetuity. Since those files were released under the permissive MIT license, too, there's not much AMD can do to pressure anyone to take them down.

This is quite a problem for AMD, which made the decision to keep FSR 4 proprietary and internal. This marked a stark change from previous versions of FSR, which were all released under an open source license. While FSR 4 wasn't, that doesn't really matter now, because it's publicly available anyway.

Although AMD's upscaling solutions are not quite as impressive as Nvidia's, and therefore this is unlikely to give its competition any real leg up, it's still not good for AMD which may have been keeping some parts of how its system works secret. Indeed, analysis of the files has revealed AMD was working on a version of FSR 4 that could have worked with RDNA3 GPUs, opening them up for frame generation and the more advanced algorithm that AMD uses in its latest upscaler. Unfortunately, the project hasn't been completed and it's not clear how far along AMD was with it before this accidental release.

As a laptop reviewer of over 10 years, it's tempting to think you've seen it all. Laptops with foldable displays or even dual screens have come and gone, as have a half-dozen other gimmicky trends. Then a box arrives at your door that subverts what you thought was possible. That's the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable.

We first saw it at CES 2025. It's a laptop that can extend from a 14-inch display up to 16.7 inches, all at the press of a key. It's the party trick to end all party tricks. And yet, as I lived with this machine, I found it far more practical than I assumed it could be.

There's nothing quite like the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable. It uses the same curved OLED technology as seen in concept televisions and smartphones but never in a product this commercially viable. (I should note that as of publication time, Lenovo's retail page says it's not yet available. We've asked Lenovo for a concrete timeline on availability.)

It starts as a 14-inch display with a 5:4 aspect ratio, which is already odd. That's as square a laptop display as you'll find. But then push the dedicated key in the function row and the magic happens. The gears start rotating, the mechanisms crank up, and eight seconds later, your laptop's display has expanded up to 16.7 inches, which is 50 percent more screen than before. Just watching it transform is fun. Seeing that display unroll out of the hinge feels futuristic.

Now, I've always been a fan of vertical space on laptops. I tend to prefer 3:2-aspect-ratio devices like the Surface Laptop over 16:10 or 16:9. At its full extension, though, the 16.7-inch screen (measured diagonally) has an 8:9 aspect ratio, making it considerably taller than it is wide. It looks both awesome and ridiculous simultaneously. Nothing will catch the attention of every other person in a coffee shop like rolling up with one of these babies. The use case is not that you'll be switching between these two sizes while in the middle of your workflow but instead that it's a portability benefit. While it's in your bag, it's just a 14-inch laptop, but when it's out on your table, it can grow into a much larger screen.

And the benefit of that larger screen? Well, you've likely seen someone using a laptop with a vertical screen attached to the top of the display. This is the same idea. You can have two 16:9 windows stacked vertically, which is perfect for multitasking. I found it super easy to throw a video, social media feed, Slack window, or source up top, with my writing window down below. Windows 11 split-screen handles that effortlessly, and I'm sure you can easily think of what you might use that extra vertical space for. Lenovo does include a custom, built-in widget panel that takes up the bottom third of the display, which can be populated with reminders, to-do lists, and calendars, but I didn't find it very helpful.

The screen is OLED, so it naturally has better color and contrast than a typical IPS display. The machine I tested had perfect color saturation, covering 100 percent of the sRGB, AdobeRGB, and Display P3 color spaces. That's not something I've seen happen very often. It also gets up to 328 nits in SDR and 662 nits in HDR, meaning it's plenty bright for almost all lighting conditions and even has decent HDR performance when watching movies and videos or playing games.

The surprise for me came in the ergonomic benefits of the design. I've been reviewing a lot of laptop stands recently and thinking about ergonomics, and as it turns out, the tall screen of the ThinkBook Plus Rollable is a surprising solution to hunching over to look down at the screen all the time. That's not a reason to buy this laptop on its own, but it just might be its secret weapon.

My only real issue with the display is that, because it's flexible OLED, it has that same plasticky protective layer over the panel that gives it a cheap look. When fully extended, you can also see the faint crease line where the original screen was. It's not overly distracting, but you can see it on dark backgrounds.

Beyond the screen, Lenovo has done its best to make this laptop look as discreet as possible. When fully extended, it certainly looks odd from behind. The device is mostly quite sturdy and well-built, but the screen hangs ever so slightly at the crease. The ThinkBook Plus Rollable also has some thick side bezels, which are there to house the “rolling” mechanism, as well as provide enough width for the laptop to still have room for a full-size keyboard.

It's 0.78 inches thick, so it's not exactly as portable as a conventional ThinkBook or ThinkPad laptop. Nor does it have as many ports. On the left side, you'll find just two USB-C ports and a headphone jack. The right side has no ports at all. If you're using one USB-C port for charging, that leaves just one free for other accessories. Even just one more USB-C port would have been helpful. You'll need a hub.

As a laptop with a premium price, it's important that Lenovo didn't phone in the parts of the device that don't have to do with the rollable screen. For example, the keyboard and touchpad are both fantastic. The keys are snappy and precise, but still feel like they have enough travel. Meanwhile, the touchpad is haptic, simulating a mechanical click. It's like the ones you get on the Surface Laptop or the MacBook Pro, and it's great.

The webcam uses a 5-megapixel camera and comes with an IR camera for facial authentication. In my testing, it struggled a bit in low light, introducing too much noise and overexposing the image. One thing I like about it, however, is the placement. Due to that tall screen, the angle of the webcam places you in the center of the screen, a bit more like a desktop webcam that's attached to the top of a monitor. Heck, there's even a somewhat decent set of speakers on this thing. They're not going to blow your mind with bass, but they surprised me nonetheless.

The ThinkBook Plus Rollable is not about its performance, though Lenovo made a good choice in using the Intel Core Ultra 258V. Or so I thought. This is an efficient chip that gets solid performance, but more importantly, it usually gets great battery life. Not the case on this ThinkBook.

There are a few things Lenovo does to make the ThinkBook Plus Rollable last longer on a charge out of the box. By default, HDR is turned off and the refresh rate is set to 60 Hz instead of 120. The power settings are also set to Best Power Efficiency on battery rather than Balanced. It's not that those are bad settings necessarily, but they skew the numbers when you test the battery life compared to other machines. Using the normal settings I test on, the ThinkBook Plus Rollable lasted 10 hours in local video playback and considerably less in real-world applications and tasks. You can get a couple more hours by lowering these settings, but that's true of just about any laptop.

Performance was about as expected for this chip. It's not nearly as fast as Apple's M4, in either single-core or multi-core performance, but that's not Lenovo's fault. One of the strongest aspects of this Intel chip is its integrated graphics performance, and here the ThinkBook Plus Rollable delivers expected results, allowing you to play some lower-tier games like Fortnite or Marvel Rivals at decent frame rates, so long as you're willing to drop graphics settings to Medium and use upscaling as necessary.

There's just one configuration available, and it happens to be a stacked model, coming with 32 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage. That's nice to have, but it's partly what makes this laptop so expensive. For what this machine is meant to do, which is basic work and multitasking, 32 GB of RAM isn't necessary.

Lenovo knows there's just one reason someone would buy a laptop like this. For fun. It's got that geeky, gadget appeal that so few pieces of modern tech still have. Buy this thing, and you'll want to show off the transformation just to see the look on people's faces. And once that excitement wears off, you'll still have a laptop that is both premium and immensely useful. That's what separates gimmicks from innovation.

James Zou used virtual AI ‘scientists' to find novel covid-19 treatments. Now, he's having AI review and present all of the research at a controversial new conference.

In October, a new academic conference will debut that's unlike any other. Agents4Science is a one-day online event that will encompass all areas of science, from physics to medicine. All of the work shared will have been researched, written, and reviewed primarily by AI, and will be presented using text-to-speech technology. 

The conference is the brainchild of Stanford computer scientist James Zou, who studies how humans and AI can best work together. Artificial intelligence has already provided many useful tools for scientists, like DeepMind's AlphaFold, which helps simulate proteins that are difficult to make physically. More recently, though, progress in large language models and reasoning-enabled AI has advanced the idea that AI can work more or less as autonomously as scientists themselves—proposing hypotheses, running simulations, and designing experiments on their own. 

That idea is not without its detractors. Among other issues, many feel AI is not capable of the creative thought needed in research, makes too many mistakes and hallucinations, and may limit opportunities for young researchers. 

Nevertheless, a number of scientists and policymakers are very keen on the promise of AI scientists. The US government's AI Action Plan describes the need to “invest in automated cloud-enabled labs for a range of scientific fields.” Some researchers think AI scientists could unlock scientific discoveries that humans could never find alone. For Zou, the proposition is simple: “AI agents are not limited in time. They could actually meet with us and work with us 24/7.” 

Last month, Zou published an article in Nature with results obtained from his own group of autonomous AI workers. Spurred on by his success, he now wants to see what other AI scientists (that is, scientists that are AI) can accomplish. He describes what a successful paper at Agents4Science will look like: “The AI should be the first author and do most of the work. Humans can be advisors.”

As a PhD student at Harvard in the early 2010s, Zou was so interested in AI's potential for science that he took a year off from his computing research to work in a genomics lab, in a field that has greatly benefited from technology to map entire genomes. His time in so-called wet labs taught him how difficult it can be to work with experts in other fields. “They often have different languages,” he says. 

Large language models, he believes, are better than people at deciphering and translating between subject-specific jargon. “They've read so broadly,” Zou says, that they can translate and generalize ideas across science very well. This idea inspired Zou to dream up what he calls the “Virtual Lab.”

At a high level, the Virtual Lab would be a team of AI agents designed to mimic an actual university lab group. These agents would have various fields of expertise and could interact with different programs, like AlphaFold. Researchers could give one or more of these agents an agenda to work on, then open up the model to play back how the agents communicated to each other and determine which experiments people should pursue in a real-world trial. 

The next big thing is AI tools that can do more complex tasks. Here's how they will work.

Zou needed a (human) collaborator to help put this idea into action and tackle an actual research problem. Last year, he met John E. Pak, a research scientist at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. Pak, who shares Zou's interest in using AI for science, agreed to make the Virtual Lab with him. 

Pak would help set the topic, but both he and Zou wanted to see what approaches the Virtual Lab could come up with on its own. As a first project, they decided to focus on designing therapies for new covid-19 strains. With this goal in mind, Zou set off training five AI scientists (including ones trained to act like an immunologist, a computational biologist, and a principal investigator) with different objectives and programs at their disposal. 

Building these models took a few months, but Pak says they were very quick at designing candidates for therapies once the setup was complete: “I think it was a day or half a day, something like that.”

Zou says the agents decided to study anti-covid nanobodies, a cousin of antibodies that are much smaller in size and less common in the wild. Zou was shocked, though, at the reason. He claims the models landed on nanobodies after making the connection that these smaller molecules would be well-suited to the limited computational resources the models were given. “It actually turned out to be a good decision, because the agents were able to design these nanobodies efficiently,” he says. 

The nanobodies the models designed were genuinely new advances in science, and most were able to bind to the original covid-19 variant, according to the study. But Pak and Zou both admit that the main contribution of their article is really the Virtual Lab as a tool. Yi Shi, a pharmacologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the work but made some of the underlying nanobodies the Virtual Lab modified, agrees. He says he loves the Virtual Lab demonstration and that “the major novelty is the automation.” 

Nature accepted the article and fast-tracked it for publication preview—Zou knew leveraging AI agents for science was a hot area, and he wanted to be one of the first to test it. 

When he was submitting his paper, Zou was dismayed to see that he couldn't properly credit AI for its role in the research. Most conferences and journals don't allow AI to be listed as coauthors on papers, and many explicitly prohibit researchers from using AI to write papers or reviews. Nature, for instance, cites uncertainties over accountability, copyright, and inaccuracies among its reasons for banning the practice. “I think that's limiting,” says Zou. “These kinds of policies are essentially incentivizing researchers to either hide or minimize their usage of AI.”

Zou wanted to flip the script by creating the Agents4Science conference, which requires the primary author on all submissions to be an AI. Other bots then will attempt to evaluate the work and determine its scientific merits. But people won't be left out of the loop entirely: A team of human experts, including a Nobel laureate in economics, will review the top papers. 

Zou isn't sure what will come of the conference, but he hopes there will be some gems among the hundreds of submissions he expects to receive across all domains. “There could be AI submissions that make interesting discoveries,” he says. “There could also be AI submissions that have a lot of interesting mistakes.”

While Zou says the response to the conference has been positive, some scientists are less than impressed.

“How do you get leaps of insight?"

Lisa Messeri, an anthropologist of science at Yale University, has loads of questions about AI's ability to review science: “How do you get leaps of insight? And what happens if a leap of insight comes onto the reviewer's desk?” She doubts the conference will be able to give satisfying answers.

Last year, Messeri and her collaborator Molly Crockett investigated obstacles to using AI for science in another Nature article. They remain unconvinced of its ability to produce novel results, including those shared in Zou's nanobodies paper. 

“I'm the kind of scientist who is the target audience for these kinds of tools because I'm not a computer scientist … but I am doing computationally oriented work,” says Crockett, a cognitive scientist at Princeton University. “But I am at the same time very skeptical of the broader claims, especially with regard to how [AI scientists] might be able to simulate certain aspects of human thinking.” 

And they're both skeptical of the value of using AI to do science if automation prevents human scientists from building up the expertise they need to oversee the bots. Instead, they advocate for involving experts from a wider range of disciplines to design more thoughtful experiments before trusting AI to perform and review science. 

“We need to be talking to epistemologists, philosophers of science, anthropologists of science, scholars who are thinking really hard about what knowledge is,” says Crockett. 

But Zou sees his conference as exactly the kind of experiment that could help push the field forward. When it comes to AI-generated science, he says, “there's a lot of hype and a lot of anecdotes, but there's really no systematic data.” Whether Agents4Science can provide that kind of data is an open question, but in October, the bots will at least try to show the world what they've got.

Earlier this month, the Chinese aerospace company Geespace said it sent 11 satellites into orbit. The satellites went up in Geespace's fourth rocket launch since 2022, bringing its total “IoT constellation” from 30 to 41 satellites. By the end of this year, it has ambitions to deploy 72 satellites, which will provide global data coverage “excluding only the polar regions,” according to a press release.

Like any other satellite firm, Geespace has relationships with several telecommunications companies, spread out over more than 20 countries, to provide high-speed internet and other connectivity services. Earlier this year, it signed new agreements with Moroccan, Malaysian, and Saudi Arabian firms.

But Geespace is also owned by the parent company of Geely, the second-best-selling carmaker in China, which also sells vehicles across five continents. Which means the rocket launch, and the in-development low-Earth-orbit constellation, also has a mobility bent. Geespace says the satellites will provide support for advanced driver-assistance systems in cars and commercial vehicles, “significantly improving travel safety and convenience.” (The company left open the possibility of supporting other vehicles' systems too.)

This makes Geely the only global automaker with its own dedicated satellite internet constellation and a public plan to integrate that connectivity into its advanced driving tech. At a time when most global automakers are struggling through concurrent crises—a rocky transition to electric vehicles; confused and confusing approaches to software; questions around the future of autonomy; global economic upheaval and trade reorientations; and the rise of Chinese auto manufacturers—the Chinese automaker's space play demonstrates a veritable long-term, international strategy.

“Geely has the reach, it has the capital, and obviously it has the capability to put satellites into orbit,” says Tu Le, the founder and managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consultancy. The automaker is arguably the most international of China's vehicle companies. In addition to its popular Geely Galaxy, Zeekr, and Lynk & Co brands, its parent company owns the majority of Volvo Cars and Lotus, nearly half of EV company Polestar, and 17 percent of Aston Martin. In 2018, Geely founder and chair Li Shufu bought a nearly 10 percent stake in Mercedes-Benz. Operating its own infrastructure in space could help support all those brands into the future. “There is no doubt that Geely has international ambitions,” says Le. “This just reinforces the mindset that Geely is going to be a global player.”

Continuing to expand globally could be existential not only for Geely, but the wider Chinese auto industry. The Chinese government has attempted to tamp down on a now-years-long auto price war that has seen round after round of aggressive cuts as the country cranks out tens of millions of vehicles annually. EV-maker BYD, which toppled Tesla this year as the globe's number one seller of new-energy vehicles, has come under special scrutiny. Chinese government and industry officials have likened the situation to Chinese real estate developer Evergrande; the firm's 2021 collapse plunged the nation into economic turmoil. Healthier growth might depend on international exports, which surged by 300 percent between 2021 and 2024 despite US and European trade barriers to Chinese cars.

Satellite communications should have some upside for advanced auto tech—and people who buy cars equipped with it. They can give vehicle software highly precise, centimeter-level data on where cars are on the road, as well as stable (and redundant) connections, which allow better route planning and driving efficiency, Fanni Li, a principal research analyst focusing on auto technology at S&P Global Mobility, writes in an email. Right now, that sort of data might help cars perform some safety functions by themselves: stay in lanes, avoid specific collisions. One day, though, satellite communications could help autonomous vehicles, those without drivers, maintain constant connectivity in a way that today's ground-based cellular networks can't, especially in places where cellular infrastructure is spotty or nonexistent.

Geely has already advertised that it's going to capitalize on its satellite capabilities. Several Geely models, including the Geely Galaxy Xinyao 8 PHEV sedan, Lynk & Co 900 PHEV SUV, and all-electric Zeekr 001, come with satellite communication technology.

So far, though, other automotive companies seem to have concluded that while constant connectivity is a nice-to-have, it's not worth the cost or the trouble, at least right now. Satellite connections require some sort of antennae to be built into each vehicle. The car business is one with razor-thin margins; adding any new component to a vehicle can be a hard sell.

“It's not [automakers'] priority in terms of their business models,” says Partha Goswami, who studied satellite connectivity in the automotive business while he worked as a technology fellow at General Motors, and who now runs his own consulting firm.

Case in point: Tesla shares its CEO, Elon Musk, with SpaceX, which operates the satellite internet service Starlink. While some Tesla drivers have written in online forums about hooking their electric cars up with Starlink Mini, the company's most compact and portable transceiver, Tesla doesn't offer Starlink-enabled connectivity built into its vehicles.

Other auto-satellite linkups, even those involving automakers “renting” satellites rather than deploying them themselves, have foundered. A 2000s-era partnership between Volvo Cars and satellite company Orbcomm petered out with the latter's bankruptcy filing. In 2016, Toyota announced it would work with US-based antenna tech company Kymeta to equip its cars with satellite communications; a Kymeta spokesperson tells WIRED that the partnership is “no longer active.”

Geespace, meanwhile, has outlined a three-phase approach to its “Future Mobility Constellation.” Phase one ends when the last of the 72 satellites reach low Earth orbit later this year; phase two will involve more than 200 more satellites to support existing mobile phone service; phase three focuses on thousands of multimedia satellites.

The plans seem overwhelming, and that's sort of the point, says Le, the analyst. Geespace and Geely “are using this as a marketing tool,” he says. They want to broadcast internationally that they are motivated, technology-forward, and focused on execution. Maybe, the messaging goes, your next car will be great, inexpensive, Chinese-made—and speak to space.

“You're covering it,” Le says to me. “The international media is taking note.”

An RTX 5090 blower that didn't come out of a shady Chinese factory


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The GeForce RTX 5090, one of the best graphics cards for gamers, is also a desirable option for AI applications. Graphics card manufacturer AFOX (via VideoCardz) has launched the GeForce RTX 5090 32GB Professional, which is currently selling for $5,999 at a U.S. retailer.

AFOX is well-versed in producing blower-style graphics cards. The vendor has been manufacturing them since the era of the GTX 10-series (codenamed Pascal) and continued through the hard-knock times of the GeForce RTX 30-series (Ampere), during which Nvidia reportedly discouraged partners from releasing RTX 3090 blower-type graphics cards. AFOX has been around since 2008; however, it doesn't appear to be an official Nvidia AIB partner, so perhaps that's why the vendor is exempt from Team Green's rules.

We are currently uncertain regarding Nvidia's position on GeForce RTX 5090 blower-type graphics cards. Since no official models have been announced from Nvidia's partners, we suspect that the chipmaker has not reconsidered its stance on this matter. Nonetheless, overseas Chinese factories have been transplanting GeForce RTX 5090 silicon and memory chips into blower-style enclosures ready for AI servers.

The GeForce RTX 5090 32GB Professional from AFOX features a blower-style cooler and a dual-slot design, making it ideal for multi-GPU configurations. This is the perfect form factor for users who want to use up to four of these graphics cards on a HEDT or workstation-grade motherboard.

The graphics card operates with a 2,017 MHz base clock and 2,407 MHz boost clock; therefore, it performs exactly like a GeForce RTX 5090 Founders Edition. It still utilizes the 16-pin (12VHPWR) power connector. Still, instead of being positioned in the middle of the shroud, AFOX relocated it to the rear, similar to how you would find the connector on a professional graphics card.

To say the GeForce RTX 5090 32GB Professional (AF5090-32GD7H4-6344) costs an arm and a leg is an understatement. HydraCluster Tech, currently the only store that sells the graphics card, has it listed for $5,999, allegedly marked down from the regular price of $6,500. Even in our current sad reality, where MSRP has become a distant memory, you can still acquire two GeForce RTX 5090 graphics cards and have leftover funds for a complete build, all for the price of the GeForce RTX 5090 32GB Professional.

With the GeForce RTX 5090 32GB Professional, you can say that it's from an established brand, as opposed to getting one from a clandestine factory in China. Then again, AFOX's factory is most likely situated in China, too, so the point of origin is any different. But there is the aspect of the warranty, which you get from AFOX. But we haven't purchased any GeForce RTX 5090 blower graphics cards from China lately, so who is to say that the Chinese factories aren't offering similar guarantees?

OpenAI is asking Meta to produce evidence related to any coordinated plans with Elon Musk and xAI to acquire or invest in the ChatGPT-maker.

The request was made public in a brief filed Thursday in Elon Musk's ongoing lawsuit against OpenAI. Lawyers representing OpenAI said they subpoenaed Meta in June for documents related to its potential involvement in Musk's unsolicited $97 billion bid to take over the startup in February. It's unclear from the filing whether such documents exist. OpenAI ultimately rejected Musk's bid.

OpenAI's lawyers said they discovered that Musk communicated with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg concerning xAI's bid to purchase the ChatGPT-maker, including “about potential financing arrangements or investments.”

Meta objected to OpenAI's initial subpoena in July; the ChatGPT-maker's lawyers are now seeking a court order to obtain such evidence. OpenAI is also asking the court for any of Meta's documents and communications related to “any actual or potential restructuring or recapitalization of OpenAI” — the core issue in Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI.

Meta spokesperson Andy Stone directed TechCrunch to a section of OpenAI's filing which states that neither Meta nor Zuckerberg signed Musk's letter of intent to acquire the ChatGPT-maker.

Meta declined to comment further. OpenAI and legal counsel for Musk did not immediately respond to TechCrunch's request for comment.

In the background of OpenAI's fight with Musk, Meta has significantly invested in its own efforts to develop frontier AI models. In 2023, Meta executives obsessed over developing an AI model that could beat OpenAI's GPT-4, court filings in another case revealed. By early 2025, Meta's AI models had fallen behind the industry standard, reportedly infuriating Zuckerberg.

Zuckerberg has upped the pressure in recent months, poaching several of OpenAI's leading AI researchers, including Shengjia Zhao, a co-creator of ChatGPT, who now leads research efforts at the company's newest AI unit, Meta Superintelligence Labs. Meta also invested $14 billion in Scale AI and reportedly approached several other AI labs about acquisition deals.

While it's unclear how far talks progressed between Musk and Zuckerberg, the mere idea of a partnership between the two billionaires represents just how much of a threat OpenAI poses. Two years ago, Musk said he would physically fight Zuckerberg in a cage match (though it never happened).

The rise of AI may have prompted Musk and Zuckerberg to set aside their differences.

The filing disclosed Thursday is part of a larger lawsuit filed by Musk against OpenAI that takes issue with OpenAI's conversion of its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation. Such a conversion is necessary for OpenAI to obtain funding from investors, and eventually go public. However, Musk — a cofounder and early investor in OpenAI — has attempted to throw a wrench in the endeavor, claiming that the restructuring goes against the startup's founding mission.

Lawyers representing Meta asked the court to reject OpenAI's request for evidence, arguing that Musk and xAI can provide any relevant information. Meta also argues that its internal discussions of OpenAI's restructuring and recapitalization are not relevant to the case.

This story has been updated to add more information about the case, as well as the history of Musk and Zuckerberg's relationship.

Fans of stealth video games likely have a soft spot in their hearts for Splinter Cell. Ubisoft's sub-series of stealth-action games endorsed by Tom Clancy has been MIA for over a decade, even with a remake of the original game on the horizon. After doing guest roles in other Clancy games and in Netflix's Far Cry anime, series lead Sam Fisher is back in all his shadowy glory in Splinter Cell: Deathwatch.

Developed by John Wick alum Derek Kolstad, the animated series sees Fisher—voiced by Liev Schreiber rather than longtime game actor Michael Ironside—as a field commander for the covert Fourth Echelon unit. Like in the games, Sam is assigned to stop a threat to global security: in this case, the mission is “personal.”

Splinter Cell: Deathwatch deploys on Netflix October 14.

Despite advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Antioxidant-1 (ATOX1) has been implicated in oncogenic processes across various cancer types; however, its specific role in HCC remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the function of ATOX1 and its underlying molecular mechanisms in HCC.

Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to assess ATOX1 expression in HCC tissues. Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, Transwell migration, flow cytometry, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays were employed to evaluate the malignant behaviors of tumor cells. A xenograft mouse model was employed to assess the effects of ATOX1 knockdown on tumor growth in vivo. DCAC50 treatment was performed to inhibit the copper transport function of ATOX1. RNA sequencing was conducted to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of ATOX1 in HCC.

ATOX1 expression was significantly elevated in HCC tumor tissues. ATOX1 promoted cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. Knockdown of ATOX1 suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, ATOX1 activated c-Myb, and thus enhanced the malignant phenotype of HCC cells via activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Additionally, ATOX1 reduced intracellular copper accumulation and inhibited ROS production and apoptosis. Inhibition of ATOX1 by DCAC50 decreased cell proliferation while increasing ROS levels and apoptosis in HCC cells. Notably, acetylcysteine reversed the reduction in c-Myb expression induced by ATOX1 knockdown.

This study elucidates that ATOX1 promotes HCC carcinogenicity through the c-Myb/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway while inhibiting copper accumulation, ROS generation, and apoptosis. These results indicate that ATOX1 represents a potential therapeutic target for HCC. Moreover, the compound DCAC50, by obstructing ATOX1's copper transport function, effectively suppresses the malignant behavior of HCC cells, suggesting its promising role in HCC treatment, particularly when combined with PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors.

Researchers from the McCullagh Group in Oxford University's Department of Chemistry have published an innovative method in Nature Protocols today (22 August) that provides comprehensive analysis of metabolites found in cells, tissues and biofluids.

The new method delivers a step-change in capability for analysing highly polar and ionic metabolites. The innovation comes from using anion-exchange chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (AEC-MS) to meet a long-standing need for improving the large-scale analysis of highly polar and ionic metabolites which drive primary metabolic pathways and processes in cells.

Ion-exchange chromatography has been used by generations of chemists since the 1970s, but historically it has been very difficult to couple directly to mass spectrometry, unlike other types of chromatography. The new method uses electrolytic ion-suppression which links the high-performance ion-exchange chromatography system directly with mass spectrometry, an innovation that improves molecular specificity and selectivity. This has led to new applications that were recently reviewed by the McCullagh Group (Ngere et al., Anal. Chem., 2023). The new method is designed for metabolomics applications which involve the large-scale analysis of metabolites in biological samples.

Rachel Williams, a D.Phil. student in the McCullagh Group, whose research focusses on the development of ion-exchange chromatography-mass spectrometry, said, "Ion-exchange chromatography offers a retention and elution mechanism which is new to metabolomics and is proving to be a powerful solution for long-standing analytical challenges in the field."

Metabolomics, is one of several 'omics' technologies, that include genomics and proteomics, offering a powerful combinatorial approach to comprehensively analyse molecular systems in cells, tissues and whole organisms. Changes in metabolite levels are sensitive biomarkers for specific diseases, diets, nutritional states, treatments and chemical exposures and metabolomics provides a tool for discovering these molecular changes. It can be applied to research questions in many disciplines, including biological chemistry, molecular biology, molecular medicine, pharmacology and environmental science.

The new AEC-MS protocol has been used in several research studies including in collaboration with the Kennedy Institute, Oxford to investigate how the gut microbiome utilises energy substrates. This led to the discovery that the microbiome-derived energy substrate product butyrate is found in circulation and can help bolster the host immune response (Schulthess et al., Immunity, 2019).

In another study it was used to investigate metabolism in diabetic pancreatic β-cells. We found the activity of GAPDH and PDH (enzymes involved in the production of ATP from glucose) were inhibited when glucose levels increased, leading to the accumulation of upstream intermediates which caused changes in gene expression including impaired insulin secretion and build-up of glycogen (Haythorne et al., Nat. Comms., 2023).

Professor James McCullagh (Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford) who led the project, said: "Developing a new metabolomics protocol is very exciting, it expands capability for existing applications but also enables us to explore and develop new applications: in our lab we are now applying the protocol in several research areas including investigating gut microbiome metabolism, how antimicrobial resistance impacts bacterial metabolism and in the discovery of biomarkers for the early detection of cancer."

By Michael Booth (Inorganic Ventures)

Laboratories face new challenges almost daily. Methods are demanding lower detection limits even as sample complexity rises. To meet these demands, instruments must operate at peak performance. However, we understand that instrument sensitivity naturally degrades with time.

Detection limits are rarely as low as on an instrument's first day in service. Fortunately, there are techniques to achieve high-quality results as your system ages.

One key technique is to follow a rigid schedule of daily, weekly, monthly, and annual hardware and sample introduction system maintenance. Calibration and tuning are just as important, but often get overlooked.

ICP-OES equipment requires periodic wavelength calibration with standards containing elements with emission lines throughout the UV/VIS spectrum.

Accurate wavelength calibration ensures precise peak centering and improves sensitivity. It also improves the accuracy of the built-in spectral interference correction algorithms.

ICP-MS systems require mass calibration, as well as routine lens and mass filter tuning. Calibration standards should include elements with a wide mass range, providing benefits similar to wavelength calibration in ICP-OES: increased sensitivity and better interference correction.

Tune solutions are tailored to specific methods, such as collision cell or non-collision cell operation. They aim to:

Advanced users can create custom tuning solutions for specific mass ranges or analyte profiles.

Maintaining high performance requires more than tuning and calibration; thorough documentation is essential. Detailed maintenance and performance log:

This data-driven strategy provides long-term dependability and high analytical performance.

To get the most out of any calibration, tuning, or performance check procedure, the quality of your reference materials is essential. Inorganic Ventures provides high-purity, NIST-traceable reference materials (CRMs) for:

A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 7 of Aging (Aging-US) on July 17, 2025, titled "The influence of cancer on a forensic age estimation tool."

In this study by Charlotte Sutter, Daniel Helbling, Cordula Haas, and Jacqueline Neubauer from the Zurich Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Zurich, and Onkozentrum Zurich, the researchers investigated how cancer might affect the accuracy of forensic tools used to estimate a person's age from blood samples.

DNA methylation is a natural chemical modification of DNA that changes with age. Forensic scientists can use these changes to predict someone's age from biological traces, such as blood found at a crime scene. However, medical conditions like cancer can alter these patterns and potentially reduce the accuracy of such predictions. This study investigated whether various cancer types influence the DNA markers used in age estimation.

The researcher stated, "Our study is among the first to show whether it might be necessary to account for the influence of cancer on forensic age estimation tools in order to enhance estimation accuracy as much as possible."

The researchers applied the VISAGE enhanced age estimation tool, a widely used DNA methylation-based method, to blood samples from 100 cancer patients and 102 healthy individuals. Age predictions in the control group were generally accurate, with small average errors.

Patients with solid tumors, including breast and lung cancers, showed only slightly less accurate results. In contrast, individuals with blood cancers, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), sometimes had large errors, with ages overestimated by as much as 50 years. 

Despite these few extreme cases, the study found that cancer does not typically have a strong impact on the accuracy of this forensic tool. Most cancer patients, even those undergoing treatment, had DNA methylation patterns similar to those of healthy individuals. The researchers found no consistent differences based on cancer type, stage, or treatment, except in isolated cases involving aggressive forms of cancer.

The findings support the continued use of current forensic age estimation methods. While aggressive cancers may occasionally affect prediction accuracy, such cases are rare. The researchers suggest noting these conditions as a possible factor in unusually large errors, without requiring changes to standard practice.

This study provides valuable information about how health conditions, such as cancer, may influence DNA-based age estimation. It strengthens confidence in the reliability of forensic age prediction tools, even when applied to individuals with a medical history of cancer.

A new Cochrane review casts doubt on the value of ketamine and other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonists to relieve chronic noncancer pain.

While ketamine and other NMDA receptor agonists are often prescribed off-label to manage chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, nerve pain, and complex regional pain syndrome, researchers found little convincing evidence of a real benefit and identified an increased risk for side effects such as delusions, delirium, paranoia, nausea, and vomiting.

“Clinicians should know that there is currently no clear evidence supporting use of ketamine for chronic pain. Large-scale, definitive randomized trials are urgently needed to determine benefits, risks, and optimal dosing regimens,” first author Michael Ferraro BSc, BHSc, doctoral candidate at University of New South Wales Sydney and Neuroscience Research Australia, Sydney, Australia, told Medscape Medical News.

“We want to be clear — we're not saying ketamine is ineffective, but there's a lot of uncertainty,” Ferraro added in a news release.

The review was published online on August 17 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

The review included 67 randomized controlled trials in more than 2300 adults with chronic noncancer, nonheadache pain for at least 3 months that evaluated intravenous (IV), oral, or topical ketamine (39 studies), oral memantine (10 studies), dextromethorphan (9 studies), oral amantadine (3 studies), or IV or oral magnesium (8 studies) vs placebo, usual care, or another medicine.

The researchers looked at the effects across various chronic pain conditions and dosing strategies.

They found no clear evidence that IV, oral, or topical ketamine reduced pain intensity in the intermediate term (48 hours to 1 week), short term (> 1 week to 3 months) or medium term (> 3 months to 6 months) compared with placebo comparators.

IV ketamine may increase the risk for psychotomimetic and other adverse events (risk ratio, 3.26). No studies reported total adverse events with oral ketamine and there was no clear evidence that topical ketamine increased risk for adverse events.

There was also no clear evidence that oral memantine or dextromethorphan, or oral or IV magnesium reduces pain intensity compared with placebo, with “uncertain” evidence regarding side effects.

Do any of the five NMDA receptor agonists have more evidence of support than others?

“Unfortunately not,” said Ferraro. “Although more studies evaluated intravenous ketamine infusions and oral memantine, small sample sizes and low-quality evidence precluded firm conclusions. As a potential benefit could not be excluded for these drugs, definitive research is urgently needed,” he noted.

The authors cautioned that the certainty of the evidence for all critical outcomes was “low to very low” and most results were downgraded for risk of bias, mainly due to deviations from the intended interventions, missing outcome data and measurement of the outcome.

Reached for comment, Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, neurologist and researcher in Miami cautioned that, the way he sees it, ketamine is not a “standalone cure.”

“Mechanistically, it promotes neuroplasticity, opening a window where the brain is more malleable. That window can be filled with structured, high-quality therapies like Pain Reprocessing Therapy,” said Lakhan, who was not involved in the review.

“In practice, ketamine works best not in isolation, but as part of an integrated program that helps patients relearn healthier patterns of perception, emotion, and pain processing. If we only study ketamine monotherapy, we may miss its true therapeutic potential,” Lakhan said.

“From a mechanistic standpoint, ketamine makes sense in chronic pain — modulating NMDA receptor hypersensitivity is one of the few levers we have. In my own clinical experience, patient selection is absolutely paramount, and some patients do very well,” he told Medscape Medical News.

“The challenge is that we lack pharmaceutical-grade, class 1 evidence: large, well-controlled phase 3 trials that can really establish efficacy and safety. A handful of efforts are now underway to address this, but until industry invests, the evidence will remain low quality and Cochrane's conclusion of uncertainty will persist. That is less a verdict on ketamine than an indictment of the research system,” Lakhan said.

The review had no commercial funding. Ferraro and Lakhan had no relevant disclosures.

Researchers have developed a new, data-driven way of fitting prosthetic legs which could lead to better fitting prosthetics, in less time and at a lower cost.

The technology has been developed by Radii Devices and the University of Southampton, and the results of an NHS trial have been published today [22 August 2025] in JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technology.

The study shows that below-the-knee prosthetic limbs designed using the new approach were as comfortable on average as those created by highly skilled prosthetists, but with more consistent results. Crucially, the new method generates a basic design instantly.

The team behind the software hope that data-driven 'socket' designs – the connection between the person and their prosthetic – will reduce the time, number of iterations and number of appointments it takes to arrive at a prosthetic limb the patient is comfortable with. This would not only improve patients' experience but could also help to clear waiting lists.

Prosthetic sockets are personalised to make sure the prosthetic is comfortable, functional, and safe to walk on. The socket bears the person's whole body weight and dynamic forces when walking, so it needs to be carefully balanced to distribute pressure without damaging limb tissue or creating discomfort.

Traditionally, a prosthetist makes a plaster cast of the leg and reshapes it to produce a socket which achieves the right balance, producing trial versions before settling on a definitive one. Today, many prosthetists use CAD (computer-aided design) software in a similar way. Importantly, this creates a digital record of the design process, which the team were able to utilize.

Radii Devices Ltd, a spin-out company from the University of Southampton, has developed software which draws on data from previous prosthetic socket designs to generate recommendations for the most comfortable socket shape using a 3D scan of the patient's residual limb.

By analyzing hundreds of previous prosthetic designs, we've been able to identify trends between different patient characteristics, such as the shape and size of the residual limb, and successful socket shapes.

We can then scan a new patient's residual limb and generate a personalised design recommendation based on features that have been successful for similar patients in the past."

Dr. Joshua Steer, Founder and CEO of Radii Devices and co-author of the study

To test the effectiveness of the data-driven socket designs, the team carried out a study with patients from three NHS prosthetic rehabilitation centres. Seventeen patients were given a trial socket designed by a prosthetist and one designed using the new method. They were then asked to compare the comfort of the sockets, giving them a score out of ten, and interviewed about their experience of socket fitting.

The study found there was no difference in the comfort scores on average, and less variation in comfort in the data-driven socket designs. Several participants preferred the fit of the data-driven socket design when asked for feedback, and had it turned into their definitive prosthetic.

The design recommendations aren't intended to be used on their own in clinical practice. Instead, the team envision prosthetists working with the technology to further enhance the patient experience.

Alex Dickinson, Professor of Prosthetics Engineering at the University of Southampton, helped to develop the new method and the evidence base behind it. He said: "3D scans can tell us a lot about the shape of the residual limb from the outside, but they don't tell us what is going on under the skin. Only a highly skilled prosthetist can identify things like bone spurs and neuromas, and know how to tweak designs to avoid causing pain or damage at these sensitive areas.

"We developed the data-driven socket design approach to save prosthetists' time by giving them a solid base to work from so they can use their expertise where it is most valuable, in making precise adaptations tailored to their patients' specific needs. The method effectively helps prosthetists to learn from each other."

Nearly 100 people have now had a prosthetic leg designed this way, across multiple centres in the UK and the USA.

The project team included physiotherapists, health scientists, and software engineers.

Maggie Donovan-Hall, Professor of Psychology in Prosthetics and Orthotics at the University of Southampton and co-author of the study, said: "This study was designed to test the 'worst-case' use of data-driven socket designs, with no additional input from prosthetists.

"The fact they performed so well in these circumstances is both surprising and encouraging, but the real value of this tool is to give the prosthetist a starting design quickly, meaning they can spend much more of their time working with their patient on perfecting the more complex, personalised aspects of the design. This is what prosthetists spend years learning and is most crucial to their patients' experience."

The final stage of this study is now underway, where the software interface is being developed with clinicians to provide them the most effective way to incorporate data-driven socket designs into their practice.

An international research team led by the University of Vienna has succeeded in developing a new method to directly measure partial charges in molecules. The results, now published in Nature, provide new insights into molecular interactions and offer potential applications in drug development and materials science.

Electrostatic forces – the attractive or repulsive interactions between atoms or molecules – lie at the heart of all molecular interactions: They are fundamental to how molecules assemble, align, and respond to one another. In chemistry, these forces are described in terms of partial charges: tiny imbalances in how electrons are distributed within a molecule.

These subtle shifts in charge govern how molecules interact with each other and their surroundings. They are key to understanding chemical reactivity, biological function, and material behavior. In medicine, for instance, partial charges influence how drugs are absorbed, distributed, and metabolized – and can shape both their therapeutic effects and potential side effects. Yet despite their significance, partial charges have remained purely theoretical: until now, there was no way to measure them directly.

A research team led by Tim Grüne, Head of the Core Facility for Crystal Structure Analysis, and Christian Schröder from the Department of Computational Biological Chemistry at the University of Vienna, has now developed a method that allows partial charges to be determined experimentally.

We used a technique called electron diffraction. It involves directing a fine beam of electrons at a tiny crystal. Because electrons are charged, they are sensitive to the electrostatic potential within the crystal and thus to the partial charges of atoms. The resulting tiny deflections in the beam were recorded using a new camera developed at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland."

Tim Grüne, Head, Core Facility for Crystal Structure Analysis, Department of Computational Biological Chemistry, University of Vienna

The team combined the diffraction data with a new analysis method called ionic scattering factor modelling (iSFAC). In this approach, each atom of a molecule is modelled simultaneously as a neutral and as a charged species. By comparing the model with the experimental data, the researchers were able to quantify the partial charge of each atom.

"Until now, partial charges were estimated using computational methods", says Christian Schröder. "Some of these fit atomic charges to reproduce the molecular electrostatic potential, resulting in so-called electrostatic potential-derived charges (ESP charges). Others partition the electron density itself among atoms. While widely used in molecular modeling, these methods can yield different values depending on the algorithm. Our new experimental technique now provides a means to assess and refine these theoretical models by offering a direct link."

To demonstrate the broad applicability of their method, the researchers examined a diverse set of crystalline compounds – including the industrial catalyst ZSM-5, the amino acids tyrosine and histidine, tartaric acid from Austrian wine, and the widely used antibiotic Ciprofloxacin. For Ciprofloxacin, which appears on the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines and is commonly administered as a hydrochloride salt, the analysis showed that the chloride ion (Cl⁻), carries only about 40 percent of a full negative charge. This demonstrates how strongly a molecule's environment can influence local charge distribution.

The Core Facility for Crystal Structure Analysis at the University of Vienna has played a key role in advancing electron crystallography in recent years. With this latest breakthrough, the technique moves beyond determining atomic positions to experimentally revealing electronic properties. The ability to measure partial charges opens new possibilities for designing pharmaceuticals with greater specificity and fewer side effects, as well as functional materials with precisely tuned properties.

Cutting off food benefits erodes hard-won dietary gains, while sustained support shows how simple subsidies can narrow health gaps and strengthen food security.

In a recent study published in the JAMA Network Open, researchers leveraged a cohort study comprising 1,973 participants to investigate the on-ground benefits of “Fresh Bucks”, a healthy food benefit program. Specifically, the study evaluated the program's impact on participant food security and fruit/vegetable consumption.

Fresh Bucks used Seattle's beverage tax revenue, creating a sustainable local funding stream distinct from federal programs.

Study findings revealed that among new enrollees, the program was associated with a 5.5 percentage-point increase in food security and a 7.5 percentage-point increase in the proportion of participants eating fruits and vegetables three or more times daily. By contrast, the study found no statistically significant effect on overall continuous daily fruit and vegetable intake. Conversely, losing the benefit was linked to a substantial decline in these outcomes.

These findings provide robust evidence from randomized program assignment that such programs can be an effective tool for reducing health disparities within America. However, the authors caution that further research is needed to confirm long-term health impacts.

Poor diet quality is a major driver of chronic diseases, with a growing body of evidence identifying low intake of fruits and vegetables as a key contributor. For many low-income and marginalized communities, the high cost and limited availability of fresh produce create significant barriers to healthy eating, contributing to food insecurity and widening health disparities between the rich and the poor.

To address these disparities, “food is medicine” initiatives, including produce prescription programs, have gained popularity as a potential solution. These programs aim to make healthy foods more accessible by providing financial incentives.

Unfortunately, a combination of their relative nascency and the fact that much of the existing research on these programs has been hampered by weak study designs, often lacking a proper comparison group, has made empirical validation of these programs' benefits hitherto impossible. This has fueled criticism of these initiatives, with a growing voice undermining their impacts.

Participants could redeem the $40 monthly benefit flexibly – all at once or split across multiple trips – at major grocery chains, local independent stores, or farmers' markets.

The present study aims to address the ongoing debate on “food is medicine” initiatives' social impacts by conducting a lottery-based cohort study evaluating the outcomes of Seattle's Fresh Bucks program, which offers a $40 monthly benefit for fruits and vegetables.

The study design treated the program as a natural experiment, leveraging the program's oversubscription in 2022, which required a random lottery to select participants from a pool of over 6,900 applicants. This randomization created natural treatment (initially selected) and control (waitlisted) groups.

The study simulated and examined two distinct scenarios: 1. ‘Gaining Access', wherein 757 newly enrolled participants were compared to a waitlisted control group over 6 months, and 2. ‘Losing Access', wherein a separate group of 1,216 prior beneficiaries was studied, comparing those randomly disenrolled (and placed on the waitlist) to those randomly selected to continue receiving benefits for an additional 6 months.

Study outcomes of interest included: 1. Food security, assessed using the validated 2-item Hunger Vital Signs screener, and 2. Fruit and vegetable consumption was measured using a modified Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) questionnaire. Data for analysis were collected via surveys administered at baseline (October 2021) and follow-up (June 2022).

Study analyses included linear regression models (LRMs) to estimate the program's effects, controlling for participants' household size, presence of children, income, race/ethnicity, preferred language, age, preferred retailer, and baseline outcome values to increase statistical power and precision.

Nearly 7 in 10 participants (68%) were aged 60 or older, and over half (51%) identified as Asian, reflecting the program's reach within specific Seattle communities.

Study outcomes revealed statistically significant evidence of the Fresh Bucks program's benefits. Among new applicants, being randomly selected to receive the $40 monthly benefit was associated with marked improvements in both diet and food security compared to being placed on the waiting list.

Specifically, enrollment led to a 5.5 percentage point (pp) increase in food security (95% CI, 0.05-10.91 pp), representing a 31% improvement from the baseline food insecurity rate. Simultaneously, a 7.5 percentage point (pp) increase in the proportion of participants consuming fruits and vegetables three or more times per day (95% CI, 0.39-14.52 pp) was observed, representing a 37% improvement from baseline. However, the study reported that average daily fruit and vegetable intake, measured continuously, did not show a statistically significant change.

The second part of the analysis, which looked at what happens when the benefit is lost because of random participant disenrollment, reinforced these findings. Previously enrolled participants who were randomly disenrolled from the program experienced a significant decline in both outcomes.

Specifically, these participants reported a 4.97 pp reduction in food security (p = .03) and a 7.34 pp decrease in the likelihood of eating produce at least three times a day (p = .01) compared to those who continued to receive benefits for the six additional months. They also ate fruits and vegetables 0.37 fewer times per day on average.

Importantly, the study found heterogeneity in outcomes. Gains in continuous fruit and vegetable intake were significant among lower-income participants (≤200% of the federal poverty level), those identifying as White or Black, and English speakers. By contrast, effects were weaker or absent for Asian participants and Vietnamese speakers, suggesting language or cultural barriers may influence program impact.

The present study's findings strongly suggest that “food is medicine” initiatives like Fresh Bucks are a powerful tool for addressing diet-related health disparities. The sharp decline in outcomes observed upon disenrollment also highlights the critical importance of sustained funding for these programs to ensure lasting benefits.

This study hence provides rigorous evidence of meaningful improvements offered by these initiatives, highlighting them as a direct and effective way to improve population health. However, given limitations such as a 28.5% survey response rate, reliance on self-reported data, and potential selection bias, the findings should be interpreted with caution and not yet generalized as a “global model.”

New genetic analysis reveals that insomnia and gut microbes shape each other, offering fresh clues to why poor sleep and gut imbalances so often go hand in hand.

Many researchers have investigated the link between sleep attributes and the state of the gut microbiome. A recent paper in the journal General Psychiatry assesses associations between insomnia and gut dysbiosis.

Insomnia affects up to a fifth of people worldwide, and at least half of those affected have chronic sleep disturbances. This can leave them irritable or tired when they are awake and expected to be functioning. Insomnia is often the prelude to other mental or physical illnesses that not only have a heavy social cost but herald premature death. For instance, depression risk doubles among people with insomnia compared to those with normal sleep.

The causes of insomnia remain elusive, though genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors are known to intertwine in causing abnormal wakefulness. Stress due to work, family circumstances, unmet financial needs, or other illnesses often impacts sleep adversely.

The gut-brain axis connects the gut microbiome and its metabolites to brain functioning. In healthy adults, the gut microbiome is dominated by a mix of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, comprising up to 90% of the total. Diet, age, and stress all affect the structure and composition of the gut microbiome, as does pregnancy. Sometimes, the resulting changes cause gut disease reflected in systemic conditions like obesity, metabolic syndrome, and autoimmune illness.

The gut microbiota is key to the establishment of the enteric nervous system that regulates visceral gut movements, including peristalsis. Gut microbes produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) like butyric acid and the neurotransmitter serotonin. These act on the enteric neurons and nerves.

SCFA receptors are abundant in the brain, forming part of the gut-brain pathways. They impact cognitive and emotional pathways. Babies with higher propionate levels in the gut tend to sleep uninterrupted for longer periods. Older people with insomnia tend to sleep more poorly if they have higher SCFA levels.

Not getting enough continuous sleep can also change the gut microbiome, and vice versa. Depletion of the gut microbiota is associated with brain wave changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The tenth cranial nerve, the vagus, mediates the gut-brain axis and is instrumental in the pathogenesis of mild cognitive impairment and depression.

In the current study, the scientists expected to find two-way relationships between insomnia and gut microbiota. To uncover this, they used Mendelian randomization (MR). This is a method of analysis that aims to minimize the effect of confounding and help reveal causation in a single direction.

The data came from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on 386,533 individuals with insomnia, and gut microbiome data from two different databases (MiBioGen n=18,340 and the Dutch Microbiome Project n=8,208; all participants of European descent). Over 211 taxa in MiBioGen and 207 taxa in the Dutch dataset were screened. This yielded 4,089 instrumental variables for the MR analysis, and 5,118 for the reverse MR analysis.

Multiple analytic methods were used to detect and validate the associations in either direction, as well as to verify causality.

There were 22 bacterial clades (an ancestor with all groups of descendants) that were causally related to insomnia. Among these, 14 bacterial taxa may increase the risk of insomnia, while eight are protective. After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, only the Clostridium innocuum group remained significant in the microbiota → insomnia direction, and forward-direction effect sizes were small (odds ratios ~1.01 to 1.04 for risk taxa and 0.97 to 0.99 for protective taxa).

At the same time, a reverse MR analysis revealed that insomnia contributed to a decrease in the abundance of seven taxa by up to 80%, while 12 taxa were increased in abundance by up to 4.4-fold. Most reverse-direction associations did not remain significant after FDR correction, and Cochran's Q indicated heterogeneity for Sutterella. The directionality of the association for Odoribacter was supported by a Steiger test.

These findings agree with many earlier studies, despite some inconsistencies. Some biological support for these results comes from the knowledge that Clostridium innocuum produces acetate (an SCFA) and breaks down tryptophan (a neurotransmitter precursor) while Coprococcus 1 produces propionate (an SCFA). Tryptophan gives rise to serotonin and melatonin, both of which are important in regulating emotional, cognitive, and other psychological processes.

The gut microbiota structure and composition vary with the presence of major depression or bipolar disorder, as well as neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. For instance, Coprococcus 1 and Lachnospiraceae are linked to depressive symptoms. Prevotella is a taxon associated with chronic local and systemic inflammatory conditions, including periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis.

Insomnia also affects the gut microbiome. For instance, it may upregulate virulence genes in response to stress molecules like interleukin-6 (IL-6), released by the enteric nervous system. More evidence comes from changes in IL-6 in mice transplanted with gut microbiome from sleep-deprived humans. Insomnia also shifts the levels of serotonin and dopamine, in turn altering the gut microbiota that produces these neurotransmitters.

The circadian rhythm of the gut microbes may also be important in these associations. Circadian disruption of the host is reflected in the gut and the brain as well, finally causing gut dysbiosis and leaky gut phenomena – the outcome being metabolic disease. Conversely, disruption of gut microbiota circadian clocks can trigger similar shifts in the body clocks, within the gut and in other tissues, while the SCFAs and other bacterial metabolites may reset the host's rhythms.

“Our study highlighted the reciprocal relationships between gut microbiota and insomnia.” These provide preliminary evidence of causal relationships. However, the authors note that only a small number of associations survived multiple-testing correction, and residual confounding cannot be entirely excluded. This predicts such relationships, but the underlying mechanisms need to be elucidated.

The study is preliminary, limited to individuals of European ancestry, and effect sizes were small, making the results hypothesis-generating rather than definitive. It may help scientists better understand how to prevent and treat insomnia through approaches that modify the gut microbiome.

World Cup

U.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday that the 2026 men's World Cup draw will take place Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center, a performing arts venue in Washington, D.C.

Trump made the announcement flanked by FIFA president Gianni Infantino and U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance in the Oval Office.

The draw is the event at which all qualified teams learn their three group-stage opponents.

The Athletic reported in April that Las Vegas appeared to be the frontrunner to host the draw, but Washington, D.C. remained in contention if it made it easier for Trump to participate extensively.

Trump will almost certainly have a role in the event, which is both procedural and a spectacle. It typically includes musical performances and speeches before the teams are drawn, via sealed orbs, from pots into their World Cup groups.

The 2026 World Cup, which will be played across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, will kick off on June 11, but the draw is the first landmark occasion associated with the tournament.

“The Kennedy Center will give it a phenomenal kick-off,” Trump said at Friday's news conference, “and we'll be involved.”

Alejandro Hutt, the director of the host city committee for Mexico's Monterrey, had told ESPN in January that they and Canadian city Vancouver had been interested in hosting the draw before being told by FIFA they would not be doing so.

Last time the men's World Cup took place in the U.S., 1994, the draw took place at the Las Vegas Convention Center, with Dick Clark hosting the event which included performances from Stevie Wonder, James Brown and Rod Stewart.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Carlos Cordeiro, an Infantino advisor and senior advisor to the White House's World Cup Task Force, were also present for the announcement.

The World Cup trophy stood on a desk in front of them, next to Trump. At one point, Infantino picked it up, handed it to Trump, and said: “This is for winners only. And since you are a winner, of course, you can (touch it) as well.”

Trump smiled, held the trophy, posed for photos, and asked: “Can I keep it?”

Trump later said he was “just sent a picture from someone who wants to be there very badly. He's been very respectful of me and our country, but not so respectful of others.”

He then held up a picture of himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin, one week after the two met in Alaska about Russia's war in Ukraine. (The meeting ended without a deal to end the war.)

Trump said that Putin, “I believe, will be coming (to the World Cup final, on July 19), depending on what happens. He may be coming, and he may not.”

Trump, after announcing the date and location of the draw, immediately pivoted to criticism of Washington D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser and promotion of his administration's moves to exert control over the nation's capital. He called D.C. a “crime-infested rat hole,” despite data showing that crime has declined in 2024 and 2025.

“Washington D.C. is a whole different place, and Gianni, I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that too, actually,” Trump said. Infantino responded: “Oh yes.”

The Kennedy Center, which has been a D.C. institution since it opened in 1971, has been the subject of a Trump effort to remake the Center in his image. Trump said during Friday's announcement that it could be called the “Trump Kennedy Center.”

Infantino later joked that “everything will start here, in Washington D.C., at the Kennedy Center — or the Trump Kennedy Center, we'll see how it will be called — on the 5th of September at noon sharp.”

Analysis by senior soccer writer Adam Crafton

For much of this year, FIFA has been engaged in extensive discussions and negotiations with Las Vegas to repeat the draw from the last time the World Cup came to the U.S. in 1994.

The discussions were so advanced that suites were held back by authorities across different resorts in Vegas for the first week of December even until recent weeks, as FIFA continued its negotiations with various venues in Vegas, including the Grand Garden Arena. Vegas was the clear preference of many host city executives, who had their eyes on an opportunity to schmooze prospective sponsors in Sin City and make a big national impact with a major event in Vegas.

However, the spectre of D.C., which is not a World Cup host city, has always loomed in the background, as reported by The Athletic in April, because FIFA has always been determined to make it as easy as possible for Trump to be involved in the draw.

When it was the Club World Cup draw in Miami last year, following his re-election but before beginning his second term, Trump sent only a video message of support. This time, Infantino will want him to be front and center — just as he was when Premier League club Chelsea lifted the Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium in July.

A venue in D.C. makes that all the easier, and this is the bromance that shows no signs of letting up.

The draw determines the exact split of the 48 qualified nations into 12 groups of four for the first stage of the World Cup.

Before the draw, the 48 teams will be allocated evenly into four ‘pots', according to the most up-to-date FIFA rankings. Pot 1 will contain the U.S., Canada and Mexico, who qualify for the tournament automatically as host nations, and the next highest-ranked nine teams. That continues across Pot 2 and Pot 3, with Pot 4 containing the 12 lowest-ranked teams. Each group will contain one country from each pot.

It has already been confirmed that the first game of the 2026 World Cup will take place at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, meaning Mexico has been automatically placed in Group A. Canada will play the second match and has been placed in Group B, while the U.S. will play the third match and is in Group D. Those games will be the only ones on June 12.

At the time of the draw, 42 of the 48 teams competing at the World Cup will be known. Four qualifiers from Europe and two from the rest of the world will be determined via a set of playoffs in March 2026, which will take place in the host nations. In previous years, placeholders have been used in Pot 4 to represent spots which will be decided by a playoff yet to take place.

The match schedule — complete with dates, kickoff times and game locations — is typically released soon after the draw. A sign behind Trump at the news conference stated the draw will begin at 12pm ET (9am PT; 5pm GMT).

President Donald Trump says the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will be at the Kennedy Center, defends his DC crime crackdown and more in Oval Office announcement.

President Donald Trump praised the administration's crackdown on crime in Washington, D.C., on Friday as he announced that the draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup will take place at the Kennedy Center on Dec. 5. 

The president was joined by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the Oval Office for Friday's announcement. Trump, now the chairman of the Kennedy Center, confirmed that the draw for the group stage will take place at the performing arts venue.

"On Dec. 5 of this year, the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center. Some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we're not prepared to do that quite yet – maybe in a week or so," Trump said, drawing laughter from the group.

"But right here in Washington, D.C., it's a tremendous honor to bring the global event and this incredible group of people and these unbelievable athletes – the best athletes in the world – to the cultural center of our nation's capital." 

Trump also took the opportunity to highlight his administration's federal takeover of D.C. in an effort to crack down on crime.

"By the way, in Washington, D.C., we have the lowest crime numbers they've had in years. Zero. It's a horrible thing to say, but I might as well say it, zero murders in the last week since we've done this. That's the first time in memory that that's happened. If you can believe it. How pathetic that is to have to even say it."

"It was unsafe. It was horrible," the president continued, "And Mayor [Muriel] Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor very long because we'll take it over with the federal government, run it like it's supposed to be run."

Trump quipped to Infantino that the city "will be nice" just in time for the draw, joking that the Italian sports figure "could handle yourself" regardless. 

"The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the largest, most complex set of events in sports history, and the Kennedy Center will give it a phenomenal kickoff and will be involved, and they'll be working over there for quite a bit of time. We have it all set so that they can stay there for the big events, the big press conferences and everything else. And they'll be in a very safe capital. That will be nice. You don't have to worry about walking down the street, Johnny, okay? But you could handle yourself."

The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., President Donald Trump announced on Friday.

The draw will be held on December 5, Trump said, adding: "Some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we're not prepared to do that quite yet. Maybe in a week or so."

The draw will determine the group-stage matchups for the expanded 48-team field. Speaking from the Oval Office alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Trump said the Kennedy Center "will give it a phenomenal kickoff."

The World Cup will be hosted jointly by the United States, Canada and Mexico, with games set across 16 stadiums between June 11 and July 19, 2026.

Before Friday's announcement, Las Vegas had been considered the front-runner to host the draw. However, Washington remained a strong contender, in part because it allowed Trump to be more directly involved.

The draw is more than just a procedural event—it's a high-profile production featuring speeches, performances and global media attention. Trump is expected to play a leading role during the ceremony.

Trump's involvement with FIFA has intensified in recent months. He attended the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, where Chelsea lifted the championship trophy. At a separate White House event earlier this year, Trump held the new Club World Cup trophy, presented to him by Infantino.

During Friday's announcement, Trump turned to Infantino and asked whether he could also hold the World Cup trophy. Infantino obliged, handing it over with a grin and said "only winners" are allowed to hold it. Trump joked: "Can I keep it?" and said it would fit nicely in the Oval Office.

Concerns have been raised internationally about travel to the U.S. ahead of the tournament, particularly over visa delays, travel bans, and the potential for immigration raids during the games.

While discussing the World Cup and the U.S. role as host, Trump surprised the room by holding up a photo of himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"I'm going to sign this for him," Trump said. "That's a man named Vladimir Putin who I believe will be coming [to the 2026 FIFA World Cup], depending on what happens." The remark appeared to catch Infantino off guard.

The comment raised eyebrows, as Russia has been suspended from FIFA and UEFA competitions since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. All Russian national and club teams remain barred from international play "until further notice," under a joint decision by the FIFA Council and UEFA Executive Committee.

This wasn't the first time Trump voiced support for Russia in a World Cup context. During a May meeting of his administration's World Cup task force, seated alongside Infantino, Trump said he was unaware of Russia's current exclusion but suggested the war's end could open the door for a return.

"I didn't know that, is that right?" Trump asked. "You want to explain that?"

"That is right," Infantino replied. "They are banned for the time being from playing, but we hope that something happens and peace will happen so that Russia can be readmitted."

Trump responded: "That's possible. Hey, could be a good incentive, right?"

FIFA President Gianni Infantino, during the press conference: "As you [Trump] rightly say, with security, beautifying cities and the whole country, we want people to come, enjoy and have fun."

Vice President JD Vance, during a May press conference: "Of course everyone is welcome to come and see this wonderful event. We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the games."

The event will mark the first time a FIFA World Cup draw is hosted in Washington. The last time the U.S. hosted a World Cup, in 1994, the draw took place at the Las Vegas Convention Center and featured appearances by Stevie Wonder, James Brown and Rod Stewart. The entertainment lineup for this year's event has yet to be announced.

World Cup

U.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday that the 2026 men's World Cup draw will take place Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center, a performing arts venue in Washington, D.C.

Trump made the announcement flanked by FIFA president Gianni Infantino and U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance in the Oval Office.

The draw is the event at which all qualified teams learn their three group-stage opponents.

The Athletic reported in April that Las Vegas appeared to be the frontrunner to host the draw, but Washington, D.C. remained in contention if it made it easier for Trump to participate extensively.

Trump will almost certainly have a role in the event, which is both procedural and a spectacle. It typically includes musical performances and speeches before the teams are drawn, via sealed orbs, from pots into their World Cup groups.

The 2026 World Cup, which will be played across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, will kick off on June 11, but the draw is the first landmark occasion associated with the tournament.

“The Kennedy Center will give it a phenomenal kick-off,” Trump said at Friday's news conference, “and we'll be involved.”

Alejandro Hutt, the director of the host city committee for Mexico's Monterrey, had told ESPN in January that they and Canadian city Vancouver had been interested in hosting the draw before being told by FIFA they would not be doing so.

Last time the men's World Cup took place in the U.S., 1994, the draw took place at the Las Vegas Convention Center, with Dick Clark hosting the event which included performances from Stevie Wonder, James Brown and Rod Stewart.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Carlos Cordeiro, an Infantino advisor and senior advisor to the White House's World Cup Task Force, were also present for the announcement.

The World Cup trophy stood on a desk in front of them, next to Trump. At one point, Infantino picked it up, handed it to Trump, and said: “This is for winners only. And since you are a winner, of course, you can (touch it) as well.”

Trump smiled, held the trophy, posed for photos, and asked: “Can I keep it?”

Trump later said he was “just sent a picture from someone who wants to be there very badly. He's been very respectful of me and our country, but not so respectful of others.”

He then held up a picture of himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin, one week after the two met in Alaska about Russia's war in Ukraine. (The meeting ended without a deal to end the war.)

Trump said that Putin, “I believe, will be coming (to the World Cup final, on July 19), depending on what happens. He may be coming, and he may not.”

Trump, after announcing the date and location of the draw, immediately pivoted to criticism of Washington D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser and promotion of his administration's moves to exert control over the nation's capital. He called D.C. a “crime-infested rat hole,” despite data showing that crime has declined in 2024 and 2025.

“Washington D.C. is a whole different place, and Gianni, I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that too, actually,” Trump said. Infantino responded: “Oh yes.”

The Kennedy Center, which has been a D.C. institution since it opened in 1971, has been the subject of a Trump effort to remake the Center in his image. Trump said during Friday's announcement that it could be called the “Trump Kennedy Center.”

Infantino later joked that “everything will start here, in Washington D.C., at the Kennedy Center — or the Trump Kennedy Center, we'll see how it will be called — on the 5th of September at noon sharp.”

Analysis by senior soccer writer Adam Crafton

For much of this year, FIFA has been engaged in extensive discussions and negotiations with Las Vegas to repeat the draw from the last time the World Cup came to the U.S. in 1994.

The discussions were so advanced that suites were held back by authorities across different resorts in Vegas for the first week of December even until recent weeks, as FIFA continued its negotiations with various venues in Vegas, including the Grand Garden Arena. Vegas was the clear preference of many host city executives, who had their eyes on an opportunity to schmooze prospective sponsors in Sin City and make a big national impact with a major event in Vegas.

However, the spectre of D.C., which is not a World Cup host city, has always loomed in the background, as reported by The Athletic in April, because FIFA has always been determined to make it as easy as possible for Trump to be involved in the draw.

When it was the Club World Cup draw in Miami last year, following his re-election but before beginning his second term, Trump sent only a video message of support. This time, Infantino will want him to be front and center — just as he was when Premier League club Chelsea lifted the Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium in July.

A venue in D.C. makes that all the easier, and this is the bromance that shows no signs of letting up.

The draw determines the exact split of the 48 qualified nations into 12 groups of four for the first stage of the World Cup.

Before the draw, the 48 teams will be allocated evenly into four ‘pots', according to the most up-to-date FIFA rankings. Pot 1 will contain the U.S., Canada and Mexico, who qualify for the tournament automatically as host nations, and the next highest-ranked nine teams. That continues across Pot 2 and Pot 3, with Pot 4 containing the 12 lowest-ranked teams. Each group will contain one country from each pot.

It has already been confirmed that the first game of the 2026 World Cup will take place at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, meaning Mexico has been automatically placed in Group A. Canada will play the second match and has been placed in Group B, while the U.S. will play the third match and is in Group D. Those games will be the only ones on June 12.

At the time of the draw, 42 of the 48 teams competing at the World Cup will be known. Four qualifiers from Europe and two from the rest of the world will be determined via a set of playoffs in March 2026, which will take place in the host nations. In previous years, placeholders have been used in Pot 4 to represent spots which will be decided by a playoff yet to take place.

The match schedule — complete with dates, kickoff times and game locations — is typically released soon after the draw. A sign behind Trump at the news conference stated the draw will begin at 12pm ET (9am PT; 5pm GMT).

            President Donald Trump announced Friday the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place on December 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, combining the world's biggest soccer tournament with the cultural institution he has sought to overhaul.
    


            The decision to hold the opening event of the World Cup – during which FIFA will announce the groups and matchups for the opening stage of the quadrennial tournament – at the Kennedy Center combines two of Trump's second-term priorities. He has taken a special interest in the Kennedy Center, long a cultural icon in the nation's capital, and he's also regularly touted bringing the World Cup to the US.
    


            “It's a tremendous honor to bring the global event and this incredible group of people and these unbelievable athletes – the best athletes in the world – to the cultural center of our nation's capital,” Trump said.
    


            Trump promised a safe atmosphere at the draw, discussing at length his federal takeover of Washington's police department and issuing threats to Mayor Muriel Bowser and the city's rat population.
    


            Next year's tournament is expanding for the first time to 48 teams and will span across the US, Mexico and Canada. Eleven American cities will be hosting games, but Washington is not one of them – an unusual situation for a host nation's capital city during the World Cup. The draw will be the highlight of the tournament for an area of the country that is one of the hotbeds for soccer in the US.
    


            “The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the largest, most complex set of events in sports history. And the Kennedy Center will give it a phenomenal kickoff and will be involved,” Trump said.
    


            The president has been working to put his own stamp on the Kennedy Center since he returned to the Oval Office in January. Trump seized control of the institution's board earlier this year, telling reporters recently he would oversee a sweeping revamp of the center and its programming.
    


            At Trump's behest, congressional Republicans set aside $250 million in July for renovations to the center as part of their tax and spending bill. Those funds will go toward an expansive overhaul of the Kennedy Center, Trump said, arguing that it was badly in need of repairs when he took control of its operations.
    


            The Kennedy Center has served as an early focal point of Trump's attempts to assert his administration's power over DC, drawing an institution that had traditionally remained above the fray of partisan politics directly into the center of the nation's culture wars. Trump in February dismissed a slew of Democratic appointees from the center's board of trustees, replacing them with aides and allies that included chief of staff Susie Wiles and second lady Usha Vance. Trump was subsequently elected chairman, with longtime confidant Ric Grenell installed as the Kennedy Center's new president.
    


            His takeover of the Kennedy Center prompted sharp criticism from Democrats and angered artists connected to the center — including the producer of the hit musical “Hamilton,” who cancelled an upcoming run of the show that was supposed to go through 2026. A series of other prominent artists, including director Shonda Rhimes and musician Ben Folds, resigned from their positions at the center.
    


            Since then, Trump has taken a hands-on approach to overhauling programming and drawing up plans for renovating the complex. Asked about his involvement in picking the center's next honorees, Trump said he personally sifted through the candidates, rejecting some he felt were too “woke.”
    


            Trump joked on Friday that people may start referring to the performance arts center as the “Trump Kennedy Center.”
    


            “We're working on it. It's about a year project to make it. It'll be great. It'll be fantastic. You see the way this is looking, looks nice. I can't tell you how much that gold costs – a lot of money. There's nothing like gold, and there's nothing like solid gold,” Trump said.
    


            FIFA president Gianni Infantino accompanied Trump in the Oval Office for the announcement. Infantino and Trump have developed a close relationship as the tournament was awarded to the US, Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term and is now being planned and held during his second term in office.
    


            “This is this will be absolutely fantastic, the biggest event ever. And everything will start here in Washington, DC, at the Kennedy Center – or the Trump Kennedy Center,” Infantino said with a laugh.
    


            Infantino presented Trump with the first ticket to next year's final, noting that tickets for the tournament go on sale on September 10.

Five short weeks after winning the Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium, Chelsea returned to competitive play at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, banners celebrating their latest championship adorned around their stadium. The Blues, though, swapped an impressive 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain last month for a sluggish 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace, the scoreline a perfect reflection of the performance.

External factors likely played a sizable role in Chelsea's underwhelming showing on Sunday, the Club World Cup creating wonky preseason schedules for the European teams that made deep runs. Enzo Maresca's side, for example, played an 11-month season, took three weeks off, and had just 13 days of preseason preparation before facing Palace on Sunday, while the opponent had a much more traditional build-up. Maresca did not feel his side were underprepared as a result, but it was hard to ignore the circumstances.

"I don't think [the team was unprepared] because, until the end, we competed," Maresca said. "We tried to win the game. I think we had some chances at the end with Estevao, with Andrey Santos. So that showed that probably we compete overall quite good. For sure, [Palace] have already played seven, eight games. And for us, last week we played two games, but we tried to share minutes. So the real game for us was today. But for sure, slowly, slowly we're going to be better."

Even then, Chelsea have room for improvement as they prepare to face West Ham United on Friday, a trip to the London Stadium offering a perfect opportunity to put Sunday's performance in the past. While Palace were organized defensively and provided real hurdles for the Blues' attackers, the Hammers are unlikely to pose the same challenge. West Ham are coming off a 3-0 loss to newly-promoted Sunderland, which could be the first sign of a troubling season ahead for a team that has not refreshed much this summer and poses a limited attacking threat.

Chelsea were clearly the more dominant attacking team on Sunday, when they outshot Palace 19 to 11 and generated almost a full expected goal more than the Eagles. It was a performance that was more about quantity than quality, though – the Blues took just three shots on goal, unideal no matter the preseason disruptions. It offered a stark reminder that despite the Club World Cup triumph and the UEFA Europa Conference League win before that, Maresca's Chelsea may have plenty of potential but are still a great unknown.

Maresca boasts a bloated squad jam-packed with attackers, but has yet to figure out what his preferred combination is yet. Considering the circumstances – specifically, an ownership group that is unusually eager to sign new players – it is understandable that the manager has not cracked the code just yet. Cole Palmer has earned the right to be a regular starter but the rest of the spots just might be up for grabs.

The journey to figure out Chelsea's first-choice attacking unit has been a constant feature of Maresca's tenure at the club but the Club World Cup run offers important context thanks to the introduction of a batch of new players. Liam Delap, who chose Chelsea despite interest from several clubs around Europe, was a starter at the start of the summer tournament but by the time the trophy was in the Blues' sights, Joao Pedro was in the mix. He joined the team midway through the tournament and notched three goals in three games, including one in the final, and translated that into a start on Sunday against Palace.

Joao Pedro was at the top of a 4-2-3-1 that included Palmer, as well as Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens on the wings, but the returns were not spectacular. Joao Pedro took just two shots in 73 minutes, a throwback to his average returns during his two years with Brighton and Hove Albion. The less-than-exciting outing for Chelsea, though, perhaps opens the door for Delap to earn a starting role while 18-year-old Estevao Willian may play a sizable role himself this season after making a 36-minute cameo on Sunday.

Friday's match at West Ham, then, feels like the unofficial start of auditions to be one of Chelsea's first-choice attackers, all of whom will be tasked with helping the Blues live up to the hype they created last season.

President Donald Trump hasn't been shy about his excitement for the U.S. to host next summer's FIFA World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico. The head of state has spent an inordinate amount of time with FIFA President Gianni Infantino since taking office and, as of last month, the trophy from this past summer's Club World Cup has become a permanent fixture in the Oval Office. 

In April, Sports Business Journal was the first to report that Trump planned to appoint Andrew Giuliani as the executive director of the White House Task Force on the FIFA World Cup 2026. The one-time New York gubernatorial candidate (and son of former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani) spoke with SBJ this week about the federal government's role in preparing for the 39-day mega-event. 

This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

You oversaw sports-related issues in the Office of Public Liaison during President Trump's first term. What did that job entail and how did it prepare you for your current role? 

I think one of the main reasons the president was inclined to select me for this is because we created a novel visa system in 2020 [during the COVID-19 pandemic], when nobody was getting in the country at all, to get 15,000 accredited athletes and personnel into the United States. That way, we could start the PGA Tour season, Major League Soccer, the U.S. Open, all the other major sports as well, the NFL and so on. So, doing that, I was able to really get a good idea for what a visa process for the World Cup would look like.

What are the most important priorities the task force needs to address? 

More than anything, it's making sure state and locals have the resources that they need to protect the sites, the fan fests and the 48 different base camps around the country. That's why when we look at the visa process here, it's key that we're welcoming the world without sacrificing our national security and our footprint here. That's a mandate directly from the President, echoed by Vice President (J.D.) Vance, [Secretary of State Marco Rubio], [Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem] and all our other incredible task force members.

The way I look at success is, I want what people are talking about on July 20 next year to be about what happens on the field, not something off the field. If we can do that, then I think the task force has accomplished its goals. 

Protecting stadiums from drone threats has been a major focus of lawmakers. How is the task force preparing to take that on? 

Over the past year, we've had lots of discussion about drone security and how important it is to major events where you have tens of thousands of Americans gathering. All these stadiums have detection capability, but when you're looking at your standard NFL or MLB games, they don't have the authority to mitigate. We've gone to Mexico City already for the first counter — UAS trilateral meeting between the United States, Canada and Mexico — I was honored to lead that delegation. We've been out to West Virginia with Secretary Noem to look at all the different drone mitigation technologies.

That'll be different next year because these are Level 1 and 2 events, and [federal law enforcement] will have the ability to mitigate. We also want to make sure that we have that ability without taking prized assets, let's say, off the southern border. So, it's a matter now of making sure that we're acquiring all the right assets we need to make sure these 78 games are safe. 

Would it be local law enforcement or federal law enforcement overseeing that? 

Because these are Level 1 and 2 events, we'll have federal jurisdiction to be able to utilize mitigation capabilities. As a legacy project, there's talk of legislation about potentially giving state and locals, in some instances, the ability to mitigate as well. That won't be necessary for the World Cup in particular, but moving forward past July 20, I think it's one of the great potential opportunities for this major event. 

You talked earlier about visas and the sheer volume of people that will want to come to the U.S. for this event. What is the task force doing to make sure fans are able to get in and out of the country easily? 

First and foremost, some of the results that we can point to already are the wait times in four soccer-enthusiastic countries. Mexico's wait time was over 800 days a year ago. That number is less than 275 days. We've got some work to do to get that number even lower, but that's why the State Department is telling people to apply early. We put it back within the timeline of the World Cup, and we want to keep it within that timeline of the World Cup.

Colombia is another example that the media really focused on. It was over 750 days for the wait time — that number is below 300 days. Argentina and Brazil — not bad at soccer these two countries. Argentina went from over 500 days of wait time last year to effectively nothing, which means less than a month. Brazil went from over 300 days to less than a month.

That's really where we focused before teams are qualified. We looked at where fans will end up coming from regardless of whether or not their country qualifies for the World Cup. Deploying consular officers to those consulates is really key. 

Then, we're looking at other processes to make sure that we can process the 350,000 accredited individuals — that's a number per FIFA — and the ticket holders. If you break down the numbers, you're looking at five-and-a-half million to 6 million tickets. Of that, about two-and-a-half milloion to 3 million will be international. And of that, you're looking at 1.2 to 1.6 million visa holders. So,we're targeting that 1.2 to 1.6 and making sure that, without sacrificing our national security, they get to go through the process. Not everybody is going to get a yes, but we want to make sure that they get processed, so that way there is a conscious decision.

How closely is the task force working with the host committees in the 11 American cities? 

We worked directly with them to make sure the $625 million [for security] was in President Trump's “Big, Beautiful Bill.” That's something we had to fight to keep in there, and we were honored to do that. That was our direct work with the host city CEOs, security leads, their government affairs teams that will allow them to have these resources. Now that the Club World Cup is over, we're starting more regular meetings with them to go through updated concerns and checklists as we get closer and closer to the World Cup.

Will the $625 million for security be allocated directly to the host committees or to local law enforcement? 

The plan right now is through the host committees. We're working on a reimbursement plan so that we can verify the money is used for safety and security as the host committees projected to Congress and to the White House. As long as they submit the receipts that show that it's for “X” amount of overtime for law enforcement or it's for “X” equipment that's used specifically for the World Cup, then we are happy to reimburse that. 

Beyond safety and security, the cities have a lot of other expenses related to hosting the World Cup. Some are struggling to raise the necessary funding and, as a result, are scaling back fan fests and legacy programs. Can the task force help ease that burden or encourage FIFA to kick in a bit more money to help out the host cities? 

For us, it's about making sure that when the fan fests are open, when the games are going on, that they're as safe as possible. We were instrumental in securing the $625 million in this bill, along with the half a billion dollars for drone mitigation. So, I think the federal government has done more than its share to make sure that that these sites are safe and secure. 

Now, it's up to the host committees to make sure that they're also raising from the state and local [governments]. This is going to be a huge, profitable opportunity for these cities to host the World Cup for 40 days. We hope they can figure it out. I'm also hopeful that as we get into the World Cup year, as the draw happens, as people get more and more excited, some more of those of those spigots will turn on for the host committees.

Speaking of the draw, it has been reported that FIFA is planning to hold the event in Las Vegas this December, but over the past couple of weeks I've been hearing chatter about it winding up in Washington, D.C. 

Were you listening in on my last call? Is that what you were doing? 

No, but is that your understanding of where it's trending? 

I would say it's to be determined, but it will be exciting.

What else do you think our readers in the sports business community should know about the White House's approach to the World Cup? 

We're always happy to engage the private sector to see ways that they believe that we can be doing better and how we can be better partners. But if we do our job on the task force, it's going to leave the biggest runway for the sports business world to be able to go and run with this mega sporting event. 

This is the largest sporting event ever hosted, and I think obviously the sports business world is going to play a huge role in maximizing this, not just for the American fans that are here, not just for the 7- or 8-year-old that's going to watch their first World Cup game, but also for the international visitor here that is just learning about the United States of America. The sports business world is going to play a huge role in maximizing this World Cup in so many different facets.

Pictures of the Oval Office have recently shocked many football fans when they noticed the FIFA Club World Club trophy there. For the unversed, the trophy was won by Chelsea when they defeated Paris Saint-Germain F.C. 3-0. The match was held in New Jersey last month. While Chelsea won the cup, the trophy was seen sitting behind Trump.

In the photo, US President Donald Trump was holding a meeting with European leaders when fans spotted the trophy. This led to questions amongst fans as to why the trophy was still in the Oval Office. According to Firstpost, the trophy was handed over to Donald Trump by FIFA itself. 

The same was reportedly confirmed by the US President during an interview with DAZN. He stated that the trophy was given to him as a token of appreciation for hosting the newly expanded FIFA Club World Cup. Trump said,

However, the trophy in Trump's office isn't the original one. According to FIFA, there are three Club World Cup trophies at the moment. The original one sits at the FIFA's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. The second replica is with Chelsea and the final replica is sitting in the Oval Office behind Trump.

Thus, based on the clarifications by FIFA, it could be concluded that the the FIFA Club World Cup trophy in the viral photo is the third replica of the original one that is now in Zurich. FIFA told the BBC that the third replica was given to Donald Trump as "recognition of the 2025 tournament's exceptional hosts."

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup kickstarted on June 14, 2025, and continued till July 13, 2025. According to the BBC, FIFA president Gianni Infantino called this event the "world's most successful club competition."

The tournament featured about 32 teams, with Chelsea securing the winning spot for themselves by defeating Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in MetLife Stadium.

Shortly before the final match between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain F.C. took place in New Jersey, Gianni Infantino spoke about the event and said,

Infantino added,

Infantino continued by stating that the organizers had heard that they wouldn't be able to financially pull off such a massive event. He confirmed that the entire tournament had already generated a revenue worth $2 billion, according to the BBC. He additionally stated that they earned about $33 million per match.

As far as the final match was concerned, Donald Trump was also set to attend the same. While Infantino believed that the tournament was a success, he could not avoid one issue which was the high temperature in the summer across the United States.

While FIFA president Gianni Infantino highlighted that the tournament in the US was a massive success, not everybody was of the same view. Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp did not seem to be very fond of the idea that there was an expansion to 32 teams this time.

According to reports by the BBC, Klopp even called it "the worst idea ever implemented in football". He reportedly was concerned about "players' welfare." In June, he had an exclusive interview with German newspaper Welt am Sonntag. In the interview, Klopp said,

The former Liverpool manager believed that amid all these constant tournaments, the players got very less time and chance to recover physically as well as mentally.

As far as the shining trophy in Donald Trump's office is concerned, it should be clarified that it is not the original FIFA Club World Cup trophy but only a replica of the same.

Chelsea's 2025-26 third kit has already been made available in stores, confirming that the FIFA Club World Cup champions badge will be placed on the left chest - the spot typically reserved for the club crest. Thanks to @jordyxcollins & @CFCDREM.

The reason for this unusual placement is the design of the third kit itself. The new Chelsea 25-26 third shirt features a centralized club crest.

With the Chelsea crest and the Nike Swoosh already occupying the center of the shirt, this leaves no room for the FIFA CWC badge in its usual position. As a result, the badge has been moved to the left chest, opposite the Nike logo.

This is a different approach compared to Chelsea's 2025-26 home and away kits. On those jerseys, which feature a traditional crest placement on the left, the FIFA Club World Cup badge is applied in the standard central position.

This small but interesting detail shows how specific kit design choices can impact the application of official league and competition badges.

What do you think of this badge placement on the Chelsea third kit? A smart solution to the central crest problem? Let us know in the comments below.

After Chelsea triumphed over PSG in the Club World Cup last month, a match-issued Cole Palmer shirt has sold for £27,636 on football auction site MatchWornShirt.

The England attacker scored twice in the first half, helping the Blues secure the first-ever Club World Cup trophy in this format.

João Pedro added a third before half-time, which was enough to help Chelsea secure victory over the European Champions.

It was a successful tournament for Chelsea, who had to overcome Benfica, Palmeiras and Fluminese in their route to the final, perhaps an easier run than their French opponents, who overcame Inter Miami, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.

The victory puts the Blues in a good position for this Premier League season, as they will be encouraged after beating the winners of the Champions League.

Following the trophy lift, which awkwardly involved President Donald Trump, match-issued shirts were put up for auction on MatchWornShirt.

MatchWornShirt partners with football clubs to put match-worn and signed shirts in the hands of fans via their online auction platform.

The shirts are collected in the dressing room after the game, and are signed by the players before being authenticated in their offices.

The auction for the shirts gained a lot of interest across the whole of the Chelsea side, with goalscorer João Pedro's shirt selling for £13,119. Additionally, Reece James' shirt sold for £8,734 while Argentine midfielder Enzo Fernández's shirt sold for £4,407.

Mark Pulisic will never be confused with a helicopter parent, hovering over his son. But even the father of Christian Pulisic can't believe some of the headlines, hype and expectations surrounding U.S. national team standout.

With Christian and Mark Pulisic in the midst of having a war of words with former U.S. men's national team standouts, we thought this five-part series, It runs in the family, would be appropriate to repost. It gives background of both Pulisics. This is the final part of a five-part series about the Pulisic family. This interview with Mark Pulisic took place in 2017.

Final of a five-part series

By Michael LewisFrontRowSoccer.com Editor

Mark Pulisic will never be confused with a helicopter parent, hovering over his son. But even the father of Christian Pulisic can't believe some of the headlines, hype and expectations surrounding U.S. national team standout.

Headlines hail the 18-year-old Pulisic as the next superstar, the team's savior.

Prior to the U.S.'s World Cup qualifier in Mexico in June, a picture of Pulisic dominated the front sports page of Reforma with the headline: American dream.

“Listen, here's my take on the media and I really never discuss this,” Mark Pulisic said earlier this year. “Most interviews, they don't go this direction. But its borderline amusing, OK? For them to compare a 17-, 18-year old player to a Landon Donovan, for instance, who has done so much, who has been so successful in this country, who's had such a great career — I don't care if it was in Europe or the U.S. — for his national team, is ridiculous. OK?”

Now, Pulisic, a native of Centereach, L.I. knows his son his talented, but he also stressed that Christian was only a teenager and at the cusp of his career for club and country. Donovan set the standard for American men's soccer in Major League Soccer and the national team, performing in three World Cups.

“Landon Donovan had a great career,” said Pulisic, who is assistant coach of the Rochester Lancers in the United Soccer League. “Landon Donovan is Landon Donovan. and he'll always be remembered as Landon Donovan. Don't put another name next to that. It's not fair, it's not right to do. That's my opinion. My son is 18. To say he's the best or going to be the best, it's ridiculous. My son's so young. He hasn't had a serious girlfriend yet. Who knows how he's going to react to that part of his life? Who knows how he's going to react to his first major setback when he's left out of a national team, when he's left out of the first team? How he is going to come off an injury?”

Pulisic then tapped the table he was sitting at three times.

“How is he going to psychologically handle that?” he added.

“I mean. He's a young kid. Just let him play, let him develop. Enjoy the moment, enjoy the now. For me, as much as the media says they don't want to put too much pressure on him or hype him too much, like did Freddy Adu. They're still doing it. So, we can help Christian to some degree with that as well as his surrounding team his agent, but I just don't like when people say they're not hyping because they are. Just let him be. He's going to fail. He's going to have bad [days]. If you really want to see an American player who's at the highest level — and I'm not saying it's my son, it may not be my son — talk about the veterans and the older players who have established themselves on the national team and put them in the spotlight, ok?

“Don't say you don't want to hype him but you do anyway. … I think it's important [for U.S. Soccer and be very smart on how they handle their young players. Not Christian, all of them. There are some very good other young players coming up in U.S. soccer. Christian is one player. This is not an individual sport, it's a team sport. There are some very good young players coming up. Give all of them the opportunity, whatever environment they're in, to develop, to start a career, to start having a good career before you start putting them and comparing them to the best players.

Now, don't get Pulisic wrong. He understands publicity, but not when it is over the top.

“I understand the hype,” he said. “I'm not saying I'm surprised by it. I understand what media has to do and I understand their job. I guess as a parent we're just trying to be a little more protective. So that's just a natural protective mechanism as a parent. You don't want your son to hear all those things. You just want him to focus on playing. And i get it all. But some of the things I do read and some of the things I do hear are quite amusing and are a little bit too much.”

At a Tuesday press conference in New York City Tuesday, this reporter asked Christian what he thought of all the hype and attention.

“Of course, I hear about all this stuff people talk about,” Pulisic said. “This kid, there's hype, whatever. I just try to keep it out of my mind as much as I can because that doesn't really matter to me. I put enough pressure on myself. I don't need all this outside tension or whatever. I just try to do the best I can for myself and the people around me.”

It has been quite a year for the teen as Christian has earned a starting spot with his club team, Borussia Dortmund, and has become a fulcrum of the U.S. national team attack.

“For me everything happened a little bit too fast,” he said. “The past year has been a roller coaster. Being able to play at club level at a high level, and then getting called into the national team, it's amazing. But I'm just trying to stay as level-grounded as I can, finding a balance.”

The pictures of the Oval Office in the White House have stunned a few football fans across the globe, as the FIFA Club World Cup trophy can be seen sitting behind President Donald Trump. The FIFA Club World Cup trophy was won by Chelsea
after beating European Champions PSG 3-0 in a match in New Jersey last month, but fans spotted that the trophy is still in the Oval Office when the White House released a new picture recently.

The picture released by the White House showed Trump meeting European leaders and the Ukrainian President on Monday, and the trophy can be seen at the back. This led to a huge chatter on social media among football fans over why the trophy, which was won by Chelsea, is still in the Oval Office.

The truth is that he was handed over the trophy by FIFA itself. Why? As a token of appreciation for hosting the newly-expanded FIFA World Cup. This was confirmed by Trump in an interview.

“I said, ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy?' [They said] ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one',” Trump said in an interview with DAZN.

“And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.”

But that claim is not 100% true.

The real truth, as per FIFA, is that there are three Club World Cup trophies in existence at the moment. The original one is at FIFA's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. The world governing body follows the same process for the World Cup trophy as well.

The second replica is with Chelsea, and the third one is in the Oval Office of the White House. FIFA told BBC that the replica of the Club World Cup trophy was given to Trump as a “recognition of the 2025 tournament's exceptional hosts.”

Los Blancos may have won their first game of the season but the new coach has an awful lot of work to do at the Santiago Bernabeu

There's no other way to cut it: Real Madrid were very poor in their 1-0 win over Osasuna to open the season. Fans looking for signs of encouragement, or hoping to be moved by new tactical ideas, would have been left largely disappointed. There was nothing definitive to be found, no glitzy new system, or innovative way of playing.

Instead, Madrid fell back into a lot of similar patterns. Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappe disagreed a lot. The midfield lacked balance. The team looked vulnerable on the break here and there. If Los Blancos really do want to compete for the league, then they will have to perform a whole lot more convincingly than this. 

The good news, though, is that it is early on in the season. Xabi Alonso may have a lot to do, but he also has a lot to work with. It helps, too, that such is the quality of the squad - and relative weakness of La Liga - that Madrid can still be carried by moments of individual magic. 

Still, individualism can only sustain them for so long, and even if he is given time, the new coach will have to start piecing together something more tactically coherent. GOAL looks at the biggest changes Alonso must make if Madrid are to win major honours this season...

Some players have refused to sign a contract despite having the pen in their hand, while others have gone into hiding to avoid a transfer

As we all know, football is no longer a sport. It's a business - and a pretty ruthless one at that. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the transfer market, where money is king and the idea of a 'gentleman's agreement' is utterly laughable. This is why it's so naive for supporters to think that a 'Here we go!' is akin to confirmation that a deal has been done.

In reality, clubs cannot take anything for granted until a player signs on the dotted line, given there are all sorts of things that can go wrong at the 11th hour. Remember, even a faulty fax machine can scupper a proposed move!

However, the biggest threat to the completion of a transfer is last-minute interest from elsewhere - as Tottenham have once again discovered to their considerable cost. So, with Eberechi Eze's move to Arsenal in mind, GOAL runs through the most dramatic hijackings in football history:

 The wait for a successful men's singles title defence at the US Open is up to 17 years, but Jannik Sinner will have every reason to believe he can snap it this fortnight in New York. 

 The top-seeded Italian enters Flushing Meadows this year with a 31-4 record for the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and he is also on a 21-match winning streak at hard-court Grand Slam tournaments dating back to the start of the 2024 Australian Open.

 At his pre-tournament press conference Friday in New York, defending champion Sinner spoke assuredly when asked how he had recovered from the illness that caused him to retire from Monday's final against Carlos Alcaraz in Cincinnati. 

 “I'm firstly very happy to be back here. It's a great tournament. It's obviously the last Grand Slam we have for this season, so the motivations are very high,” said the Italian. “Physically I feel good. I have recovered mostly, not 100% yet, but we are aiming to be there in couple of days. So should be all fine for the tournament.” 



 The No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner was asked his thoughts on why defending the title has been so tough in recent years at the US Open, where the last man to win consecutive crowns was Roger Federer (the Swiss won five in a row from 2004 to 2008). The 24-year-old believes the challenge may lie in small contextual details that surround the event. 

 “We are heading towards end of the season, so some players, they are tired. Some players, they are feeling different. Many things can change,” said the 20-time tour-level titlist. “It's also the last big trophy of the year. I feel like here it changes a lot if you play night or if you play day. There are many, many small things at this Grand Slam makes a difference. 

 “For example, also obviously we are sleeping in the city, and it takes one hour to come [to Flushing Meadows}. Small things. But I feel if you don't handle them very well, then it's also very difficult to play the best possible tennis. Let's see. I always say that the future is unpredictable. So I don't know what's going to happen this time. But of course, it's a very, very difficult tournament to play.”

A campaign group has said it will seek to take its legal battle over plans to almost triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site to the Court of Appeal after losing a High Court challenge.

Save Wimbledon Park (SWP) previously took legal action against the Greater London Authority (GLA) over its 2024 decision to grant planning permission for the expansion, but Mr Justice Saini dismissed the challenge last month.

The proposals, submitted by the All England Club, would see the construction of 38 new tennis courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on the grounds of the former Wimbledon Park Golf Club, allowing it to host Wimbledon qualifiers on-site.

On Friday, SWP said that it had asked the Court of Appeal for the green light to challenge the High Court's ruling, a decision it said had “not been taken lightly”.

Jeremy Hudson, a director of SWP, said: “Above all, this is a public interest case. Planning is ultimately concerned with whether a development is in the public interest.

“The existence of rights of the public, imposed through the statutory trust and the restrictive covenants in the public interest, should plainly be very material to the planning decision.

“Unwanted development of public open spaces is proposed all over London: Wimbledon Park is just one example.”

Barristers for SWP told the High Court at a two-day hearing in early July that the decision to approve the plans was “irrational” and should be quashed.

They claimed that Wimbledon Park – a Grade II*-listed heritage site partly designed by Lancelot “Capability” Brown – was covered by trusts and covenants governing how it could be used.

The GLA and the All England Club defended the challenge, with the court told that the restrictions were not “material”.

In a ruling, Mr Justice Saini found that the decision to approve the plans was “a planning judgment rationally exercised and having regard to appropriate and relevant factors”.

SWP said on Friday that it believed Mr Justice Saini “took insufficient account of the statutory trust and the restrictive covenants”.

It continued that a decision on whether it could appeal against the ruling was expected later this year.

Among the group's supporters are comedian and writer, Andy Hamilton, and actress, Thelma Ruby.

Mr Hamilton said that the plans would come at “devastating cost to the local environment and community”, while Ms Ruby said that the plans would “desecrate a precious heritage landscape”.

The expansion proposals would see seven maintenance buildings, access points, and an area of parkland with permissive public access constructed, in addition to the courts and associated infrastructure.

They would also include work on Wimbledon Lake.

After Merton Council approved the plans, but Wandsworth Council rejected them, the Mayor of London's office took charge of the application, but Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan recused himself from the process after previously expressing public support for the development.

Planning permission for the scheme was granted by Jules Pipe, London's deputy mayor for planning, who said that the proposals “would facilitate very significant benefits” which “clearly outweigh the harm”.

Debbie Jevans, chairwoman of the All England Club, said at the time that the proposals would deliver 27 acres of “newly accessible parkland for the community”.

Following the ruling, Sir Sadiq said that the decision would “cement Wimbledon's reputation as the greatest tennis competition in the world and London as the sporting capital of the world”.

The US Open is the fourth and final Grand Slam on the tennis calendar.

Thousands of fans will flock through the gates at Flushing Meadows to witness the entertaining action unfold.

The raucous yet special atmosphere at Flushing Meadows adds to the brilliance displayed on some of the world's finest courts.

It remains to be seen which players will conquer New York and lift the coveted US Open title, and the tournament has drawn attention from stars in other sports.

The likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner lead the way for the men's favourites to win the US Open title.

Sinner is the world number one and defending champion, while Alcaraz claimed the Cincinnati Open title on Monday.

Furthermore, Novak Djokovic, who is aiming for a record 25th Grand Slam title and a fifth at the US Open, cannot be counted out.

But Sky Sports asked Premier League footballers Rodri and Alexis Mac Allister who they would pick to lift the title, and they threw their support behind Alcaraz.

“I will say Carlos,” Rodri answered, before MacAllister added: “Today Sinner and Alcaraz are up there, so I'm going to go with Alcaraz.”

Sinner and Alcaraz are the world's top two players and they have contested the last four tournament finals they have entered, two each at Grand Slam and Masters 1000 level.

They have firmly established themselves as the leading men of this era of men's tennis, and the French Open final illustrated how phenomenal their matches can be when both are at their best.

Despite their intense and fierce rivalry on court, Alcaraz stressed the fact he has a good relationship with Sinner both in an outside of tennis.

“Trash-talking gets a lot of attention. People really like the idea that there is friction between us,” Alcaraz told The Financial Times. “That's what sells.

“But although tennis is an individual sport, we are with the same players every week, day in and day out … Jannik and I, who have had great battles on the court, see each other a lot off of it.

“We talk, we train together sometimes. And in the end you forge a good relationship, a beautiful relationship. We want to win and beat each other, but then off court, being good people and getting along is another matter. For me that is one of the virtues and values of sport.”

Can Pegula rediscover the form that took her to a first Grand Slam final?ByAssociated PressPublished Aug 22, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK (AP)—This is supposed to be Jessica Pegula's favorite part of the season. She says so herself.And why wouldn't it be?Pegula gets to stay in North America. She gets to compete in front of friendly and supportive crowds. She gets to play on hard courts, her preferred surface. She gets to point toward success at the US Open, which starts Sunday, and which she's always loved for all of the above reasons.Plus, now she can declare that it was the site of her best Grand Slam performance—a run to the final a year ago.And yet? Well, things have not quite gone according to plan lately for Pegula, a 31-year-old who was born in New York and is based in Florida. She is seeded No. 4 at Flushing Meadows; that's the good news. Less good? Pegula goes into the US Open having lost four of her most recent six singles matches, including opening-match exits at Wimbledon—her earliest elimination from a major in five years—and Washington last month, and second-round defeats at Montreal and Cincinnati this month.

"I don't really feel like I'm playing great tennis. At times, I am, but I feel very up and down, kind of sloppy, which I don't like. It really bothers me. I'm kind of a perfectionist, so I don't like having to say that," said Pegula, whose parents own the NFL's Buffalo Bills and NHL's Buffalo Sabres."I feel like I've gone through phases in my career—a few tournaments—where I feel like that, sometimes, and you have to figure out how to get out of it and not feel sorry for yourself or make excuses," she added. "I've got to figure it out."Her performance at the US Open in 2024 began a series of four consecutive appearances in Grand Slam title matches by women from the U.S., including titles for Madison Keys at the Australian Open and Coco Gauff at the French Open—and changed things for Pegula, personally.

It had to, and not simply because that was the most successful run she had produced in 23 career appearances at major tournaments to that point.Remember (even if she might prefer not to): Pegula was 0-6 in Grand Slam quarterfinals until upsetting then-No. 1 Iga Swiatek in that round there in rather dominant fashion, winning 6-2, 6-4.Then Pegula reached her first title match at one of the sport's four most important events by eliminating 2023 French Open runner-up Karolina Muchova in three sets, before losing to current No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka 7-5, 7-5 in the US Open final."There's a little bit more pressure," Pegula said of how her mindset is different this time around, "but at the same time, (there is) a little bit more confidence. Coming into this swing last year, there wasn't as much pressure, but I also was a little worried about how I would do."

The main draw for the 2025 men's singles tournament at the US Open has been announced, and some stars have been handed a much better path than others. 

Novak Djokovic's pursuit of a 25th major title at Flushing Meadows will begin with a favourable string of opening matchups, and the Serb can avoid the top two-ranked players until the semifinals. 

For defending champion Jannik Sinner, a potential fourth-round headache awaits in the form of Alexander Bublik, who is the only man to beat him this season outside of Carlos Alcaraz. 

Alcaraz's route to the final does not come without its difficulties either, as the Spaniard finds himself on a collision course with both Daniil Medvedev and Ben Shelton. 

As the full draw begins to take shape with the conclusion of qualifying, one former top 20 player has failed to reach the first round in New York. 

With the first week of the US Open quickly approaching, non-seeded players continue to battle it out for a place in the main draw. 

The dream is over, however, for former Wimbledon quarterfinalist Cristian Garin, who suffered defeat to 35-year-old Argentine Marco Trungelli in straight sets. 

Garin reached a career high of world number 17 in 2021, and earned his best result at a major in 2022, when he made the last eight at the All England Club. 

In SW19 that year, the Chilean secured a statement victory over now-world number eight Alex de Minaur in a thrilling five-setter.

His campaign came to an end after losing to eventual runner-up Nick Kyrgios, bowing out to the Australian in straight sets. 

In 2023, Garin recorded a first-round finish at the Australian Open, but shortly before Roland Garros, he announced he would pull out of the event due to a broken rib. 

The withdrawal from the French Open saw him fall outside the top 100, and although he had made the quarterfinals at Wimbledon the year before, he could not compete in the 2023 tournament through direct entry as his ranking was too low. 

He failed to qualify for the US Open later that season, and since then, Garin has only featured in the main draw of a Grand Slam four times. 

The 29-year-old went out in the first round of both the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2024 and suffered second-round exits again in Melbourne and London in 2025.

NEW YORK — Tennis apparel sponsorship is a big business. It is also one that, among the top players, is dominated by a small group of industry titans.

Brands like Nike, Adidas and Asics provide the outfits for most of the top 100, with their recognizable logos splashed across the shirts and skirts of Grand Slam favorites.

But if one looks beyond that upper echelon and into the U.S. Open's qualifying tournament – where lower-ranked players compete for spots in the main draw – there's a world of local startups and small clothing businesses making their way into the booming tennis business.

For many players in the qualifying tournament, their apparel sponsors are companies local to their home country. These companies often specifically seek out their countrymen. 

“It's key to sponsor and help our Swiss players,” said Laura Tolub, the chief operating officer of Fourteen Company. Fourteen is a small sportswear brand based in Geneva, Switzerland, that sponsors a couple of Swiss players in the qualifying draw. “It doesn't mean we're only sponsoring Swiss players, but it's important to us to … be there for them.”

That country connection is often important on the player's side, too. Swiss player Marc-Andrea Hüsler, ranked 228th, won his second round qualifying match Thursday afternoon in Fourteen apparel.

“It's a Swiss brand, so I wanted to do something with the Swiss if possible,” he said about his decision to join the brand two years ago. “They were new and they were building up.”

They've built into a tight-knit community, according to Tolub.

“(Some players) want to have the feeling they are part of a family, which Fourteen is,” she said. “It's more of a family than a big brand.”

Arianne Hartono went a similar route. She is sponsored by The Indian Maharadja, a Dutch company known for its hockey clothing and based out of Nieuwkuijk, a small town of about 5,000 people.

“They were a very small startup, like three, four years ago,” Hartono said. “They approached me through social media, they just came at me and said, ‘Hey, we're a small company, we want to start coming into tennis.'”

She agreed, and their spiral logo was on full display as the Dutch player, ranked 158th, made her way into the third round of the qualifying tournament with a tight victory Thursday afternoon.

Other qualifiers look for the right fit beyond country lines. Argentine Marco Trungelliti, ranked No. 183rd, found one with personal ties.

His match clothes are made by a small upstart in Mexico called Lega, an apparel brand that's run by “a friend of a friend,” who the Argentine said he has become quite close with through their time working together. His shirts have been getting attention from keen-eyed fans – at the French Open, his top had a large Eiffel Tower design, and now in the U.S. Open's qualifying rounds, it's a Statue of Liberty.

“It's a complete new run,” he said of the New York City shirt, which was designed and manufactured by Lega specifically for his U.S. Open matches.

“I'm not a designer at all, but I had some opinions in there,” he said after winning his second round qualifying match. “But this one was completely on (the Lega designer), and I loved it.”

   10:58 EDT 22 Aug 2025, updated  12:03 EDT 22 Aug 2025    By JAMES COHEN, SPORTS REPORTER  

American tennis player and rising OnlyFans star Sachia Vickery has revealed the brutal financial truth that pushed her to launch an adult content career.

The 30-year-old returned to the court for US Open qualifying this week, beating Anastasiya Soboleva in the first round before losing against Germany's Ella Seidel.

While her comeback has made headlines, it's Vickery's lucrative side hustle that has truly set the internet ablaze in recent days. 

The Florida native, who charges $12.99 a month for access to what she calls 'content too spicy for Instagram', has faced sharp criticism since joining the x-rated platform. 

Some fans claim she's tarnishing the sport but Vickery insists her OnlyFans success has helped keep her tennis career alive.

'When you're on tour you're not automatically making a ton of money,' Vickery told the New York Post from Flushing Meadows. 

'Yes, I have done very well throughout my career. I've made great investments from the time I was young, so you know, it's like I'm fine.

'But at the same time, tennis players spend $100K plus a year on coaching, hotels, food, training, physio. So if I have another avenue where I'm able to make a lot of money to support that, you know, I don't see anything negative with it, personally.'

Vickery has banked just over $2million throughout her 14-year career on the court. Outside of the sport, she demands a $1,000 deposit fee just to date her. 

'It's an expensive sport, so I invest a lot of my money from there back into tennis, and I think that's one thing people don't understand. They think I'm just doing it to do it,' she added. 

'It's a great moneymaker. It's a great investment. If I have the potential to make a lot of money on there, why am I not going to take it? It's giving me a better life.'

Her OnlyFans platform teases her 'longest shower vid yet,' strip teases and 'spicier' pictures, while also asking her fans to rate her 'riding skills' as she shares risque videos and saucy snaps. 

'I no longer date for free due to the behavior of men I now require a pre-date deposit send me 1,000 and we can make it happen my cashapp is $Sachiavick,' she told her 39,4000 followers during an Instagram Q&A session earlier this week.

While Vickery's move may have sent ripples through the tennis world, she has no regrets. She previously revealed that she's always seen herself as something of a revolutionary.

'I've always pushed boundaries,' she said on the Black Spin Global podcast earlier this year. 'I've always been outspoken about racial hate I get online, bodyshaming. I'm very open about a lot of stuff.

'I'm still playing tennis, my career is still going but I also want to do things outside of tennis. I'm starting to explore more opportunities on social media.'

'Obviously there are levels to OnlyFans, you have athletes like Nick [Kyrgios] and Alex [Muller] who are going to be posting tennis content for the most part and then you have the other complete extreme, which I'm not. I'm in that middle gap,' she added.

'I set it up in January and it just took off. Being a tennis player definitely helped my marketing. I'm at a stage where I don't do the absolute most on there but I'm comfortable as I need to be. I'm doing really well.

'Obviously, I'm going to get some negative feedback but that's just normal. Whatever you do in life there's always going to be some criticism. If I was doing nothing I'd be getting criticism, so I might as well get on the platform and make money while I'm at it.'

Yet as she stepped onto the Grand Slam stage in Flushing Meadows again this week, Vickery once again hit back at her critics.

'I'm very open-minded and I don't care what people think of me … it's also the easiest money I've ever made and I enjoy doing it,' said Vickery when asked about balancing the two entirely different worlds together in an Instagram Q&A session.

'I will never talk s*** about girls on OnlyFans ever again for the rest of my life. Because the amount I made on there in my first two days, I am overwhelmed. I am just shook really.'

Vickery, whose father Rawle is a former soccer player and brother Dominque Mitchell played football at South Carolina State, turned professional in 2011 after training with USTA and Mouratoglou Academy in France.

But her career peaked back in 2018, when she managed a career-high ranking of World No 73.

ATP and PIF have today unveiled ATP Tennis IQ Powered by PIF, an enhanced performance analytics platform delivering richer data insights to all singles players across the PIF ATP Rankings.

The platform will empower around 2,000 players across the ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour to reach their full performance potential, unlocking opportunities and levelling the playing field, from emerging talent through to the top players of the sport.







ATP Tennis IQ Powered by PIF reflects the shared vision between ATP and PIF to elevate the sport through innovation and improved access to cutting-edge technology. The platform delivers richer data and analytics in real time, in the form of advanced scouting, video analysis and wearables insights.

Ross Hutchins, Chief Sporting Officer, ATP, said: “One of the things we're most proud of with ATP Tennis IQ Powered by PIF is putting high quality data insights into the hands of more players – enabling easy access to information that can genuinely impact their careers. We've also made big strides in the sophistication of the platform itself. Working with PIF has accelerated that progress – scaling faster, supporting more players, and delivering one of the biggest technological step changes in the sport.”

Mohamed AlSayyad, Head of Corporate Brand at PIF, added: “PIF is invested in better. Our partnerships are designed to address critical needs and leave a legacy of transformative impact, built on a shared ambition to elevate every level of sport at a global scale. ATP Tennis IQ Powered by PIF embodies how innovation can empower athletes. PIF remains committed to driving partnerships in sport to catalyse innovation, expand opportunity, and support the next generation of talent.”

Initially launched in 2023, the platform was developed in collaboration with Tennis Data Innovations (TDI) and TennisViz. The new version builds on the original platform, adding depth and scale:



These upgrades put richer data and analytics at players' fingertips in real time – helping them to better prepare, improve training techniques, refine and modify strategy and make better in-match decisions.

This launch is part of ATP and PIF's broader partnership focused on enhancing global tennis and its long-term future. PIF is the official naming partner of the ATP Rankings, celebrating players' journeys and progress across the season and championing excellence as the Year-End No. 1, presented by PIF, is crowned at the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin, Italy.

PIF partners with ATP Tour events in Indian Wells, Miami, Madrid, Beijing and the Nitto ATP Finals, in addition to the Next Gen ATP Finals Presented by PIF, hosted in Jeddah until 2027.

The top men's and women's tennis players are poised to go far at the 2025 US Open.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are expected to face off in another major final in the men's singles draw. 

Women's top seed Aryna Sabalenka isn't the betting favorite, but she should be considered as the top choice to win given her track record on hard courts. 

Upsets will happen in the first few rounds, but there shouldn't be dreams of an unlikely winner in either bracket. 

Odds via DraftKings Sportsbook.

Jannik Sinner (+110; bet $100 to win $110)

Carlos Alcaraz (+175)

Novak Djokovic (+1400)

Jack Draper (+2000)

Ben Shelton (+2200)

Alexander Zverev (+2200)

The last seven men's singles major titles have been won by Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. 

The two stars of the men's game are on track to face each other in another final in New York. Sinner is the No. 1 overall seed and Alcaraz is the No. 2 seed. 

Alcaraz has the more difficult path to the final with Novak Djokovic and the top two Americans, Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton, all in his side of the draw. 

The US Open has sprung more surprises than the other three majors in the past. Marin Cilic, Juan Martin Del Potro and Dominic Thiem all snuck in major titles during the Djokovic-Nadal-Federer reign. 

Fritz and Shelton are the two best long-shot betting options. Fritz made the final in New York last year and Shelton was a semifinalist in 2023. 

The two Americans probably have to get through both of Djokovic and Alcaraz just to get to the final, but it's worth noting that Djokovic and Alcaraz were both out by the third round in New York last year.

Sinner might be on cruise control until the final, which is bad news for whomever emerges from the gauntlet on the bottom half. 

The draw is favorable and Sinner is in solid form, so unless an upset occur before the final, the top-seeded Italian has to be viewed as the favorite. 

Prediction: Sinner over Alcaraz

Iga Swiatek (+250)

Aryna Sabalenka (+275)

Coco Gauff (+950)

Elena Rybakina (+1200)

Mirra Andreeva (+1200)

Naomi Osaka (+2000)

Madison Keys (+2000)

The last repeat women's winner of the US Open was Serena Williams from 2012-14.

That statistic doesn't bode well for reigning champion Aryna Sabalenka.

However, the top-seeded woman won three of the last five hard-court majors. She won twice in Australia and once in New York during that span.

Sabalenka is a lock to go far in New York. She's advanced to four straight semifinals at the US Open and she's made to the semifinals in seven of her last nine hard-court majors.

Iga Swiatek's had mixed results on the hard courts. She only has three semifinal appearances between Australia and New York and she's gotten past the fourth round just twice in six US Open appearances.

Swiatek reached the semis in every major so far in 2025, but she's far more vulnerable to an upset than Sabalenka on the hard court, which is why it's safer to bet on Sabalenka to win.

Australian Open winner Madison Keys and fellow American Coco Gauff will be tough to beat in Swiatek's portion of the draw.

Keys is a three-time US Open semifinalist and she should play freer in front of the home crowd with a major now under her belt.

Look for Keys to make a deep run, and if she plays well, we could see a rematch of the Australian Open final between her and Sabalenka.

Prediction: Sabalenka over Keys

...

NEW YORK (AP) — There was a time, not all that long ago, when any conversation about the up-and-coming U.S. players in men's tennis included a reference to Sebastian Korda. He made it to the fourth round of the 2020 French Open as a 20-year-old qualifier ranked No. 213 before losing to his idol, Rafael Nadal.

The following year, Korda became the youngest American man to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon since Andy Roddick was a semifinalist there in 2003. And in 2023, Korda made it to the first Grand Slam quarterfinal of his career at the Australian Open.

Injuries derailed Korda's progress, though, including surgery on his right elbow last year and a stress fracture in his right shin this year. He was sidelined following the French Open in May until this week, when he returned to the tour at the hard-court Winston-Salem Open, a chance to prepare for the U.S. Open, which begins Sunday.

“It was a long time,” the 25-year-old Korda, who reached the Winston-Salem Open semifinals but withdrew because of an illness Friday, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But it's nice to be playing again.”

He grew up in as sports-forward a family as there is: His parents were professional tennis players — Mom, Regina, was ranked in the top 30, and Dad, Petr, won the 1998 Australian Open and was the runner-up at the 1992 French Open — and his sisters, Nelly (ranked No. 1 until recently) and Jessica, are professional golfers.

After the shin problem was confirmed by an MRI exam, Korda needed a bit of a break, and only was back to hitting balls at 100% about two weeks ago. But he didn't exactly come to a complete stop before that, still swinging a racket while sitting on a chair and wearing a boot to protect his leg.

“It's been a lot of fun being back out here and running around,” Korda said. “Something I won't ever take for granted again is being able to run pain-free.”

Just about exactly a year ago, he was at a career-high No. 15 in the ATP rankings thanks to winning the title in Washington and making it to the semifinals in Montreal.

Back then, there was little reason to believe he wasn't ready to keep on climbing, right alongside other Americans such as Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul.

But Korda's body wouldn't let him. First, he was out of action because of the operation on his elbow. Then came the trouble with the shin.

When the rankings points he earned in Washington and Montreal came off his record because he missed both events this year, Korda slid all the way down to No. 86.

Before getting to Winston-Salem, Korda had competed in only 21 matches in 2025, going 11-10.

“I definitely haven't been playing healthy. That's kind of the main goal right now,” Korda said. “I'm not comparing myself to anyone, but definitely, there's a lot of motivation from seeing your peers doing so well — Ben, Taylor, Frances, Tommy, (Alex) Michelsen, Learner (Tien). They're all pushing each other. We're all pushing each other.”

When Maria Sharapova and her father, Yuri, arrived in Florida in 1994 -- from the frigid outer reaches of Eastern Europe -- they only had a borrowed $700 and couldn't speak English.

Sharapova was seven years old.

A year earlier, at a tennis clinic, 18-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratilova had recommended professional training at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida with coach Nick Bollettieri. Two years later, Sharapova was already so clearly talented that IMG underwrote her scholarship.

The gamble paid off. What began as a scholarship soon became one of the most recognizable careers in modern tennis.

On Saturday, the five-time major singles champion -- and one of only seven women in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam -- will be enshrined along with doubles champions Mike and Bob Bryan in the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island.

It's a worthy honor, for Sharapova finished her career with 36 WTA Tour-level titles, more than $28 million in prize money and a record of 645-171 (.790). She first achieved the No. 1 ranking at the age of 18.

Breakthrough at Wimbledon

You could see her coming. 

Four years after landing at the IMG Academy, she was the winner of the 2000 Girls' 16 division at the Eddie Herr International Junior Tennis Championships -- at the age of 13. Two years later, she was a finalist at the Australian Open and Wimbledon junior tournaments.

Sharapova turned professional on the day of her 14th birthday.

In 2003, at the age of 16, she crashed the Top 50. After winning her first two career titles, the Japan Open and the Bell Challenge in Quebec City, she was named the Newcomer of the Year.

A year later, she kicked it into another gear, winning Wimbledon at the age of 17.

Sharapova loved the strawberries and cream, but most of all she enjoyed stunning two-time defending champion Serena Williams 6-1, 6-4 in the final. That win ended the numerous comparisons to countrywoman Anna Kournikova, a blazing talent who never quite panned out as a professional. Sharapova was the first player from her country to win Wimbledon and, overall, the third youngest ever.

Years later, she was asked for a favorite memory from her playing days.

“I'd say your first Grand Slam final is ultimately just the most memorable one,” Sharapova said. “In my career, it came at a very young age. I was 17 years old and it was in London, in Wimbledon, and the whole world was watching. I was playing against Serena Williams, and everything felt like I should have just been happy to be there, but I was so fearless.

“It's always the memory that comes to mind because I least expected it to come then,” she said. “And I was so tough. I went for it.”

Backing it up

Sharapova, at 6-foot-2, was a baseline banger with a big, well-directed serve. Her secret weapon, though, was an iron will and an unyielding work ethic.

In 2006, at the still-precocious age of 19, she won her second major, the 2006 US Open. This time she beat another of the sport's icons, Justine Henin, 6-4, 6-4 in the final.

After Henin found the net on match point, Sharapova fell to her knees, held her head in her hands and ran to embrace her father.

“I figured I lost the last four times against Justine so I thought I would just flip everything [180] degrees and do the total opposite,” Sharapova said at the time.

Henin, who reached all four major finals that year, gave Sharapova her due.

“She's been a real fighter tonight and she deserves it,” Henin said.

Two years later, at the 2008 Australian Open, Sharapova added a third different Grand Slam to her eclectic resume.

After missing chunks of time the previous year with a serious shoulder injury, Sharapova -- in terms of ranking -- was actually the underdog against Ana Ivanovic after getting through, among others, Lindsay Davenport, Henin and Jelena Jankovic.

In sweltering conditions, Sharapova emerged as a 7-5, 6-3 winner in 91 minutes.

“If someone had told me in the middle of last year I'd be standing here with the big one,” Sharapova said, “I'd have said, ‘Forget it.'”

An unexpected turn

For Sharapova, the right shoulder was always the fulcrum of her success. And, because of the stress involved, her greatest vulnerability.

A few months after winning in Melbourne, Sharapova developed shoulder pain and eventually two tears were discovered in her rotator cuff. When rehabilitation didn't work, she elected to undergo surgery.

“I had my doubts,” Sharapova said. “I would always ask around who had such problems with their shoulder and who recovered from it, and who had surgery, and who got back to the top. And I didn't get many answers back, which was a little frightening, because you always want to look toward the positives.”

After sitting out for 10 months, she returned to tennis in the spring of 2009. Adapting to that adversity, Sharapova redesigned her serve -- reinvented herself, actually -- to take pressure off the joint most responsible for her success.

And while that leave of absence took her outside the Top 100, she returned to the No. 1 spot after an unexpected title run at Roland Garros in 2012.

On the red clay that had once left her completely befuddled, Sharapova beat Sara Errani in the 2012 final and, with it, joined the short list of women to win all four majors.

“It's the most incredible feeling,” Sharapova said after her win in Paris. “I'm so happy. I've worked so hard for this -- it took a lot to get to this stage and even more to win it.

“There are so many tough days where you feel like giving up, but you don't. It's been such a journey to get to this stage again.”

And then she did it again two years later, defeating Simona Halep in a three-set match that ran more than three hours.

“This is the toughest Grand Slam final I've ever played,” Sharapova told reporters. “If somebody had told me ... at some stage in my career, that I'd have more Roland Garros titles than any other Grand Slam, I'd probably go get drunk -- or tell them to get drunk. One or the other.”

U.S. Open

The U.S. Open begins Sunday in New York City, and the draws for the men's and women's singles have thrown up some blockbuster first-round matches.

The Athletic's tennis writers, Matthew Futterman and Charlie Eccleshare, analyze an intriguing draw, as well as offering some of their picks for the best matches of the opening days.

The main question for Novak Djokovic, comfortably the third-best player at the Grand Slams for the past year, was always going to be which order he would have to play the two guys above him.

When those two have been as dominant as Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, who have shared the past seven majors, that's especially the case.

So for Djokovic, cast back in the role of men's tennis's “third man,” all eyes were on whether he would end up in the Sinner half of the draw or the Alcaraz one. Given their head-to-head record, he will surely be happier with Alcaraz — especially as he would not meet the Spaniard until the semifinals. Djokovic's No. 7 seeding meant he could have played Alcaraz as early as the quarters, as he did at the Australian Open seven months ago.

Djokovic won on that occasion, as he did in last year's Olympic final. The world No. 1, by contrast, dispatched Djokovic in straight sets at Roland-Garros and Wimbledon, and seems a more reliable bet to reach the latter stages of the majors.

Alcaraz has been slightly less consistent, falling in the second round at last year's U.S. Open against Botic van de Zandschulp. But he has also developed his serve into a pressure release valve, beaten Djokovic in two Wimbledon finals, and come through two potentially discomfiting matches against physically limited opponents to win the Cincinnati Open.

After being thrashed by Sinner at Wimbledon, Djokovic spoke about not having enough gas left in the tank to beat one, let alone both, of the current Big Two in men's tennis. If someone took out Alcaraz earlier in the tournament, that would be an enormous boost for Djokovic. Defeating Sinner would be an almighty task, but doing so after overcoming Alcaraz looks borderline impossible this year.

Others in the draw might have something to say about Djokovic's progress, especially Taylor Fritz, who would meet him in the quarters. But aside from a mid-match retirement against Alexander Zverev, the only player not named Sinner or Alcaraz to beat him at a Grand Slam since 2022 is Alexei Popyrin. When? Last year's U.S. Open, of course.

Aryna Sabalenka or Iga Świątek, the top two seeds, didn't want Coco Gauff in their half of the draw at the U.S. Open. Especially Sabalenka, who crumbled under the crush of a pro-Gauff New York crowd two years ago. Gauff can become a force in New York, and loves the atmosphere, especially at night.

But right now, she is in a vulnerable moment. Gauff hasn't looked convincing since the French Open final, and now she is reconstructing her serve. She's brought in the biomechanist Gavin MacMillan, who helped Sabalenka fix her serve three years ago when she was about where Gauff is now, double-faulting 20 times every match.

Gauff tapping MacMillan the week before a Grand Slam — arguably her most important tournament as the leading American — could be a sign she didn't think she had any shot of winning this thing, or maybe even winning matches, in her current state. She was ready to take the long view, trying to fix her serve so she can rely on it for 10 years instead of 10 minutes. That process starts now, even if a massive tournament is just days away.

If Gauff ends up in a semifinal against Świątek, she might feel like she has already won, because she will have registered more wins in one tournament than she has all summer, but solving her serve problems could take months. She knows that. Her team knows that. MacMillan knows that. He doesn't tweak and tinker. He re-teaches a repeatable, efficient motion. She doesn't have that. In her mind, getting it as soon as possible is more important than whether she can find a way to beat Świątek in one match in one of what will likely be 80 Grand Slams she plays during her career.

Aside from Sinner and Alcaraz, does anyone have a better chance of winning the U.S. Open than Ben Shelton? Or at least, reaching the final?

Shelton has only lost to Sinner or Alcaraz at the Grand Slams this year. He had good chances to take early leads in all three matches. Then he won the Canadian Open, which Sinner and Alcaraz skipped, making something of a statement.

Shelton, the world No. 6, would face Alcaraz in the quarters. It is not the easiest draw — he might have preferred landing in Taylor Fritz's quarter — but he would probably take it if it means avoiding Sinner. As for Fritz, he may have to go through Djokovic to make the semis and the world No. 4 is 0-10 against the Serbian.

The percentages would suggest all of this is moot. Sinner and Alcaraz are levels above everyone else — but things happen in New York. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal never faced each other here. It's the back end of the season. It's hot and crowded and noisy. It's the tournament with an “if-this-man-should-fall” vibe.

Sinner and Alcaraz are probably going to meet in the final but Shelton might fancy his chances on a hard court in front of a frothy Ashe crowd against Alcaraz — at least, more than against Sinner, who is 21-0 in the last three hard court majors.

Novak Djokovic (7) vs. Learner Tien: The 24-time Grand Slam champion, who hasn't played a singles match since Wimbledon, likely under the lights on Ashe, against a promising young American lefty with a knack for top-10 upsets on his favorite surface. Sign me up.

João Fonseca vs. Miomir Kecmanović: Fonseca is an outrageous 19-year-old talent from Brazil in his first U.S. Open main draw. There are an estimated 500,000 Brazilians in the New York area. This will be loud.

Coco Gauff (3) vs. Ajla Tomljanović: Gauff is beatable. Tomljanović ended Serena Williams' career on Ashe three years ago. She won't be afraid of facing Gauff and 24,000 fans



The women's draw looks bottom-heavy, with all three of this year's Grand Slam winners in that half. Gauff and Madison Keys are slated to meet in one of the quarterfinals, with Amanda Anisimova due for a rematch of the Wimbledon final that Świątek won 6-0, 6-0 a month ago. Świątek, full of confidence after winning at the Cincinnati Open, doesn't have too many banana skins until that point.

In the top half, Sabalenka will be pretty pleased with the three other high seeds being Jasmine Paolini, Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva — players she has a lot less baggage against than the quartet above, three of whom have beaten her at the slams this year. Sabalenka will want to avoid Elena Rybakina, a possible quarterfinal opponent. Rybakina thrashed Sabalenka 6-1, 6-4 in Cincinnati last week and is not afraid of the world No. 1.

In the fourth round, Sabalenka is slated to meet the big-hitting Clara Tauson, another player who has beaten her this year. Leylah Fernandez might also be waiting in the third round but if Sabalenka can get through that tricky mid-section, she would look a strong favourite to reach the final. For Świątek, she might relish the prospect of facing all these top players and acquiring the match-toughness that Sabalenka might get less of from her later rounds.

Lois Boisson and Victoria Mboko have made good on the wild cards they received from their national tennis federations this year. Boisson took hers all the way to the Roland Garros semifinal. Mboko took hers to the Canadian Open title.

Those achievements earned them the ranking points required to enter directly into the main draws without any charity. Both had to play qualifying at Wimbledon. Mboko survived. Boisson did not. 

Mboko's triumph in Montreal has earned her the No. 22 seed, supposedly protecting her from facing the highest quality opponents in the early rounds — no luck there. The 18-year-old has drawn two-time Grand Slam champion Barbora Krejčíková in the first round. 

Krejcikova has not been in Grand Slam-winning form for a while and has battled injuries the past year, but she won three matches in Cincinnati. This might be a tough ask for Mboko, who could feel the pressure of expectation for the first time.

As for Boisson, can her game transfer to a hard court? She has drawn Viktorija Golubic of Switzerland in the first round. 

Of those just below Sinner, Alcaraz and Djokovic, Fritz and No. 5 seed Jack Draper are theoretically the most likely to have a deep run — not just because of their ranking, but their pedigree, too. Fritz reached the final here last year, while Draper was a semifinalist. Both look entirely at home on this surface and in these conditions.

Fritz appears to have a relatively straightforward passage to the quarters, with the out-of-form No. 16 seed Jakub Menšík the highest other seed he could face before then. He could also face the similarly out-of-form No. 21 seed Tomáš Macháč or Fonseca in the fourth round.

Meanwhile, Draper, who hasn't played since Wimbledon, has some dangerous opponents in his quarter. The exciting Canadian No. 31 seed Gabriel Diallo is his slated third-round opponent, while one of the Italians, Lorenzo Musetti or Flavio Cobolli, could await in the last 16. Draper could also play the huge-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard at that stage. He opens up against a qualifier or lucky loser.

Alexander Zverev is the No. 3 seed but has been unconvincing since reaching the Australian Open final in January. He has Alex de Minaur, Karen Khachanov, and Andrey Rublev as the highest-ranked players in his quarter. Were it not for his ropey form this year, he would be a big favourite to work his way through that and set up a likely semifinal against Sinner. But at present there are few certainties for a player who knows he needs to be more aggressive but fighting his more conservative instincts.

Venus Williams (WC) vs. Karolina Muchová (14)

The most exciting wild card in the draw by a distance, up against a player with a throwback game that wouldn't have looked out of place when Williams made her tour debut 31 years ago. Muchová was a semifinalist last year, and is a mighty fun watch — this should be very entertaining.

Barbora Krejčíková vs Victoria Mboko (22)

After her thrilling run to the Canadian Open title, Mboko is looking to back that up with her first run to the second week of a Grand Slam. A former Wimbledon champion and two-time major singles champion with plenty of know-how stands in her way.

Reilly Opelka vs Carlos Alcaraz (2)

OK, hear me out. I know recommending someone with as big a serve as Opelka's might sound like a wind-up, but he's also the classic “on his day” opponent. Even a five-time Grand Slam champion might struggle — or at the very least, be forced to produce some magical defense.

Which matchups are you looking out for? Let us know in the comments.

Matthew Grover is paving the way for para standing tennis after taking to the manicured lawns of Wimbledon last week in what was an unforgettable experience at SW19. 

Grover, 31, who lives in Horsham featured in the national finals at Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, which is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition and is delivered by Vodafone in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club.

Thousands of players took part in the qualifying stages this year, leading to county and regional finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on Wimbledon's Aorangi Courts last week.

Grover, who won the world championship doubles and singles title in 2024, was part of a para standing tennis exhibition match during the tournament and noted just how important it is to shine a light on the sport.

He said: "Wimbledon is such an historic venue and so to be able to be in Play Your Way To Wimbledon just helps us show people who don't necessarily think that tennis is for them that they can play on these courts.

"It's a fantastic experience to see all the age groups and disability formats. For us as para standings tennis players, to show our sport on the same courts that so many pros have been on is brilliant.

"It brings disability sport to life and brings so much for visibility.

"I never knew about para based sport until London 2012 and I've now become world and European champion in singles and doubles as well as playing at the US Open in a couple of weeks time."

This year's tournament delivered over 10,000 playing opportunities with thousands of singles and doubles players taking part at 800 venues, leading to county and area finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on the All England Club's Aorangi Courts from 3 – 9 August 2025.

The competition aims to broaden playing opportunities and to inspire people of all ages and abilities to play tennis and follow in the footsteps of their tennis heroes by competing for a chance to play on Wimbledon's iconic courts.

In addition to 14 and under singles, 18 and under doubles and adult doubles draws, the categories also included wheelchair (adult and juniors), learning disability and visually impaired competitions. The national finals also saw the return of popular para-standing and deaf tennis exhibition matches held during the week.

World No.1 wheelchair doubles partners and Vodafone ambassadors Alfie Hewett OBE and Gordon Reid OBE were in attendance to cheer on the players at SW19 and offer their experience and advice.

“We would have loved to have had something like this when we were younger and playing'” said Hewett.

“Play your Way to Wimbledon is a massive event for someone to pick up a racket for the first time or start playing again if they haven't for a while.

“It's about being active at grassroots level, making friends and new tennis partners and that is the beauty of events like this.”

Reid added: “We want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport.

“This event encapsulates that perfectly and we're proud to be a part of it.”

Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition. It is delivered by Vodafone, in partnership with the LTA and the All England Club, forming part of Vodafone's ongoing commitment to supporting grassroots tennis in the UK and making the sport more accessible for players of all ages and abilities.

An intriguing all-Asian matchup in the final round of US Open qualifying will take place on Friday as No. 3 seed Aoi Ito takes on fast-rising Pepperdine University graduate Janice Tjen for a berth in the main draw.

Ito, the unorthodox Japanese 21-year-old who has scored upsets over Jasmine Paolini and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova this summer, came through a see-saw contest over Spain's Guiomar Maristany Zuleta De Reales 6-0, 1-6, 6-1. Tjen notched her 99th match win since graduating last May 7-5, 7-5 over Poland's Maja Chwalinska, coming from 5-3 down and saving two set points in the first set.

Their first-time encounter will be one to watch not just because of their form but also their contrasting game styles. Ito attacks with her backhand while feeding her opponents an array of slices and high balls on the forehand wing; Tjen boasts a combination of a formidable forehand and a precise backhand slice, reminiscent of Ashleigh Barty. Both excel in the forecourt.

Tjen, 23, is bidding to become the first Indonesian player in a Grand Slam main draw since Angelique Widjaja at the 2004 US Open.

Valentova, Jones wrap up wins; Jimenez Kasintseva shines after rain

Wednesday's qualifying action was a near-washout due to continuous rain. Only eight women's matches were started, and none were completed; as a result, the entire second round is scheduled for Thursday, with the scheduled final round pushed to Friday.

Two of the most highly-rated teenagers in the draw were among those who had their matches delayed at a crucial juncture. No. 2 seed Tereza Valentova trailed Tatiana Prozorova 5-4 in the first set, while Emerson Jones led Laura Pigossi 5-4 -- having just failed to serve out the opener. Both returned on Thursday to wrap up their wins. Valentova, 18, sped through nine out of 10 games on resumption for a 7-5, 6-1 victory. Jones, 17, came through 6-4, 6-4.

Australia's Jones will next face another former junior No. 1, Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva. The 20-year-old Andorran, who is bidding to become the first player from her country to compete in a Grand Slam main draw, trailed Astra Sharma by a set and a break overnight. However, on resumption she played with substantially more purpose and confidence to win 2-6, 6-3, 6-3.

It was a good day to keep up with the Joneses. British No. 1 seed Francesca Jones -- no relation to Emerson -- came through a remarkable second-set tussle to defeat Ekaterine Gorgodze 6-1, 7-6(11). She trailed the Georgian 4-1 in the set and 6-2 in the tiebreak, but saved five set points before converting her own fifth match point.

No. 86-ranked Jones extended her winning streak to seven matches (following her Palermo WTA 125 title in July), and will next face Arianne Hartono. The Dutchwoman defeated No. 19 seed Olivia Gadecki 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.

Vandewinkel, Salkova escape from match points down

Two players came through the second round after saving match points. Belgium's Hanne Vandewinkel trailed No. 5 seed Viktoriya Tomova by a set and 5-3, but saved two on her own serve at 5-4 before roaring back to win 3-6, 7-5, 6-4. The result was the 21-year-old's first Top 100 victory, and puts her into the final round of a Grand Slam qualifying event for the first time. Though Vandewinkel has yet to compete in a tour-level main draw, she delivered an eye-catching performance in the 2024 Billie Jean King Cup Qualifiers by stretching Emma Navarro to a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 scoreline.

Czech 21-year-old Dominika Salkova reached the third round of Grand Slam qualifying for the second time this year with a marathon 6-3, 5-7, 7-6[8] win over Kristina Dmitruk, the 2021 US Open girls' runner-up. Salkova led by a set and 2-0, but ended up having to fend off four match points trailing 6-5 in the decider before edging the super-tiebreak.

Slovenia's Veronika Erjavec continued to deliver standout performances on the major stage, advancing 6-4, 6-4 past Canada's Cadence Brace. Erjavec qualified for her first Grand Slam main draw at the Australian Open, made the final round of Roland Garros qualifying and upset Marta Kostyuk to reach the Wimbledon second round as a qualifier. Her record at Grand Slams in 2025 stands at 11-3 so far -- compared to a modest 10-15 at all other levels.

The final qualifying round of the US Open is as follows:

[1] Francesca Jones (GBR) vs. Arianne Hartono (NED)[2] Tereza Valentova (CZE) vs. [18] Arantxa Rus (NED)[3] Aoi Ito (JPN) vs. Janice Tjen (INA)[4] Dalma Galfi (HUN) vs. [29] Panna Udvardy (HUN)Hanne Vandewinkel (BEL) vs. [27] Priscilla Hon (AUS)[6] Varvara Gracheva (FRA) vs. [20] Ena Shibahara (JPN)[7] Katie Volynets (USA) vs. Jana Fett (CRO)Destanee Aiava (AUS) vs. [21] Ella Seidel (GER)[9] Zhang Shuai (CHN) vs. Wei Sijia (CHN)Emerson Jones (AUS) vs. [28] Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva (AND)Alina Charaeva vs. [31] Wang Xiyu (CHN)[12] Darja Semenistaja (LAT) vs. Linda Klimovicova (POL)[WC] Ayana Akli (USA) vs. Oksana SelekhmetevaDominika Salkova (CZE) vs. [17] Rebecca Marino (CAN)Lucrezia Stefanini (ITA) vs. Hina Inoue (USA)[SR] Claire Liu (USA) vs. [32] Veronika Erjavec (SLO)

Despite the fact she's already earned millions in prize money

Pro tennis player, Sachia Vickery has clapped back at criticism over her OnlyFans account whilst she's playing in the US Open, describing it as the “easiest money” she's “ever made.”

Despite Sachia earning over $2 million in prize money throughout her career, she explained that the platform has massively helped her finically when she's not playing matches.



A post shared by Sachia Vickery (@sachiavick)



During a Q&A on Instagram, she discussed her OnlyFans account, which she set up seven months ago. She explained: “I'm very open-minded and I don't care what people think of me.

“It's also the easiest money I've ever made and I enjoy doing it. I will never talk s**t about girls on OnlyFans ever again for the rest of my life. Because the amount I made on there in my first two days, I am overwhelmed. I am just shook, really.”

Sachia Vickery currently charges $12.99 per month for her OnlyFans, with a representative for the tennis playing confirming that her content is more suggestive than explicit.

They stated that her content shouldn't be seen as “sex work” and clarified that there are “no full nudity or sexual acts performed” on her account.

The representative also went into further detail about why the tennis pro decided to start her account in the first place, saying: “Vickery was off [for] six months due to a major injury and in that time, OnlyFans was pursued, tennis was not stopped to go into OnlyFans.”

After her match at the US Open on Thursday, Sachia opened up more about her account, explaining that the adult site is “a great moneymaker.”



A post shared by Sachia Vickery (@sachiavick)



She told The Post: “Yeah, and another part of, you know, the tennis and OnlyFans aspect is that when you're on tour you're not automatically making a ton of money.

“Yes, I have done very well throughout my career. I've made great investments from the time I was young, so you know, it's like I'm fine.”

She continued: “So if I have another avenue where I'm able to make a lot of money to support that, you know, I don't see anything negative with it, personally.

“It's an expensive sport, so you know I invest a lot of my money from there back into tennis, and I think that's one thing people don't understand.

“They think it's, you know, I'm just doing it to do it. It's a great moneymaker. It's a great investment. If I have the potential to make a lot of money on there, why am I not going to take it? It's it's giving me a better life.”

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

As is always the case with it being played the week right before the US Open, the ATP 250 in Winston-Salem didn't exactly feature a star-studded field, but it has still been a great week of tennis so far. With four players remaining it's anybody's guess who will take the trophy home. None of the four players left is expected to make big waves at the US Open given their recent form but a title here could well give them the necessary momentum for a run in the year's last Slam.

Head-to-head: first meeting

Both players are having very disappointing seasons but can turn them around for a title here. While Mpetshi Perricard is young and expected to have a long career as at least a solid ATP level player, for van de Zandschulp winning this event would arguably be the biggest achievement of his career so far. He has reached two finals, both in Munich, but is yet to actually win an ATP level event. Last year at the US Open he beat Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets in what was undoubtedly the biggest win of his career, and he seems once again to be playing quite well at this time of the year. That said, this match is very likely to be closed by tiebreaks, and whoever can keep their composure and execute better in the biggest points will have the edge.
Prediction: van de Zandchulp in 3

Editor's Note: This article was accidentally published early. Marton Fucsovics had not yet won his quarterfinal match at the time of publishing. We will leave the article as is and will update if necessary.

Head-to-head: Korda 1-1 Fucsovics

While it's clear that his injury issues haven't helped, Korda hasn't really been able to deliver on the expectations many had of him. So far he has peaked at #15 in the rankings with only two titles, which is a disappointing resumé for someone with his level of talent and who has shown the ability to beat the likes of Alcaraz, Zverev, and Medvedev. Fucsovics is a veteran of the circuit still going strong, but the outcome of this match will depend mostly on what kind of level Korda can bring to the table.
Prediction: Korda in 2

ByMatt Craig,

Forbes Staff.

There's plenty to look at during a tennis spectacle like the U.S. Open, where a night match in Arthur Ashe Stadium might hold 23,000 fans, hundreds of sponsor activations, dozens of celebrities and who knows how many Honey Deuces. But everyone watching, whether in-person or on TV at home, looks at one thing more than any other during a match: the tennis ball.

Given that exposure and the makeup of a crowd at a typical ATP Tour event—where 60% to 75% of spectators identify as tennis players themselves, according to tour data—manufacturers have long paid for the privilege of serving as the official provider of tournaments' tennis balls, hoping to increase their market share in a global marketplace that sells $1.5 billion worth of balls annually. With each tournament free to negotiate with any brand it chooses, Forbes estimates the biggest events on the calendar can fetch $200,000 to $500,000 annually, in addition to a supply of the 70,000 or so balls used during play.

This sponsorship free-for-all has become a hot-button issue for professional players since different brands make balls with slightly different weights, densities and felt—all of which affect how it feels to hit for hours each day. Balls have become a scapegoat for players' inconsistent performance and, increasingly, for shoulder, elbow and wrist injuries.

“A lot of players are adamant about the effects that changing balls week in and week out have had on their body,” says Chris Eubanks, a former Wimbledon semifinalist and the ATP's 160th-ranked singles player, who will serve as an analyst for ESPN at the U.S. Open next week. “At least give us time to adjust to the different balls so that we can make whatever modifications we need to. Then our bodies will naturally adjust.”

Andy Roddick, an American tennis legend who won the 2003 U.S. Open, put it another way on his Served podcast earlier this year. “Imagine if pitchers, what would happen to their elbows if the baseballs they were throwing [had] different weights?” he said. “Tell me that if you had to do that professionally, over and over again, in an extreme way, that those wouldn't affect your body differently.”

The ATP, which organizes the men's tour, had been hearing these complaints for years but felt powerless to address them until 2023, when it passed a moratorium on tournaments signing new contracts with ball manufacturers and secured the rights to negotiate future deals on behalf of all of its tournaments. After another quiet two years, the tour unveiled its grand plan in June, finally taking action to create some tour-wide consistency.

The catalyst, as it so often is, was money—or in this case, a lack of it.

While the ATP broadly oversees the events on the men's tour, each tournament is owned and operated by a different entity, each of which is naturally trying to maximize its revenue. Historically, tennis balls were too important a sponsorship category to disrupt. As recently as the 1990s, ball manufacturers were the title sponsors of some ATP Tour stops.

During the pandemic, however, differences between ball brands became more of a focus as worker shortages at rubber and felt companies and strained supply chains led to inconsistent quality. At certain tournaments, players reported low ball pressure and overly fluffy balls that were leading to more stress on the arm.

“Four weeks—four different balls. When are tournaments going to listen to players?” three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka wrote on social media in 2023. Nick Kyrgios, a player never afraid to wade into controversy, later posted, “The people who think balls aren't a big enough factor to result in an athlete being hurt are potatoes.”

By that point, the relative weight of tennis balls as a sponsorship category had decreased dramatically. At big events like Masters 1000s and Grand Slams, airline, banking and car brands today might pay ten times as much as ball manufacturers for their partnerships, and the tour also distributes more money from media rights and data collection deals, making ball sponsorships a less significant slice of the revenue pie. That new financial reality allowed the ATP to step in.

“Clearly it wouldn't have happened even 10 years ago,” says Geoffroy Bourbon, the ATP's executive vice president for Europe. “Now, it's become much easier to go to tournament directors and say, ‘Relinquish your grip on the category, and let's do what's right from a sporting standpoint.'”

The ATP now plans to divide the calendar into a handful of “swings,” such as the Australian hardcourt circuit in January or the European clay-court events in May, with the same brand of ball being used at each tournament within that stretch. Any existing sponsorships will be honored until the end of their current term, the last of which run through 2028, and as the tour negotiates short-term deals timed to expire simultaneously that same year, the ATP has guaranteed tournaments that any new deals will match or increase the revenue they currently generate.

"By creating swings, we've created a scarcity of opportunities to be present on tour, so that's the commercial leverage we have over manufacturers,” Bourbon says. “And they had the threat of what was going to happen in 2029 if they don't play along.”

About 25% of tour events were forced to change their ball sponsor, but “as long as the money stayed the same, we're happy,” one tournament organizer told Forbes. “Plus, now players can't complain to us—they have to complain to the tour.”

The manufacturers have been less receptive to the plan now that they will no longer be able to pick and choose which tournaments to sponsor. Instead of partnering with an individual marquee event or one that arrives at a strategic point on the calendar—for instance, one Masters 1000 tournament in the spring and one in the fall, for a six-figure combined sum—a brand might need to make a seven-figure offer to sponsor a swing of Masters 1000-, 500- and 250-level events.

“It wasn't ideal for them from a marketing standpoint, for sure, but at the same time they recognize what we're trying to do,” Bourbon says.

The ultimate goal, Bourbon says, is to provide manufacturers with objective, data-based player feedback they can use to improve the quality of balls, which in turn should raise the quality of play and limit injuries. But Bourbon is quick to shut down the suggestion that the ATP is going through all this effort out of the goodness of its heart.

“That's clearly a business decision,” he says. “When you end up not having your best talent show up at your most important tournaments because they've switched balls three times in three weeks and they've got a wrist ache, that is more important to us than $5,000 more here or there.”

In the short term, ball centralization remains an imperfect system. The four Grand Slams, for example, are not controlled by the ATP and still negotiate their ball deals individually, which could lead to a situation where players use a Dunlop ball through the clay-court swing and then a Wilson ball at the French Open. Meanwhile, tournaments with existing sponsorships will continue to disrupt the schedule for the next handful of years. And while the ATP worked with the WTA Tour for sponsorships at men's and women's combined events, the WTA continues to operate on a tournament-by-tournament basis for the time being.

For players like Eubanks, continuity can't come soon enough.

“When we're having two weeks on, three weeks off, back to Ball A for another week and then using Ball C for this week, it just continues to drive us crazy,” he says. “And we're already crazy enough.”

Tennis

One year ago, Taylor Fritz had a Grand Slam quarterfinal problem.

Four times he had reached the last eight of a major; four times he had lost. Notoriously hard on himself, the best American male tennis player of his generation did not wear that record lightly.

Twelve months on, Fritz returns to the U.S. Open occupying a different place in the sport's hierarchy, looking to end America's 22-year wait for a men's Grand Slam champion.

After reaching the 2024 final to break his personal glass ceiling, Fritz last month backed up that result with a run to the Wimbledon semifinals. World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beat him last year in New York, and this year in southwest London, world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz took him down. Everyone in men's tennis knows the feeling, and Fritz's progress over the past year means he will be the No. 4 seed this fortnight — the highest U.S. Open seeding for an American man since Andy Roddick in 2005.

“I've got to the point where it doesn't feel like it's such a big deal,” Fritz, 27, said during a news conference at Wimbledon.

“When you have that feeling, it allows you to play your best tennis in the situation and the moment.”

“Experience helps,” added Paul Annacone in a recent interview. Annacone, who worked with serial winners Pete Sampras and Roger Federer and is on Fritz's team led by Michael Russell, emphasized how Fritz's having been “to the rodeo once or twice before” means he knows what is required.

Fritz has never entered his home major as such a contender, despite a rough year featuring several injuries and some recent underwhelming results. A Cincinnati Open defeat to world No. 136 Terence Atmane followed a straight-sets Canadian Open loss against Ben Shelton, who is looking to usurp Fritz as the top U.S. player.

Striving to be the best he can be without putting suffocating pressure on himself, even during a run that falls below his standards, has been key to Fritz's improvement.

Four years ago, he wrote a note to himself: “Nobody in the whole world is underachieving harder than you, you are so f—-ing good, but 40 in the world, get your f—ing s— together.” By his own admission, he sets himself extremely high standards and can be “a bit delusional,” a quality that peers and friends, such as fellow player Reilly Opelka, remember from his junior days.

“I would say he's not delusional, I'd say he is very obsessed with trying to be as good as he can be,” said Annacone. “That focus is a huge asset if he maintains his balance, which he's starting to get.

“Now he gets annoyed when he loses and he's frustrated when we talk about it, but he can move on. That's the change. When you're not No. 1, tennis is a lot of getting your backside kicked for a while. So his obsessive, compulsive desire to win everything, to always win, to be better? It can burn you out.”

Fritz said during Wimbledon that in training, he's still as hard on himself as ever, but has learned to stay calmer during actual matches. He credits girlfriend Morgan Riddle with helping him stay focused and improving his results.

Fritz's game has developed along with his mindset during his rise to establish himself at the top of the sport. He has “graduated,” Annacone said, from relying on his huge serve. His backhand is rock-solid and his forehand is more devastating.

“He's done a remarkable job of having a crystal clear idea of what makes him the player that he is and not straying from it,” Jim Courier, a former world No. 1 and now Tennis Channel analyst, said in a phone interview during Wimbledon.

“The most important thing is his clarity of shot selection. It's when he is in an offensive position, whether it's the forehand or a backhand, trusting that his shots are good enough. Because they are, he can hurt you with both sides. The forehands come in quicker, but the backhand is pretty lethal, too.”

Fritz has also further developed what was already one of the ATP Tour's keenest tactical minds. His news conferences have become appointment viewing, as he thoughtfully breaks down strengths and weaknesses — his own, as well as those of his opponents. During the Wimbledon semifinal against Alcaraz, he hit a monstrous serve while holding set point in the fourth set. Alcaraz somehow returned it, then won the point, the set, and, with it, the match.

Fritz later blamed his attention to detail, saying he had tossed the ball an iota too far to his right. That meant he sliced it a little, so it curved through the air toward Alcaraz and gave him slightly more leeway to get it back.

Fritz “isn't going to do something just because you tell him, you better be able to back it up,” Annacone said. His charge also shares another key characteristic with those two. “My number one trait that I look for is someone who's an unconditional competitor,” Annacone said. “This kid competes, I would argue, better than anybody.”

But having established his ability to compete with the best, Fritz now has to beat them. Sinner was much too good in last year's final, winning in straight sets, and Fritz has admitted to sometimes feeling powerless against Alcaraz. Last year's loss to the Italian still encouraged him because Fritz thought he had reached the final without playing that well.

At Wimbledon, things were different.

“The way I played the first two sets today, there's not much any opponent can do,” Fritz said after beating Karen Khachanov to earn the right to face Alcaraz.

Whether or not that's “a bit delusional,” self-belief has gotten Fritz this far, and each time he plays Sinner or Alcaraz, he learns a bit more about how to beat them. For 2025, if the U.S. Open draw goes to form, it would be Alcaraz first in the semifinals, then Sinner for the trophy, again.

This year's problem may be tougher to solve than last year's, but it's a far more preferable one to have.

NEW YORK—New format, same champions.Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori knocked out a field of singles stars to defend their mixed doubles title at the 2025 US Open, edging past the upstart team of Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud, 6-3, 5-7 10-6 in a dramatic final on Arthur Ashe Stadium."I think these two days will be really important for doubles in the future because we show that doubles player are great players," Vavassori said after the match. "I think this product can grow."Errani and Vavassori were not guaranteed entry into the revamped mixed doubles event, which prioritized players with higher singles rankings, but following a statement protesting their potential exclusion, the Italians were ultimately admitted via wild card."I don't think if we didn't do the statement if we would have played this tournament, honestly," Vavassori claimed.Once in the tournament, the reigning Roland Garros champions vowed to play “for all doubles players” as they set to work at winning their second Grand Slam title of the season. They breezed through Day 1 of play with wins over No. 2 seeds Elena Rybakina and Taylor Fritz and Karolina Muchova and Andrey Rublev to reach semifinals, and kicked off the championship evening with a 4-2, 4-2 win over Americans Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison.

To win the title, they would need to topple Swiatek and Ruud, who first bonded over the clay-court swing when Ruud expressed his support for the former world No. 1 after a disappointing defeat at the Mutua Madrid Open. Competing together for the first time in Flushing Meadows, they shrugged off Swiatek's quick turnaround from winning the Cincinnati Open to beat both Madison Keys-Frances Tiafoe and Caty McNally-Lorenzo Musetti in straight sets. In the semifinals, they rallied from a set down and won the match tiebreak from 4-8 down to book their first mixed doubles major final."It's been an honor and really fun to share the court with Iga and other players," Ruud said. "It's the first time they're doing this. I know it's created a lot of reaction, somewhat bold to do it. You can't argue that it's not great for fans because you have full packed Arthur Ashe at midnight on a Wednesday of the quallie week. How often do you get that?"Errani and Vavassori initially appeared to have the upper hand as their doubles experience helped them capture the first set and take a 5-3 lead in the second. But just as the Italians looked to have the match sewn up, Swiatek and Ruud scored a crucial break as Vavassori served for the match, breaking Errani to force another Sudden Death.With the title on the line, Errani and Vavassori stepped up once more, showing superior net play to take a 9-5 lead on the Polish-Norwegian team, converting their second championship point when Swiatek netted a final volley.

We show that you have to think, be smart. On doubles there are more things than hitting the ball. Sara Errani

"In doubles is not just serving good, hitting good, returning good," said Errani, herself a former top tier singles player. "There are many other things that are not easy. I think the doubles players improve that things a lot to see, to cross, many other thing that is not only hitting the ball."We show that you have to think, be smart. On doubles there are more things than hitting the ball. Singles has other things and doubles has another things. We show that we are good on doubles, you know, to change the game, to know what to do."While Errani and Vavassori will look to make a clean sweep when they enter their respective doubles events next week, Swiatek and Ruud will both feature in the singles. Swiatek will be the No. 2 seed after winning her sixth Grand Slam title at Wimbledon earlier this summer. Ruud, a former US Open finalist, is projected to be the No. 12 seed in the men's singles tournament.

Mariano Puerta's career was anything but ordinary. Born in Cordoba, Argentina, he moved to Buenos Aires as a teenager to pursue tennis professionally, inspired by countryman Guillermo Vilas. 

Results came quickly, especially on clay. As a junior, his biggest achievement was reaching the Roland Garros boys' final in 1995 against Mariano Zabaleta, though he fell short of the title.

Still, Puerta's promise was clear. By 1998, he broke through on the ATP Tour, capturing his first career title in Palermo, Italy, against fellow Argentine Franco Squillari. The year 2000 marked his real emergence. He was second only to Guga Kuerten in clay-court victories, winning the Bogota Open and reaching finals in Mexico City, Santiago, Gstaad, and Umag.

But Puerta's rise was derailed by a serious wrist injury while training with coach Hernan Gumy. The setback shook him both physically and mentally. “It happened while warming up with Hernan Gumy. First ball, he hit it softly, I set up my forehand, swung, and felt a tremendous pain. That year I ended up playing with injections. The injury got worse until we decided on surgery, which I had in the United States. That's when instability in my career began, along with mental struggles,” Puerta told La Nacion.

His return was rocky. Puerta later admitted it took him time to realize he needed psychological help. “In 2002 I wasn't bouncing back. I felt 100 percent responsible for the failure of my comeback after surgery. I was so aware of it that during many tournaments I was hurting myself on purpose—sometimes hitting balls out deliberately, not being humble, not chasing certain shots. It takes a lot of humility to succeed. Having so much success at a young age can make you arrogant. There was a moment when I said: ‘Either I forgive myself or this ends here. I couldn't go on like that,'” Puerta recalled.

By 2003, Puerta was rebuilding his form. But at the ATP tournament in Viña del Mar, after losing to fellow Argentine Agustin Calleri, he tested positive for clenbuterol, a banned substance. He was suspended for nine months.

“After that match in Chile, I had a doping test—everything seemed normal. Months later they told me it was positive. I thought, ‘What is this? Oh, the medicine!' I cannot believe it!,” Puerta said.

Cleared to compete again in mid-2004, Puerta mounted an impressive comeback. He reached the Buenos Aires final in 2005, then won his third ATP title in Casablanca by defeating Juan “Pico” Monaco.

That set the stage for the best run of his career: the 2005 Roland Garros. Puerta advanced to the final, where he faced a young Rafael Nadal, who was seeking his first Grand Slam title. Puerta stunned the Spaniard by taking the opening set 7–6, but Nadal stormed back to win the next three and claim his maiden major crown.

Days later, Puerta's career unraveled. A drug test from Roland Garros came back positive, this time for epinephrine. Puerta argued the trace amount found in his body came from accidentally drinking from his wife's water bottle, which contained medication.

The penalty was severe: an eight-year suspension, effectively a career-ending sanction. In 2006, the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced it to two years, allowing him to return in 2007. He won a Challenger in Bogota in 2008, but he never came close to his previous heights. In truth, that 2005 Roland Garros final would remain the defining match of his career—the peak and the turning point.

Despite the controversies, Puerta still left his mark on Argentine tennis. He reached a career-high ranking of World No. 9 in August 2005 and played a crucial role in Argentina's Davis Cup win over Australia that same year, teaming with David Nalbandian to defeat Wayne Arthurs and Lleyton Hewitt in doubles on grass.

The official cast of “Survivor 49” has been revealed, featuring 18 brand-new castaways ready to outwit, outplay and outlast the competition. While the latest players to join the Emmy-winning reality series includes the likes of a NASA rocket scientist and a former Marvel Studios executive, longtime host Jeff Probst revealed in a statement that two cast members were added to the season's lineup just hours before the game began. 

Those players come in the form of 32-year-old legal clerk Jason Treul and 29-year-old fitness trainer Michelle “MC” Chukwujekwu. The duo originally traveled to Fiji as alternates for the season, but officially joined the “Survivor” family after two prospective castaways were sent home before filming began. 

A historic first for the longrunning series, Probst opened up about “Survivor” producer's last minute descision in an interview with Entertainment Weekly following the August 20 cast announcement.

“What I can say about the reason we made the move is this: ‘Survivor' has rules and standards, and if a player crosses that line, we act,” said the host. He went on to explain that the players had been removed from the cast for violating the show's pre-game rules that prohibit contestants from engaging in any kind of communication with one another before filming begins.

The rule, put in place to prevent players from forming pre-season alliances and to preserve the authenticity of the game, stipulates against prospective players engaging in any kind of verbal, non-verbal, or physical contact during their pre-game quarantine.

“It's one of the reasons we bring alternates,” said Probst, adding that the tradition of bringing more castaways than necessary to Fiji ahead of filming acts as sort of “insurance” policy for producers. 

“Typically, we bring alternates in case somebody gets sick or has a panic attack and can't begin the game,” he said. “That's very, very, very rare there. But regardless why we brought them there initially, they are also there to serve as a reminder that we do put a lot of importance on the integrity of the game, and we won't let anything or any person put that in jeopardy.”

While Jason and MC flew to Fiji ahead of filming knowing that they likely wouldn't appear on “Survivor 49,” Probst explained that the duo were “suddenly thrust into the game” with just 12 hours notice. 

“It was a shock, for sure,” the host continued. 

Despite having less than a day to mentally prepare for “Survivor,” Probst told EW that he saw Jason and MC's last minute addition to the cast as an “advantage” for the players. 

“You've spent a week observing, but without the pressure of thinking you were going to have to play and put it into motion,” said the host, adding, “Jason and MC find themselves in this marooning challenge that 12 hours ago they were dreaming might happen one day and suddenly it's right in front of them.”

Probst went on to identify the moment as a “completely unique situation” for “Survivor,” adding that he hopes the last-minute casting shuffle will add a “cool layer to this experiment.”

Jason and MC will similarly be joined on the “Survivor 49” cast by two former alternates, Sage Ahrens-Nichols and Sophie Segreti, who were alternates for Season 47 and 48, respectively. 

“We have four alternates playing,” said Probst, noting the historic series first. “When we tell you you're an alternate, we tell you what that means. It means we want you on the show. We just don't have a spot for you this season. And we really mean it.” 

Probst added that he hopes “Survivor's” most alternate-heavy season will encourage future alternates to hold out hope that they'll eventually find themselves on the beaches of Fiji searching for Hidden Immunity Idols and attending Tribal Council ceremonies. Conversely, the longtime host said he also hopes this moment acts as warning to future prospective castaways that the show takes its rules very seriously. 

“The word should spread,” he said, “Just because we tell you you're on the show – until the game begins, you're not on the show.”

“Survivor 49” is set to make its two-hour CBS debut on Wednesday, September 24 at 8:00pm ET.

The prequel series won't go ahead, but a writers room for season two of ‘Dexter: Resurrection' is set to open soon.

	The Dexter prequel Original Sin won't get a second season, despite an announcement to the contrary earlier this year. The Dexter franchise is still a going concern, however, with a writers room for season two of Dexter: Resurrection set to begin work in the near future.


	Showtime announced a second season renewal for Dexter: Original Sin in April, six weeks after the 1991-set series following a young Dexter Morgan (played by Patrick Gibson) ended its 10-episode first season. Sources say, however, that the show had been on hiatus since production wrapped, and no start date for production on a second season was ever scheduled.

	With a change in leadership at Paramount following the Skydance merger, the Dexter franchise moved from Showtime/MTV Entertainment into the reborn Paramount Television Studios under Matt Thunell. The decision then came to focus on Resurrection, which continues the present-day Dexter's (Michael C. Hall) story from the original 2006-13 series and the 2021-22 follow-up Dexter: New Blood.


	A writers room for a potential second season of Resurrection is set to open soon, with the intent being a renewal, sources tell THR — though season two has yet to be formally greenlit. The series has been performing well for Paramount+ Premium and the linear Showtime channel. The premiere episode drew 3.1 million viewers over its opening weekend and grew to 4.4 million after seven days; Paramount says the Aug. 15 episode drew the show's largest audience of the season. 

	











	Sources also note that Paramount remains invested in the Dexter franchise but is directing its efforts toward the unfolding story of Resurrection rather than filling in more of the character's life in a continued prequel series.

EXCLUSIVE: Amid monster viewership for Happy Gilmore 2, which last month scored Netflix‘s biggest U.S. opening weekend ever, Adam Sandler's Happy Madison is teaming with Shawn Levy's 21 Laps to develop a feature adaptation of Evan S. Porter‘s debut novel Dad Camp, with Kevin Jakubowski on board to pen the script.


	Published by Dutton in June 2024, Dad Camp follows John, a devoted father who finds his once-close bond with daughter Avery unraveling as she enters her preteen years. Desperate to reconnect before she starts middle school, he signs them up for a week-long father-daughter retreat at a rundown summer camp, where he's forced to confront both his fears of losing her and the evolving nature of their relationship.

	











	Shawn Levy and Dan Levine will produce on behalf of 21 Laps, with Emily Feher and Max Gains overseeing the project for the company.

	Working as a blogger in between writing his novels, Dad Camp author Porter wrote for Upworthy from 2015-2018, and spent three years as Lead Copywriter and Director of Content at Atlanta-based digital marketing agency Nebo before that.


	Jakubowski is a Humanitas Prize-nominated screenwriter whose credits include HBO Max's 8-Bit Christmas, which was nominated for a PGA Award for Outstanding Producer of Televised or Streamed Motion Pictures, and Assassination of a High School President, which was an official selection of the Sundance and SXSW Film Festivals. In television, he created Legendary Dudas for Nickelodeon and Play by Play for Verizon/Roku Channel. His original scripts Old Time Hockey and Full Fenski Christmas are currently set up at Skydance. 


	The scribe began his career as a PA on South Park and is repped by Kaplan/Perrone, Verve, and attorney Adam Cooper.


	Recently setting Tripper Clancy to write a Night at the Museum reimagining for 20th Century Studios on which we had the scoop, 21 Laps launches the fifth and final season of global hit Stranger Things later this year. Recently, the company has also announced feature adaptations of Grady Hendrix's short story “The Blanks” and Freida McFadden's psychological thriller Never Lie for Netflix, as well as a Madonna limited series for the same streamer.

	











	As a director, Levy's next project is Star Wars: Starfighter, starring Ryan Gosling, Mia Goth and Matt Smith, which he's also producing. Pic goes into production this fall and will be released theatrically on May 28, 2027.


	Marking Sandler's first Netflix film based on one of his legacy characters, Happy Gilmore 2 amassed 46.7 million views in its first three days on the platform, beginning July 25, and has now garnered over 109 million views. This puts the film on track to break into Netflix's Top 10 Most Popular Movies, as the last of 10 entries on that list, the Millie Bobby Brown starrer Damsel from 2024, has just 138 million views.


	First entering into an exclusive deal with Netflix in 2014, Sandler's films have consistently been top performers for the streamer. Most recently, his Happy Madison has announced a pair of new Netflix comedies, on which we were first to report: Don't Say Good Luck from Julia Hart and Roommates from Chandler Levack.


	Soon to be seen starring opposite George Clooney in the awards prospect Jay Kelly from Noah Baumbach, which releases in select theaters on November 14 before premiering on Netflix on December 5, Sandler is also set to hit 37 arenas with his Adam Sandler: You're My Best Friend Tour, beginning next month.

Donald Trump made a much-teased announcement from the Oval Office on Friday, saying the FIFA World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center on December 5.


	But he also signaled his desire to put his own name on the arts institution.


	“On December 5 of this year, the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center,” Trump said. “Some people refer to it as the ‘Trump Kennedy Center,' but we're not prepared to do that quite yet. Maybe in a week or so.”


	Since taking office, Trump has taken an intense interest in the Kennedy Center, making his fourth visit to the institution on Friday to survey contractor plans to renovate the complex. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump's signature piece of legislation, included $257 million to upgrade the facility.

	











	Rep. Bob Onder (R-MO) last month introduced legislation to rename the Kennedy Center as the Donald J. Trump Center for the Performing Arts. But a 1983 law specifies that “no additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The World Cup announcement will take place two days before the annual Kennedy Center Honors, with this year's recipients George Strait, KISS, Sylvester Stallone, Gloria Gaynor and Michael Crawford. Trump has said that he had a “98%” influence on the selection of the recipients. Just weeks after taking office, Trump ousted Joe Biden's appointees to the Kennedy Center board, ensuring that he would be named its chairman, a first for a POTUS.


	At the Oval Office announcement, FIFA President Gianni Infantino brought the gold World Cup trophy, telling Trump, “Presidents of countries and winners can touch it, because this is for winners only. And since you are a winner, you can, as well touch it.” 


	“Can I keep it?” Trump said, noting that it would fit in with his Oval Office gilt-laden decor. Infantino said that they do have to give it to the next winner.

disgusting/get him impeached.  The oval office looks like Saudi Arabia.  He's a Power Hungry dictator that must be removed from office

Epstein. Epstein. Epstein.
He can try anything he wants but he won't get away from everyone wanting to see the files.
He knows he's gonna come out on the wrong side of history so why not take his whole family with him?

He is the worst of us

This will be a haven for D and F-list celebrities and poorly selling musical groups. They may reconfigure the building to accommodate monster truck shows and wrestling matches. The possibilities are limitless. And that is frightening.

To be fair, he's an idiot.

	Somewhere in Tallahassee, at the turn of the millennia, a young Byron Donalds stood in the parking lot of his local Cracker Barrel — then his place of employment — and contemplated the man atop the wood-and-whimsy pancake palace. It was in that moment, staring into the gold and brown face helming the performatively old-timey interstate eatery, that a future congressman decided to give himself to Christ. 


	That may not be exactly how it happened, but Donalds came forward with his story of religious epiphany in a Cracker Barrel parking lot amid MAGA outrage over the chain restaurant's decision to change its logo, removing the image of “Uncle Herschel” and his barrel. 


	“In college, I worked at @CrackerBarrel in Tallahassee. I even gave my life to Christ in their parking lot,” he wrote. “Their logo was iconic and their unique restaurants were a fixture of American culture. No one asked for this woke rebrand. It's time to Make Cracker Barrel Great Again 🇺🇸” 

	











	There is no indication that Cracker Barrel's decision to simplify its logo was motivated by politics or “wokeness.” If anything, the company has been struggling for years to market its perfectly mediocre food and boomer nostalgia-themed ambiance to anyone but the remaining population of baby boomers, or those in urgent need of a bathroom during their long drives. A rebrand was long overdue. But Republicans are reacting to the marketing decision as if old Uncle Herschel — the uncle of founder Dan Evins — had been taken out back and shot in the name of DEI. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“WTF is wrong with @CrackerBarrel??!” Donald Trump Jr. wrote on X. MAGA country musician John Rich asked his followers if they would “go to Cracker Barrel now that it's going woke? This could be a ‘Bud Light' moment in the making.” 


	Right-wing actor James Woods posted that on cross-country drives, “Cracker Barrel was the only place I'd ever stop. No mob fights, a fun corny atmosphere, and delicious food when you're hungry and tired. I'll never stop foot in one again.”

	Professional anti-woke troll Christopher Rufo declared that “we must break the Barrel. It's not about this particular restaurant chain — who cares — but about creating massive pressure against companies that are considering any move that might appear to be ‘wokification.'”


	In effect, Rufo openly acknowledged that while there may be no actual indicator of the restaurant chain's motivation, the delusions of right-wingers triggered by the redrawing of a corporate logo or the redesign of a candy mascot are grounds for punishment. And, to that end, Cracker Barrel's already flailing stock took a dip on Thursday as conservatives fumed at the company. 


	For some reason, the Democratic National Committee got in on the act. “We think the Cracker Barrel rebrand sucks too,” wrote the DNC, amid the total collapse of its own brand.


	Even more bizarre, for some Republican influencers, the meltdown over Uncle Herschel's PR demise took a turn for the sexual. TPUSA Founder Charlie Kirk posted an image comparing the original logo to new MAGA favorite and universally-acknowledged-hot-actress Sydney Sweeney, and the redesign to a plus-sized woman.

	“Accurate” Kirk wrote. Is the implication that Kirk found the image of Herschel to be hotter? 


	Perhaps the appeal of Cracker Barrel was not the peg game, the rocking chairs on the front porch, or the subpar biscuits and gravy, but the coy gaze of Herschel — apparently a Christlike figure watching the MAGA cult from his perch above the freeway — inviting one inside.

EXCLUSIVE: Fathom Entertainment‘s 35th anniversary rerelease of New Line's 1990 movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cleared a good first week of $3.3 million, and exhibitors have asked, and will now receive, a second week of play of the costumed character pic.


	But there's more: Given the excitement over the first movie based on the Eastman & Laird 1980s comic book, Fathom, Saga Arts and Warner Bros are now planning to rerelease the 1991 sequel Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze in March 2026.


	The original Steve Barron-directed film when released screamed to the world that, by God, there's a mega franchise in these turtles. Paramount has since absorbed the franchise and was behind a two-pic Michael Bay-directed live-action reboot as well as the 2023 animated movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, which pushed $1 billion in global retail merchandise sales for that calendar year. The first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie opened to $25.3M and now counts a running domestic total of $138.6M. The 35th anniversary rerelease played in around 1,300 theaters this past week.

The Secret of the Ooze opened to $20M in 1991 and and finaled at $78.6M domestic. A third film that petered out the initial run of the franchise, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, debuted in 1993 to $12.4M and ended its run at $42.2M.




			Watch on Deadline		







	All in between both the Warner Bros and Paramount releases of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, the green guys have grossed $1.3 billion worldwide from seven movies. 

	











	”The devoted fans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise have shown up in droves with so much passion and enthusiasm in celebration of the iconic film's 35th anniversary, Fathom Entertainment is thrilled to extend its theatrical run for a third time and add an additional full week in select theatres until August 28. Even better, we have confirmed with our partners that Fathom is bringing back the 1991 sequel to the big screen in March 2026,” Fathom CEO Ray Nutt said. “With $3.3M in box office revenues for the opening week of its theatrical return engagement, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 35th Anniversary is currently the highest-grossing 2025 classic/repertory film for Fathom Entertainment.”

The idea of a “period piece” usually conjures up images of Georgian ballrooms and crenellated battlements. But now that “Time to Pretend” is a vintage track (how horrid), any TV show or film set in the back half of the 20th Century is firmly a period project; and the 1970s, specifically, might be one of the most challenging decades for contemporary movies and series to recreate. 

There are a number of reasons why this is. IndieWire reached out to production designers who have worked on contemporary films or shows set in the 1970s — including Anastasia Masaro (“Fellow Travelers”), Curt Beech (“BlacKkKlansman”), Howard Cummings (“Behind the Candelabra”), Aaron Haye (“Bohemian Rhapsody”), and Beth Mickle (“The Deuce”) — to ask how difficult they've found the time period and none of them classed the ‘70s as easy. 

 








Related Stories How ‘Star Wars' Stormed the Academy Awards and Sent an Oscar Into Space ‘Ne Zha 2' Review: The Chinese Animated Phenomenon Is a Gorgeously Animated Epic 

They all highlighted ways in which our cultural awareness of the ‘70s can fool film crews and audiences alike into thinking we remember what the period should look like. But memory, just like a shag carpet, is tricky to maintain. 

 










“It's close enough to our time to feel familiar, yet so much has changed that every detail matters if you want to keep the world authentic and believable,” Haye told IndieWire. “For example, finding a location that still retains a true sense of the '70s can be difficult. Small details like rooftop antennas, graphic elements, and of course, more obvious things like vehicles and architecture are essential to grounding a piece in that period.” 

Yet, as Beech pointed out, a lot of the material goods actually from the ‘70s are of a lower quality than earlier decades and also more degraded than the period relics of the ‘80s and ‘90s. “Because of the [economic] downturn, products made and used in this period were of a lower quality than what the baseline is today. Because of this, they have largely been relegated to landfills. They had little value then, and did not retain it. The upside is, this all adds up to an interesting visual story to try to tell,” Beech told IndieWire. 

Masaro told IndieWire that she and her team needed to rely on a lot of specialty shops and rentals in order to create an authentic sense of the ‘70s in her sets. “The thing that makes the ‘70s a little more manageable is that it's still a highly desirable era, whether it be for the design or the nostalgia, so there are collectors who specialize in it,” Masaro said. 

 










Cummings agreed that the one bright spot about working in the decade is the nostalgic desirability of the styles and items most associated with the period. “The color palette alone of the ‘70s just immediately transforms the visuals. Add in the exploration and use of textures… [it's] heaven,” Cummings told IndieWire. 

It only takes some diligent scanning on eBay, Chairish, and Facebook Marketplace to get to heaven, it turns out — at least when it comes to finding '70s-appropriate furniture. Mickle told IndieWire that it's not necessarily hard to find pieces from the decade, but it is tricky to use them in the right way, and in the correct proportion. 

“The ‘70s saw a wave of more experimental styles [in] shapes and forms used in architecture, furniture design, and surface patterns, as well as clothing and vehicle design. But in recreating the period, it's important to remember that these more extreme visuals weren't seen everywhere all at once,” Mickle told IndieWire. “If that's not kept in mind, it's easy to go overboard and flood the frame with ‘70s cliches. The design can quickly feel like a caricature of the period.” 

Beech agreed with the danger of flooding the zone; if he had any advice for others working on projects set in the ‘70s, it would be to remember that people did not accumulate so much stuff in the way that we do now. The temptation to fill the walls is something that production designers going for period accuracy have to fight against. “If you need to fill a space visually for a 1970s project, you will have to be more creative than cramming the walls with stuff. It's going to be more about the basics of color, texture, and shapes than ‘things,'” Beech said. 

 










Those signifiers of time period also have to be balanced with a lived-in sense of other time periods, too. Masaro's work on “Fellow Travellers” is decade-spanning, but she said that the key was that she couldn't hermetically seal the ‘50s and ‘60s away when it came time to design her ‘70s sets. “The thing I find with any period is [you can't] focus too heavily on the decade styles themselves, without including design choices from previous decades,” Masaro said. “Layering previous decades with the ‘present' makes it feel more realistic and less like an advertisement for the 1970s.” 

Because the colors, textures, and geometric patterns that immediately scream “1970s” are such strong deviations from both contemporary design and a lot of what came before in the 20th Century, that balance is easy to get wrong or to tip into pastiche. “Only the 1930s are harder,” Beech said, about another era that maybe has become too iconic in our shared cultural imagination for its own good.  

The '70s require a great deal of patience to search out scarce resources, to sift through imperfect research material, and to combat our contemporary myths and misunderstandings that it was all waterbeds and egg-shaped chairs. “But if you aren't excited about that challenge, you are in the wrong career,” Beech said. “I speak for all production designers when I say we live for the really hard assignments!” 

 










IndieWire's '70s Week is presented by Bleecker Street's “RELAY.” Riz Ahmed plays a world class “fixer” who specializes in brokering lucrative payoffs between corrupt corporations and the individuals who threaten their ruin. IndieWire calls “RELAY” “sharp, fun, and smartly entertaining from its first scene to its final twist, ‘RELAY' is a modern paranoid thriller that harkens back to the genre's '70s heyday.” From director David Mackenzie (“Hell or High Water”) and also starring Lily James, in theaters August 22.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


A column chronicling conversations and events on the awards circuit.


	In case you missed it when Deadline posted it on Monday, over the weekend I hosted a conversation with Seth Rogen and five other cast members of The Studio at SAG headquarters in the Wilshire District, and you can see that here. It was total laugh-out-loud with that group, as you can imagine. What I didn't print, and what was not on the video we posted, was equally hilarious — especially because Rogen had never been to SAG headquarters before, which includes the incredible new Meryl Streep Center for Performing Artists that's been built on the penthouse level. And it all provided some instant material for the comedy star.

	











	This center, named after the three-time Oscar-winning and 21-time-nominated star, has all kinds of rooms where actors can attend seminars, self-tape auditions, do voice-overs, take headshots and so much more. It also houses a screening room that seats about 100 or so, and that is where we showed SAG nominating committee members the final two episodes of The Studio‘s season and conducted the conversation — which, due to the limited size of the stage, meant three stars were on the bottom row and three others right above them. “It feels like we're about to play The Match Game,” Rogen cracked.

	And before I could work in any questions, Rogen had some observations of his own on the size of the intimate theater in this facility named after Streep (the theater itself is named for Tom & Rita Hanks, who, like Streep donated quite a bit of money for the naming honor). “I would hope Meryl Streep had a bigger theater, if I'm being totally honest. This is it? What Meryl Streep gets is this? Is that Meryl Streep annex? Come on. Give the lady a full-size theater. You got, like, one-eighth of a theater here,” he joked.

	











	But when I mentioned this was all being recorded, he changed his tune a bit. “Wow, what a beautiful [theater]. … Don't worry, she's not going to watch this. I'm not concerned this is going to get back to her — like Meryl's just livestreaming her theater all day. Oh man, this could be an episode of The Studio, trying to hide from Meryl Streep! Anyway, congratulations. “

	Before the actual Q&A began, Rogen was noticing all the other areas of the Streep Center that had been donated by the famous, like the room named for now-divorced Hugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness, or, notably, the Ryan Reynolds & Blake Lively Balcony right off the Green Room.


	All of this inspired Rogen so much that he grabbed a marker and paper to rename the restroom after himself. Here is that photo. Do you think they left it up?


	This was all in good fun, and I have to say that what SAG-AFTRA has created with this Streep Center is remarkable — a way the union can help its members with all the practical needs for any actor. I have done a few of these conversations there for the SAG Foundation, and the actors who come in for those always leave impressed.


CLOCK IS TICKING FOR EMMY VOTERS


	We are still in crunch time for casting your Emmy ballot, with voting continuing only until August 27. This is why you are seeing so many contenders popping up anywhere they can still bring attention to their nominated work. Alan Cumming is the guest on today's edition of my Deadline video series Behind the Lens, talking about all aspects of his career including as host of Peacock's The Traitors, for which he is nominated for two Emmys. But he goes back in time to recall his first production of Cabaret on Broadway, where the PR representative welcomed him and he thought there wouldn't be much more to do. He says she corrected him and told him she would be seeing a lot of him in the next three months. “It's awards season!” she said. Cumming said he had never heard of an “awards season” before. He certainly has now.

	As this one winds down, it has become apparent we have some real horse races going on. Will it be Hacks repeating or The Studio cashing in a lot of those 23 nominations for its first season? Or, can The Bear make a comeback? This week the Television Critics Association recognized The Studio for best comedy but clearly showered the most love on The Pitt, with four major wins. Severance was shut out has double the number of Emmy nominations, so it looks like the contest for Drama Series is coming down to the wire with both shows firmly in contention. Could The White Lotus come back a la The Bear and triumph once again? Anything is possible, well except in the Limited Series race, where Adolescence has this thing in the bag.


OSCAR CONTENDERS, START YOUR ENGINES


	As the Emmys wind down, next week marks the official start of Oscar Season as Venice and Telluride kick off the Fall Festival circuit. No rest for the weary. Over the course of the next few months, one potential winner after another will be introduced. Some will fade quickly, others will be at the Dolby in March. But from the first eight months of the year, Warner Bros looks to be in the prime starting position with a couple of surprises from the horror genre — Sinners and Weapons — leading the pack of potentials, and Apple's summer smash F1, for which Warner Bros is handling the theatrical release. They are the only surefire Best Picture possibilities among movies that already have had a theatrical release. Last night at the DGA and Wednesday night at AMC Century City, F1 appeared to be the first on the Oscar track in terms of all guild Q&As for the industry. It is getting an early jump on the game. I moderated the DGA screening to a packed house and asked legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer — who was on the panel with director Joseph Kosinski, producer Jeremy Kleiner, casting director Lucy Bevan and supervising sound editor Al Nelson — why the Academy doesn't take these big, beautifully crafted movies more seriously.

	











	It wasn't until Top Gun: Maverick that Bruckheimer received the first Best Picture nomination in his career, and now there is talk for F1, both directed by Kosinski. “I wish I knew this. Then I could make those other kinds of movies he's so good at,” he laughed about Kleiner, who has two Best Picture Oscars for smaller films 12 Years a Slave and Moonlight, both for Brad Pitt's Plan B. “I mean, I love making movies that take you to another world and show you how it actually works as a process,” he said, adding that they worked three long years to pull F1 off, and now it not only is Apple's biggest success, but the streamer let the theatrical aspect play out to an astonishing (for this era) 58 days on an exclusive theatrical window. In fact, Kosinski announced that as we were at the DGA (and showed me on his phone), F1 officially debuted Thursday night on digital at a $19.99 rental price but still has no firm streaming date. It also is hitting $600 million at the worldwide box office, but most importantly, it is a film with emotion and humanity, and some terrific performances led by Pitt. Why shouldn't it be a contender?


	We shall see it and you on the Oscar season trail.

Close to a year before Los Angeles welcomes the FIFA World Cup in June 2026, Snoop Dogg is already rallying his fellow Angelenos to get pumped up in a promotional video. The rapper and coach on “The Voice” has been named the official Community Chairman for the Los Angeles Host Committee. 

According to press materials distributed on August 12, 2025, Snoop will be highly visible before and during the global tournament, with eight soccer matches to take place at SoFi Stadium.

“This isn't just any tournament,” the Los Angeles native said in an announcement video. “This is the biggest event on the planet and it's coming to our city.”

As the Community Chairman for the Los Angeles World Cup 2026 Host Committee, Snoop will work closely with the events team, inspiring “countless Angelenos and fans of the global game” as part of “this once-in-a-generation moment,” per a press release. 

“L.A.'s ready to show up with that signature style, culture, and love for the beautiful game,” Snoop said in a video announcing his new role. “I'm here to make sure that the whole world has a great experience in our city and everyone in our community gets the chance to participate.” 

Officials said Snoop will “represent the tournament at community engagement and legacy programs,” including cheering on the U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) in their first match on June 12. 

This isn't Snoop's first time representing the U.S. for a global sporting event. In 2024, he was an official torchbearer during the opening ceremony of the Paris Summer Olympics. He also served as a special Olympics correspondent for NBC, reporting in primetime from a wide variety of events with his signature enthusiasm and humor. 

Snoop was so visible during the Olympics that the BBC dubbed him “America's cheerleader.”

In addition to his new role with the FIFA World Cup, Snoop is also returning to “The Voice” for season 28 alongside fellow coaches Reba McEntire, Niall Horan, and Michael Bublé.

The coaches have already filmed Blind Auditions and Battle Rounds, and are due back at the studio to film the Knockout Rounds on August 28 and 29, according to ticketing manager 1iota. 

The new season is scheduled to premiere on September 22 with a two-hour Blind Auditions episod

In 2018, SOPHIE and Liz reunited to make a follow-up to their 2015 collaboration “When I Rule the World” at SOPHIE's Nichols Canyon home studio. That song, “Sunscreen,” did not immediately see the light of day, though it leaked on streaming platforms and occasionally popped up in DJ sets. Now, Liz is back, and she is releasing the finished song to mark her return. Below, watch the song's video, shot on the Greek island of Mykonos. James Orlando directed it, and co-designer Renata Raksha drew from an idea conceptualized with SOPHIE.

SOPHIE's brother, Benny Long, and vocal engineer Suzy Shinn worked with Liz to complete the track. The song is also getting a vinyl release. “Sunscreen” is the latest in a string of posthumous SOPHIE releases, the latest being the self-titled album released last year.

Liz wrote on social media, “After all the years of rips, leaks, lore, and speculation, SUNSCREEN is finally here. SOPHIE always wanted me to put this song out, and I'm so grateful to Benny and Emily Long for being the loving and classy individuals they are, and for trusting me with the vision for this release.”

She added, “And to SOPHIE… your brilliance, your spirit, your friendship—I carry all of it with me. Thank you for believing in me. You continue to shape me and so many others; your impact is eternal. SOPHIE FOREVER.”

Bruce Springsteen‘s unreleased song vault is a source of seemingly infinite wonders. Just two months after releasing seven shelved albums on Tracks II: The Lost Albums, Springsteen has gone back into the vault and emerged with the Born to Run outtake “Lonely Night in the Park” that he's sharing to celebrate the 50-year anniversary of the landmark LP.


	“Lonely Night In the Park” was recorded at New York's Record Plant across two days in May 1975, and came very close to appearing on Born to Run. Springsteen included it on several proposed Born to Run track sequences in his notebooks, and Jon Landau argued it should be on the album instead of “Meeting Across The River.”


	“I won my way on things,” former Springsteen manager/Born to Run co-producer Mike Appel told Backstreets in 1990. “When [Landau] and Bruce would say ‘Here's Lonely Night in the Park and Linda Let Me be the One.' They came in and they thought that was going to be a commercial song. And I won my way. I said ‘These are such dogs and the lyrics are so bad.' I said, just go away. I said these songs aren't staying on the record − over my dead body. I told him this stuff was ‘shit.' And nobody today would talk to him like that.”

	











	“Lonely Night In the Park” remained little more than a myth until SiriusXM's E Street Radio played the song in 2005, around the album's 30th anniversary. The credits for this new version include Steve Van Zandt and Ron Aniello on guitar, confirming there were recent overdubs on the original studio recording. (Van Zandt didn't join the E Street Band until the Born to Run tour, and Aniello didn't enter Springsteen's orbit until the 2000s.) But they stuck with Springsteen's vocal track from 1975.

	The 30th anniversary of Born to Run in 2005 was celebrated with a new box set and documentary. The plans are a little more muted for the 50th this year, but the Bruce Springsteen Archives & Center For American Music is holding a 50th anniversary symposium at Monmouth University's Pollak Theatre on September 6. According to the official website, the symposium will feature “panels, presentations, and interviews with members of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, as well as with journalists and historians, music industry legends, and special guests.”

	If all of this doesn't fulfill your Born to Run 50 needs, Peter Ames Carlin — author of the definitive Springsteen biography Bruce — has just released Tonight in Jungleland: The Making of Born to Run. It features new interviews with Springsteen, Landau, Appel, and members of the E Street Band. Check out an exclusive excerpt about the messy birth of “Jungleland” right here.

More than 20 years after the icon's death, Exceleration Music's John Burk is reissuing four classic Charles albums under his original Tangerine label.

	Steve Knopper



While producing what became Ray Charles‘ final album, Genius Loves Company, John Burk asked the soul music legend if he might re-sing a part. “No,” Charles said. “I ain't doing that.”


	Burk revisited the subject later, in a quiet moment at the studio, asking Charles to explain his reluctance. “It's about what I'm feeling, at that moment,” Charles replied. “That's what you want on the record.”


	Charles, of course, was right: Genius Loves Company, released after the singer, pianist and songwriter's death in 2004, went triple platinum and won the Grammy for album of the year. And Burk, a partner at Exceleration Music, remembered that conversation when preparing to reissue four albums from Charles' catalog of 60-plus releases earlier this year. The first, 1974's Come Live With Me, out today (Aug. 22), is what Burk calls a “heartbreak and sadness and loneliness album,” a gem that didn't make the Billboard 200. “It's one of the best examples of Ray truly expressing himself.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The album, Burk adds, is “ripe for discovery” and came out “when the marketplace was just so different than what he was doing. It didn't quite fit in certain charts and radio formats.”


	The four releases Burk has prepared are from Tangerine Records, Charles' longtime indie label, with which Exceleration partnered in 2021. An investment group formed by ex-execs from Concord Music Group, Merlin and others, Exceleration has spent the past five years investing in influential indie labels such as blues powerhouse Alligator Records, alt-country fixture Bloodshot Records and '90s-rock stalwarts Kill Rock Stars. After making a deal in 2021 with the Ray Charles Foundation, Exceleration rolled out reissues from the singer's vast catalog — the 90-track True Genius box set in honor of what would have been Charles' 90th birthday in 2020, then Charles' classic country albums such as Crying Time and the two volumes of Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music.


	Burk, one of five partners at Exceleration, says the upcoming Charles reissues — Ingredients In a Recipe for Soul is due Sept. 19, Love Country Style, Oct. 24, and No One Does It Like … Ray Charles, Nov. 21 — will be part of a long, gradual rollout of Charles' “massive catalog.” Although Rhino Records reissued much of Charles' catalog in the ‘90s with lavish CD packaging, Burk says, “There's a lot more to discover about Ray Charles than the public may know. A lot of this stuff's just not out.”


	Despite a long association with Atlantic Records, Charles spent much of his career as an indie artist, albeit funded by large corporations such as ABC and British Decca. Love Country Style, from 1970, is in the mode of Charles' 1962 masterpiece Modern Sounds In Country and Western Music and includes a bluesy cover of Johnny Cash‘s “Ring of Fire”; 1963's Ingredients In a Recipe for Soul, which hit No. 2 on the Billboard 200, opens with his classic version of Harlan Howard‘s “Busted”; and No One Does It Like … Ray Charles! is a new title compiling non-album singles from 1962-1965, including “No One” and “Something's Wrong.”


	Tangerine, named after Charles' favorite fruit, was not actually the original record company that released Come Live With Me — that album belonged to Charles' later label, Crossover, according to the singer's 1978 autobiography Brother Ray. The material on the other three reissues comes from ABC, which in the early '60s lured the singer from Atlantic Records, the label that made him famous. “Look,” he told ABC lawyers before signing, according to Michael Lydon‘s 1998 bio Ray Charles: Man and Music: “Since I'm producing my own music, I want to own my own masters.” Such a deal was unprecedented at the time, as labels have insisted on ownership of masters for decades. But ABC agreed — as long as the deal kicked in after five years.


	“He's just completely free and doing what he felt like doing,” Burk says about these recordings. “He built his own everything — his own record company, his own publishing company, his own management company, his own studio, his own tour bus, his own plane. He was completely independent.”


	Charles was with ABC from 1960 to 1973, and for the last five years of that deal, his music came out under the Tangerine-ABC label, according to Brother Ray, the autobiography written with David Ritz. He returned to Atlantic Records in 1977. “I loved Tangerine,” Charles said in Man and Music. “But to run a label, especially a small label, you have to keep your hands in it. I was spread too thin, but I wasn't about to give up my own music or going on the road. At least Tangerine didn't lose any money, and figuring in all I learned, I'd say we came out ahead.”

Zach Cregger's sleeper hit is the second notable win for the horror genre this year following Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners,' which is likewise an original story. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Who says lightning can't strike twice and on the same Hollywood studio lot?


	On Thursday, writer-director Zach Cregger‘s Weapons became the second original R-rated pic of the year to achieve the $100 million milestone domestically after Ryan Coogler's Sinners at a time when the overall genre has come under siege. And it's a triple win on the horror front for Warner Bros.' film empire, led by Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy. The. main studio made Sinners, while New Line is home of Weapons and the R-rated Final Destination: Bloodlines franchise reboot, which surprised many in scaring up more than $385 million at the early summer box office. Like Bloodlines, Weapons is no slouch overseas for an early worldwide tally of $170 million or thereabouts.

					The Summer Box Office Is Quickly Turning South		
			









Weapons achieved the $100 million North American milestone in its 14th day in release, compared to nine days for Sinners, which opened to $48 million in April. Thanks to winning over critics and audiences alike, director Cregger's buzzy movie came in more than $10 million ahead of expectations when winning the Aug. 8-10 weekend with a $43.5 million domestic opening.

	The script for the creepy R-rated pic was the subject of a heated bidding war when the package hit the market. New Line and Warners prevailed over rivals after plunking down $38 million, including a $10 million payday for Cregger to direct, write and produce after he made waves with his debut feature film, 2022's Barbarian, which he both wrote and directed. Sources say he commanded a $20 million fee for his deal to make Sony's next Resident Evil movie.

	











Weapons stars Julia Garner as a teacher who learns that 17 of the 18 children in her classroom simultaneously got out of bed and ran off into the night at the exact same time, 2:17 a.m. Josh Brolin plays a grieving father who is intent on finding his missing child and is suspicious that the young teacher had something to do with it. Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams and Amy Madigan also star in Weapons, which has quite the twist. (Madigan's performance as the ghoulish and creepy Aunt Gladys is already sparking awards chatter.)


	Yet there's another reason to be on the lookout for the unforgettable character. Multiple sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that Warner Bros. and New Line are already talking with Cregger about making a prequel exploring the origin story of the strange aunt who suddenly arrives in town.


	One of Weapons' conceits is its chapter structure centering on particular characters, and sources say that Cregger actually had a chapter focused on Gladys and some of her backstory. He ultimately pulled that section from the script for length purposes. Now with the movie's wild success, that lost chapter would be expanded into a full-length story. Sources say no deals have been made, nor is there any timeline.


	That's partly because Cregger is already in prep on his next feature — he wasn't even in town for the opening of Weapons, as he was in Prague in pre-production on Resident Evil.


Weapons landed an impressive 96 percent critics' score on Rotten Tomatoes and an A- CinemaScore from audiences, an almost unheard of grade for a horror pic. Exceptions include Jordan Peele's seminal horror pic Get Out, which also earned an A- and made Peele one of the most sought-after directors overnight.

	











	Rival studios add that Warners' marketing campaign for Weapons was nothing short of brilliant, considering it didn't want to ruin the surprise and exploit the twist in marketing materials. It also got a coveted two-week berth in coveted Imax auditoriums. All told, Imax and other premium large-format screens turned in a huge 34 percent of the opening weekend gross.


	Heading into its opening this spring, Sinners had the advantage of being shepherded by Coogler, one of Hollywood's most proven directors and the filmmaker behind the Black Panther and Creed franchises. The pic also reunited him with his go-star, Michael B. Jordan. 


Sinners has grossed north of $278 domestically to become the first original movie since Disney's Coco in 2017 to earn north of $200 million in North America. And it has narrowly bested Jaws — not adjusted for inflation — to rank as the top-grossing R-rated horror film ever domestically, although its worldwide tally of $366 million puts it well behind Jaws' global cume of $477 million.


Weapons was the seventh Warner Bros. release of the year to open in first place, an unrivaled feat, as well as its sixth title in a row to open to more than $40 million domestically, also an unrivaled record. The studio is also getting ready to celebrate DC Studios' and James Gunn's Superman crossing the $600 million milestone on Friday, while F1: The Movie, released in partnership with Apple Original Films, should zoom past $600 million over the weekend.

	In addition to the original eight-track LP remastered from the original 1/4″ master tapes, the refresh will also feature a number of previously unreleased outtakes and rarities, including Smith's 1975 RCA audition tape. In addition to such favorites as “Gloria,” “Redondo Beach,” “Birdland” and the multi-part “Land,” the re-release will feature the previously unreleased songs, including the skittering, frenetic jazz rocker “Snowball,” “Birdland (alternate take),” “Distant Fingers,” “The Hunter Gets Captured By the Game” and “We Three.”

	Smith is in peak form on “Snowball,” featuring spiky guitar work from her longtime musical consigliere guitarist and co-writer Lenny Kaye and the urgent lyrics, “When it hits me I'm so amazed/ When it hits me I'm feeling crazed/ When it hits me I start to recall/ Memories flooding like a snowball running down a hill.”

	The anniversary edition will also feature RCA demos of the thrilling “Gloria” and “Redondo Beach,” as well as alternate takes on “Kimberly” and “Break It Up.” The album peaked at No. 47 on the Billboard 200 in February 1976. It was inducted into the National Recording Registry in 2009 and the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2021.

	











	In addition, on Nov. 4, Smith will publish her long-awaited memoir Bread of Angels, which is described by publisher Random House Publishing as the singer's, “most intimate and visionary work.” In it, Smith delves into her post-WWII childhood in working class Philadelphia and South Jersey, as well her teenage years, “when the first glimmers of art and romance take hold, her rise as punk rock icon to her retreat from public life when she meets her one true love and starts a family on the shores of Lake Saint Clair, Michigan.”


	The book, which also covers Smith's marriage to late MC5 guitarist Fred “Sonic” Smith — its release date is timed to fall on the anniversary of Smith's 1994 passing — is a look at the pivotal early years when, “Arthur Rimbaud and Bob Dylan emerge as creative role models as she begins to write poetry then lyrics, ultimately merging both into the songs of iconic recordings such as Horses, Wave, and Easter.”


	The 288-page book is the follow-up to Smith's National Book Award-winning 2010 memoir Just Kids documenting her relationship with artist/photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, as well as her acclaimed 2015 follow-up, M Train.


	Smith will embark on a world tour celebrating the Horses anniversary  this fall, kicking off a European run on Oct. 6 in Dublin, Ireland at 3Arena before moving to North American shores starting on Nov. 10 at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle. The tour is currently slated to run through a Nov. 29 show at the Met in Philadelphia. She will be joined on the tour by Kaye and another longtime band member, drummer Jay Dee Daugherty, who both played on Horses.

	Away From Home, the traveling festival curated by Louis Tomlinson, will make its U.S. debut this October with a two-day takeover of Cooperstown, N.Y.


	Tomlinson will top the festival bill along with pop singer-songwriter Lauv and mega-producer Steve Aoki, who is billed as a “special guest.” Other performers include Plain White T's, Daya, Circa Waves and Pale Waves, with Abbie McCarthy as the resident DJ for the weekend.

“I'm so excited to be bringing Away From Home to the U.S., and for the first time, a two-day festival!” Tomlinson said in a statement. “Really honored and grateful to have such a strong lineup over both days, got a few things up my sleeve too. Can't wait to see you all there — it's going to be special!”


	Away From Home will be held on Oct. 4 and 5 at the Brewery Ommegang in Cooperstown. Pre-sale tickets will be available on Aug. 26 at 10 a.m. ET, and general onsale starts on Aug. 28 at 10 a.m. ET. Full details for the festival can be found at its official website.

	Tomlinson launched Away From Home in London in 2021 as a means of celebrating the return of live music following the pandemic shutdown. Since then, the festival has traveled to Malaga, Spain, in 2022; Camaiore, Italy, in 2023; and Mérida, Mexico, last year, with artists including The Cribs, DMA's, Hinds, and The Vaccines among the artists who have performed at the festival.

	











	Since One Direction's final album in 2015, Tomlinson has released two full-lengths — 2020's Walls and 2022's Faith in the Future. Walls scored a No. 9 peak on the Billboard 200, while Faith in the Future did even better, reaching No. 5 on the albums chart three years ago. In May, Tomlinson shared photos of himself in the studio, presumably working on new music, to his 19 million Instagram followers.

In June, Brian Eno and Beatie Wolfe released a pair of collaborative albums, Lateral and Luminal, and they've now announced a third. An 11-song project called Liminal is out October 10 via Verve. Below, listen to the first two singles, “The Last to Know” and “Ringing Ocean.”

“﻿Liminal stands at the point of convergence between Lateral and Luminal,” Eno and Wolfe said in a statement. “If Lateral is a kind of landscape painting, a sonic place, Luminal is a dreamlike awakening, a feeling space. Liminal, the newest addition, is a hybrid of the two, a strange new land with a human living and feeling its way through its mysterious spaces.”

The artists continued, “Liminal is set in the borderlands between song and non-song (or ‘nong' as we call it), where the listener is exploring an intimate and unfamiliar new sonic world, as yet unclaimed, and still ambiguous.”

Tina Fey has passed on some advice to the Sky team behind Saturday Night Live UK.


	The 30 Rock star said the “dirty secret” of the NBC version of the show is that its infamous all-night writing marathons are not always necessary.


SNL writers traditionally pen sketches late into the night on a Tuesday before table reads on a Wednesday with the cast and guest presenter.


	“Here's a dirty secret: you don't have to do it that way,” Fey told the Edinburgh TV Festival, marking her first-ever visit to Scotland. “You could start in the morning.”

	During a conversation with Graham Norton reflecting on her career, Fey said it was “intimidating” joining SNL as a writer in 1997 and that the show “was still pretty male” at the time. She grew up watching the comedy and entered a “well-oiled machine.”

	Her comments come as Sky ramps up preparations for Saturday Night Live UK ahead of its launch next year in partnership with Lorne Michaels' Broadway Video.


	Talent scouts have been in Edinburgh watching comedy shows, while The Late Late Show With James Corden producer James Longman has been confirmed as showrunner (as first tipped by Deadline).


	Earlier in the week, Phil Edgar-Jones, Sky's executive director of unscripted originals, said he wanted the remake of NBC's iconic sketch show to bring “chaos” and “noise” to the screen.


	“It's exciting, a little bit scary as well,” he said. Edgar-Jones said the show will be true to the American original but “has to be a very British thing” if it is going to resonate with audiences in the UK.

In a year that's proven a bit soft at the box office, the biggest story (and just plain biggest film, period) is the monstrous power of “Ne Zha 2,” a Chinese CGI animated feature that, during its theatrical release in January, utterly annihilated the likes of “Fantastic Four,” “Superman,” and even “A Minecraft Movie” to become the highest global earning film this year. The competition isn't tight, either: with $2.2 billion grossed so far, it has an absurd $1.2 billion lead over “Lilo & Stitch” and is the fifth highest-earning movie ever, no qualifications needed.

 










“Ne Zha 2” isn't the first Chinese film to challenge Hollywood productions in terms of success, with the country having established itself as a highly important market for global productions. But its sheer impact still heavily outpaces any other Chinese film ever made. By comparison, the second-highest-grossing Chinese film of all-time is 2021's “The Battle at Lake Changjin,” which “only” grossed a lowly $913 million. Even more impressive is “Ne Zha 2” managed to make all that money with barely any help from North American markets: the movie received a limited eight-week U.S. release by CMC Pictures in February, where — per Box Office Mojo — it managed around $20 million.

Which is where A24 comes in. With U.S. audiences still largely ignorant of what exactly “Ne Zha” is, the indie distributor acquired the rights to the film and gave it a glossy English dub for a second introduction to the market, complete with an IMAX rollout to better appreciate the film's stunningly detailed backdrops and fight scenes.

What unsuspecting viewers will find at the theater is a film that's not really anything like the animated films Hollywood produces: glossy and operatic in its scale, “Ne Zha 2” has a mammoth 150-minute running time that's longer than expected for the average kids' attention span (or the average attention span of a TikTok-rotted adult brain, to be frank). But in its emotional viewpoint and its streak of gleeful potty humor, “Ne Zha 2” is also quite blatantly a movie for children. The closest comparison to make isn't Pixar's “Elio” or Disney's “Zootopia,” but the world of battle Shonen anime like “Dragon Ball Z” or “Naruto,” long shows characterized by excitable teen boys engaging in nonstop, over-the-top brawls with their own specialized power sets.

Like many products of this genre, “Ne Zha 2” can occasionally veer on the numbing, its barrage of setpieces blending in together into one amorphous blob. But at the same time, you can't help but admire the sheer scale of the canvas director Yang Yu (alternatively credited as Jiaozi) uses to paint, and the often jaw-dropping artistry and detail of the animation speaks for itself.

 










As its title makes clear, “Ne Zha 2” is a sequel, and anyone who hasn't taken the time to study up on the original 2019 “Ne Zha” is going to inevitably be a bit confused by this one, which starts with a very brief recap of the first movie, but nonetheless plunges the audience directly into this fantasy version of China with little context or effort to handhold. For American audiences this will inevitably jar, given how much the characters and story takes inspiration from the 16th-century novel “Investiture of the Gods” and various mythological and folk figures from Chinese history. After an opening that starts immediately after the first film introducing the titular Ne Zha and his best friend Ao Bing as spirits whose bodies need to be rebirthed, followed by a massive war sequence between characters just introduced, you would not be forgiven for getting a headache trying to keep up.

Once the movie slows down, the uninformed are able to ease more readily into the plot of the film. The first movie covered the story of how Ne Zha — a foul-mouthed, raccoon-eyed, rebellious youth who was born to demon hunters as the feared reincarnation of a demon orb — befriended the serene, properly mannered Ao Bing. In “Ne Zha 2,” master Taiyi Zhenren recreates their bodies, only for Ao Bing to lose his body in an attack from the dragons — led by the main villain, the sniveling but sympathetic Shen Gongbao — who mistakenly attack their hometown under the belief he is dead. With Ao Bing's spirit now in Ne Zha's body, the two manage a truce with dragons to venture to the land of the heavenly Chan sect and complete three tasks that will grant them immortality and restore Ao Bing's body.

 










That journey to and through the divine world is long, and a plot synopsis in a review can't really capture all of the characters and moving parts to this tale. There's just too much of it. At 2 hours and 24 minutes, the movie sags in pacing, with a protracted first act to get to the real meat of things that could use a serious edit, jokes that linger a second too long, and fight scenes that drag to the point that you sometimes lose the emotional stakes of the story. The sheer amount of toilet humor — there's a lot of mucus, snot, and jokes about people drinking piss stuffed into one film — often proves more annoying than fun.

Luckily, things click into place when Ne Zha begins his trials, and the tension between using Ao Bing's greater power to win and remaining true to his own misfit self begins to wear at him. It's also the point in which the often bratty, off-putting character clicks into place, and his simple desire to be accepted and prove his worth emerges as the real emotional heart of the story. The other characters emerge as complex figures rather than stock archtypes, as the Chan sect holds obvious secrets and biases towards demons while Shen Gongbao's hidden soft side comes to light.

Most importantly, the trials gives “Ne Zha 2” a framework to showcase some of the most impressive and vibrant 3D animation that has been seen on film in quite some time. The product of roughly 138 Chinese companies and around 4,000 individual animators, “Ne Zha 2” looks vibrant and alive in every frame, striking an unusual balance between anime-inspired exaggeration and realism that works shockingly well in practice. The environments — from the white jade walls of the Chan sect palace to the dusty town of talking bandit moles that Ne Zha begins his trials in to the rushing waterfall where he fights a shapeshifting water demon — are astonishingly ornate and detailed, while the characters that inhabit them are creatively imagined and varied, from cartoonish old fat men to dragons with scales that shine like they're truly alive. 

 










Then there's the action, which melds influences from anime, wuxia, and good old-fashioned “Looney Tune” pratfalls to create some jaw-dropping setpieces that zig and zag in new directions; you never know how a brawl will resolve or what a character will do next, and that unpredictability allows for real exhilaration. The climax, an operatic conflict that manages to successfully merge emotion with spectacle in a way the rest of the film sometimes struggles with, is a particular feat. In one stunning shot, two hordes of warriors on rival sides of a conflict are seen from afar, like two waves crashing into each other. And yet, the detail, attention, and artistry of every pixel in frame is very evidently displayed. In many respects, watching “Ne Zha 2” feels akin to viewing the “Avatar” films, as the film provides a visual experience that's the absolute peak of what its medium is capable of.

It also benefits from a solid dubbing effort that gratifyingly features a mostly Asian cast and a absence of stunty A-list gets. The sole exception is Michelle Yeoh, who's appropriately warm and heartbreaking as the title character's mother Lady Yin. The rest of the cast is mostly unknowns or professional voice actors, including Crystal Lee and Aleks Le, a winning double act as Ne Zha and Ao Bing. Occasionally, the dialogue doesn't quite match up with the character's mouth flaps, but it's a minor distraction in a mostly seamless experience. 

 










All dubbing inevitably invites a debate over whether or not it's necessary or if English speakers should learn to appreciate subtitles, but “Ne Zha 2” has a good case for why it's necessary. When a movie is as stuffed with detail and action as this, better to make sure the audience has their eyes on the whole screen rather than just a tiny third of it.

A24‘s “Ne Zha 2” is currently playing in theaters.

It's 2004, and Avi Schwooper (Ben Feldman) is flying home for his little brother's bar mitzvah. Sitting next to him — on an era-appropriate plane with adequate legroom and extra seats filled by casually strewn bags and coats — is his girlfriend, Jen (Angelique Cabral), cradling a CD player in her lap, half-listening to Paul Simon's “The Obvious Child” and half-listening to Avi explain why the song is so good. 

“‘Sonny gets married and moves away'?,” Avi exclaims, quoting the lyrics. “He was just born! How did he– It's because that's time. One moment you're young, you're free. The next moment, Sonny gets married and moves away.”

It's 2022, and Avi Schwooper is sitting in his car, alone. The brown, bouncy curls once atop his head have tumbled down above his ears, leaving just a few strays to crown his suddenly expansive forehead. Jen is nowhere to be seen, but the song she was listening to on the plane is playing on the radio. Does Avi remember their conversation from 18 years prior? Does he recognize the lyric's intention has come to life — his life? Does he feel the same excitement over Simon's song now as he did then? 

 










It's hard to say, given the image lasts a few fleeting seconds, but the poignancy evoked is powerful. Even though Avi's expression is somewhat inscrutable, its dour contrast to his past exuberance is enough to make you reach for the tissues. Whether his life panned out as planned, whether he's still with Jen or once again on his way to see his family, there's a pronounced regret present in Avi's aging; in his abrupt transformation from bright-eyed twenty-something to a silent, solitary forty-something; in the inevitable passage of time, wrought upon Avi as it is wrought upon us all.

Such a reaction, brought about so quickly, would be easier to explain away if Avi's life was definitively a tragedy. Nobody wants to get old, get divorced, or get bald. That's sad! But “Long Story Short” brilliantly and repeatedly embraces the idea that the tragedy isn't found in life's disappointments; it's found in the fact that when it comes to life within a loving family, it will never feel like enough. What you get is largely beyond your control, and you'll always end up wanting more.

The same can already be said about the series itself. Raphael Bob-Waksberg's 10-episode first season is an immensely moving, blisteringly funny temporal travelogue. “Long Story Short” follows the Schwooper siblings across three decades, bouncing back and forth between childhood lodestars and adult crossroads, alongside their parents and partners, friends and enemies, children and one prominent uncle named Barry. The individual episodes engross you in an enchanting mix of absurd situational humor and customary family crises, with each nestled closely next to poignant reminders of time's passing. 

 










It's a savvy, almost inevitable structure for Bob-Waksberg to embrace, who's always loved classic TV sitcoms and long marveled at the tricky nature of time. Be it his landmark Netflix original series “BoJack Horseman” — which often mined BoJack's thorny past for clues to his present tumult, never better than in the Season 4 episode, “Time's Arrow” — or the time-bending magic trick that was “Undone,” the writer keenly identifies the power of accumulated experiences, especially as it applies to TV.

Why do people endlessly rewatch “Friends” and “The Office” if not to exist in a frozen stretch of pure joy? And why do those silly comedies carry such intimate significance for us if not for how long we've spent with them in our living rooms, season after season, year after year? Time is one of television's unique advantages as a medium, just as animation is an ideal medium for depicting temporal shifts without distracting makeup or CGI. 

Rather than mine nostalgia by resurrecting the past (as Hollywood loves to do these days), “Long Story Short” starts from scratch, building connections by telling a story uniquely unburdened by answering the question, “What happens next?” so much as it's doubly invested in the significance of each and every happening, minor and major, even the goofy ones — especially the goofy ones. 

 










For instance, in between Avi's 2004 plane ride that starts the episode's main arc and its last-second flash-forward to 2022, the premiere revels in the rapid wordplay of a gentile girlfriend meeting a vibrant Jewish family and the general tomfoolery of a jubilant bar mitzvah. Jen tries to make a good impression with Avi's mom, Naomi (Lisa Edelstein), by bringing her a vase, but all the put-upon mom can see is another thing for her to do. (“My parents taught me to never show up empty-handed,” Jen says. “So you show up empty-vased!,” Naomi quips back.) Elliot (Paul Reiser) is well-meaning and kind, but he's completely bowled over by his wife, and thus unable to offer the overwhelmed Jen any shelter.

Avi doesn't fare much better. The chaos of the Schwooper household is normal to him, and he quickly falls into familiar patterns: bickering with his younger sister, Shira (Abbi Jacobson); ignoring his wacky baby bro, Yoshi (the bar mitzvah boy); and letting his mother alternate between fawning over her beloved son and making him feel guilty for, well, everything.

But “Long Story Short” isn't beholden to any one perspective. Subsequent episodes are positioned behind Shira, as she tries to start a family with her wife, Kendra (Nicole Byer), or maniacally preps for a school pot luck. Other entries center Yoshi (and thus Greenfield's jaunty, vulnerable vocal performance), as he goes on a spontaneous first date across San Francisco or has to hide a sizable secret from his entire family. Each half-hour episode starts with a scene from childhood that frames the events to come, the bulk of which take place when the kids are at various stages of adulthood. 

 










There's a twist to the formula here and there, like when we get a brief glimpse of Naomi's upbringing to better contextualize her own parenting style, and future seasons could benefit from a bolder, less chronological approach to time's odd little loops and pivots. But as a foundation, the first season tills fertile ground with rich initial results. The cast is excellent, with Greenfield and Edelstein as stand-outs (and Reiser an exciting, underutilized option for Season 2). The humor is clever and sharp, with a half-dozen jokes per half-hour guaranteed to elicit a chuckle or more. (Just wait for the Gary Oldman line in Episode 5.)

And the animation, designed by “BoJack” producer and “Tuca & Bertie” creator Lisa Hanawalt, is an adventure all its own: Big, block colors and blurred background characters put extra emphasis on the leads and their chosen priorities, but a treasure trove of subtle jokes and telling details lie tucked away behind those focal points. (There's a “Rats” play poster, a la “Cats,” that feels ripped straight from Princess Carolyn's office.) The lighting and movement, framing and staging, all keenly evoke memories. Sometimes you're straining to put all the details in place, sometimes you're enmeshed in a fully-realized flashback. But no matter what, it's easy to get swept away. 

 










In “Long Story Short's” first scene, it's 1996 and the family is driving home from Naomi's mom's funeral. Avi tries to comfort his grieving (read: irritable) mother by saying at least his grandmother and grandfather are together again in Heaven. But Naomi isn't hearing it. “Jews don't believe in Heaven,” she says. “For Jews, we focus on this life,” Elliot says, eager to comfort his kids without lying to them. “You don't lead a good, meaningful life for some reward later. You lead a good, meaningful life so that you… lead a good meaningful life.”

Watching the series, it's easy to appreciate the value of a good and meaningful life. By the time the finale circles back to 2022, expanding on Avi's reflective moment in the car, it feels like you've known the Schwoopers forever, yet can't get enough. It doesn't matter if he's still married or long divorced, if he's on his way to see his family or about to move away. You want him to be happy, of course, but what you really want, knowing where that happiness stems from, is a little more time. 

“Long Story Short” premieres Friday, August 22 on Netflix. All episodes will be released at once. Season 2 has already been renewed.

It's the followup to her 2023 collection "Bewitched," winner of the Grammy Award and a top 20 hit on the Billboard 200.

	Head's up, it's Laufey time.


	The Icelandic-Chinese talent returns with A Matter of Time (via Vingolf Recordings / AWAL), the followup to her 2023 collection Bewitched, winner of the Grammy Award for best traditional pop vocal album and a top 20 hit on the Billboard 200.


	For A Matter of Time, Laufey (pronounced lay-vay) tapped a pair of co-producers. Returning to the fold was Spencer Stewart, who worked with Laufey on her first two albums, while Aaron Dessner (Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran) collaborated with the contemporary jazz star for the first time.

	Led by the singles “Silver Lining” and “Tough Luck,” A Matter of Time is a dreamy meditation, hugged with Laufey's jazz hands.

	“I'm constantly thinking about classical and jazz, how to properly preserve them and pay homage. For this album,” she explains, “I just wanted to let my heart wander.”




			Trending on Billboard		







A Matter of Time, like 2022's Everything I Know About Love and Bewitched is “for me is a blank book of stories to write,” she explains.


	In support of the new collection, Laufey took over the Grammy Museum's Ray Charles Terrace in downtown Los Angeles this week for Drop: Laufey – A Benefit Program, a presentation that blended new music, candid storytelling, and a touch of star power, as Selena Gomez watched on.


	Laufey Land, as she calls it, captured the imagination of the music business. Sources told Billboard that she sparked a multimillion-dollar bidding war in 2023 among record labels that have rarely seen so much commercial potential in a jazz-adjacent act. She went on to sign a global label deal with AWAL that allowed her to retain ownership of her work.

	











	Raised between Iceland and the Washington, D.C., area, Laufey (full name Laufey Lín Jónsdóttir) grew up surrounded by classical musicians, and counts Chopin, Liszt, Baker, Fitzgerald, and Holiday among her influences.


	As her story grew, Laufey was named in Forbes' 30 Under 30 list, was one of TIME's 2025 Women of the Year, she has sold out the Hollywood Bowl, Radio City Music Hall, and London's Royal Albert Hall; performed backed by the LA Phil, the National Symphony Orchestra, and the China Philharmonic Orchestra and is behind The Laufey Foundation, which has the primary mission of supporting young musicians with the resources they need, especially through youth orchestras, to reach their full potential.

It's fitting that Peacemaker season two should focus on alternate realities and new beginnings, as change has come to define the DC Universe since we last enjoyed the sordid exploits of Christopher Smith (John Cena). Hell, even the streaming platform where our favorite antihero hangs his chromed helmet has rebranded in the interim. (Welcome back, HBO Max.) As the third installment in a revitalized DCU under the stewardship of series creator James Gunn, building on the momentum of Superman and last winter's Creature Commandos, Peacemaker returns energized by positive creative shifts and the new dramatic possibilities of its reality-hopping premise—plus, it still packs the chaotic punch that made its first season such a riot to watch.

For all the delays, it's comforting, and a little miraculous, that Peacemaker still rocks as thoroughly as it does. Story-wise, the fallout from last season's astonishingly violent Butterfly invasion sets a mood best described—at least in this week's premiere—as “gloomy.” Chris, along with his best buddy Eagly (a chirpy digital triumph voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), has relocated from that flag-festooned trailer from season one into his father's house, which he inherited after he killed Auggie Smith (Robert Patrick), the racist supervillain known as the White Dragon. This home is less a place for closure and one for tearing open old wounds, a dwelling where Chris can confront the regret and abuse that have since calcified into his toxic antihero persona, The Peacemaker. 

The gloom spreads to the surviving members of the “11th Street Kids.” Adebayo (Danielle Brooks), last season's reluctant sleeper agent, has embraced a new badass persona at the expense of domestic stability: Estranged from her wife (Elizabeth Ludlow) and now a private security consultant, Adebayo has found her swagger by losing the one person who anchored her. “I'm the hardcore shit now—that's what I do,” she says, awkwardly jamming out to Hanoi Rocks' “Don't You Ever Leave Me” in her beige-colored sedan and holding court in a filthy motel room, or “the worst level of Grand Theft Auto,” as Economos (Steve Agee) later puts it. Adebayo has evolved into a full-on Midwestern rocker washout, an unexpected turn for her character that Brooks manages to render both adorable and sad. 

Harcourt's (Jennifer Holland) life update is grimmer. She blames Adebayo's whistleblowing on Task Force X and her mother, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), for collapsing her career. “You suffer from a particularly severe form of toxic masculinity,” is her psychotherapist's diagnosis for this mid-life L, which Harcourt denies throughout the episode, bloodily taking her angst out on her car dashboard and a pack of barroom goons alike. The question lingers: Is Waller secretly blackballing her ability to get a job in the government? The “nos” piling up from the alphabet soup of U.S. agencies seems to suggest it, but maybe her shrink is onto something. Harcourt's inability to connect puts up some insurmountable barriers of their own. Take her and Chris's inevitable hookup after last season's victory (off-screen, on a party boat): Was this just an adrenaline-sating fling, or the beginning of something more? Why are Chris and Harcourt left to suffer their failures alone when the obvious path to happiness (or something resembling it) is staring in each other's faces? 

While Harcourt stalls out, Chris spots a chance to move up in the DCU, with Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn) inviting Peacemaker to audition for the Justice Gang. “I don't want to be a joke anymore,” he tells Adebayo as she drops him off. “This is all I've ever wanted, y'know? To be a real hero.” Fate, however, proves a harsh mistress: His interview—observed by an indifferent Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced) and a mocking Green Lantern (Nathan Fillion)—goes about as well as you'd expect. It's hostile, degrading, and, once his body count (of both kinds) is questioned, demoralizing. “I don't want to be ruled by past experiences and anger” is his sincere confession, reduced to background noise amid fratty banter about asses and Hawkgirl's new carb-light popcorn diet. Chris goes home, defeated. 

This crescendo of failure erupts into the premiere's set piece: an orgy set in Auggie's living room, where breasts, butts, and swinging dongs flail about as Chris puts copious amounts of powder in his nose, a pity party for one in a sea of willing flesh. (Is this Gunn's sneering response to The Boys‘ Herogasm?) Despite his emotional isolation, Chris isn't completely alone: Economos surveys his home—between quizzing Vigilante (Freddy Stroma) on all things owls, natch—on behalf of Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo), father to Rick Jr. (Joel Kinnaman), who was killed by Peacemaker way back in The Suicide Squad. Flag's ascension to director of A.R.G.U.S. is an unexpected development following Adebayo's whistleblowing; he can now abuse the unit's resources to spy on his hated enemy, waiting for Chris to make one wrong move so Flag can cut loose with a long-gestating vengeance. 

As a second-season premiere for a rowdy superhero series, “The Ties That Grind” is a surprisingly lachrymose and tidy table-setter. Gunn indulges his usual shaggy-dog digressions—the Justice Gang sequence overstays its welcome—but the episode's function is primarily restorative, gathering its scattered, damaged cast and resituating them before the dramatic weight of Chris's reality-shifting discovery at the end of the episode detonates all over the place. For now, signs of Gunn's larger narrative architecture hum faintly at the edges: Cleavis Thornwaite (Michael Ian Black in Tucker Carlson mode) blares paranoia about breakouts at Belle Reve and Arkham Asylum (cameos forthcoming?), and we discover that Chris' interdimensional arsenal shares energy signatures with the pocket dimension Lex Luthor (Nicolas Hoult) used to rip Metropolis a new one during Superman. 

Parallel universes are narrative devices that literalize regret and rely almost entirely on easy gimmicks, like dramatic what-ifs, strange new character skins, and inverted pop-culture references. (The amount of hair metal discrepancies in Chris's parallel-Earth bedroom is fodder enough for its own article.) What will matter this season, not just for Chris but the series around him, is what Gunn mines from this premise, how he manages to poignantly explore the ache of what could have been while also carving out an R-rated alcove for his tawdry, Troma-tinted tendencies. Look at Cena's face as he crosses the cosmic threshold for a drink with his alternate-dad—lucid and free of hate—and his living older brother, Keith (David Denman). More than simply presenting the disparity of two lives, one with love and one without, this moment demonstrates reality's many injustices, where personal choices yield cruel, unbending consequences that reverberate across generations. Not too bad for a show that presented us an engorged dick just moments earlier.

Across his DC tenure, John Cena has nurtured Chris Smith from cartoon thug to a character defined by his hangdog, Keatonesque features, a maudlin bruiser whose granite-sculpted mug reveals vulnerability that transcends Peacemaker‘s rock-‘n'-roll bravado. The closing shot of Chris cradling his interdimensional doppelgänger's corpse, an awesome if existentially terrifying sci-fi beat, asks impossible questions of an unknowable future. Cena sells the moment. What kind of man was this? What might have been had love and stability been possible for Peacemaker? 

Cena weaves this speculative ache throughout the premiere. Chris is a man white-knuckling his way to decency, still undone by substances and sex, still haunted by the shadow of Rick Flag and his hate-saturated father. Yet the counter image of the man he could have been suggests new (and possibly shortsighted) possibilities for him. In this sense, Peacemaker has landed on its richest terrain yet. The DCU at large is still cooling after its seismic reset, experimenting with tone and grasping for coherence. Gunn doesn't stabilize things through grandeur; instead, he zeroes in on the smaller, more scalable intimacies of arrested development, thwarted love, the paths never taken—the elements that make growth possible. Its violence is still nuts, its humor still juvenile, but beneath this second season of Peacemaker beats a wiser, more chastened heart.

Anthony Geary is paying tribute to the life and legacy of his beloved “General Hospital” co-star and friend Tristan Rogers. The actor, best known for his role as Luke Spencer, reflected with deep emotion after learning Rogers had died on August 15 at the age of 79.

Geary, 78, told TV Insider that news of Rogers' death left him “depressed,” but filled with gratitude for their time together. “I have great memories of him and always will,” Geary said. “I've always thought Tristan was a good actor, a very giving actor, and fun to work with.”

He added, “Working with him was an experience that I could always rely on to be funny, exciting, challenging, and infuriating — a perfect day's work.”

Geary first joined “General Hospital” in 1978, with Rogers arriving two years later in 1980. Their characters, Luke Spencer and Robert Scorpio, quickly became fan favorites as their storylines intertwined in thrilling adventures.

“Tristan was an enigma — comfortable enough to create a man of mystery,” Geary recalled. “The fun thing about working with Tristan is that he was unpredictable, always good for throwing in a surprise or taking a scene in his own direction. I always liked that.”

Though their characters faced plenty of drama, Geary said their on-screen relationship was built on a deep bond. “We didn't challenge Luke and Robert's relationship. It was a classic relationship with a couple ne'er-do-wells, who knew the worst about each other, but for the most part, remained friends anyway.”

Rogers' longtime manager, Meryl Soodak, confirmed his death and praised his contributions to the soap. “He loved being Scorpio, and he created that role from nothing,” Soodak told ABC 7 Eyewitness News. “He was supposed to work a day and he ended up making it into something huge. He was just a genuinely loyal, kind human being and he loved his family.”

“General Hospital” executive producer Frank Valentini also released a statement, calling the cast and crew “heartbroken.” He added, “Tristan has captivated our fans for 45 years and Port Charles will not be the same without him (or Robert Scorpio). Tristan was a one-of-a-kind talent and will be greatly missed.”

Rogers' on-screen family also paid their respects. His TV wife, Finola Hughes, and TV daughter, Kimberly McCullough, shared emotional tributes online.

“Wish I could play one more scene with you, my friend,” Hughes wrote. “Serious about his work, but always a rebel. His own man, navigating the system, he protected me, protected Kimberly [McCullough], his character, his friends. God, he was a good one. Silly, funny, kind, serious.”

McCullough echoed the sentiment, calling Rogers a devoted costar who cared deeply for those around him.

Pop star Meghan Trainor is no longer “All About That Bass,” happily showcasing her fit physique and impressive strength in a new social media video on August 21, 2025. But many fans say Trainor, a season 22 advisor on “American Idol” who was very vocal about wanting to be the show's next judge after Katy Perry's departure, is nearly unrecognizable in her new post. 

Less than an hour after Trainor's post, hundreds had already liked one Instagram comment that said, “Wait that's Megan trainor? 😮” while others defended the singer, flooding her with compliments over her new look. 

In March, Trainor opened up about her weight loss journey, which has included “huge lifestyle changes,” from intense workouts to using the weight loss tool Mounjaro, telling People, “I have never been more comfortable in my body.”

A post shared by Meghan Trainor (@meghantrainor)

Trainor's August 21 video featured her take on the viral Nicki Minaj Challenge trend, which dares people to defy gravity by balancing on one foot, in a seated position, on top of random objects, per Today.com. Trainor was filmed in a workout room, calmly balancing on top of two dumbbells that had been flipped on their sides and stacked on top of each other. 

The singer quipped in her caption, “never again #nickiminajchallenge”

Trainor's post was instantly flooded with comments from followers. But the majority of the comments weren't about her impressive balancing act but, rather, about her transformed physique and face. 

“I didn't recognize you,” one person wrote, and another comment — liked by hundreds of followers — said, “Wow why does she look like a different person. This is not her”

One fan noted that Trainor looked more like Ariana Grande than herself, and another complained, “You are starting to look like everything you were once singing against. So much for self lov”e and empowerment…”

But Trainor was deluged with compliments, too, including one that said, “MOTHERRRRR YOU LOOK GORGEOUS 🥹🔥”

Someone else deemed Trainor the “prettiest girl on planet,” while another fan declared, “mama you look AMAZING 😍😍”

The comments from fans won't likely faze Trainor, who's been an open book about the tools she's used to change her look in ways that boost her confidence. 

“No, I don't look like I did 10 years ago,” she wrote on Instagram in May. “I've been on a journey to be the healthiest, strongest version of myself for my kids and for me.”

Trainor, who shares two young sons with her husband Daryl Sabara, wrote after being honored at Billboard's Women in Music event, that “it's a little disheartening that so many of the questions (and comments) were focused on my body instead of my music, my passion, or the decade of hard work that got me here. This is what it's like to be a woman in the music industry.”

Trainor went on to say, “I've worked with a dietician, made huge lifestyle changes, started exercising with a trainer, and yes, I used science and support (shoutout to Mounjaro!) to help me after my 2nd pregnancy. And I'm so glad I did because I feel great.”

“Here's to celebrating talent, growth, and the power of putting yourself first,” she concluded. “Let's keep shifting the convo to what REALLY matters.”

HBO's True Detective franchise has always prided itself on bringing in big-name talent to flesh out its various highly flawed crime solvers, with a frankly ludicrous number of current and future Oscar nominees and winners cycling through its anthology show seasons. Now the series is reportedly in pursuit of one of the biggest oddball movie stars of them all, as Variety reports that Nicolas Cage is in talks to star in a fifth season of the series.

Said season rests in the hands of Issa López, who previously showran the series through its fourth installment, Night Country (taking over for that other Hollywood Nic, Pizzolatto). Those episodes starred Jodie Foster and Kali Reis as its crimesolvers, investigating disappearances in a remote town in Alaska; the new season will reportedly mix things up a bit, instead zooming over to New York's Jamaica Bay.

Cage has reportedly been circling the part for a good long while, without ever actually sealing the deal. The actor is a relative rarity, these days, in being a big-name movie star who has not dipped a toe into television for a miniseries here or there; until he signed on to star in Prime Video's Spider-Noir series, set to come out some time next year, he'd never really been lured onto the small screen at all. That being said, he feels like a pretty natural fit for True Detective, which is usually as much about exploring its characters' fucked-up moralities as it is actual criminal investigation; it's not hard to imagine the guy who brought us Bad Lieutenant: Port Of Call New Orleans fitting in with the show's roster of oddball cops.

	Erik Menendez, the younger of the two Beverly Hills brothers who infamously gunned down their parents in 1989 after years of alleged sexual abuse, was denied parole at a highly anticipated hearing Thursday. 


	The three-year denial, while minimal, dashed many supporters' hopes that Erik, 54, might be home with his family in time for the holidays. It also dampened expectations ahead of the separate parole board hearing for Erik's older brother and co-defendant, Lyle Menendez, 57, set for Friday.


	“I believe in redemption, or I wouldn't be doing this job,” Commissioner Robert Barton said as he delivered the decision. “But based on the legal standards, we find that you continue to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety.”


	Barton said Erik's history of rule violations while in custody factored heavily in the ruling, especially his use of contraband cell phones as recently as last year. He further noted Erik was “not in imminent fear” of death when he opened fire on his parents.

	











	Appearing over a video link from his prison in San Diego, Erik nodded along but appeared visibly shaken by the denial. Barton was blunt, saying he found the execution of Erik's mom, Kitty Menendez, “devoid of human compassion.” He noted that Kitty suffered at the hands of Erik's father as well.

	“I can't put myself in your place. I don't know that I've ever had rage to that level, ever. But that is still concerning, especially since it seems she was also a victim herself of the domestic violence,” Barton said. “The truest thing you said [today] in terms of accountability is there is no justification for your actions. … Doing what you did, when you did, how you did it, there is no justification.”

	











	In his comments leading up to the decision, Erik said he deeply regretted murdering his parents, José and Kitty Menendez, in the den of their $4 million Mediterranean-style mansion 36 years ago. He recalled believing his own life was in danger, but he admitted the shooting was not in self-defense.

	“Dad was going to come to my room and rape me that night. That was going to happen. One way or another. If he was alive, that was going to happen,” Erik told the parole board Thursday. Asked why he fatally shot his mother as well, Erik said he was blinded by the belief she supported José unconditionally. “On that night, I saw them as one person. Had she not been in the room, maybe it would have been different,” he said.


	“I wish to God I did not do that,” he told the board. “I cannot express sorrow and remorse enough. Doing it for the rest of my life will not be enough.”


	Turning emotional at times, he noted that Wednesday was another anniversary of the Aug. 20, 1989, murders. “Today is Aug. 21st. Today is the day that all of my [relatives] learned my parents were dead. So today is the anniversary of their trauma journey,” he told the panel. “I just want my family to understand that I am so unimaginably sorry for what I have put them through.”


	Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian argued against Erik's release on parole, telling the board that while it's true Erik earned a degree from UCLA while incarcerated and started programs to help other inmates, it's not clear he understands “the full severity and depravity of his conduct.” He suggested Erik's behavior was “calculated.”


	“When what you've done is shotgun your parents to death, deleted any competing wills, taken their money, spent their money, you're a violent person,” Balian argued. “When one continues to diminish their responsibility for a crime and continues to make the same false excuses that they've made for 30-plus years, one is still that same dangerous person that they were when they shotgunned their parents.”

	Thursday's denial is not the end of the road for Erik's bid to be released. He'll be eligible for another parole hearing in three years, and he has the right to petition to advance, meaning he could end up before the board earlier. Both brothers also have a motion for a new trial still pending in the courts. And a separate clemency bid is on the desk of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Even so, the parole board process is widely considered the brothers' most likely path to freedom.

	











	In a July episode of his podcast, This is Gavin Newsom, the governor said he planned to make any decision in front of him regarding the brothers' fate by Labor Day. He told his guest, Ryan Murphy, creator of the Netflix series Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, that he refrained from watching the show because he didn't want to be “persuaded” by anything “not in the files.” He did not hint which way he might rule.


	The brothers won the right to parole last May when a Los Angeles County judge resentenced them to 50 years to life for their first-degree murder convictions. (They previously were sentenced to life without parole.) Because both brothers were younger than 26 at the time of the murders, the reduced sentences made them immediately eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law.


	“While we respect the decision, today's outcome was of course disappointing and not what we hoped for,” Erik's family members said in a joint statement. “Our belief in Erik remains unwavering, and we know he will take the board's recommendation in stride. His remorse, growth, and the positive impact he's had on others speak for themselves.” The relatives said they remained “cautiously optimistic and hopeful” heading into Lyle's hearing on Friday.


	“This ruling does justice for Jose and Kitty Menendez,” Hochman said in a statement Thursday evening. “The board correctly determined that Erik Menendez's actions speak louder than words, and that his conduct in prison and current mentality demonstrate that he still poses an unreasonable risk of danger to the community.”


	At the start of Thursday's nearly 10-hour hearing, Barton asked Erik about the two residential burglaries he committed before the murders. Erik said he was trying to impress older kids. He also claimed his parents failed to instill in him a strong “moral foundation.”


	“I was raised to lie, to cheat, to steal,” he said. “When I was playing tennis, my father would make sure that I cheated at certain times if he told me to.” Erik admitted he was impulsive and “entitled” as a teenager.


	“I would violate the rules if I believed that it would benefit me. I did not trust authority. I didn't trust my relatives. I lived in an isolated household. We were trained not to go outside the household. I had deep character failings,” he told the board. Erik said the second burglary was a way of “sticking it” to his dad because it could hurt José's reputation. 

	











	“But you murdered him because you thought there was something he was going to do to you?” Barton asked. Erik replied yes. He said the murders were a little over a year after the second burglary.


	Recounting the 1989 Sunday-night slayings, Erik said that on the Tuesday before, he confided in Lyle that the “sexual violence was still going on.” Two days later, they first discussed buying guns after Lyle had a “very bad” confrontation with their dad, he said.


	“When we talked about getting the guns, I had made the decision that I was never going to let Dad come in my room and do that again,” Erik said. “In my mind, leaving meant death. There was no consideration. I was totally convinced there was no place I could go.”


	Erik admitted he “fantasized” about his father “not being alive.” But he said “pulling the trigger” was not premeditated, adding that his dad “was the most terrifying human being” he knew.


	“Is there any part of this which you believe was self-defense?” Barton asked. Erik said no.


	“My purpose in getting the guns was to protect myself in case my father or my mother came at me to kill me. Or my father came in the room to rape me. That is why I bought the guns,” he said. He recalled feeling his life was in “extreme danger immediately” after he and Lyle confronted their parents over the alleged sexual abuse.


	Asked who acted first “in terms of the violence,” Erik said Lyle came to the top of the stairs once their father ordered Erik to his room. “It's happening now,” Lyle purportedly told him, he said. “All I knew as I had to get to that den. Fear was driving me to that den,” he said.


	Erik recalled grabbing his gun and taking it out to his car to load it. Barton asked if he recognizes now that he had “other choices at that point.”


	“When I look back at the person I was then, and what I believed about the world and my parents, running away was inconceivable. Running away meant death,” Erik said. He claimed his father “had trained me to believe that running away meant death.”


	“Why kill Mom?” Barton asked. Erik said that when his mother told him she knew about the alleged abuse, he was stunned. “It was the most devastating moment in my entire life. It changed everything for me. I had been protecting her by not telling her,” he said. Erik said his mom told him she considered José a “great man” and would never leave him.


	“I saw my mother and my father as one person after I learned that she knew, so when I was running into the den, I was in a state of terror, of panic, of rage,” he said. “I didn't parse out in my mind my mother or my father. I ran in because fear was compelling me to run to the den.”

	











	Erik said he did his best to testify truthfully after he confessed. “I testified about the reloading, which I did not have to,” he said, referring to the fact that his brother reloaded his weapon during the shooting. “There was no evidence.”


	Asked about his rule violations behind bars, Erik identified his risk areas as “criminal thinking, substance abuse, violence, anger, impulsivity, [and] cell phone use.” Barton said the conduct in custody was important because it was an indicator of his current risk to public safety.


	Barton said Erik got in trouble for writing letters on a work device in 1997, physical fights with other inmates, and for having contraband, including cell phones, art supplies, tobacco and alcohol. He also engaged in excessive physical contact with visitors, according to his prison files. One incident involved a visit from his current wife in 2006. The woman's nine-year-old daughter was in the room. He said the girl was across the room reading a book while he and his wife were “snuggling.”


	“I was pushing the line occasionally in the visiting room with my wife because I was attracted to her and we had sexual feelings for one another,” he said. “It's difficult to be next to a woman that I love and am attracted to and want to be with and I can only hold her hand. It was a lapse in judgment. This was not something I did every day.”


	Erik said he tried heroin in custody but didn't like it. The hearing then touched on a sensitive topic with his brother.


	Barton accused Erik of covering up an aspect of his relationship with his brother when he requested a transfer to Lyle's prison. Erik told staff he and Lyle never had any problems. Barton said that was a “lie.”


	At that point, Erik said the allegation Lyle was “molesting [me] as a kid” was something he withheld from corrections department staff. He said he simply wanted to be closer to family. Erik's lawyer for the hearing, Heidi Rummel, said her client wasn't required to tell CDCR about every detail of his relationship with his brother.


	Erik admitted he participated in a tax fraud scheme in 2013 but said he did it for protection after his closest prison friends had been stabbed and raped. While details of the scheme were not explained, Erik said a violent prison gang recruited him to fill out the forms, and he jumped at the chance to “align myself with them” and “survive.”


	He said the risk of getting caught with phones was outweighed by the “connection with the outside world” they afforded. He claimed his thinking changed last year when, for the first time, he was given a shot at possible resentencing and parole. “Now the consequences mattered. Now the consequences meant I was destroying my life,” he said. Erik said he was using the phones for “connection with my wife, watching YouTube, listening to music, watching movies, porn. Anything you could do on a phone, I did.”

	











	Erik said he faced a turning point in 2013 and decided his purpose was to be a “good person” and leave a legacy. “I did not like who I was in 2013. I did not like using drugs. I did not like helping the [gang],” he said. “It just made me feel ugly and dirty.”


	Unfortunately, he said, he became “addicted” to the phones and convinced himself they weren't harming anyone. He now understands they're destructive to the prison environment because they involve the corruption of prison staff and involve “taxing” the benefit prison gangs, he said.


	“I justified it by saying if I don't buy it, someone else is going to buy it,” he said. “The phones were going to be sold, and I longed for that connection.” Asked if Lyle was the one who introduced him to cell phone use, he said no. He claimed Lyle has been a good influence, saying they're “serious accountability partners.” 


	At their resentencing hearing, both brothers expressed regret for the double slaying of their parents. Appearing by video, Erik called his actions “selfish, cruel, and cowardly.” He admitted he concocted an alibi about having been at a movie theater and did everything he could “to get away with my crimes.” He apologized to his family members for having “stolen” José and Kitty and said he planned to spend the rest of his life helping others.


	“I make no excuses and offer no justification,” Lyle said in his separate statement. “I take full responsibility for my choices. The choice to confront my dad about the abuse. The choice to keep the family secret instead of asking for help. The choice to stay instead of leave. The choice to buy guns and ammunition. The choice to point a gun at my mom and dad and shoot them. The choice to reload … and run up to my mom on the floor and shoot her again.”


	Lyle said he regretted his choice, after his arrest, “to make a mockery of the criminal justice system by soliciting perjury.” It was a notable admission considering prosecutors stated over and over during the resentencing hearing that the brothers never admitted they asked people to lie for them to cover their tracks. Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian specifically accused Lyle of having attempted to recruit a former girlfriend, Jamie Pisarcik, to falsely testify that José had drugged and violently raped her.


	Lyle said he was “immature, impulsive, emotionally isolated” and “in a co-dependent relationship” with Erik. He said his father molested him as well, when he was younger, so the brothers shared the “traumatic bond” of suffering that sexual abuse.

	











	“My choice to buy guns did not come from logic or reason. I was scared but also filled with rage. I'm so sorry I didn't ask for help. I should have trusted someone: a relative, the police, a priest,” he said.


	The brothers have spent the last 35 years behind bars for the grisly killings that became a media sensation. After their initial televised trial ended with two hung juries — one for each brother — Lyle and Erik were convicted of first-degree murder at a follow-up trial and sentenced in 1996.


	At trial, the brothers told jurors they suffered years of sexual abuse and believed their parents had plans to kill them to keep a lid on the family's dark secret. Prosecutors argued the brothers acted out of greed, resorting to the gruesome murders to get their multimillion-dollar inheritances before being cut out of their parents' will.


	In testimony to the court last May, cousin Diane VanderMolen recounted some of what she told jurors during the brothers' first trial. She said Lyle shared with her when he was a child that his father had been molesting him. She also described the “hallway rule” inside the Menendez family's home. (Her testimony about the alleged sexual abuse was not allowed at the second trial.)


	“When José was with one of the boys, you weren't allowed to go down the hall,” she testified Tuesday. She said no one dared challenge José because he was incredibly “intimidating.” She explained that while Kitty once had been like a second mother and mentor to her, Kitty's personality “greatly changed” after she allegedly discovered José “was having an affair.”


	“José was so powerful. And Kitty became the enforcer,” VanderMolen testified in a soft voice. She testified that Erik and Lyle were understandably terrified of their parents when they carried out the murders. “They did not see a way out,” she testified. “Afterward, after getting older, they realize now that they would have had other opportunities.”


	The judge granted the resentencing after L.A. County District Attorney Nathan Hochman tried to derail it. The process was initiated by Hochman's more liberal predecessor, George Gascón, last October. Gascón said he considered the brothers' young ages at the time of the killings — Erik was 18 and Lyle was 21 — and the brothers' exemplary behavior behind bars. He said they had paid their “debt” to society and should be eligible for parole immediately.

	











	Another cousin, Tamara Lucera Goodell, testified in May that the brothers were rehabilitated. She pointed to the green space, hospice, and meditation programs for other inmates that they've started behind bars. She asked the judge to strike down their life sentences so her bedridden 93-year-old grandmother, Joan VanderMolen, Kitty's sister, would have a chance to see them in person before she dies.


	“For 35 years, I have watched my entire family spiral during different conversations about what happened,” she testified. “I watched my grandmother and my aunts traumatized.” She said her grandmother's family had “a long history of abuse in multiple forms,” and having a chance to reunite with the brothers would help the family heal from the tragedy.


	José's older sister, Teresita Menendez-Baralt, 85, and Joan, Kitty's sister, both testified at a different hearing last November, saying they supported release. “No child should have to endure what Erik and Lyle lived through at the hands of their father,” Joan said on the witness stand. “It breaks my heart that my sister Kitty knew what was happening and did nothing about it, that we knew of,” she said under questioning by Mark Geragos, the lawyer representing the brothers.


	Testifying again Thursday, Teresita broke down in tears. “I want to make clear that although I love my brother, I have fully forgiven Erik,” she said, calling her nephew a “sweet, gentle soul.” She told the panel she's dying from Stage 4 cancer. “The truth is, I do not know how much time I have left. If Erik is granted parole, it would be a blessing to help him in any way I can,” she said. “More than anything, I hope I live long enough to welcome him into my home. To sit at the same table. To wrap my arms around him. That would bring me immeasurable peace and joy.”


	Kitty's grandniece, Natascha Leonardo, told the board she was willing to house Erik in Colorado with her family. She said Erik is close with her kids. “We're not asking you to release Erik into uncertainty. We're asking you to release him into a network of love and support,” she said.


	Lyle and Erik's story drew outsized national attention in 1989 due to the family's wealth and the brothers' claim that their parents were murdered in a Mafia-style hit. Police initially treated them as grieving orphans, but they were eventually arrested and charged with first-degree murder in 1990.


	The story remained a staple for true crime aficionados, but during the Covid-19 pandemic, CourtTV, the channel that originally broadcast their trial, released the entire recording of the proceeding online. This caused a major resurgence of interest in the Menendez case, especially for younger viewers who weren't even alive during the original televised trial.

	











	Later, in the 2023 Peacock docuseries, Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed, Roy Rossello, a former member of the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, stepped forward with new allegations. Rossello claimed that José Menendez, a prominent music industry executive, had sexually abused him, too. In October 2024, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story debuted on Netflix, with Murphy's dramatic retelling of the murders placing the brothers in a sympathetic light. The show ignited a new round of public and celebrity support for the brothers' release.

	“For more than 35 years, they have shown sustained growth. They've taken full accountability. They express sincere remorse to our family to this day and have built a meaningful life defined by purpose and service,” the Menendez family said in a statement leading up to the parole board hearings. “We know that Erik and Lyle will come home, that is no longer a doubt. We just hope that they are granted this second chance in time to hug their Aunt Joan and Aunt Terry.”

Between Woody Harrelson, Matthew McConaughey, Jodie Foster, Colin Farrell, Mahershala Ali, and Rachel McAdams, “True Detective” has a knack for getting big movie stars onto the small screen, and the latest could be someone who has only recently dipped his toes into television: Nicolas Cage. In fact, the actor hinted way back in 2023 that he may only have a few movies left in him and would've wanted to “have left on a high note” before turning to TV. 

Cage is in talks to star in the fifth season of “True Detective” for HBO, a source told IndieWire. This season is said to be set in the Jamaica Bay area of New York City, and showrunner and writer Issa Lopez, who took over for creator Nic Pizzolatto for the fourth season, “Night Country,” is back. Any other plot details are still under wraps.

HBO had no comment. 

The only other instance of Cage turning to television as the lead for a series still hasn't come out yet. That would be “Spider-Noir,” the live-action, black and white series for Amazon that is a spinoff of Cage's character in the animated “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” In it he plays a 1930s private investigator/superhero forced to grapple with his past life choices. The series is set to debut in 2026.

 










Not only was “Night Country” the most-watched season of “True Detective” in its four seasons, it also broke the losing streak for “True Detective” and won its lead Jodie Foster an Emmy and Golden Globe, the first time a lead for the series has won the top industry prizes. Cage would still be a Tony and a Grammy away from EGOT status if he managed the same, but we can dream.

Pizzolatto had teased that Season 1 stars McConaughey and Harrelson were interested in reprising their roles, with Pizzolatto saying he had another idea for their characters Cohle and Hart, but Pizzolatto last wrote for the series in Season 3. 

True to form, Cage has been plenty busy in both prestigious projects and lower-budget shlock, starring in last year's “Longlegs,” “The Surfer,” and “Arcadian,” as well as this year's “Gunslingers.” In addition to the “Spider-Noir” series set for next year, Cage is playing NFL legend John Madden in a biopic being directed by David O. Russell, he's starring in a sequel to “Lord of War” from Andrew Niccol, he'll appear in a horror film called “The Carpenter's Son,” and he's in post on “The Prince,” based on a David Mamet script.

Visitors at Disney World's Epcot are reporting an out-of-this-world experience.

A woman working behind the scenes at a popular Nashville radio show gained newfound notoriety with her recent claim of a UFO sighting, during a visit to the Orlando theme park with her boyfriend. 

While waiting for the nightly fireworks show with her boyfriend, Morgan Huelsman, digital director of “The Bobby Bones Show”, said she saw a sudden bright light overhead — one that apparently had nothing to do with the planned pyrotechnics.

After scouring the internet for information regarding potential satellites or drones in the area and coming up short, the tourist from Tennessee pronounced the bright object as “definitely a UFO with aliens.”

A video of the episode posted to the official “Bobby Bones Show” X account on Aug. 21 was widely circulated online — sparking discussion over what Huelsman could have seen.

“[Morgan] saw this hovering over EPCOT at Disney World for several minutes before it just blipped away,” the post said. 

The video showed a small bright light hovering in the dark night sky, though it's unclear if the object was moving or not because the camera was not steady.

One person noted that there had been a rocket launch from Cape Canaveral earlier in the week which could explain the sighting, but show staff reported that the object “was never moving.”

It's unknown exactly when the video was taken, though SpaceX did launch a batch of satellites for Starlink out of Cape Canaveral on Aug. 14 and Aug. 18 — just about 60 miles away from Walt Disney World.

Another comment said that the bright light in the video “looks exactly like a police helicopter.”

Epcot's proximity to NASA launch sites has sparked scores of UFO reports from parkgoers.

Experts have noted that the combination of clear skies in Florida, rocket launches and highly populated tourist areas make it a hotspot for misidentified aerial phenomena.

Florida ranks behind only California for the most number of reported UFO sightings, according to the Florida Times-Union. 

Since 1995, there have been 8,623 UFO sightings in Florida reported to the National UFO Reporting Center.

Disney has yet to comment on the mysterious episode.

      If companies like Boeing or Lockheed Martin really are sitting on non-human intelligence tech (NHI), the U.S. government would have a huge problem: how do you keep something that valuable secret when it's technically inside publicly traded corporations?
    


      Shareholders, analysts, quarterly reports waaay too many eyes. The easiest fix? Just buy them out. Privatize the whole thing. Turn them into black-budget R&D labs under direct government control, with total security over the workforce.
    


      And it wouldn't even be insanely expensive compared to other things the goverment waists money on. A few hundred billion dollars is basically pocket change in Washingtn  Boeing and Lockheed at 2x market value are still very cheap compared next to overinflated tech companies.
    


      If nhi tech was on the table, that would probably be the best deal in history. The Trump administration already has a lot of connections in the private equity and investments & business intelligence defence branche ie Palantir and Anduril.

“Chicago, 1967,” a description of the book reads. Magazine writer Harry Kean has been dispatched to rural Indiana to investigate the sudden disappearance of Becky Plume, a local teenager who stepped into the national spotlight with staggering photographic evidence of a recent UFO sighting. Frustrated to leave his developing stories in Chicago—and the wife he's hoping to win back—Harry sets off to expose a hoax but instead finds himself in a labyrinth of high strangeness involving a missing girl, her boyfriend, a UFO, and some mysterious black-clad “visitors circling at the perimeter of a mystery more vast than Harry could possibly imagine.

High Strangeness: Book One comes from writer and producer Daniel Noah, writer Chris Condon, and artist Dave Chisholm. Jim Perry also provides a feature-length essay regarding “the historical facts and documentary evidence underpinning the phenomena detailed” in each book.

Future issues will be written by Zac Thompson, Christopher Cantwell, Cecil Castellucci, and Christian Ward, while art comes from Noah Bailey, Valeria Burzo, Chloe Stawski, and Ward.

High Strangeness: Book One will be released on October 8, 2025, from One Press and SpectreVision, the latter of which is a production company co-founded by Noah, Elijah Wood, and Lawrence Inglee.

The B-2 bomber flying wing design was shaped by decades of engineering, not alien craft. Yet, its UFO-like look fuels mystery and conspiracy. Is it really just stealth science or something more? 

The B-2 bomber flying wing shape is not from a crashed UFO. As per reports it evolved from 1940s American aircraft designs like the Northrop XB-35 and YB-49. It's design focuses on aerodynamics and stealth, developed engineers.

A flying wing is a plane without a separate tail or fuselage. Instead, it's all wing this shape reduces drag and radar visibility. Engineers first experimented with it in the 1930s-40s, aiming for better fuel efficiency and stealth.

The B-2 Spirit builds on these earlier designs. Its crescent shape results from decades of research into reducing radar detection and improving flight. It uses advanced materials and computer modelling, but the shape's roots are purely terrestrial.

Some believe the B-2 bomber design was copied from a UFO from the Roswell incident or that whistleblower Bob Lazar revealed secret files. As per reports these claims have no solid evidence and remain in the realm of conspiracy theories.

The sleek, smooth shape of the B-2 resembles reported UFO sightings. This is just because both designs aim for the same things: invisibility to radar and efficient flight. Experts say the similarity is functional, not alien.

The B-2's radar system uses cutting-edge electronics and radar-absorbing materials. While rumours suggest alien tech involvement, the reality is human-made advances after years of research and testing.

Though some stories claim secret UFO files influenced the B-2 bomber, official records show it was human engineering. The truth about possible alien technology remains unproven.

Confirmed by the scientific community—an extraterrestrial mineral found in a meteorite breaks known laws by expanding in an unusual way when heated

There is something that has the entire scientific community on edge because there is absolutely nothing like it on Earth. It is an extraterrestrial mineral, or at least that is what they believe in the article published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), and it all comes from a meteorite that fell in what is now Germany in 1724!!!

It is called silica tridymite, a very rare form of silicon dioxide that has nothing similar on our planet, and the most curious thing about this element is that it has the ability to maintain a constant thermal conductivity!! And now they believe new ways of working with this material could open up in industries where high temperatures are needed (such as steel production).

This mineral cannot be classified as crystal or as glass, it is something that intrigues the entire community, what is it?! Something that came from space, we suppose. But now it could help reduce carbon emissions on Earth, and seeing how fast the greenhouse effect is advancing, maybe it is our last bullet, don't you think?

Tridymite was found in a meteorite and, surprisingly, it has also been detected on Mars (everything takes us to Mars, why is that!!). What most puzzles experts is that it breaks the normal rules of heat conduction. While crystals tend to lose thermal conductivity when heated and glasses tend to increase it, this material maintains a constant level, and that is what makes it the perfect candidate for other applications, and the metallurgical industry is already thinking about how to include it!

According to the researchers, it has a point of order like that of crystals, but also a touch of disorder like that of glasses. That is, it does not fit entirely into any category, and that is exactly what gives it such peculiar properties.

Think about it, only in the United States, this sector emits about 7% of all the CO₂ in the country, and an important part of that impact comes from the extreme heat they need to handle. If materials like tridymite could be used in that context, energy expenditure and emissions could be greatly reduced.

If this material can be replicated or adapted, the possibility of reducing the environmental impact of one of the most polluting industries on the planet would open up. This makes it not only a scientific finding, but also a strategic one for the fight against climate change.

The study is called Temperature-invariant crystal–glass heat conduction: From meteorites to refractories and it is nothing more than the beginning!! From here, researchers believe new heat-resistant materials could be developed inspired by this mineral that came from space.

The most interesting thing is that, unintentionally, a piece of rock that fell from the sky centuries ago could help us build a more sustainable future on Earth. And although there is still much to investigate, this shows that looking at the universe not only serves to understand what is out there, but also to improve what we have here inside. Mars, get ready because soon we are coming for more!

Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon.

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural".

This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years.

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

This visitor is bigger, faster and behaves differently from the two previous visitors to our galaxy -  Oumuamua and Borisov - and is shielded behind the sun as it hurtles in our general direction.

Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion.

Klarer had no such negative thoughts. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media".

Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon.

Klarer claimed her sightings at what became known as Flying Saucer Hill were witnessed by a Zulu manager, Ladam, as well as her sister, May, on the family farm in Rosetta.

Various articles in the "Sunday Tribune" over the years reported that on April 7, 1956, she visited the hilltop again after further reports from her family that Zulu workers had seen the "lightning bird" appear there again. 

This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship.

During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. 

He further explained that they occasionally took women from Earth as partners, as the offspring strengthened their race. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. She was returned to the hilltop thereafter.

In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls.

In the case of the Hills, hypnosis was used to try to make sense of what had happened to the New Hampshire couple on September 19, 1961. 

They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path.

What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. Betty's smart court shoes had been badly scuffed on the toes, as though she had been dragged there. Both their watches had stopped and never ticked again.

After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli.

Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons.

Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis.

However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon.

As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved.

An American couple, Betty and Barney Hill, went to their deathbeds convinced they were abducted and probed by aliens and had their memories of the 1961 encounter erased.

Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959.

These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural".

This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years.

The object is moving at a speed of 209 000 kph, and has no tail, a telltale sign astronomers say distinguishes it from a comet.

It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago.

This visitor is bigger, faster and behaves differently from the two previous visitors to our galaxy -  Oumuamua and Borisov - and is shielded behind the sun as it hurtles in our general direction.

Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion.

Klarer had no such negative thoughts. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media".

Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon.

Klarer claimed her sightings at what became known as Flying Saucer Hill were witnessed by a Zulu manager, Ladam, as well as her sister, May, on the family farm in Rosetta.

Various articles in the "Sunday Tribune" over the years reported that on April 7, 1956, she visited the hilltop again after further reports from her family that Zulu workers had seen the "lightning bird" appear there again. 

This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship.

During the encounter, kisses were exchanged, and he told Klarer that she was a reincarnated Venusian and a long-lost soulmate. 

He further explained that they occasionally took women from Earth as partners, as the offspring strengthened their race. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. She was returned to the hilltop thereafter.

In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart.

Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation.

Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail.

Her interstellar love story inspired a stage production, and Jimmy Neversink even penned a tune on the unexplained affair across the Universe.

When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. 

One, however, twirled her index finger about her head, indicating that her youngest sibling may have had a mental health issue.

Just after midnight in a part of Planet Earth known as Massachusetts, a team of scientists who track comets and minor planets in the solar system announced that they had spotted something new: a spark in the southern sky, visible in the data they were getting from a telescope in Chile.

The telescope, high in the Atacama Desert, is tasked with searching for objects that might collide with Earth. “We at the Minor Planet Center have the role to collect the information and also to post it quickly, almost in real time, on our website if the object is somehow interesting,” said Peter Veres, a Harvard astronomer sometimes described as an air-traffic controller for the solar system.

So at 1.15am local time on July 1, the discovery was announced. “Observers around the world quickly gathered their telescopes,” Veres said.

Soon, astronomers concluded that the object had come from interstellar space, that it would not come within 170 million miles of Earth and that it was, in all likelihood, a sort of cosmic iceberg billions of years old, ejected from the frosty outer limits of another star system and now zipping along at 118,000 miles an hour, the fastest object ever sighted in our solar system.

But there was also another theory that was soon being advanced by the Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb: that this object could be an alien probe, sent on a reconnaissance mission through our solar system on a course that kept it, deliberately, out of reach of our fastest rockets.

It is only the third interstellar object ever recorded passing through the solar system. The first, that was named Oumuamua, was sighted in 2017. A second, 2I/Borisov, was spotted in 2019 by a telescope maker in Crimea named Gennadiy Borisov. This latest visitor was sighted by a telescope run by Atlas, an early warning system funded by Nasathat is designed to detect asteroids heading towards Earth. It has been named 3I/Atlas, the 3I standing for “3 Interstellar”.

Loeb is recognised by fellow astronomers for his work on the evolution of the first stars, but he gained a global following in 2018 when he and a colleague published a paper suggesting that Oumuamua was a solar sail created by an alien civilisation, floating like driftwood through interstellar space, or perhaps even an alien probe dispatched on a scouting mission to our solar system.

On July 2, 24 hours after Harvard's Minor Planets Center announced the sighting of 3I/Atlas, Loeb woke at 2am to appear on a late-night radio show called Coast to Coast. After he got off air, “one of the listeners wrote to me and said: ‘There is a potential new object,'” he said.

Loeb began posting essays on the 3I/Atlas. “They have received a quarter of a million views,” he said. “Can you believe it? It's not a TikTok video. These are essays of 1,000 words or more.”

Several things about 3I/Atlas struck him as unusual. “There is no trail of dust,” he said. Its trajectory lines up, to within five degrees, to the ecliptic plane, the orbital plane on which the Earth and most of the other planets in the solar system track around the sun, he added. “The chance of it being on that plane is one in 500.” Its timing meant that it would come close to three planets: Jupiter, Mars and Venus. This, he said, “raises the question of whether this trajectory was designed”.

It would pass closest to the sun on October 29 but “we won't be able to observe it because the sun will be in the way”, he said. “It's an interesting coincidence.” Its speed is expected to increase, as it nears the sun, to about 152,000 miles per hour — and when you factor in the speed of the Earth, which is moving in the opposite direction around the sun, “that's three times faster than our fastest rockets”, he said.

On a scale of one to ten, where ten represents a definite piece of alien technology, he still only gives it “a four so far”, he said. But he recently posted an essay on the Medium platform, asking what humanity should do “if the new interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a spacecraft, guided to send mini-probes that will arrive at Earth and other planets in the coming months”.

He has a 15-point plan.

One of his followers is already trading against the stock market, believing it will crash if the probe theory proves true, he said. Markets would crash “because of the uncertainty”, he said, adding: “We might feel like the Iranian air-defence system, when the B2 bombers were flying overhead and we can't do anything about it.”

Other astronomers think that the object is a comet: a fascinating thing to see but not proof, at last, that mankind is not alone in the universe. Loeb is “a super bright guy”, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He noted that Loeb had led Breakthrough Starshot, a project to send a probe to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri. “Then when Oumuamua came in, he asked the very reasonable question: if one of my probes went through Alpha Centauri, wouldn't it look just like this? The answer turns out to be no.”

Oumuamua was long and flat. Veres, of the Minor Planets Center, said that it was “interesting because of its shape and its odd motion”. It did not have the fuzzy halo of gas and dust that comets usually give off as they near the sun and heat up, and it seemed to accelerate in a manner that could not be accounted for “purely by gravity”, Veres said. “That led to some, I would say speculative ideas by Professor Loeb … that it's a solar sail or probe.”

• Scientists challenge theory that mystery object was alien ship

The second interstellar object to be spotted, Borisov, behaved more like a comet, Veres said. This third object was spotted when it was about 418 million miles from the sun. Its size is still hotly debated, though it is thought to be somewhere between 200 and 5,000 metres across, he said.

Its trajectory, zipping through the solar system against the flow of the circling planets, is certainly interesting, but Veres notes that it is only the third such object ever spotted. “The previous two objects were on totally random angles,” he said. Once 30 or 100 have been tracked, it will be easier to see what is ordinary for an interstellar comet, he said.

But there are still unanswered questions. “Now it's like, [260 million] miles from the sun. It's getting warmer … but it's still not very active,” he said. “There is still no tail.” This, he said, was “fuel for those speculative ideas by Professor Loeb”.

Veres thinks that the lack of a halo of gas and dust might be because it has developed a hard crust as it crossed interstellar space and was “baked”, though not in a warming sense, by cosmic rays. Perhaps as it nears the sun, this crust “will peel off and suddenly we'll see a lot of activity”.

John Forbes, a computational astronomer at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, believes that 3I/Atlas does have a halo but that it is hard to see, because the comet is still travelling in our general direction. “The tail is pointing a little away from us,” he said. “For my money, it's a really interesting object but it looks an awful lot like a comet.”

It has come from nearer the centre of the Milky Way, where there are stars formed billions of years before our sun. These older stars are composed of lighter elements, and have fewer metals in them, “because metals themselves are produced by stars evolving and exploding”, said Forbes.

As stars form, a flat disc of dust and gas swirls around them and resolves into planets as well as lumps of ice and dust that get ejected into interstellar space. McDowell described 3I/Atlas as an interstellar iceberg with a composition unlike any ice on Earth, “wandering the galaxy for yonks” and now, as it nears us, “barrelling along in a cloud of its own steam”.

Loeb thinks that whatever it is, its passage through our solar system represents a huge opportunity to get the general public excited about science. “It entered the outskirts of our solar system, the edge of the so-called Oort Cloud, 8,000 years ago,” he said. “That was when humans started to document their history. It came within 1,000 times of the [distance between the Earth and the sun] 80 years ago.” Eight years ago, it passed through the Kuiper Belt, just beyond the orbit of Neptune, he said. Now it is a speck in the heavens, moving steadily north across the night sky.
