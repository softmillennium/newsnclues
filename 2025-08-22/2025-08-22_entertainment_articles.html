                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Those players come in the form of 32-year-old legal clerk Jason Treul and 29-year-old fitness trainer Michelle “MC” Chukwujekwu. A historic first for the longrunning series, Probst opened up about “Survivor” producer's last minute descision in an interview with Entertainment Weekly following the August 20 cast announcement. The rule, put in place to prevent players from forming pre-season alliances and to preserve the authenticity of the game, stipulates against prospective players engaging in any kind of verbal, non-verbal, or physical contact during their pre-game quarantine. “Typically, we bring alternates in case somebody gets sick or has a panic attack and can't begin the game,” he said. But regardless why we brought them there initially, they are also there to serve as a reminder that we do put a lot of importance on the integrity of the game, and we won't let anything or any person put that in jeopardy.” While Jason and MC flew to Fiji ahead of filming knowing that they likely wouldn't appear on “Survivor 49,” Probst explained that the duo were “suddenly thrust into the game” with just 12 hours notice. Despite having less than a day to mentally prepare for “Survivor,” Probst told EW that he saw Jason and MC's last minute addition to the cast as an “advantage” for the players. “You've spent a week observing, but without the pressure of thinking you were going to have to play and put it into motion,” said the host, adding, “Jason and MC find themselves in this marooning challenge that 12 hours ago they were dreaming might happen one day and suddenly it's right in front of them.” Probst went on to identify the moment as a “completely unique situation” for “Survivor,” adding that he hopes the last-minute casting shuffle will add a “cool layer to this experiment.” “We have four alternates playing,” said Probst, noting the historic series first. We just don't have a spot for you this season. Probst added that he hopes “Survivor's” most alternate-heavy season will encourage future alternates to hold out hope that they'll eventually find themselves on the beaches of Fiji searching for Hidden Immunity Idols and attending Tribal Council ceremonies. Conversely, the longtime host said he also hopes this moment acts as warning to future prospective castaways that the show takes its rules very seriously. “Survivor 49” is set to make its two-hour CBS debut on Wednesday, September 24 at 8:00pm ET.</p>

The Dexter prequel Original Sin won't get a second season, despite an announcement to the contrary earlier this year. The Dexter franchise is still a going concern, however, with a writers room for season two of Dexter: Resurrection set to begin work in the near future. Showtime announced a second season renewal for Dexter: Original Sin in April, six weeks after the 1991-set series following a young Dexter Morgan (played by Patrick Gibson) ended its 10-episode first season. Sources say, however, that the show had been on hiatus since production wrapped, and no start date for production on a second season was ever scheduled. A writers room for a potential second season of Resurrection is set to open soon, with the intent being a renewal, sources tell THR — though season two has yet to be formally greenlit. Sources also note that Paramount remains invested in the Dexter franchise but is directing its efforts toward the unfolding story of Resurrection rather than filling in more of the character's life in a continued prequel series.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Amid monster viewership for Happy Gilmore 2, which last month scored Netflix‘s biggest U.S. opening weekend ever, Adam Sandler's Happy Madison is teaming with Shawn Levy's 21 Laps to develop a feature adaptation of Evan S. Porter‘s debut novel Dad Camp, with Kevin Jakubowski on board to pen the script. Published by Dutton in June 2024, Dad Camp follows John, a devoted father who finds his once-close bond with daughter Avery unraveling as she enters her preteen years. Desperate to reconnect before she starts middle school, he signs them up for a week-long father-daughter retreat at a rundown summer camp, where he's forced to confront both his fears of losing her and the evolving nature of their relationship. Shawn Levy and Dan Levine will produce on behalf of 21 Laps, with Emily Feher and Max Gains overseeing the project for the company. Working as a blogger in between writing his novels, Dad Camp author Porter wrote for Upworthy from 2015-2018, and spent three years as Lead Copywriter and Director of Content at Atlanta-based digital marketing agency Nebo before that. Jakubowski is a Humanitas Prize-nominated screenwriter whose credits include HBO Max's 8-Bit Christmas, which was nominated for a PGA Award for Outstanding Producer of Televised or Streamed Motion Pictures, and Assassination of a High School President, which was an official selection of the Sundance and SXSW Film Festivals. His original scripts Old Time Hockey and Full Fenski Christmas are currently set up at Skydance. Recently setting Tripper Clancy to write a Night at the Museum reimagining for 20th Century Studios on which we had the scoop, 21 Laps launches the fifth and final season of global hit Stranger Things later this year. Recently, the company has also announced feature adaptations of Grady Hendrix's short story “The Blanks” and Freida McFadden's psychological thriller Never Lie for Netflix, as well as a Madonna limited series for the same streamer. As a director, Levy's next project is Star Wars: Starfighter, starring Ryan Gosling, Mia Goth and Matt Smith, which he's also producing. Pic goes into production this fall and will be released theatrically on May 28, 2027. Marking Sandler's first Netflix film based on one of his legacy characters, Happy Gilmore 2 amassed 46.7 million views in its first three days on the platform, beginning July 25, and has now garnered over 109 million views. This puts the film on track to break into Netflix's Top 10 Most Popular Movies, as the last of 10 entries on that list, the Millie Bobby Brown starrer Damsel from 2024, has just 138 million views. First entering into an exclusive deal with Netflix in 2014, Sandler's films have consistently been top performers for the streamer. Most recently, his Happy Madison has announced a pair of new Netflix comedies, on which we were first to report: Don't Say Good Luck from Julia Hart and Roommates from Chandler Levack. Soon to be seen starring opposite George Clooney in the awards prospect Jay Kelly from Noah Baumbach, which releases in select theaters on November 14 before premiering on Netflix on December 5, Sandler is also set to hit 37 arenas with his Adam Sandler: You're My Best Friend Tour, beginning next month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was in that moment, staring into the gold and brown face helming the performatively old-timey interstate eatery, that a future congressman decided to give himself to Christ. That may not be exactly how it happened, but Donalds came forward with his story of religious epiphany in a Cracker Barrel parking lot amid MAGA outrage over the chain restaurant's decision to change its logo, removing the image of “Uncle Herschel” and his barrel. I even gave my life to Christ in their parking lot,” he wrote. It's time to Make Cracker Barrel Great Again 🇺🇸” There is no indication that Cracker Barrel's decision to simplify its logo was motivated by politics or “wokeness.” If anything, the company has been struggling for years to market its perfectly mediocre food and boomer nostalgia-themed ambiance to anyone but the remaining population of baby boomers, or those in urgent need of a bathroom during their long drives. !” Donald Trump Jr. wrote on X. MAGA country musician John Rich asked his followers if they would “go to Cracker Barrel now that it's going woke? This could be a ‘Bud Light' moment in the making.” Right-wing actor James Woods posted that on cross-country drives, “Cracker Barrel was the only place I'd ever stop. Professional anti-woke troll Christopher Rufo declared that “we must break the Barrel. It's not about this particular restaurant chain — who cares — but about creating massive pressure against companies that are considering any move that might appear to be ‘wokification. And, to that end, Cracker Barrel's already flailing stock took a dip on Thursday as conservatives fumed at the company. Even more bizarre, for some Republican influencers, the meltdown over Uncle Herschel's PR demise took a turn for the sexual. TPUSA Founder Charlie Kirk posted an image comparing the original logo to new MAGA favorite and universally-acknowledged-hot-actress Sydney Sweeney, and the redesign to a plus-sized woman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. But now that “Time to Pretend” is a vintage track (how horrid), any TV show or film set in the back half of the 20th Century is firmly a period project; and the 1970s, specifically, might be one of the most challenging decades for contemporary movies and series to recreate. There are a number of reasons why this is. Related Stories How ‘Star Wars' Stormed the Academy Awards and Sent an Oscar Into Space ‘Ne Zha 2' Review: The Chinese Animated Phenomenon Is a Gorgeously Animated Epic They all highlighted ways in which our cultural awareness of the ‘70s can fool film crews and audiences alike into thinking we remember what the period should look like. But memory, just like a shag carpet, is tricky to maintain. Small details like rooftop antennas, graphic elements, and of course, more obvious things like vehicles and architecture are essential to grounding a piece in that period.” “Because of the [economic] downturn, products made and used in this period were of a lower quality than what the baseline is today. Because of this, they have largely been relegated to landfills. They had little value then, and did not retain it. Masaro told IndieWire that she and her team needed to rely on a lot of specialty shops and rentals in order to create an authentic sense of the ‘70s in her sets. Add in the exploration and use of textures… [it's] heaven,” Cummings told IndieWire. But in recreating the period, it's important to remember that these more extreme visuals weren't seen everywhere all at once,” Mickle told IndieWire. “If that's not kept in mind, it's easy to go overboard and flood the frame with ‘70s cliches. The temptation to fill the walls is something that production designers going for period accuracy have to fight against. “If you need to fill a space visually for a 1970s project, you will have to be more creative than cramming the walls with stuff. It's going to be more about the basics of color, texture, and shapes than ‘things,'” Beech said. Those signifiers of time period also have to be balanced with a lived-in sense of other time periods, too. Masaro's work on “Fellow Travellers” is decade-spanning, but she said that the key was that she couldn't hermetically seal the ‘50s and ‘60s away when it came time to design her ‘70s sets. “The thing I find with any period is [you can't] focus too heavily on the decade styles themselves, without including design choices from previous decades,” Masaro said. Because the colors, textures, and geometric patterns that immediately scream “1970s” are such strong deviations from both contemporary design and a lot of what came before in the 20th Century, that balance is easy to get wrong or to tip into pastiche. “Only the 1930s are harder,” Beech said, about another era that maybe has become too iconic in our shared cultural imagination for its own good. The '70s require a great deal of patience to search out scarce resources, to sift through imperfect research material, and to combat our contemporary myths and misunderstandings that it was all waterbeds and egg-shaped chairs. IndieWire's '70s Week is presented by Bleecker Street's “RELAY.” Riz Ahmed plays a world class “fixer” who specializes in brokering lucrative payoffs between corrupt corporations and the individuals who threaten their ruin. IndieWire calls “RELAY” “sharp, fun, and smartly entertaining from its first scene to its final twist, ‘RELAY' is a modern paranoid thriller that harkens back to the genre's '70s heyday.” From director David Mackenzie (“Hell or High Water”) and also starring Lily James, in theaters August 22.

According to press materials distributed on August 12, 2025, Snoop will be highly visible before and during the global tournament, with eight soccer matches to take place at SoFi Stadium. “This isn't just any tournament,” the Los Angeles native said in an announcement video. 's ready to show up with that signature style, culture, and love for the beautiful game,” Snoop said in a video announcing his new role. “I'm here to make sure that the whole world has a great experience in our city and everyone in our community gets the chance to participate.” Officials said Snoop will “represent the tournament at community engagement and legacy programs,” including cheering on the U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) in their first match on June 12. This isn't Snoop's first time representing the U.S. for a global sporting event.

That song, “Sunscreen,” did not immediately see the light of day, though it leaked on streaming platforms and occasionally popped up in DJ sets.

SOPHIE's brother, Benny Long, and vocal engineer Suzy Shinn worked with Liz to complete the track. The song is also getting a vinyl release. Liz wrote on social media, “After all the years of rips, leaks, lore, and speculation, SUNSCREEN is finally here. SOPHIE always wanted me to put this song out, and I'm so grateful to Benny and Emily Long for being the loving and classy individuals they are, and for trusting me with the vision for this release.” You continue to shape me and so many others; your impact is eternal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bruce Springsteen‘s unreleased song vault is a source of seemingly infinite wonders. “Lonely Night In the Park” was recorded at New York's Record Plant across two days in May 1975, and came very close to appearing on Born to Run. Springsteen included it on several proposed Born to Run track sequences in his notebooks, and Jon Landau argued it should be on the album instead of “Meeting Across The River.” “I won my way on things,” former Springsteen manager/Born to Run co-producer Mike Appel told Backstreets in 1990. I said these songs aren't staying on the record − over my dead body. And nobody today would talk to him like that.” The credits for this new version include Steve Van Zandt and Ron Aniello on guitar, confirming there were recent overdubs on the original studio recording. The 30th anniversary of Born to Run in 2005 was celebrated with a new box set and documentary. According to the official website, the symposium will feature “panels, presentations, and interviews with members of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, as well as with journalists and historians, music industry legends, and special guests.” Thanks, Trump: ICE Just Gassed a Public School Into Submission Lil Nas X Hospitalized for Possible Overdose After Roaming L.A.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 20 years after the icon's death, Exceleration Music's John Burk is reissuing four classic Charles albums under his original Tangerine label. While producing what became Ray Charles‘ final album, Genius Loves Company, John Burk asked the soul music legend if he might re-sing a part. “It's about what I'm feeling, at that moment,” Charles replied. And Burk, a partner at Exceleration Music, remembered that conversation when preparing to reissue four albums from Charles' catalog of 60-plus releases earlier this year. The first, 1974's Come Live With Me, out today (Aug. 22), is what Burk calls a “heartbreak and sadness and loneliness album,” a gem that didn't make the Billboard 200. The album, Burk adds, is “ripe for discovery” and came out “when the marketplace was just so different than what he was doing. It didn't quite fit in certain charts and radio formats.” The four releases Burk has prepared are from Tangerine Records, Charles' longtime indie label, with which Exceleration partnered in 2021. An investment group formed by ex-execs from Concord Music Group, Merlin and others, Exceleration has spent the past five years investing in influential indie labels such as blues powerhouse Alligator Records, alt-country fixture Bloodshot Records and '90s-rock stalwarts Kill Rock Stars. After making a deal in 2021 with the Ray Charles Foundation, Exceleration rolled out reissues from the singer's vast catalog — the 90-track True Genius box set in honor of what would have been Charles' 90th birthday in 2020, then Charles' classic country albums such as Crying Time and the two volumes of Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music. Burk, one of five partners at Exceleration, says the upcoming Charles reissues — Ingredients In a Recipe for Soul is due Sept. 19, Love Country Style, Oct. 24, and No One Does It Like … Ray Charles, Nov. 21 — will be part of a long, gradual rollout of Charles' “massive catalog.” Although Rhino Records reissued much of Charles' catalog in the ‘90s with lavish CD packaging, Burk says, “There's a lot more to discover about Ray Charles than the public may know. Despite a long association with Atlantic Records, Charles spent much of his career as an indie artist, albeit funded by large corporations such as ABC and British Decca. Love Country Style, from 1970, is in the mode of Charles' 1962 masterpiece Modern Sounds In Country and Western Music and includes a bluesy cover of Johnny Cash‘s “Ring of Fire”; 1963's Ingredients In a Recipe for Soul, which hit No. 2 on the Billboard 200, opens with his classic version of Harlan Howard‘s “Busted”; and No One Does It Like … Ray Charles! is a new title compiling non-album singles from 1962-1965, including “No One” and “Something's Wrong.” Tangerine, named after Charles' favorite fruit, was not actually the original record company that released Come Live With Me — that album belonged to Charles' later label, Crossover, according to the singer's 1978 autobiography Brother Ray. “Look,” he told ABC lawyers before signing, according to Michael Lydon‘s 1998 bio Ray Charles: Man and Music: “Since I'm producing my own music, I want to own my own masters.” Such a deal was unprecedented at the time, as labels have insisted on ownership of masters for decades. “I loved Tangerine,” Charles said in Man and Music.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zach Cregger's sleeper hit is the second notable win for the horror genre this year following Ryan Coogler's 'Sinners,' which is likewise an original story. Who says lightning can't strike twice and on the same Hollywood studio lot? main studio made Sinners, while New Line is home of Weapons and the R-rated Final Destination: Bloodlines franchise reboot, which surprised many in scaring up more than $385 million at the early summer box office. Like Bloodlines, Weapons is no slouch overseas for an early worldwide tally of $170 million or thereabouts. Bill Hader's 'The Cat in the Hat' Lands New November 2026 Release Date Thanks to winning over critics and audiences alike, director Cregger's buzzy movie came in more than $10 million ahead of expectations when winning the Aug. 8-10 weekend with a $43.5 million domestic opening. Sources say he commanded a $20 million fee for his deal to make Sony's next Resident Evil movie. Weapons stars Julia Garner as a teacher who learns that 17 of the 18 children in her classroom simultaneously got out of bed and ran off into the night at the exact same time, 2:17 a.m. Josh Brolin plays a grieving father who is intent on finding his missing child and is suspicious that the young teacher had something to do with it. Alden Ehrenreich, Austin Abrams and Amy Madigan also star in Weapons, which has quite the twist. (Madigan's performance as the ghoulish and creepy Aunt Gladys is already sparking awards chatter.) One of Weapons' conceits is its chapter structure centering on particular characters, and sources say that Cregger actually had a chapter focused on Gladys and some of her backstory. He ultimately pulled that section from the script for length purposes. Now with the movie's wild success, that lost chapter would be expanded into a full-length story. Sources say no deals have been made, nor is there any timeline. Rival studios add that Warners' marketing campaign for Weapons was nothing short of brilliant, considering it didn't want to ruin the surprise and exploit the twist in marketing materials. All told, Imax and other premium large-format screens turned in a huge 34 percent of the opening weekend gross. The pic also reunited him with his go-star, Michael B. Jordan. And it has narrowly bested Jaws — not adjusted for inflation — to rank as the top-grossing R-rated horror film ever domestically, although its worldwide tally of $366 million puts it well behind Jaws' global cume of $477 million. Weapons was the seventh Warner Bros. release of the year to open in first place, an unrivaled feat, as well as its sixth title in a row to open to more than $40 million domestically, also an unrivaled record.

In a year that's proven a bit soft at the box office, the biggest story (and just plain biggest film, period) is the monstrous power of “Ne Zha 2,” a Chinese CGI animated feature that, during its theatrical release in January, utterly annihilated the likes of “Fantastic Four,” “Superman,” and even “A Minecraft Movie” to become the highest global earning film this year. The competition isn't tight, either: with $2.2 billion grossed so far, it has an absurd $1.2 billion lead over “Lilo & Stitch” and is the fifth highest-earning movie ever, no qualifications needed. “Ne Zha 2” isn't the first Chinese film to challenge Hollywood productions in terms of success, with the country having established itself as a highly important market for global productions. But its sheer impact still heavily outpaces any other Chinese film ever made. By comparison, the second-highest-grossing Chinese film of all-time is 2021's “The Battle at Lake Changjin,” which “only” grossed a lowly $913 million. Even more impressive is “Ne Zha 2” managed to make all that money with barely any help from North American markets: the movie received a limited eight-week U.S. release by CMC Pictures in February, where — per Box Office Mojo — it managed around $20 million. Related Stories The History of Sh*t-Eating on Film — for ‘Saló' Day! Imagining What ‘Saturday Night Fever' Might Have Looked (and Sounded) Like with Original Director John G. Avildsen What unsuspecting viewers will find at the theater is a film that's not really anything like the animated films Hollywood produces: glossy and operatic in its scale, “Ne Zha 2” has a mammoth 150-minute running time that's longer than expected for the average kids' attention span (or the average attention span of a TikTok-rotted adult brain, to be frank). But in its emotional viewpoint and its streak of gleeful potty humor, “Ne Zha 2” is also quite blatantly a movie for children. The closest comparison to make isn't Pixar's “Elio” or Disney's “Zootopia,” but the world of battle Shonen anime like “Dragon Ball Z” or “Naruto,” long shows characterized by excitable teen boys engaging in nonstop, over-the-top brawls with their own specialized power sets. Like many products of this genre, “Ne Zha 2” can occasionally veer on the numbing, its barrage of setpieces blending in together into one amorphous blob. As its title makes clear, “Ne Zha 2” is a sequel, and anyone who hasn't taken the time to study up on the original 2019 “Ne Zha” is going to inevitably be a bit confused by this one, which starts with a very brief recap of the first movie, but nonetheless plunges the audience directly into this fantasy version of China with little context or effort to handhold. For American audiences this will inevitably jar, given how much the characters and story takes inspiration from the 16th-century novel “Investiture of the Gods” and various mythological and folk figures from Chinese history. After an opening that starts immediately after the first film introducing the titular Ne Zha and his best friend Ao Bing as spirits whose bodies need to be rebirthed, followed by a massive war sequence between characters just introduced, you would not be forgiven for getting a headache trying to keep up. In “Ne Zha 2,” master Taiyi Zhenren recreates their bodies, only for Ao Bing to lose his body in an attack from the dragons — led by the main villain, the sniveling but sympathetic Shen Gongbao — who mistakenly attack their hometown under the belief he is dead. With Ao Bing's spirit now in Ne Zha's body, the two manage a truce with dragons to venture to the land of the heavenly Chan sect and complete three tasks that will grant them immortality and restore Ao Bing's body. The sheer amount of toilet humor — there's a lot of mucus, snot, and jokes about people drinking piss stuffed into one film — often proves more annoying than fun. Luckily, things click into place when Ne Zha begins his trials, and the tension between using Ao Bing's greater power to win and remaining true to his own misfit self begins to wear at him. The other characters emerge as complex figures rather than stock archtypes, as the Chan sect holds obvious secrets and biases towards demons while Shen Gongbao's hidden soft side comes to light. Most importantly, the trials gives “Ne Zha 2” a framework to showcase some of the most impressive and vibrant 3D animation that has been seen on film in quite some time. The product of roughly 138 Chinese companies and around 4,000 individual animators, “Ne Zha 2” looks vibrant and alive in every frame, striking an unusual balance between anime-inspired exaggeration and realism that works shockingly well in practice. Then there's the action, which melds influences from anime, wuxia, and good old-fashioned “Looney Tune” pratfalls to create some jaw-dropping setpieces that zig and zag in new directions; you never know how a brawl will resolve or what a character will do next, and that unpredictability allows for real exhilaration. In one stunning shot, two hordes of warriors on rival sides of a conflict are seen from afar, like two waves crashing into each other. The rest of the cast is mostly unknowns or professional voice actors, including Crystal Lee and Aleks Le, a winning double act as Ne Zha and Ao Bing. Occasionally, the dialogue doesn't quite match up with the character's mouth flaps, but it's a minor distraction in a mostly seamless experience. All dubbing inevitably invites a debate over whether or not it's necessary or if English speakers should learn to appreciate subtitles, but “Ne Zha 2” has a good case for why it's necessary. When a movie is as stuffed with detail and action as this, better to make sure the audience has their eyes on the whole screen rather than just a tiny third of it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's fitting that Peacemaker season two should focus on alternate realities and new beginnings, as change has come to define the DC Universe since we last enjoyed the sordid exploits of Christopher Smith (John Cena). Story-wise, the fallout from last season's astonishingly violent Butterfly invasion sets a mood best described—at least in this week's premiere—as “gloomy.” Chris, along with his best buddy Eagly (a chirpy digital triumph voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), has relocated from that flag-festooned trailer from season one into his father's house, which he inherited after he killed Auggie Smith (Robert Patrick), the racist supervillain known as the White Dragon. This home is less a place for closure and one for tearing open old wounds, a dwelling where Chris can confront the regret and abuse that have since calcified into his toxic antihero persona, The Peacemaker. “I'm the hardcore shit now—that's what I do,” she says, awkwardly jamming out to Hanoi Rocks' “Don't You Ever Leave Me” in her beige-colored sedan and holding court in a filthy motel room, or “the worst level of Grand Theft Auto,” as Economos (Steve Agee) later puts it. Adebayo has evolved into a full-on Midwestern rocker washout, an unexpected turn for her character that Brooks manages to render both adorable and sad. Harcourt's inability to connect puts up some insurmountable barriers of their own. Take her and Chris's inevitable hookup after last season's victory (off-screen, on a party boat): Was this just an adrenaline-sating fling, or the beginning of something more? Why are Chris and Harcourt left to suffer their failures alone when the obvious path to happiness (or something resembling it) is staring in each other's faces? While Harcourt stalls out, Chris spots a chance to move up in the DCU, with Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn) inviting Peacemaker to audition for the Justice Gang. “I don't want to be a joke anymore,” he tells Adebayo as she drops him off. It's hostile, degrading, and, once his body count (of both kinds) is questioned, demoralizing. “I don't want to be ruled by past experiences and anger” is his sincere confession, reduced to background noise amid fratty banter about asses and Hawkgirl's new carb-light popcorn diet. This crescendo of failure erupts into the premiere's set piece: an orgy set in Auggie's living room, where breasts, butts, and swinging dongs flail about as Chris puts copious amounts of powder in his nose, a pity party for one in a sea of willing flesh. Despite his emotional isolation, Chris isn't completely alone: Economos surveys his home—between quizzing Vigilante (Freddy Stroma) on all things owls, natch—on behalf of Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo), father to Rick Jr. (Joel Kinnaman), who was killed by Peacemaker way back in The Suicide Squad. is an unexpected development following Adebayo's whistleblowing; he can now abuse the unit's resources to spy on his hated enemy, waiting for Chris to make one wrong move so Flag can cut loose with a long-gestating vengeance. For now, signs of Gunn's larger narrative architecture hum faintly at the edges: Cleavis Thornwaite (Michael Ian Black in Tucker Carlson mode) blares paranoia about breakouts at Belle Reve and Arkham Asylum (cameos forthcoming? ), and we discover that Chris' interdimensional arsenal shares energy signatures with the pocket dimension Lex Luthor (Nicolas Hoult) used to rip Metropolis a new one during Superman. Parallel universes are narrative devices that literalize regret and rely almost entirely on easy gimmicks, like dramatic what-ifs, strange new character skins, and inverted pop-culture references. (The amount of hair metal discrepancies in Chris's parallel-Earth bedroom is fodder enough for its own article.) What will matter this season, not just for Chris but the series around him, is what Gunn mines from this premise, how he manages to poignantly explore the ache of what could have been while also carving out an R-rated alcove for his tawdry, Troma-tinted tendencies. More than simply presenting the disparity of two lives, one with love and one without, this moment demonstrates reality's many injustices, where personal choices yield cruel, unbending consequences that reverberate across generations. Not too bad for a show that presented us an engorged dick just moments earlier. Across his DC tenure, John Cena has nurtured Chris Smith from cartoon thug to a character defined by his hangdog, Keatonesque features, a maudlin bruiser whose granite-sculpted mug reveals vulnerability that transcends Peacemaker‘s rock-‘n'-roll bravado. Chris is a man white-knuckling his way to decency, still undone by substances and sex, still haunted by the shadow of Rick Flag and his hate-saturated father. In this sense, Peacemaker has landed on its richest terrain yet. The DCU at large is still cooling after its seismic reset, experimenting with tone and grasping for coherence. Gunn doesn't stabilize things through grandeur; instead, he zeroes in on the smaller, more scalable intimacies of arrested development, thwarted love, the paths never taken—the elements that make growth possible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HBO's True Detective franchise has always prided itself on bringing in big-name talent to flesh out its various highly flawed crime solvers, with a frankly ludicrous number of current and future Oscar nominees and winners cycling through its anthology show seasons. Those episodes starred Jodie Foster and Kali Reis as its crimesolvers, investigating disappearances in a remote town in Alaska; the new season will reportedly mix things up a bit, instead zooming over to New York's Jamaica Bay. That being said, he feels like a pretty natural fit for True Detective, which is usually as much about exploring its characters' fucked-up moralities as it is actual criminal investigation; it's not hard to imagine the guy who brought us Bad Lieutenant: Port Of Call New Orleans fitting in with the show's roster of oddball cops.
