                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, speaks during a hearing on Capitol Hill, Thursday, May 2, 2024, in Washington. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth meet with members of the National Guard at Union Station in Washington, Wednesday, Aug. 20, 2025. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired a general whose agency's initial intelligence assessment of damage to Iranian nuclear sites from U.S. strikes angered President Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the decision and a White House official. Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse will no longer serve as head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. It found that Iran's nuclear program has been set back only a few months by the U.S. strikes, contradicting assertions from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a news conference following the June strikes, Hegseth lambasted the press for what he claimed was an anti-military bias but did not offer any direct evidence of the destruction of Iranian nuclear production facilities. Earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that the Air Force's top uniformed officer, Gen. David Allvin, planned to retire two years early. And the Office of the Director of National Intelligence — which is responsible for coordinating the work of 18 intelligence agencies, including DIA — announced that it would slash its staff and budget. The firing of Kruse was first reported by The Washington Post.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Audrey Strauss, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, points to a photo of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, during a news conference in New York on July 2, 2020. The Justice Department on Friday released transcripts of interviews its No. 2 official did with Jeffrey Epstein's imprisoned former girlfriend as the Trump administration scrambles to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose a trove of records from the sex-trafficking case. The disclosure represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass. By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from President Donald Trump's base even as they continue to sit on other evidence they had suggested was being prepared for public release.

It found that Iran's nuclear program has been set back only a few months by the U.S. strikes, contradicting assertions from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Trump says Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business. Speaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan — which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China. After her interview, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida where she had been serving a 20-year sentence to a minimum security prison camp in Texas. The Epstein case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financer's social connections over the years to prominent figures including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Trump, who has said his relationship with Epstein ended years before. “The Committee intends to make these records public after thorough review to ensure any victims' identification and child sexual abuse material are redacted,” a spokesperson for Oversight Committee Chair James Comer said. House Democrats seized on the issue and ultimately helped push Comer to subpoena the DOJ for documents along with every living U.S. attorney general as well as Bill and Hillary Clinton. “I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript. Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from jail in Tennessee on Friday so he can rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. Although Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed.

By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from President Donald Trump's base even as they continue to sit on other evidence they had suggested was being prepared for public release. Trump is filing an appeal after a judge said his executive order targeting a prominent law firm violated the firm's First Amendment rights. Susman Godfrey was one of several law firms targeted by Trump's executive orders, and the firm sued in April. In late June, District Court Judge Loren AliKhan granted summary judgment in Susman Godfrey's favor, noting that noting that by that point every court to have considered a challenge to the law-firm-related orders had found “grave constitutional violations.” The President is also appealing rulings in other cases brought by law firms. Acknowledging the change announced earlier Friday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth tweeted a news story about his order for troops to carry guns and said, “Common Sense.” “We're going to see whether or not they have a meeting,” Trump told reporters. Trump said he had begun making arrangements for a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting on Monday soon after concluding White House talks with Zelenskyy and European leaders and speaking by phone with Putin. Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, made clear on Friday that Putin won't sit-down with Zelenskyy until Ukraine agrees to certain concessions. The president said he called earlier this month for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign after reading something written by Arkansas Republican senator. Muriel Bowser generally avoids directly criticizing President Donald Trump. Even when she is being harshly critical of Trump's decisions — publicly stating that his declaration of a federal crime emergency in Washington “makes no sense” — Bowser sometimes seems to structure her statements so as to avoid actually saying Trump's name. Trump, meanwhile, seems to be escalating his attacks on Bowser. In a 2 a.m. Friday social media post, Trump wrote, “Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen, including a complete and total Federal takeover of the City!” Hours later in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters, “Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor for long.” “Trump is once again putting armed military onto the streets of an American city. As a federal district, the local government's powers are broadly delegated to it Congress, leaving local officials few avenues to formally block or protest Trump's plan. City Council Chair Phil Mendelson wrote on social media that he'd discussed “the affects of the so-called crime emergency,” among other topics, with Washington residents at a town hall last night. Putin invaded Ukraine more than three years ago, and Trump has been frustrated by his inability to resolve the war. Referring to the photo, Trump said, “I thought it was a nice picture of him. After Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a pause in providing U.S. visas to commercial truck drivers, the Trump administration says it applies to certain foreign applicants. The State Department said Friday that the pause affects those seeking permission to drive a truck under visas for H-2B temporary nonagricultural workers, E-2 investors in U.S. businesses or EB-3 skilled workers. It said the government is launching a review of the way it screens foreign drivers and that “enhanced vetting” will apply to those who don't now hold valid visas. “Applicants must demonstrate the necessary skills, experience, and English language proficiency required to safely operate these vehicles on America's roads,” the department said. President Donald Trump holds the FIFA World Cup Winners Trophy as FIFA President Gianni Infantino, right, and Vice President JD Vance watch, during an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington. Touching the World Cup trophy is an honor usually reserved for countries that win it. But organizers of the 2026 World Cup have made an exception for Trump. FIFA President Gianni Infantino visited the Oval Office on Friday and noted of the trophy, “Only the FIFA presidents, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it because it's for winners only.”Then, he added to Trump, “And, since you are a winner, of course you can as well.” The president did just that, then responded, “It's pretty heavy.” He later called the trophy “a beautiful piece of gold” and joked about keeping it and displaying in the Oval Office — which Trump has redone in a gaudy, gold-hued décor. Trump was subsequently presented with a ticket to next year's World Cup final, which organizers said was the first ticket available for the upcoming tournament. President Donald Trump, from right, speaks as Vice President JD Vance and Richard Grenell, president of the Kennedy Center Board of Trustees, listen during an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington. Trump usually wears a tie in the Oval Office, as do top aides and other officials who visit. But in an unusual move, not only did Trump not wear a tie but none of the men standing around him did either. It wasn't clear why they wore the unified look. The president suggested that other cities will receive similar treatment to D.C. “I think Chicago will be our next,” he said. Trump said people in Chicago are “screaming for us to come.” Vice President JD Vance says it's not the case that the Trump administration is targeting former national security adviser John Bolton because he's a vocal critic of President Donald Trump. He said the inquiry centers in part on classified documents as well as what he said was a “broad concern” about Bolton. He said if no crime is found during the investigation, no prosecution will be brought, but that if a crime is found “Ambassador Bolton will get his day in court.” He said “no, not at all” when asked if Bolton was being pursued because of his criticism of Trump and, that if that were the case, “we would just throw out prosecutions willy-nilly.” ESPN had previously reported that the draw would be held in Las Vegas. The federal investigation follows a complaint by multiple professors accusing the university of favoring faculty candidates based on diversity considerations rather than their credentials. President Trump's announcement Friday that he would seek $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington D.C. will likely be received with ironic eyerolls from the local government. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the D.C. Council have spent most of 2025 (prior to the current federal takeover crisis) dealing with an artificial budget crisis created by this Congress. An obscure change in a federal government funding bill forced the district's government to revert to its 2024 budget parameters, effectively cutting $1.1 billion from its previously balanced budget midway through the financial year. Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney speaks with media during a news conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Wednesday, July 30, 2025. Canada is dropping retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, a government official familiar with the matter said Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly ahead of the expected announcement by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. “We're doing some very detailed renovations, fixing things are broken. “We'll be doing the Lincoln Bathroom which was Art Deco.” He said of the project, “We're making it actually incredible.” Trump has already made extensive changes to the White House, including installing patio seating around the Rose Garden and promising to build a ballroom. “We're going to be raising about $2 billion from Congress,” the president told reporters. President Donald Trump speaks at The People's House museum, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington. The president, for a while, has been covering bruising on the back of his hand with makeup that doesn't match his skin tone. A large spread of makeup could be seen on the back of his hand on Friday that appeared more pronounced than usual. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Trump's hand bruising is “consistent” with irritation from his “frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin.” Florida Sen. Joe Gruters watches during a legislative session April 30, 2021, at the Capitol in Tallahassee, Fla. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File) Republican National Committee members elected Gruters on Friday at their summer meeting in Georgia. President, thank you for your faith in me,” Gruters said after the vote. Gruters is a Florida state lawmaker and former state party chairman who was a Trump ally even before the billionaire real estate and marketing mogul first ran for president. Gruters succeeds Michael Whatley, who stepped down to run for U.S. Senate in North Carolina. Republicans hope new maps pushed by President Trump will produce five new GOP seats in a bid to hold their slim majority in the U.S. House. Texas' gerrymandering effort has triggered a ripple effect across several states. President Donald Trump speaks with members of law enforcement and National Guard soldiers, Thursday, Aug. 21, 2025, in Washington. And it comes as nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city, with the arrival this week of hundreds of troops from several Republican-led states. The Pentagon and Army said last week that troops would not carry weapons. His comments follow the White House's decision to start a TikTok account this week. But Trump has extended the platform's shutdown deadline repeatedly since taking office for his second term. President Donald Trump speaks at The People's House museum, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington. The president, in his comments to reporters at the White House Historical Association, said he's told Attorney General Pam Bondi to “do what you have to do” and that he doesn't want to know about their work, but suggested he could be much more involved if he chose, saying, “I could know about it. “I'm actually the chief law enforcement officer,” he said. “We're going to see if Putin and Zelenskyy will be working together. They don't get along too well for obvious reasons. “And we'll see whether or not I would have to be there. Trump has previously suggested that the White House is working to facilitate a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting in the short term, and that a subsequent, trilateral meeting involving those two leaders and Trump would likely come next. Fed Governor Lisa Cook is under fire from Trump after an administration official alleged Wednesday that she'd falsely claimed two homes as primary residences in 2021. “I'll fire her if she doesn't resign.” Trump said Friday. His comment came as Cook is attending the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, with Chair Jerome Powell. If Trump is able to oust Cook, he could install a loyalist and extend greater control over the Fed, traditionally independent from day-to-day politics. The president can't fire a Fed governor over a disagreement on rates, but can “for cause,” which typically means malfeasance or neglect of duty. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered that National Guard troops patrolling the streets of Washington for President Trump's crackdown will be armed, the Pentagon said Friday. He told reporters at an earlier stop that he planned to show them marble that would be used in sprucing up the center, along with other planned renovations such as painting the columns from gold to white. President Donald Trump blasted his former national security adviser John Bolton, calling him “a lowlife” and “not a smart guy” but insisted he knows “nothing about” the FBI raids Friday morning of Bolton's home and office FBI agents carry empty boxes to former national security adviser John Bolton's house, Friday, August. An FBI agent walks to the front entrance of ex-Trump national security adviser John Bolton's Washington office, Friday, Aug 22, 2025. President Donald Trump speaks as Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association, listens, during a visit to The People's House museum, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington. In a high-profile speech that will be closely watched at the White House and on Wall Street, Powell said there are risks of both rising unemployment and stubbornly higher inflation. “The stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,” Powell said in prepared remarks. That suggests the Fed will continue to evaluate jobs and inflation data as it decides whether to cut rates, including at its next meeting Sept. 16-17. Powell has come under relentless criticism from President Trump for not rapidly cutting rates sooner.

President Donald Trump speaks with members of law enforcement and National Guard soldiers, Thursday, Aug. 21, 2025, in Washington. In an overnight social media post, Trump said he was considering “a complete and total Federal takeover of the City!” He's already seized control of the local police department for 30 days, which could be extended with congressional approval. “Mayor Muriel Bowser must immediately stop giving false and highly inaccurate crime figures, or bad things will happen,” the president wrote.</p>

But I feel that it's better this way,” Trump said. Bolton had said in interviews this year that he was mindful that he could be scrutinized, telling the AP in January shortly before Trump took office, “Anybody who ever disagrees with Trump has to worry about retribution. An FBI search like the one at Bolton's properties requires authorization from a federal magistrate judge. It wasn't immediately clear what information authorities submitted to demonstrate that they had probable cause of a crime, though the Justice Department years ago launched an investigation into whether Bolton improperly disclosed classified information in a book manuscript he had written. Vice President JD Vance denied in an NBC News interview on Friday that Bolton was being targeted because of his criticism of Trump, “If there's no crime here, we're not going to prosecute it. If there is a crime here, of course, Ambassador Bolton will get his day in court. Bolton was not home for the search of his home, but after it started, he was spotted Friday morning standing in the lobby of the Washington building where he keeps an office and talking to two people with “FBI” visible on their vests. He left a few minutes later and appeared to have gone upstairs in the building. Agents were seen taking bags into the office building through a back entrance. Messages left with a spokesperson for Bolton were not immediately returned, and a lawyer who has represented Bolton had no immediate comment. The FBI reportedly is investigating an ex-Trump national security adviser. The Justice Department had no comment, but leaders appeared to cryptically refer to the searches in a series of social media posts Friday morning. FBI Director Kash Patel, who included Bolton on a list of “members of the Executive Branch Deep State” in a 2023 book he wrote, posted on X: “NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission.” Attorney General Pam Bondi shared his post, adding: “America's safety isn't negotiable. The Justice Department is separately conducting mortgage fraud investigations into Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump and his company, and ex-Trump prosecutor Jack Smith faces an investigation from an independent watchdog office. Schiff and James have vigorously denied any wrongdoing through their lawyers. Patel said in a Fox Business Channel interview this week that the Mar-a-Lago search represented a “total weaponization and politicization” of the bureau, and Trump himself referenced it on Friday, telling reporters: “I guess his house was raided today, but my house was raided, also.” He faced scrutiny during the first Trump administration over a book he wrote about his time in government that officials argued disclosed classified information. To make its case, the Justice Department in 2020 submitted sworn statements from senior White House officials, including then-National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, asserting that Bolton's manuscript included classified information that could harm national security if exposed. Bolton's lawyers have said he moved forward with the book after a White House National Security Council official, with whom Bolton had worked for months, said the manuscript no longer contained classified information. Bolton's harshly critical book, “The Room Where It Happened,” portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy and said he “saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.” Trump responded by slamming Bolton as a “crazy” warmonger who would have led the country into “World War Six.” Bolton served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush and also held positions in President Ronald Reagan's administration. Trump, on his first day back in office this year, revoked the security clearances of more than four dozen former intelligence officials, including Bolton. The handling of classified information by top government officials has been a politically loaded topic in recent years. Associated Press writers Michelle L. Price, Nathan Ellgren, Lindsay Whitehurst, Alanna Durkin Richer, Byron Tau and Jill Colvin contributed to this report.</p>

Multiple people are dead, including children, after a tour bus traveling from Niagra Falls to New York City on Friday crashed and rolled over on the highway in Genesee County, New York. The crash, which involved a tractor-trailer and a tour bus, happened near mile marker 4039, according to New York State Police. The tour bus was carrying about 50 passengers, troopers said. A passenger manifest provided by the bus company confirms 52 individuals, including the driver, were on board. Trooper James O'Callaghan told Fox News Digital at least three people are dead and multiple people are unaccounted for. Some passengers were ejected from the bus and others likely remain trapped underneath it. Additional ambulances and medical support have been requested. At least four Mercy Flight helicopters have been called to the scene, Pembroke town officials told Fox News Digital. Video footage is being recovered from the bus, and the tour company is cooperating with state police. Closures caused a traffic diversion on the New York highway. Kathy Hochul said she had been briefed. "My team is coordinating closely with [New York State Police] and local officials who are working to rescue and provide assistance to everyone involved," Hochul wrote in an X post. New York State Police confirmed all lanes are closed. New York State Thruway Authority officials said to avoid the area. Pembroke is a rural town in Genesee County, about 45 minutes from Buffalo. It travels from Seattle, Washington to Boston, Massachusetts. Multiple people are dead after a tour bus crash in New York.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump told reporters he knows “nothing” about the probe but expects to be briefed later today. • Redistricting efforts: The Texas Senate is poised to pass a Republican-drawn congressional map today that would create five more GOP-leaning House districts, a move backed by Trump. And in California, lawmakers passed three bills to temporarily redraw their state's congressional maps — a counterpunch to efforts in GOP-led states. • Trump eyes expanded crackdown: The president said yesterday he would expand the law enforcement and National Guard crackdown he ordered in Washington, DC, this month to other jurisdictions. Vice President JD Vance deflected when asked today if the FBI search of John Bolton's home and office was retribution for his criticism of President Donald Trump's foreign policy knowledge, saying in part that the media and Americans should “let the investigation unfold.” “We're in the very early stages of an ongoing investigation into John Bolton. I will say we're going to let that investigation proceed,” Vance said. CNN observed FBI personnel at Bolton's house in the Washington, DC, area this morning. They were seen speaking to a person on the porch of the house, and at least four to six agents were seen going inside. President Donald Trump was asked earlier this morning about the FBI search of his former national security adviser John Bolton's home. The FBI conducted a court-authorized search at John Bolton's home as part of a national security investigation into whether he disclosed classified information in his 2020 book, according to two people familiar with the matter. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced he's lifting retaliatory tariffs that were placed on an extensive list of American goods earlier this year. Carney said Trump specifically told him that removing these tariffs would kick-start trade negotiations. Carney sought to establish throughout a news conference that he's not capitulating to Trump by removing tariffs but rather was “matching” the US, which hasn't charged duties on Canadian goods that comply with USMCA. More context: Canada is America's top export market and has been one of the only countries so far to impose retaliatory tariffs on American goods. It comes after Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney spoke yesterday. Today's move was viewed as a goodwill gesture by the White House. “We welcome this move by Canada, which is long overdue,” a White House official told CNN. This post has been updated with the latest from Carney's announcement. President Donald Trump is planning to announce this afternoon that the 2026 World Cup draw will occur at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, on December 5, according to a senior White House official. This year's World Cup features more teams than ever before as FIFA expanded the tournament to 48 teams for the first time. Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino have developed a close relationship during his two terms in office and Infantino has frequently been spotted at the White House and accompanying the president at other events, including the trophy ceremony at the Club World Cup final earlier this summer. The Republican National Committee elected Florida state Sen. Joe Gruters as its new chair today at a committee meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, replacing outgoing chairman Michael Whatley, who is running for US Senate in North Carolina. “No, I love the chairman, what an incredible honor.” Gruters, who previously served as the RNC's treasurer, ran unopposed, with the backing of President Donald Trump making his election a formality. More background: Gruters succeeds Whatley, who took the helm of the national party in 2024 following former RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel's exit amid tensions with Trump. After announcing his departure, Whatley had also touted Gruters' status as an ally to the president. The new chair takes over an RNC with an exceptionally strong balance sheet, having amassed more than $80 million in cash on hand — more than five times its Democratic counterpart. A story to watch: Tension between Gruters and Florida Gov. DeSantis, who has kept the door open to another White House bid, could now find himself running in a future presidential primary partially controlled by an RNC chairman he has repeatedly spurned. But publicly released data from the Metropolitan Police Department shows that the district previously had multiple stretches of one week or longer without any homicides earlier this year. “DC was a hellhole, and now it's safe,” Trump told reporters this morning. There were no murders reported from May 4 through May 11, April 11 to 17, and a more than two-week-long period from February 25 through March 12. There have been a total of 89 homicides so far in 2025, according to the district's data. In some cases, murders are confirmed and added into the public MPD database weeks or months after they occur, so it's possible that additional cases will be added. A separate federal magistrate authorized the search of former national security adviser John Bolton's office in DC, a source familiar with the matter told CNN's Kristen Holmes. President Donald Trump made an unscheduled visit this morning to “The People's House: A White House Experience” exhibit, a White House Historical Association-sponsored museum located across the street from the White House that includes miniature replicas of the home's historic rooms and a life-size Oval Office. The visit comes after CNN reported that tours to the real White House have been temporarily halted as construction is expected to begin next month on a sweeping, 90,000-square-foot ballroom addition to the White House spearheaded by Trump. White House Historical Association President Stewart McLaurin hosted Trump at the exhibit earlier today, where Trump was spotted perusing the gift shop. “We have this wonderful People's House gallery, so that while the White House is closed for tours for this wonderful ballroom to be built, we have this 33,000-square-foot experience open seven days a week, free to the public. So until that's built and reopened, we're happy to welcome everyone here,” McLaurin said. CNN saw several unmarked federal vehicles outside Bolton's office building in downtown Washington this morning. As the FBI conducts searches of John Bolton's home and office, here's a bit about him: Bolton served as the US ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2006 and as national security adviser from April 2018 to September 2019, when President Donald Trump fired him, saying he “strongly disagreed with many” of Bolton's positions. Within hours of taking office this January, Trump terminated the Secret Service detail, which was assigned to Bolton due to threats against him from Iran. Bolton published a book in 2020 in which he claimed the president was woefully under informed on matters of foreign policy, obsessed with shaping his media legacy, and that Trump asked the leaders of Ukraine and China to help him win the 2020 election. Here's what he discussed with CNN's Brianna Keilar last night concerning Trump's rhetoric on the Russia-Ukraine war: But he also tried to stress his independence from the department. But I feel that it's better this way,” Trump added. President Donald Trump told reporters today he will speak to China President Xi Jinping “at the right time” about TikTok, as Trump has repeatedly pushed off a deadline for the app's parent company to either divest or face a US ban. “I haven't spoken to President Xi about it. At the right time, when we're set, I'll do it. More on TikTok: Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline of a sale-or-ban law passed under former President Joe Biden's administration, with the new deadline less than a month away on September 17. The latest delay in June kept the app accessible for its 170 million American users, despite legislation that passed last year due to bipartisan concerns that TikTok's Chinese ownership poses a US national security risk. Both the United States and China are seeking leverage in ongoing tense trade talks. One week after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump was noncommittal on his ability to arrange a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Putin, saying that the two are “like oil and vinegar.” “They don't get along too well, for obvious reasons, but we'll see,” Trump said. “And then we'll see whether or not I would have to be there.” The president's remarks came after Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier today that there were no plans for a meeting between the two leaders. Trump said earlier this week that Putin and Zelensky would meet as part of his push to end the Russia-Ukraine war. But those plans have yet to materialize, and the US has made little apparent progress in convincing the two sides to hold direct talks. President Donald Trump just made remarks to reporters, saying that he knows “nothing” about the FBI search at his former national security adviser John Bolton's home. CNN observed FBI personnel at Bolton's house in the Washington, DC, area earlier. The FBI had also planned to search Bolton's office this morning, according to a source familiar with the investigation, though it was unclear when that search would be conducted. The FBI is also investigating whether former national security adviser John Bolton disclosed classified information outside of his 2020 book, potentially to clients or media members, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Investigators are focused on the book, but are also exploring other possible leaks as a form of “weaponization,” the source said. Some context: The search of former national security adviser John Bolton's home stems from a now-resumed investigation into whether he disclosed classified information in his 2020 book, the source said. President Donald Trump had previously threatened to jail Bolton over the book, and the Justice Department launched an investigation into possible mishandling of classified information. The book included material that initially was cleared for publication by career officials at the White House, but Trump political appointees sought to overturn that approval.

Fox News' David Spunt provides details on the FBI raid at former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton's home in Maryland as FBI Director Kash Patel tweets, 'NO ONE is above the law.' The FBI launched a raid Friday morning into the home and office of John Bolton — President Donald Trump's national security advisor from 2018 and 2019 — months after Trump yanked Bolton's security clearance in January upon taking office. The two men have a long history of trading barbs following Bolton's exit from Trump's first administration — all of which escalated after Bolton sought to publish a memoir in 2020 that included some unflattering details about his time in the White House. While Trump has labeled Bolton a "wacko" and a "dope," Bolton has had his fair share of harsh words for the president. "I don't think he's fit for office," Bolton said in an interview with ABC News in June 2020, ahead of his memoir's release. Former national security adviser John Bolton gestures while speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "There really isn't any guiding principle that I was able to discern other than what's good for Donald Trump's reelection," Bolton said at the time. Bolton also characterized Trump as lacking focus on policy while being very fixated on himself — to the detriment of national security matters. "His policymaking is so incoherent, so unfocused, so unstructured, so wrapped around his own personal political fortunes, that mistakes are being made that will have grave consequences for the national security of the United States," Bolton also said in an ABC interview in June 2020. The first Trump administration sought to block the release of Bolton's memoir, "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," and asserted it contained classified material. The book alleged that Trump "pleaded" Chinese President Xi Jinping to support Trump's reelection campaign, and called the president "stunningly uninformed." Former national security adviser John Bolton takes part in a discussion on global leadership at Vanderbilt University on Feb. 19, 2020. "Many of the ridiculous statements he attributes to me were never made, pure fiction," Trump said in a social media post June 18, 2020. "Just trying to get even for firing him like the sick puppy he is!" In this Dec. 13, 2018 photo, national security adviser John Bolton unveils the Trump Administration's Africa Strategy at the Heritage Foundation in Washington. "Wacko John Bolton's ‘exceedingly tedious'(New York Times) book is made up of lies & fake stories. Said all good about me, in print, until the day I fired him," Trump said in a separate social media post on June 18, 2020. Never had a clue, was ostracized & happily dumped. Bolton departed his post at the White House in September 2019. While Bolton said that he left due to his own volition, Trump claimed that he fired Bolton. Bolton was not arrested or taken into custody following the raid on his home and office Friday. Trump told reporters Friday that he had no knowledge of the raid and learned about it watching TV. "But he could be a very unpatriotic. I mean, we're going to find out. Diana Stancy is a politics reporter with Fox News Digital covering the White House.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Armagost chose to walk away rather than face accountability for his actions,” said Democratic state Rep. Yara Zokaie, the subject of the picture in question. Democrats indicated that they are exploring steps for the censure resolution. “Resigning may remove him from this chamber, but it does not erase the harm he caused or the responsibility he bears for perpetuating a culture of violence against women,” Zokaie continued. Armagost shared the picture in a private group chat with fellow Republicans. “That's awful,” Republican state Rep. Brandi Bradley wrote in the group chat. “I didn't know it was dress like a stripper day.” The image was then posted online on an anonymous, conservative social media account. Democratic leadership in Colorado condemned Armagost's actions ahead of the vote. Assistant House Majority Leader Jennifer Bacon called it “unbecoming” of an elected official. Armagost has declined to comment on why he took the picture. “My trust with a number of Republican colleagues is completely broken and will not be rebuilt,” Zokaie said, according to Colorado Public Radio.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both Republican and Democratic leaders in Virginia are condemning a sign that was shown at a protest in Arlington County that targeted Republican Lt. Gov. The Arlington school board was meeting on Wednesday to discuss its transgender bathroom policy in the face of threats of federal funding cuts, and transgender rights protesters were outside. One person at the protest was holding a sign that is being condemned as racist. “Hey Winsome, you have a gender neutral bathroom in your house,” one side of the sign read, with the other side reading, “Hey Winsome, if trans can't share your bathroom, then Blacks can't share my water fountain.” Earle-Sears, the Republican candidate for governor in the 2025 election, said on social media that she was “disgusted, but not surprised.” There is no place for this disgusting hatred in our Commonwealth. Anyone who doesn't condemn this sign is complicit in approving it,” she continued. Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, condemned the sign in a statement, calling it “racist, abhorrent, and unacceptable.” “It was satire meant to provoke conversation around the absurdity of prejudice. Other elected officials in Virginia have condemned the language. @winwithwinsome — and Virginia — deserve better,” Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares said on social media. Been teaching my kids – and students – that for years. We should insist on betting the better angels of our nature,” Democratic state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg said in a social media statement.

Thursday's arrests in Washington, D.C. amid the Trump administration's federal crime crackdown included a suspected member of the brutal Salvadoran street gang MS-13. "Just yesterday we made 40 arrests, took 5 more illegal firearms off our streets, and had 36 ICE arrests—including a suspected MS-13 gang member," Attorney General Pam Bondi said on X on Friday morning. She thanked Trump for his "unwavering support to make DC safe again!" Pam Bondi, US attorney general, during a swearing-in ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, May 6, 2025. On Aug. 15, Bondi said the total number of arrests was 189, meaning that over the past week, federal authorities have arrested 530 suspected criminals, an average of almost 76 per day.

The suspects have been charged with crimes including homicide, drug trafficking, possession of illegal firearms and child sex crimes. With mounting criminal cases in the nation's capital, the Trump administration said Thursday that it was deploying Judge Advocate General (JAG) attorneys, who are military lawyers, to prosecute misdemeanors. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. confirmed to Fox News Digital that 20 JAGs will handle the cases. "The assignment of 20 JAGs to my office is further proof of President Trump's commitment to fighting and reducing crime in the district," U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Trump's new fee will make the USAID cuts look like a rounding error in some countries. Immigrant rights activist Guerline Jozef can't count the number of frantic texts, calls, and emails she gets daily from Haitians in the United States terrified that some day soon, they won't be able to feed their families anymore. Not just those in the US, but their “mother, sister, niece, a cousin, a church member” back in Haiti, who heavily depend on their breadwinner abroad to survive. “Haiti is literally being held together by those of us who are outside of the country and sending money back home.” Haiti's decades-long humanitarian crisis deepens each day, forcing immigrants to send record-high payments back home in recent years. Each Haitian immigrant living abroad supports a dozen or so friends, family, or community members in their home country, many of whom rely on those payments to survive, Jozef says. The 1 percent tax passed as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill enacted by Congress last month and will go into effect starting January 1, 2026. Though 1 percent might not sound like much, it could mean billions of dollars that never reach grandparents who need medical care, homes that fall into disrepair, and girls unable to stay in school. About 200 million immigrant workers support about 800 million family members in their home countries each year — together, that's roughly one in eight people worldwide. For every dollar that a wealthy nation sends in foreign aid, immigrants send almost four times as much back home, totaling over $700 billion worldwide — enough to buy up every home for sale in the US and still have billions to spare. When the tax goes into effect next year, Haitians could lose about $61 million annually in direct payments for food, shelter, and health care, according to the Center for Global Development. Globally, the losses will add up to about $4.5 billion. The agency's sudden demise has left a multibillion-dollar vacuum for peace building, humanitarian relief, and health infrastructure in dozens of low- and middle-income countries where those funds made a tremendous difference. Many countries — like India, Guatemala, and the Philippines — will lose way more money from this 1 percent tax on remittances than they will from foreign aid cuts. Losing yet another lifeline will be beyond catastrophic — it could further destabilize countries already steeped in crisis. If remittances fall, “it will mean more famine,” Jozef said. Immigrants in the US sent almost $100 billion overseas last year, mostly to low- or middle-income countries, making it the world's largest source of remittances. Every family is different, but most immigrant workers send about 15 percent of their salary or upward of $300 per month back home. Let's say you're an immigrant from Honduras trying to send some extra money home this month to help cover your brother's back-to-school fees. So instead, like most immigrants, you walk up the block to your local money transfer shop. Say, a Western Union nestled in your neighborhood pharmacy, and tell the agent how much money you want to send. In Honduras, your mom walks to the Western Union shop up the street from your elementary school and picks up her cash. It's hard to overstate the importance of these payments. Remittances have been proven to reduce infant mortality, boost school enrollment, and fuel housing construction around the world. Studies show that they play a significant role in helping countries achieve sustainable development goals like clean water for all. “And all administrations, including the Biden administration, just didn't want to pay attention to these issues.” But in many countries, “GDP growth basically depends on remittances.” For example, Nepal's tourism industry raked in a hefty $2.5 billion in 2023, but it was no match for the $11 billion Nepalese workers abroad sent home that year. And in places without food stamps or Medicaid, those payments function as a vast, invisible, global social safety net, ensuring that the world's poorest don't fall through the cracks. More often than not, remittances directly support families' basic needs like food, housing, education, and medical care, filling gaps that traditional aid programs might not reach, said Dulce Guzmán, executive director of Alianza Americas, a network of immigrant-serving groups based in Chicago. “They're a huge pillar for sustaining life in our countries of origin.” “The purpose is not to be mean,” said Ira Mehlman, who works at the anti-immigrant Federation for American Immigration Reform, which the Southern Poverty Law Center defines as a hate group for its hardline stance. “It's no different than if you're cruising along on the highway at 80 miles an hour and you see somebody else getting pulled over for speeding,” he argued. Because taking your foot off the gas here means cutting off millions of vulnerable people from the money they need to survive. Under normal circumstances, remittances rise when foreign aid is cut, but that won't be easy this time around with so many countries hit by both aid cuts and the tax on money transfers. The tax — which to Mehlman's chagrin, a hodgepodge of fintech, free market, and pro-immigrant lobbyists haggled down from 5 percent in an initial proposal — will require senders to pay a 1 percent fee on all cash transfers. Money transfer agents or bank tellers will be required to apply the tax on any cash, money orders, or cashier's checks sent overseas, similar to a restaurant collecting a sales tax on the food and beverages it serves. If businesses fail to collect the tax as required, they're on the hook for paying it themselves along with any penalties or interest fees. But sending money between foreign bank accounts is not as simple as using Venmo or Zelle, which require a US bank account to use — something many immigrants and their families don't have. Despite the rise of app-based providers like Remitly, which is tailor-made for overseas transfers, many immigrants still make the monthly trek to Western Union to send money home because that's what they and their recipients — often elderly parents or grandparents — back home are used to and trust. Without the $1,600 that Damaris Ortega sends home from Texas each month, her mother and three children in El Salvador could never afford to eat meat. Just the basics there — rice, beans, eggs, vegetables — cost “basically your entire salary” each month, she said. If they ever got sick or hurt, her family couldn't afford the gauze, bandages, or medications they'd need to bring to local hospitals that rarely have those on hand. “The contributions we send from here to there — many families there live off of that,” Ortega, an organizer at the immigrant rights group CRECEN Houston, said in Spanish. For Ortega, the tax will mean paying an additional $16 each month on top of the 6 percent fee many already pay on average to businesses like Western Union or MoneyGram. With a new tax on top of existing fees, it means $112 less money for Ortega's family each month, or $1,344 each year. Or zooming out, El Salvador, which is set to be hit hardest per capita by the tax, will lose about $198 million annually when it goes into effect. That's roughly 0.62 percent of the country's entire GDP or a gobsmacking 1.1 percent if you count the $150 million it's projected to lose from USAID cuts too. It's as if the entire US agricultural industry were to disappear overnight. “If it weren't for the support of the community that sends remittances, I think there would be extreme poverty, more than there already is, in our countries,” Ortega said. The good news is that even if the tax reduces remittances to an extent, “people are still going to send that money. It's just going to take a different channel,” said Ananya Kumar, who studies the future of money at the Atlantic Council, a think tank focused on international security. That's especially true for those from rural, poorer, more vulnerable places with less digital and banking infrastructure — and the new tax specifically targets those cash-based transfers. More than one in five adults worldwide still don't have a bank or mobile money account, and that's especially true for women and those living in sub-Saharan Africa, where only about half the population has an account. Many immigrants in the US don't have bank accounts either. While someone who's savvy with a smartphone may be able to send money tax-free, for those without banking or regular internet access, cash is still king — and it will be taxed. Some of those senders could soon begin “moving into the shadows versus having legitimate businesses do it,” said Kumar, which would make them more vulnerable to scammers or criminal networks promising to send the money for less. That'll cover just 0.15 percent of the federal US budget for a year at most. Likewise, if we're calculating generously, the gutting of USAID could save US citizens maybe $5 — one matcha latte pre-matcha shortage — per month. In Liberia, for example, aid cuts from the US alone have been so steep that they're projected to lead to a full 2.6 percent decline in gross national income, the highest rate of any country, on top of which the remittance tax will shave off another 0.16 percent. That's a total of over $100 million lost, more than the Liberian government allocated for education this year, in a country where the average salary is less than $3,000 per year. In Mexico, remittances have already plunged by double-digit percentages in recent months, thanks in part to Trump's immigration crackdown, a growing problem for low-income Mexicans who rely on remittances for up to 30 percent of their income and may soon struggle to afford basic goods. At a recent press conference, President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico quipped in Spanish that if the US “wants to charge taxes, they should go somewhere else — not to Mexico's poorest people” who “receive and live off these remittances.” In an attempt to minimize the damage, she promised to reimburse Mexicans for the tax, and last month, launched a low-fee government debit card that can facilitate tax-free digital transfers. But those solutions are probably too expensive or out of reach for poorer countries, where these payments make the biggest difference. But there's no question that taken as a whole, these policies are “going to further destabilize these countries and push more people to leave,” Guzmán said. In Jozef's words,“the people of Haiti need that money more than President Trump.” It's about “flooding the zone.” It's about throwing a billion strands of spaghetti to the wall at once and seeing what sticks. If millions of people starve as collateral, then that's because the system was broken to begin with. And well, the system was broken to begin with. No country should be so vulnerable, so reliant on income from its citizens employed abroad, that a 1 percent tax could push them over the edge. Yet, remittances and foreign aid remain many countries' best bet for leveling the global playing field and “addressing those root causes” of forced migration in the first place, said Guzmán. For creating the conditions needed so that one day, countries like Haiti and El Salvador won't need remittances anymore. Their citizens won't need to leave at all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FBI conducted a court-authorized search at former national security adviser John Bolton's home and office as part of a renewed investigation into whether he disclosed classified information in his 2020 book, according to two people familiar with the matter. Bolton served as President Donald Trump's national security adviser in his first term 2019, but the president fired him and the two have been at odds ever since. CNN observed FBI personnel at Bolton's house in the Washington, DC, area on Friday morning. They were seen speaking to a person on the porch of the house, and at least four to six agents were seen going inside. The FBI also was searching Bolton's office on Friday morning, according to a source. CNN saw several unmarked federal vehicles the building in downtown Washington. But Vice President JD Vance later said in an interview for Meet the Press with Kristen Welker that “classified documents are certainly part of it, but I think that there's a broad concern about, about Ambassador Bolton.” Vance denied that the search was politically motivated, characterizing it as part of an evidence-gathering operation “driven by the law and not by politics.” “If they ultimately bring a case, it will be because they determine that he has broken the law,” he said. “We're going to be deliberate about that, because we don't think that we should throw people — even if they disagree with us politically, maybe especially if they disagree with us politically — you shouldn't throw people willy-nilly in prison.” Reached by CNN earlier on Friday, Bolton said he was unaware of the FBI activity and was looking into it further. His attorney didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. But I feel that it's better this way,” he said. He also took aim at Bolton, calling him a “low life.” Trump has repeatedly gone after his former national security adviser while in office, including most recently saying this month that the media was “constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton.” The president also terminated Bolton's Secret Service detail within hours of starting his second term in January. During his first term, the president threatened to jail Bolton after his 2020 book, “The Room Where It Happened,” claimed Trump was woefully under-informed on matters of foreign policy and obsessed with shaping his media legacy. The book included material that initially was cleared for publication by career officials at the White House, but Trump political appointees sought to overturn that approval. ‘Trump did not lose, but Putin clearly won': Bolton reacts to Alaska summit Trump and his government have carried out a campaign of retribution in recent months against a wide swath of the president's perceived political enemies, ranging from former Trump officials to members of Congress to the prosecutors who brought cases against the president while he was out of office. Last week, FBI Director Kash Patel declassified and released internal FBI interview notes from a former House Intelligence Committee staffer who first accused former Rep. Adam Schiff in 2017 of directing illegal leaks of classified information about Trump and Russia, in an escalation of Trump's long-standing feud with Schiff. The public nature of the FBI search on Friday at Bolton's house – with agents wearing prominently identifiable “FBI” jackets while entering and exiting the house throughout the morning and key officials appearing to telegraph it on social media – has already led neighbors and friends of Bolton to say the search may be related to political retribution. Top FBI officials posted on social media Friday morning just after 7 am. If the officials are cryptically referring to Bolton, it would be a notable departure of the Bureau's practice of not commenting publicly on investigations, especially as FBI agents are still at the scene. For instance, the hours-long FBI search of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago for classified records in 2022 was conducted with officials in plain clothes, and with the public largely unaware of the search until it was nearly concluded. Trump was indicted by a grand jury for mishandling several national security documents he retained after his first term in office, keeping boxes of classified records in a bathroom, a ballroom and other rooms at his Florida resort, until a Florida-based judge dismissed the case in 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least ten cities in states whose Republican governors are deploying National Guard troops to Washington, DC, had higher rates of violent crime or homicide than DC last year, according to a CNN review of FBI data. Governors from Ohio, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia announced this week that they're sending troops to assist President Donald Trump's crackdown on crime in the nation's capital. Violent crime was already falling in DC, though it still ranks 17th among major cities. Military officials said there were nearly 2,000 soldiers and airmen mobilized in DC as of Thursday afternoon. Governors from the six states previously said they're contributing about 1,000 troops. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, said she wants “to make the most of the additional officer support that we have… to drive down crime.” And DC police chief Pamela Smith said, “We have to get illegal guns off of our streets, and if we have this influx or enhanced presence, it's going to make our city even better.” Still, many Trump critics – including Democratic lawmakers, liberal activists and criminal justice advocates – have blasted his federal takeover of DC. And they've pointed out that some of the states sending National Guard troops have their own crime challenges. No,” Tillis said, flagging red-state cities with higher crime rates like Memphis, and criticizing Trump's federal “micromanaging.” Cleveland had the 2nd-highest overall crime rate last year among US cities with more than 250,000 people, according to a CNN review of FBI statistics from 2024. When it comes to violent crime specifically – which the FBI defines as murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault – two additional Ohio cities had higher rates than DC last year: Toledo and Dayton. Trump says law enforcement crackdown will ‘go on to other places' during appearance at police facility in DC A fourth-generation Cleveland resident, Patton lives in Outhwaite Homes public housing and said more resources are needed to keep people safe. This year, Patton noted, the Trump administration canceled a $2 million federal grant for an anti-gang organization that his group partners with in the city. “We're losing the focus on crime in Ohio because of DC's issues. A spokesman from DeWine's office told CNN in an email that “Ohio has traditionally helped the District of Columbia, Ohio mayors, and other states when they request assistance,” including requests from Democratic officials. Bill Lee confirmed Tuesday that he was sending about 160 members of the state's National Guard to aid Trump's deployments in DC. Two cities in Tennessee with populations over 250,000 had higher violent crime rates than DC, according to a CNN review of FBI data. Memphis ranked 1st and Nashville was 12th on the list, five spots ahead of DC. “Washington, DC, is a creation of the Congress, and I believe it's within the president's constitutional purview,” Tennessee GOP Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN's Dana Bash on Wednesday, adding that he doesn't believe any troops are needed in Memphis because “it's not a federally created environment.” Lee's office didn't respond to a request for comment from CNN. He conceded that parts of Memphis are dangerous, but said public safety was improving because of Biden-era grants for local anti-violence programs, which the Trump administration is slashing. “I'm more worried about them taking away all this money from violence intervention programs in major cities, just as these things have been gearing up and are starting to work.” Jeff Landry on Monday approved sending 135 troops to DC. Shreveport and Lafeyette are smaller cities, but they both had a higher violent crime rate than DC last year, according to a CNN review of FBI statistics. Landry's office did not respond to CNN's request for comment. “It's crazy,” Michael McClanahan, president of the NAACP Louisiana State Conference, told CNN in an interview. We have so much work to do in our state. Hurricane Erin moves away from the East Coast, but it remains a coastal threat Gavin Newsom, a leading Democratic critic of Trump's moves, used this data in a recent interview to accuse Trump of authoritarianism. Tate Reeves is also sending about 200 troops to DC. Jackson had the nation's highest homicide rate in 2024 for cities with at least 100,000 people, according to a CNN analysis of FBI statistics and local reports of police data. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat who represents parts of Jackson, said Reeves' deployment was a taxpayer-funded “political stunt” that pulls brave Mississippi troops “away from their homes, families, and critical missions.” Reeves' deputy chief of staff Cory Custer told CNN in an email that “it's wrong to imply that Mississippi cannot support President Trump's efforts to clean up Washington, D.C., while also working to keep Mississippians safe.” He said it was a “ridiculous premise” because Reeves signed legislation doubling the size of Mississippi Capitol Police and has presided over an estimated 43% drop in homicides in Jackson compared to this point last year. The two largest cities in West Virginia – Charleston and Huntington – each have only about 45,000 residents and are much smaller than DC, which has about 702,000 residents. But statistically, they both had a higher violent crime rate per capita than DC last year, according to CNN's review of FBI data. Morrisey's office did not respond to CNN's inquiries about the deployments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Late Thursday afternoon, the Supreme Court handed down an incomprehensible order concerning the Trump administration's decision to cancel numerous public health grants. The array of six opinions in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association is so labyrinthine that any judge who attempts to parse it risks being devoured by a minotaur. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson writes in a partial dissent, the decision is “Calvinball jurisprudence,” which appears to be designed to ensure that “this Administration always wins.” The case involves thousands of NIH grants that the Trump administration abruptly canceled which, according to Jackson, involve “research into suicide risk and prevention, HIV transmission, Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular disease,” among other things. A federal district court ruled that this policy was unlawful — “arbitrary and capricious” in the language of federal administrative law — in part because the executive orders gave NIH officials no precise guidance on which grants should be canceled. As Jackson summarized the district court's reasoning, “‘DEI'—the central concept the executive orders aimed to extirpate—was nowhere defined,” leaving NIH officials “to arrive at whatever conclusion [they] wishe[d]” regarding which grants should be terminated. According to Jackson, “the court found, as a factual matter, ‘an unmistakable pattern of discrimination against women's health issues' and ‘pervasive racial discrimination'—indeed, ‘palpable' racial discrimination of a sort the judge had ‘never seen' in 40 years on the bench.” Instead, the case hinged on a jurisdictional dispute. But the case also bears some superficial similarity to a breach of contract suit, because it involved the government's decision not to pay money that it had previously agreed to pay. Four justices — the three Democrats plus Chief Justice John Roberts — concluded that these plaintiffs were right to bring their suit in the district court. Four other justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh — concluded that the case must be brought in the Court of Claims. That would mean that these plaintiffs would have to start over again in the claims court, and possibly that they would have to bring individual suits seeking to reinstate individual grants, rather than seeking a broad order attacking the entire grant cancellation policy. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, meanwhile, cast the deciding vote. She claims that this suit must be split between the two courts. '” So these plaintiffs likely must wait until after they have fully litigated the question of whether the Trump administration's broad policy is illegal in district court, before they can actually try to get any money in the claims court. By the time this mess gets sorted out, it is likely that most — if not all — of the research at issue in NIH will be lost, even if the plaintiffs do prevail. As Jackson writes, without any money to fund their operations, the grant recipients will need to “euthanize animal subjects, terminate life-saving trials, and close community health clinics.” There are actually even more complexities in this case, but rather than engage in the Sysiphean task of trying to list all of them, I will simply repeat Jackson's summary of what appears to be going on here: Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins. The court finally lifted a two-year ban on drag performances. Don't expect the courts to keep ICE under control. The Court has a special set of rules for Trump. A new poll shows public support for the Supreme Court at its lowest point ever. ﻿The Court recently saved part of the Voting Rights Act.</p>
