                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. This study aimed to investigate the function of ATOX1 and its underlying molecular mechanisms in HCC. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to assess ATOX1 expression in HCC tissues. Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, Transwell migration, flow cytometry, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays were employed to evaluate the malignant behaviors of tumor cells. A xenograft mouse model was employed to assess the effects of ATOX1 knockdown on tumor growth in vivo. DCAC50 treatment was performed to inhibit the copper transport function of ATOX1. RNA sequencing was conducted to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of ATOX1 in HCC. Inhibition of ATOX1 by DCAC50 decreased cell proliferation while increasing ROS levels and apoptosis in HCC cells. Notably, acetylcysteine reversed the reduction in c-Myb expression induced by ATOX1 knockdown. This study elucidates that ATOX1 promotes HCC carcinogenicity through the c-Myb/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway while inhibiting copper accumulation, ROS generation, and apoptosis. These results indicate that ATOX1 represents a potential therapeutic target for HCC. Moreover, the compound DCAC50, by obstructing ATOX1's copper transport function, effectively suppresses the malignant behavior of HCC cells, suggesting its promising role in HCC treatment, particularly when combined with PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from the McCullagh Group in Oxford University's Department of Chemistry have published an innovative method in Nature Protocols today (22 August) that provides comprehensive analysis of metabolites found in cells, tissues and biofluids. The new method delivers a step-change in capability for analysing highly polar and ionic metabolites. The innovation comes from using anion-exchange chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (AEC-MS) to meet a long-standing need for improving the large-scale analysis of highly polar and ionic metabolites which drive primary metabolic pathways and processes in cells. Ion-exchange chromatography has been used by generations of chemists since the 1970s, but historically it has been very difficult to couple directly to mass spectrometry, unlike other types of chromatography. The new method uses electrolytic ion-suppression which links the high-performance ion-exchange chromatography system directly with mass spectrometry, an innovation that improves molecular specificity and selectivity. This has led to new applications that were recently reviewed by the McCullagh Group (Ngere et al., Anal. The new method is designed for metabolomics applications which involve the large-scale analysis of metabolites in biological samples. student in the McCullagh Group, whose research focusses on the development of ion-exchange chromatography-mass spectrometry, said, "Ion-exchange chromatography offers a retention and elution mechanism which is new to metabolomics and is proving to be a powerful solution for long-standing analytical challenges in the field." Metabolomics, is one of several 'omics' technologies, that include genomics and proteomics, offering a powerful combinatorial approach to comprehensively analyse molecular systems in cells, tissues and whole organisms. Changes in metabolite levels are sensitive biomarkers for specific diseases, diets, nutritional states, treatments and chemical exposures and metabolomics provides a tool for discovering these molecular changes. It can be applied to research questions in many disciplines, including biological chemistry, molecular biology, molecular medicine, pharmacology and environmental science. We found the activity of GAPDH and PDH (enzymes involved in the production of ATP from glucose) were inhibited when glucose levels increased, leading to the accumulation of upstream intermediates which caused changes in gene expression including impaired insulin secretion and build-up of glycogen (Haythorne et al., Nat. Professor James McCullagh (Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford) who led the project, said: "Developing a new metabolomics protocol is very exciting, it expands capability for existing applications but also enables us to explore and develop new applications: in our lab we are now applying the protocol in several research areas including investigating gut microbiome metabolism, how antimicrobial resistance impacts bacterial metabolism and in the discovery of biomarkers for the early detection of cancer."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Methods are demanding lower detection limits even as sample complexity rises. To meet these demands, instruments must operate at peak performance. However, we understand that instrument sensitivity naturally degrades with time. Fortunately, there are techniques to achieve high-quality results as your system ages. One key technique is to follow a rigid schedule of daily, weekly, monthly, and annual hardware and sample introduction system maintenance. Calibration and tuning are just as important, but often get overlooked. Accurate wavelength calibration ensures precise peak centering and improves sensitivity. Calibration standards should include elements with a wide mass range, providing benefits similar to wavelength calibration in ICP-OES: increased sensitivity and better interference correction. Advanced users can create custom tuning solutions for specific mass ranges or analyte profiles. Maintaining high performance requires more than tuning and calibration; thorough documentation is essential. This data-driven strategy provides long-term dependability and high analytical performance. To get the most out of any calibration, tuning, or performance check procedure, the quality of your reference materials is essential.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 7 of Aging (Aging-US) on July 17, 2025, titled "The influence of cancer on a forensic age estimation tool." In this study by Charlotte Sutter, Daniel Helbling, Cordula Haas, and Jacqueline Neubauer from the Zurich Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Zurich, and Onkozentrum Zurich, the researchers investigated how cancer might affect the accuracy of forensic tools used to estimate a person's age from blood samples. Forensic scientists can use these changes to predict someone's age from biological traces, such as blood found at a crime scene. However, medical conditions like cancer can alter these patterns and potentially reduce the accuracy of such predictions. This study investigated whether various cancer types influence the DNA markers used in age estimation. The researcher stated, "Our study is among the first to show whether it might be necessary to account for the influence of cancer on forensic age estimation tools in order to enhance estimation accuracy as much as possible." Age predictions in the control group were generally accurate, with small average errors. Patients with solid tumors, including breast and lung cancers, showed only slightly less accurate results. In contrast, individuals with blood cancers, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), sometimes had large errors, with ages overestimated by as much as 50 years. Despite these few extreme cases, the study found that cancer does not typically have a strong impact on the accuracy of this forensic tool. While aggressive cancers may occasionally affect prediction accuracy, such cases are rare. The researchers suggest noting these conditions as a possible factor in unusually large errors, without requiring changes to standard practice. This study provides valuable information about how health conditions, such as cancer, may influence DNA-based age estimation. The influence of cancer on a forensic age estimation tool.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new Cochrane review casts doubt on the value of ketamine and other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonists to relieve chronic noncancer pain. While ketamine and other NMDA receptor agonists are often prescribed off-label to manage chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, nerve pain, and complex regional pain syndrome, researchers found little convincing evidence of a real benefit and identified an increased risk for side effects such as delusions, delirium, paranoia, nausea, and vomiting. “Clinicians should know that there is currently no clear evidence supporting use of ketamine for chronic pain. Large-scale, definitive randomized trials are urgently needed to determine benefits, risks, and optimal dosing regimens,” first author Michael Ferraro BSc, BHSc, doctoral candidate at University of New South Wales Sydney and Neuroscience Research Australia, Sydney, Australia, told Medscape Medical News. “We want to be clear — we're not saying ketamine is ineffective, but there's a lot of uncertainty,” Ferraro added in a news release. They found no clear evidence that IV, oral, or topical ketamine reduced pain intensity in the intermediate term (48 hours to 1 week), short term (> 1 week to 3 months) or medium term (> 3 months to 6 months) compared with placebo comparators. No studies reported total adverse events with oral ketamine and there was no clear evidence that topical ketamine increased risk for adverse events. As a potential benefit could not be excluded for these drugs, definitive research is urgently needed,” he noted. Reached for comment, Shaheen Lakhan, MD, PhD, neurologist and researcher in Miami cautioned that, the way he sees it, ketamine is not a “standalone cure.” “Mechanistically, it promotes neuroplasticity, opening a window where the brain is more malleable. That window can be filled with structured, high-quality therapies like Pain Reprocessing Therapy,” said Lakhan, who was not involved in the review. “In practice, ketamine works best not in isolation, but as part of an integrated program that helps patients relearn healthier patterns of perception, emotion, and pain processing. “From a mechanistic standpoint, ketamine makes sense in chronic pain — modulating NMDA receptor hypersensitivity is one of the few levers we have. In my own clinical experience, patient selection is absolutely paramount, and some patients do very well,” he told Medscape Medical News. “The challenge is that we lack pharmaceutical-grade, class 1 evidence: large, well-controlled phase 3 trials that can really establish efficacy and safety. A handful of efforts are now underway to address this, but until industry invests, the evidence will remain low quality and Cochrane's conclusion of uncertainty will persist. That is less a verdict on ketamine than an indictment of the research system,” Lakhan said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have developed a new, data-driven way of fitting prosthetic legs which could lead to better fitting prosthetics, in less time and at a lower cost. The technology has been developed by Radii Devices and the University of Southampton, and the results of an NHS trial have been published today [22 August 2025] in JMIR Rehabilitation and Assistive Technology. The study shows that below-the-knee prosthetic limbs designed using the new approach were as comfortable on average as those created by highly skilled prosthetists, but with more consistent results. Crucially, the new method generates a basic design instantly. This would not only improve patients' experience but could also help to clear waiting lists. Prosthetic sockets are personalised to make sure the prosthetic is comfortable, functional, and safe to walk on. The socket bears the person's whole body weight and dynamic forces when walking, so it needs to be carefully balanced to distribute pressure without damaging limb tissue or creating discomfort. Today, many prosthetists use CAD (computer-aided design) software in a similar way. Radii Devices Ltd, a spin-out company from the University of Southampton, has developed software which draws on data from previous prosthetic socket designs to generate recommendations for the most comfortable socket shape using a 3D scan of the patient's residual limb. By analyzing hundreds of previous prosthetic designs, we've been able to identify trends between different patient characteristics, such as the shape and size of the residual limb, and successful socket shapes. We can then scan a new patient's residual limb and generate a personalised design recommendation based on features that have been successful for similar patients in the past." Seventeen patients were given a trial socket designed by a prosthetist and one designed using the new method. Several participants preferred the fit of the data-driven socket design when asked for feedback, and had it turned into their definitive prosthetic. The design recommendations aren't intended to be used on their own in clinical practice. Only a highly skilled prosthetist can identify things like bone spurs and neuromas, and know how to tweak designs to avoid causing pain or damage at these sensitive areas. "We developed the data-driven socket design approach to save prosthetists' time by giving them a solid base to work from so they can use their expertise where it is most valuable, in making precise adaptations tailored to their patients' specific needs. The method effectively helps prosthetists to learn from each other." Nearly 100 people have now had a prosthetic leg designed this way, across multiple centres in the UK and the USA. The project team included physiotherapists, health scientists, and software engineers. "The fact they performed so well in these circumstances is both surprising and encouraging, but the real value of this tool is to give the prosthetist a starting design quickly, meaning they can spend much more of their time working with their patient on perfecting the more complex, personalised aspects of the design. The final stage of this study is now underway, where the software interface is being developed with clinicians to provide them the most effective way to incorporate data-driven socket designs into their practice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international research team led by the University of Vienna has succeeded in developing a new method to directly measure partial charges in molecules. The results, now published in Nature, provide new insights into molecular interactions and offer potential applications in drug development and materials science. Electrostatic forces – the attractive or repulsive interactions between atoms or molecules – lie at the heart of all molecular interactions: They are fundamental to how molecules assemble, align, and respond to one another. These subtle shifts in charge govern how molecules interact with each other and their surroundings. They are key to understanding chemical reactivity, biological function, and material behavior. Yet despite their significance, partial charges have remained purely theoretical: until now, there was no way to measure them directly. A research team led by Tim Grüne, Head of the Core Facility for Crystal Structure Analysis, and Christian Schröder from the Department of Computational Biological Chemistry at the University of Vienna, has now developed a method that allows partial charges to be determined experimentally. "Until now, partial charges were estimated using computational methods", says Christian Schröder. Others partition the electron density itself among atoms. While widely used in molecular modeling, these methods can yield different values depending on the algorithm. Our new experimental technique now provides a means to assess and refine these theoretical models by offering a direct link." For Ciprofloxacin, which appears on the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines and is commonly administered as a hydrochloride salt, the analysis showed that the chloride ion (Cl⁻), carries only about 40 percent of a full negative charge. This demonstrates how strongly a molecule's environment can influence local charge distribution. The Core Facility for Crystal Structure Analysis at the University of Vienna has played a key role in advancing electron crystallography in recent years. With this latest breakthrough, the technique moves beyond determining atomic positions to experimentally revealing electronic properties. The ability to measure partial charges opens new possibilities for designing pharmaceuticals with greater specificity and fewer side effects, as well as functional materials with precisely tuned properties.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fresh Bucks used Seattle's beverage tax revenue, creating a sustainable local funding stream distinct from federal programs. Study findings revealed that among new enrollees, the program was associated with a 5.5 percentage-point increase in food security and a 7.5 percentage-point increase in the proportion of participants eating fruits and vegetables three or more times daily. By contrast, the study found no statistically significant effect on overall continuous daily fruit and vegetable intake. Conversely, losing the benefit was linked to a substantial decline in these outcomes. These findings provide robust evidence from randomized program assignment that such programs can be an effective tool for reducing health disparities within America. However, the authors caution that further research is needed to confirm long-term health impacts. To address these disparities, “food is medicine” initiatives, including produce prescription programs, have gained popularity as a potential solution. These programs aim to make healthy foods more accessible by providing financial incentives. Unfortunately, a combination of their relative nascency and the fact that much of the existing research on these programs has been hampered by weak study designs, often lacking a proper comparison group, has made empirical validation of these programs' benefits hitherto impossible. This has fueled criticism of these initiatives, with a growing voice undermining their impacts. Participants could redeem the $40 monthly benefit flexibly – all at once or split across multiple trips – at major grocery chains, local independent stores, or farmers' markets. The present study aims to address the ongoing debate on “food is medicine” initiatives' social impacts by conducting a lottery-based cohort study evaluating the outcomes of Seattle's Fresh Bucks program, which offers a $40 monthly benefit for fruits and vegetables. This randomization created natural treatment (initially selected) and control (waitlisted) groups. ‘Gaining Access', wherein 757 newly enrolled participants were compared to a waitlisted control group over 6 months, and 2. ‘Losing Access', wherein a separate group of 1,216 prior beneficiaries was studied, comparing those randomly disenrolled (and placed on the waitlist) to those randomly selected to continue receiving benefits for an additional 6 months. Food security, assessed using the validated 2-item Hunger Vital Signs screener, and 2. Fruit and vegetable consumption was measured using a modified Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) questionnaire. Data for analysis were collected via surveys administered at baseline (October 2021) and follow-up (June 2022). Study analyses included linear regression models (LRMs) to estimate the program's effects, controlling for participants' household size, presence of children, income, race/ethnicity, preferred language, age, preferred retailer, and baseline outcome values to increase statistical power and precision. Nearly 7 in 10 participants (68%) were aged 60 or older, and over half (51%) identified as Asian, reflecting the program's reach within specific Seattle communities. Study outcomes revealed statistically significant evidence of the Fresh Bucks program's benefits. Among new applicants, being randomly selected to receive the $40 monthly benefit was associated with marked improvements in both diet and food security compared to being placed on the waiting list. Simultaneously, a 7.5 percentage point (pp) increase in the proportion of participants consuming fruits and vegetables three or more times per day (95% CI, 0.39-14.52 pp) was observed, representing a 37% improvement from baseline. However, the study reported that average daily fruit and vegetable intake, measured continuously, did not show a statistically significant change. Previously enrolled participants who were randomly disenrolled from the program experienced a significant decline in both outcomes. Specifically, these participants reported a 4.97 pp reduction in food security (p = .03) and a 7.34 pp decrease in the likelihood of eating produce at least three times a day (p = .01) compared to those who continued to receive benefits for the six additional months. They also ate fruits and vegetables 0.37 fewer times per day on average. Gains in continuous fruit and vegetable intake were significant among lower-income participants (≤200% of the federal poverty level), those identifying as White or Black, and English speakers. The present study's findings strongly suggest that “food is medicine” initiatives like Fresh Bucks are a powerful tool for addressing diet-related health disparities. This study hence provides rigorous evidence of meaningful improvements offered by these initiatives, highlighting them as a direct and effective way to improve population health. However, given limitations such as a 28.5% survey response rate, reliance on self-reported data, and potential selection bias, the findings should be interpreted with caution and not yet generalized as a “global model.” Hugo Francisco de Souza is a scientific writer based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New genetic analysis reveals that insomnia and gut microbes shape each other, offering fresh clues to why poor sleep and gut imbalances so often go hand in hand. Study: Investigating bidirectional causal relationships between gut microbiota and insomnia. A recent paper in the journal General Psychiatry assesses associations between insomnia and gut dysbiosis. Insomnia affects up to a fifth of people worldwide, and at least half of those affected have chronic sleep disturbances. This can leave them irritable or tired when they are awake and expected to be functioning. Insomnia is often the prelude to other mental or physical illnesses that not only have a heavy social cost but herald premature death. The causes of insomnia remain elusive, though genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors are known to intertwine in causing abnormal wakefulness. Stress due to work, family circumstances, unmet financial needs, or other illnesses often impacts sleep adversely. In healthy adults, the gut microbiome is dominated by a mix of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, comprising up to 90% of the total. Diet, age, and stress all affect the structure and composition of the gut microbiome, as does pregnancy. Sometimes, the resulting changes cause gut disease reflected in systemic conditions like obesity, metabolic syndrome, and autoimmune illness. Gut microbes produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) like butyric acid and the neurotransmitter serotonin. These act on the enteric neurons and nerves. Babies with higher propionate levels in the gut tend to sleep uninterrupted for longer periods. Older people with insomnia tend to sleep more poorly if they have higher SCFA levels. Not getting enough continuous sleep can also change the gut microbiome, and vice versa. Depletion of the gut microbiota is associated with brain wave changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. To uncover this, they used Mendelian randomization (MR). This is a method of analysis that aims to minimize the effect of confounding and help reveal causation in a single direction. The data came from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on 386,533 individuals with insomnia, and gut microbiome data from two different databases (MiBioGen n=18,340 and the Dutch Microbiome Project n=8,208; all participants of European descent). Multiple analytic methods were used to detect and validate the associations in either direction, as well as to verify causality. Among these, 14 bacterial taxa may increase the risk of insomnia, while eight are protective. After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, only the Clostridium innocuum group remained significant in the microbiota → insomnia direction, and forward-direction effect sizes were small (odds ratios ~1.01 to 1.04 for risk taxa and 0.97 to 0.99 for protective taxa). At the same time, a reverse MR analysis revealed that insomnia contributed to a decrease in the abundance of seven taxa by up to 80%, while 12 taxa were increased in abundance by up to 4.4-fold. Most reverse-direction associations did not remain significant after FDR correction, and Cochran's Q indicated heterogeneity for Sutterella. These findings agree with many earlier studies, despite some inconsistencies. Some biological support for these results comes from the knowledge that Clostridium innocuum produces acetate (an SCFA) and breaks down tryptophan (a neurotransmitter precursor) while Coprococcus 1 produces propionate (an SCFA). Tryptophan gives rise to serotonin and melatonin, both of which are important in regulating emotional, cognitive, and other psychological processes. The gut microbiota structure and composition vary with the presence of major depression or bipolar disorder, as well as neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. For instance, Coprococcus 1 and Lachnospiraceae are linked to depressive symptoms. For instance, it may upregulate virulence genes in response to stress molecules like interleukin-6 (IL-6), released by the enteric nervous system. Insomnia also shifts the levels of serotonin and dopamine, in turn altering the gut microbiota that produces these neurotransmitters. “Our study highlighted the reciprocal relationships between gut microbiota and insomnia.” These provide preliminary evidence of causal relationships. However, the authors note that only a small number of associations survived multiple-testing correction, and residual confounding cannot be entirely excluded. This predicts such relationships, but the underlying mechanisms need to be elucidated. The study is preliminary, limited to individuals of European ancestry, and effect sizes were small, making the results hypothesis-generating rather than definitive. It may help scientists better understand how to prevent and treat insomnia through approaches that modify the gut microbiome.
