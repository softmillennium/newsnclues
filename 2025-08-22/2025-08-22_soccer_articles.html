                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday that the 2026 men's World Cup draw will take place Dec. 5 at the Kennedy Center, a performing arts venue in Washington, D.C. The Athletic reported in April that Las Vegas appeared to be the frontrunner to host the draw, but Washington, D.C. remained in contention if it made it easier for Trump to participate extensively. It typically includes musical performances and speeches before the teams are drawn, via sealed orbs, from pots into their World Cup groups. “The Kennedy Center will give it a phenomenal kick-off,” Trump said at Friday's news conference, “and we'll be involved.” Alejandro Hutt, the director of the host city committee for Mexico's Monterrey, had told ESPN in January that they and Canadian city Vancouver had been interested in hosting the draw before being told by FIFA they would not be doing so. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Carlos Cordeiro, an Infantino advisor and senior advisor to the White House's World Cup Task Force, were also present for the announcement. The World Cup trophy stood on a desk in front of them, next to Trump. At one point, Infantino picked it up, handed it to Trump, and said: “This is for winners only. Trump smiled, held the trophy, posed for photos, and asked: “Can I keep it?” Trump later said he was “just sent a picture from someone who wants to be there very badly. He then held up a picture of himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin, one week after the two met in Alaska about Russia's war in Ukraine. Trump said that Putin, “I believe, will be coming (to the World Cup final, on July 19), depending on what happens. Trump, after announcing the date and location of the draw, immediately pivoted to criticism of Washington D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser and promotion of his administration's moves to exert control over the nation's capital. He called D.C. a “crime-infested rat hole,” despite data showing that crime has declined in 2024 and 2025. “Washington D.C. is a whole different place, and Gianni, I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that too, actually,” Trump said. Infantino later joked that “everything will start here, in Washington D.C., at the Kennedy Center — or the Trump Kennedy Center, we'll see how it will be called — on the 5th of September at noon sharp.” The discussions were so advanced that suites were held back by authorities across different resorts in Vegas for the first week of December even until recent weeks, as FIFA continued its negotiations with various venues in Vegas, including the Grand Garden Arena. Vegas was the clear preference of many host city executives, who had their eyes on an opportunity to schmooze prospective sponsors in Sin City and make a big national impact with a major event in Vegas. However, the spectre of D.C., which is not a World Cup host city, has always loomed in the background, as reported by The Athletic in April, because FIFA has always been determined to make it as easy as possible for Trump to be involved in the draw. When it was the Club World Cup draw in Miami last year, following his re-election but before beginning his second term, Trump sent only a video message of support. This time, Infantino will want him to be front and center — just as he was when Premier League club Chelsea lifted the Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium in July. A venue in D.C. makes that all the easier, and this is the bromance that shows no signs of letting up. Four qualifiers from Europe and two from the rest of the world will be determined via a set of playoffs in March 2026, which will take place in the host nations. In previous years, placeholders have been used in Pot 4 to represent spots which will be decided by a playoff yet to take place.</p>

President Donald Trump says the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will be at the Kennedy Center, defends his DC crime crackdown and more in Oval Office announcement. The president was joined by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the Oval Office for Friday's announcement. FIFA President Gianni Infantino, right, hands the FIFA World Cup Winners Trophy to President Donald Trump during an announcement in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Aug. 22, 2025, in Washington. "On Dec. 5 of this year, the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center. Some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we're not prepared to do that quite yet – maybe in a week or so," Trump said, drawing laughter from the group. "But right here in Washington, D.C., it's a tremendous honor to bring the global event and this incredible group of people and these unbelievable athletes – the best athletes in the world – to the cultural center of our nation's capital." Trump also took the opportunity to highlight his administration's federal takeover of D.C. in an effort to crack down on crime. "By the way, in Washington, D.C., we have the lowest crime numbers they've had in years. It's a horrible thing to say, but I might as well say it, zero murders in the last week since we've done this. Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser speaks at a press conference after President Donald Trump announced a federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department at the Wilson Building on August 11, 2025 in Washington, DC. It was horrible," the president continued, "And Mayor [Muriel] Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor very long because we'll take it over with the federal government, run it like it's supposed to be run." Trump quipped to Infantino that the city "will be nice" just in time for the draw, joking that the Italian sports figure "could handle yourself" regardless. "The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the largest, most complex set of events in sports history, and the Kennedy Center will give it a phenomenal kickoff and will be involved, and they'll be working over there for quite a bit of time. We have it all set so that they can stay there for the big events, the big press conferences and everything else. And they'll be in a very safe capital. You don't have to worry about walking down the street, Johnny, okay? Trump established a White House task force earlier this year in anticipation of the Club World Cup and the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be predominantly hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico will also play host to several matches. The international tournament, spanning North America, will begin in June 2026 and is the first World Cup in more than two decades that will take place in multiple countries. The tournament will be hosted in 16 cities, beginning with 48 teams and playing 104 matches in total. In the U.S., matches will be played in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Kansas City, Atlanta, Miami, Boston, Philadelphia and East Rutherford, New Jersey.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., President Donald Trump announced on Friday. The draw will be held on December 5, Trump said, adding: "Some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we're not prepared to do that quite yet. Speaking from the Oval Office alongside FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Trump said the Kennedy Center "will give it a phenomenal kickoff." The World Cup will be hosted jointly by the United States, Canada and Mexico, with games set across 16 stadiums between June 11 and July 19, 2026. However, Washington remained a strong contender, in part because it allowed Trump to be more directly involved. The draw is more than just a procedural event—it's a high-profile production featuring speeches, performances and global media attention. Trump is expected to play a leading role during the ceremony. Trump's involvement with FIFA has intensified in recent months. He attended the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, where Chelsea lifted the championship trophy. At a separate White House event earlier this year, Trump held the new Club World Cup trophy, presented to him by Infantino. During Friday's announcement, Trump turned to Infantino and asked whether he could also hold the World Cup trophy. Infantino obliged, handing it over with a grin and said "only winners" are allowed to hold it. and said it would fit nicely in the Oval Office. While discussing the World Cup and the U.S. role as host, Trump surprised the room by holding up a photo of himself with Russian President Vladimir Putin. "I'm going to sign this for him," Trump said. "That's a man named Vladimir Putin who I believe will be coming [to the 2026 FIFA World Cup], depending on what happens." The remark appeared to catch Infantino off guard. The comment raised eyebrows, as Russia has been suspended from FIFA and UEFA competitions since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. All Russian national and club teams remain barred from international play "until further notice," under a joint decision by the FIFA Council and UEFA Executive Committee. President Trump holds up photo sent by Russian President Vladimir Putin: "I'm going to sign this for him ... That's a man named Vladimir Putin who I believe will be coming (to 2026 FIFA World Cup) depending on what happens." This wasn't the first time Trump voiced support for Russia in a World Cup context. During a May meeting of his administration's World Cup task force, seated alongside Infantino, Trump said he was unaware of Russia's current exclusion but suggested the war's end could open the door for a return. "They are banned for the time being from playing, but we hope that something happens and peace will happen so that Russia can be readmitted." Hey, could be a good incentive, right?" FIFA President Gianni Infantino, during the press conference: "As you [Trump] rightly say, with security, beautifying cities and the whole country, we want people to come, enjoy and have fun." Vice President JD Vance, during a May press conference: "Of course everyone is welcome to come and see this wonderful event. The event will mark the first time a FIFA World Cup draw is hosted in Washington. The entertainment lineup for this year's event has yet to be announced.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump announced Friday the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will take place on December 5 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, combining the world's biggest soccer tournament with the cultural institution he has sought to overhaul. “It's a tremendous honor to bring the global event and this incredible group of people and these unbelievable athletes – the best athletes in the world – to the cultural center of our nation's capital,” Trump said. Trump promised a safe atmosphere at the draw, discussing at length his federal takeover of Washington's police department and issuing threats to Mayor Muriel Bowser and the city's rat population. Next year's tournament is expanding for the first time to 48 teams and will span across the US, Mexico and Canada. Eleven American cities will be hosting games, but Washington is not one of them – an unusual situation for a host nation's capital city during the World Cup. “The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the largest, most complex set of events in sports history. And the Kennedy Center will give it a phenomenal kickoff and will be involved,” Trump said. Trump seized control of the institution's board earlier this year, telling reporters recently he would oversee a sweeping revamp of the center and its programming. At Trump's behest, congressional Republicans set aside $250 million in July for renovations to the center as part of their tax and spending bill. Those funds will go toward an expansive overhaul of the Kennedy Center, Trump said, arguing that it was badly in need of repairs when he took control of its operations. The Kennedy Center has served as an early focal point of Trump's attempts to assert his administration's power over DC, drawing an institution that had traditionally remained above the fray of partisan politics directly into the center of the nation's culture wars. Trump in February dismissed a slew of Democratic appointees from the center's board of trustees, replacing them with aides and allies that included chief of staff Susie Wiles and second lady Usha Vance. Trump was subsequently elected chairman, with longtime confidant Ric Grenell installed as the Kennedy Center's new president. A series of other prominent artists, including director Shonda Rhimes and musician Ben Folds, resigned from their positions at the center. Since then, Trump has taken a hands-on approach to overhauling programming and drawing up plans for renovating the complex. Asked about his involvement in picking the center's next honorees, Trump said he personally sifted through the candidates, rejecting some he felt were too “woke.” Trump joked on Friday that people may start referring to the performance arts center as the “Trump Kennedy Center.” You see the way this is looking, looks nice. I can't tell you how much that gold costs – a lot of money. Infantino and Trump have developed a close relationship as the tournament was awarded to the US, Mexico and Canada during Trump's first term and is now being planned and held during his second term in office. And everything will start here in Washington, DC, at the Kennedy Center – or the Trump Kennedy Center,” Infantino said with a laugh. Infantino presented Trump with the first ticket to next year's final, noting that tickets for the tournament go on sale on September 10. CNN's Adam Cancryn contributed to this report.</p>

Five short weeks after winning the Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium, Chelsea returned to competitive play at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, banners celebrating their latest championship adorned around their stadium. The Blues, though, swapped an impressive 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain last month for a sluggish 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace, the scoreline a perfect reflection of the performance. External factors likely played a sizable role in Chelsea's underwhelming showing on Sunday, the Club World Cup creating wonky preseason schedules for the European teams that made deep runs. Enzo Maresca's side, for example, played an 11-month season, took three weeks off, and had just 13 days of preseason preparation before facing Palace on Sunday, while the opponent had a much more traditional build-up. Maresca did not feel his side were underprepared as a result, but it was hard to ignore the circumstances. For sure, [Palace] have already played seven, eight games. So the real game for us was today. Even then, Chelsea have room for improvement as they prepare to face West Ham United on Friday, a trip to the London Stadium offering a perfect opportunity to put Sunday's performance in the past. West Ham are coming off a 3-0 loss to newly-promoted Sunderland, which could be the first sign of a troubling season ahead for a team that has not refreshed much this summer and poses a limited attacking threat. Chelsea were clearly the more dominant attacking team on Sunday, when they outshot Palace 19 to 11 and generated almost a full expected goal more than the Eagles. It was a performance that was more about quantity than quality, though – the Blues took just three shots on goal, unideal no matter the preseason disruptions. It offered a stark reminder that despite the Club World Cup triumph and the UEFA Europa Conference League win before that, Maresca's Chelsea may have plenty of potential but are still a great unknown. Maresca boasts a bloated squad jam-packed with attackers, but has yet to figure out what his preferred combination is yet. Considering the circumstances – specifically, an ownership group that is unusually eager to sign new players – it is understandable that the manager has not cracked the code just yet. The journey to figure out Chelsea's first-choice attacking unit has been a constant feature of Maresca's tenure at the club but the Club World Cup run offers important context thanks to the introduction of a batch of new players. He joined the team midway through the tournament and notched three goals in three games, including one in the final, and translated that into a start on Sunday against Palace. Joao Pedro was at the top of a 4-2-3-1 that included Palmer, as well as Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens on the wings, but the returns were not spectacular. Joao Pedro took just two shots in 73 minutes, a throwback to his average returns during his two years with Brighton and Hove Albion. The less-than-exciting outing for Chelsea, though, perhaps opens the door for Delap to earn a starting role while 18-year-old Estevao Willian may play a sizable role himself this season after making a 36-minute cameo on Sunday. Friday's match at West Ham, then, feels like the unofficial start of auditions to be one of Chelsea's first-choice attackers, all of whom will be tasked with helping the Blues live up to the hype they created last season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump hasn't been shy about his excitement for the U.S. to host next summer's FIFA World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico. The head of state has spent an inordinate amount of time with FIFA President Gianni Infantino since taking office and, as of last month, the trophy from this past summer's Club World Cup has become a permanent fixture in the Oval Office. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity. You oversaw sports-related issues in the Office of Public Liaison during President Trump's first term. So, doing that, I was able to really get a good idea for what a visa process for the World Cup would look like. That's why when we look at the visa process here, it's key that we're welcoming the world without sacrificing our national security and our footprint here. Vance, [Secretary of State Marco Rubio], [Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem] and all our other incredible task force members. The way I look at success is, I want what people are talking about on July 20 next year to be about what happens on the field, not something off the field. If we can do that, then I think the task force has accomplished its goals. Protecting stadiums from drone threats has been a major focus of lawmakers. How is the task force preparing to take that on? All these stadiums have detection capability, but when you're looking at your standard NFL or MLB games, they don't have the authority to mitigate. We've gone to Mexico City already for the first counter — UAS trilateral meeting between the United States, Canada and Mexico — I was honored to lead that delegation. That'll be different next year because these are Level 1 and 2 events, and [federal law enforcement] will have the ability to mitigate. We also want to make sure that we have that ability without taking prized assets, let's say, off the southern border. So, it's a matter now of making sure that we're acquiring all the right assets we need to make sure these 78 games are safe. As a legacy project, there's talk of legislation about potentially giving state and locals, in some instances, the ability to mitigate as well. That won't be necessary for the World Cup in particular, but moving forward past July 20, I think it's one of the great potential opportunities for this major event. You talked earlier about visas and the sheer volume of people that will want to come to the U.S. for this event. What is the task force doing to make sure fans are able to get in and out of the country easily? First and foremost, some of the results that we can point to already are the wait times in four soccer-enthusiastic countries. Mexico's wait time was over 800 days a year ago. Colombia is another example that the media really focused on. Argentina and Brazil — not bad at soccer these two countries. Argentina went from over 500 days of wait time last year to effectively nothing, which means less than a month. Brazil went from over 300 days to less than a month. That's really where we focused before teams are qualified. We looked at where fans will end up coming from regardless of whether or not their country qualifies for the World Cup. Deploying consular officers to those consulates is really key. Then, we're looking at other processes to make sure that we can process the 350,000 accredited individuals — that's a number per FIFA — and the ticket holders. Of that, about two-and-a-half milloion to 3 million will be international. And of that, you're looking at 1.2 to 1.6 million visa holders. So,we're targeting that 1.2 to 1.6 and making sure that, without sacrificing our national security, they get to go through the process. Not everybody is going to get a yes, but we want to make sure that they get processed, so that way there is a conscious decision. That was our direct work with the host city CEOs, security leads, their government affairs teams that will allow them to have these resources. Now that the Club World Cup is over, we're starting more regular meetings with them to go through updated concerns and checklists as we get closer and closer to the World Cup. Some are struggling to raise the necessary funding and, as a result, are scaling back fan fests and legacy programs. Can the task force help ease that burden or encourage FIFA to kick in a bit more money to help out the host cities? For us, it's about making sure that when the fan fests are open, when the games are going on, that they're as safe as possible. We were instrumental in securing the $625 million in this bill, along with the half a billion dollars for drone mitigation. So, I think the federal government has done more than its share to make sure that that these sites are safe and secure. Now, it's up to the host committees to make sure that they're also raising from the state and local [governments]. I'm also hopeful that as we get into the World Cup year, as the draw happens, as people get more and more excited, some more of those of those spigots will turn on for the host committees. Speaking of the draw, it has been reported that FIFA is planning to hold the event in Las Vegas this December, but over the past couple of weeks I've been hearing chatter about it winding up in Washington, D.C. No, but is that your understanding of where it's trending? But if we do our job on the task force, it's going to leave the biggest runway for the sports business world to be able to go and run with this mega sporting event. The sports business world is going to play a huge role in maximizing this World Cup in so many different facets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pictures of the Oval Office have recently shocked many football fans when they noticed the FIFA Club World Club trophy there. The match was held in New Jersey last month. In the photo, US President Donald Trump was holding a meeting with European leaders when fans spotted the trophy. This led to questions amongst fans as to why the trophy was still in the Oval Office. He stated that the trophy was given to him as a token of appreciation for hosting the newly expanded FIFA Club World Cup. According to FIFA, there are three Club World Cup trophies at the moment. The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup kickstarted on June 14, 2025, and continued till July 13, 2025. According to the BBC, FIFA president Gianni Infantino called this event the "world's most successful club competition." The tournament featured about 32 teams, with Chelsea securing the winning spot for themselves by defeating Paris Saint-Germain F.C. Shortly before the final match between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain F.C. took place in New Jersey, Gianni Infantino spoke about the event and said, Infantino continued by stating that the organizers had heard that they wouldn't be able to financially pull off such a massive event. He confirmed that the entire tournament had already generated a revenue worth $2 billion, according to the BBC. He additionally stated that they earned about $33 million per match. As far as the final match was concerned, Donald Trump was also set to attend the same. Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp did not seem to be very fond of the idea that there was an expansion to 32 teams this time. According to reports by the BBC, Klopp even called it "the worst idea ever implemented in football". He reportedly was concerned about "players' welfare." In June, he had an exclusive interview with German newspaper Welt am Sonntag. The former Liverpool manager believed that amid all these constant tournaments, the players got very less time and chance to recover physically as well as mentally. As far as the shining trophy in Donald Trump's office is concerned, it should be clarified that it is not the original FIFA Club World Cup trophy but only a replica of the same.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea's 2025-26 third kit has already been made available in stores, confirming that the FIFA Club World Cup champions badge will be placed on the left chest - the spot typically reserved for the club crest. The new Chelsea 25-26 third shirt features a centralized club crest. With the Chelsea crest and the Nike Swoosh already occupying the center of the shirt, this leaves no room for the FIFA CWC badge in its usual position. As a result, the badge has been moved to the left chest, opposite the Nike logo. This is a different approach compared to Chelsea's 2025-26 home and away kits. On those jerseys, which feature a traditional crest placement on the left, the FIFA Club World Cup badge is applied in the standard central position. This small but interesting detail shows how specific kit design choices can impact the application of official league and competition badges. What do you think of this badge placement on the Chelsea third kit? A smart solution to the central crest problem? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

After Chelsea triumphed over PSG in the Club World Cup last month, a match-issued Cole Palmer shirt has sold for £27,636 on football auction site MatchWornShirt.

The England attacker scored twice in the first half, helping the Blues secure the first-ever Club World Cup trophy in this format.

João Pedro added a third before half-time, which was enough to help Chelsea secure victory over the European Champions.

It was a successful tournament for Chelsea, who had to overcome Benfica, Palmeiras and Fluminese in their route to the final, perhaps an easier run than their French opponents, who overcame Inter Miami, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.

The victory puts the Blues in a good position for this Premier League season, as they will be encouraged after beating the winners of the Champions League.

Following the trophy lift, which awkwardly involved President Donald Trump, match-issued shirts were put up for auction on MatchWornShirt.

MatchWornShirt partners with football clubs to put match-worn and signed shirts in the hands of fans via their online auction platform.

The shirts are collected in the dressing room after the game, and are signed by the players before being authenticated in their offices.

The auction for the shirts gained a lot of interest across the whole of the Chelsea side, with goalscorer João Pedro's shirt selling for £13,119. Additionally, Reece James' shirt sold for £8,734 while Argentine midfielder Enzo Fernández's shirt sold for £4,407.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Pulisic will never be confused with a helicopter parent, hovering over his son. But even the father of Christian Pulisic can't believe some of the headlines, hype and expectations surrounding U.S. national team standout. With Christian and Mark Pulisic in the midst of having a war of words with former U.S. men's national team standouts, we thought this five-part series, It runs in the family, would be appropriate to repost. It gives background of both Pulisics. This interview with Mark Pulisic took place in 2017. Mark Pulisic will never be confused with a helicopter parent, hovering over his son. But even the father of Christian Pulisic can't believe some of the headlines, hype and expectations surrounding U.S. national team standout. Prior to the U.S.'s World Cup qualifier in Mexico in June, a picture of Pulisic dominated the front sports page of Reforma with the headline: American dream. “Listen, here's my take on the media and I really never discuss this,” Mark Pulisic said earlier this year. “Most interviews, they don't go this direction. For them to compare a 17-, 18-year old player to a Landon Donovan, for instance, who has done so much, who has been so successful in this country, who's had such a great career — I don't care if it was in Europe or the U.S. — for his national team, is ridiculous. knows his son his talented, but he also stressed that Christian was only a teenager and at the cusp of his career for club and country. Donovan set the standard for American men's soccer in Major League Soccer and the national team, performing in three World Cups. “Landon Donovan had a great career,” said Pulisic, who is assistant coach of the Rochester Lancers in the United Soccer League. and he'll always be remembered as Landon Donovan. Don't put another name next to that. He hasn't had a serious girlfriend yet. Who knows how he's going to react to his first major setback when he's left out of a national team, when he's left out of the first team? How he is going to come off an injury?” Pulisic then tapped the table he was sitting at three times. For me, as much as the media says they don't want to put too much pressure on him or hype him too much, like did Freddy Adu. So, we can help Christian to some degree with that as well as his surrounding team his agent, but I just don't like when people say they're not hyping because they are. He's going to have bad [days]. If you really want to see an American player who's at the highest level — and I'm not saying it's my son, it may not be my son — talk about the veterans and the older players who have established themselves on the national team and put them in the spotlight, ok? … I think it's important [for U.S. Soccer and be very smart on how they handle their young players. There are some very good other young players coming up in U.S. soccer. There are some very good young players coming up. Give all of them the opportunity, whatever environment they're in, to develop, to start a career, to start having a good career before you start putting them and comparing them to the best players. He understands publicity, but not when it is over the top. You don't want your son to hear all those things. You just want him to focus on playing. But some of the things I do read and some of the things I do hear are quite amusing and are a little bit too much.” At a Tuesday press conference in New York City Tuesday, this reporter asked Christian what he thought of all the hype and attention. I just try to keep it out of my mind as much as I can because that doesn't really matter to me. I put enough pressure on myself. I don't need all this outside tension or whatever. I just try to do the best I can for myself and the people around me.” It has been quite a year for the teen as Christian has earned a starting spot with his club team, Borussia Dortmund, and has become a fulcrum of the U.S. national team attack. “For me everything happened a little bit too fast,” he said. “The past year has been a roller coaster. Being able to play at club level at a high level, and then getting called into the national team, it's amazing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA Club World Cup trophy was won by Chelsea after beating European Champions PSG 3-0 in a match in New Jersey last month, but fans spotted that the trophy is still in the Oval Office when the White House released a new picture recently. This led to a huge chatter on social media among football fans over why the trophy, which was won by Chelsea, is still in the Oval Office. As a token of appreciation for hosting the newly-expanded FIFA World Cup. This was confirmed by Trump in an interview. “I said, ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy?' [They said] ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office, we're making a new one',” Trump said in an interview with DAZN. “And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.” Also Read | Was the 32-team FIFA Club World Cup a success? The real truth, as per FIFA, is that there are three Club World Cup trophies in existence at the moment. The original one is at FIFA's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
