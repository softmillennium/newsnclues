                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin BTC$116,686.28 bounced off the $111,800 support level on Friday, sharply rising by 2.6% to $114,800 after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell hinted at potential rate cuts during a speech at Jackson Hole. The majority of those losses are attributed to traders holding short positions. Despite fears that Powell's speech would have a hawkish tone, he said "the downside risks to employment are rising," and "If those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment." The comments suggest rate cuts could be on the table next month, which would directly benefit risk assets like bitcoin and ether. While liquidations have taken derivatives positions out of the market, open interest has risen to its highest point in four days, suggesting that the bounce is also being backed by leverage, according to Coinalyze. The altcoin market is lagging behind ether with the exception of lido (LDO) and ethena ENA$0.7346, which are both continuing their upside ascent after the SEC clarified rules around staking earlier this month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The EU is weighing Ethereum and Solana for its digital euro, a move that could redefine how central banks approach blockchain. The European Union is weighing a surprising move regarding its long-discussed digital euro. Officials are now exploring whether to run it on public blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH-USD) or Solana (SOL-USD). Until now, most central banks, including China, have favored private blockchains that restrict access to authorized players. If Europe breaks from that approach, the digital euro could resemble U.S. stablecoins rather than China's tightly controlled digital yuan. U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins now dominate with more than 98 percent of the market. European policymakers worry that such heavy reliance on American products could erode Europe's financial independence. In April, ECB board member Piero Cipollone argued that cutting down the use of stablecoins might require a digital euro that people can trust and adopt. Choosing Ethereum or Solana would be a strategic signal that Europe intends to compete directly with U.S. private sector innovation instead of playing catch-up. A digital euro built on Ethereum or Solana could connect instantly with existing crypto infrastructure such as DeFi platforms, wallets, and global payment rails. This would make adoption smoother and reduce the friction that usually slows central bank digital currencies. Juan Ignacio Iba√±ez of MiCA Crypto Alliance put it bluntly when he said, the upside is better integration, while the downside is a stronger state interest in influencing blockchain governance. An ECB spokesperson declined to confirm whether Ethereum or Solana are officially under review and instead pointed to the central bank's FAQ page. The ECB maintains that no model has been chosen. Europe is no longer asking if it should launch a digital euro. Investors interested in crypto should stay informed by tracking the prices of their favorite cryptocurrencies and using technical analysis tools on the TipRanks Cryptocurrency Center.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beijing's consideration of a yuan-backed stablecoin could mark a new front in the global financial system, but experts say dollar dominance, liquidity and trust are high hurdles. China appears to be weighing the launch of a yuan-backed stablecoin, with an initial rollout in Hong Kong and Shanghai, a surprising shift after years of cracking down on crypto while promoting its central bank digital currency, the digital yuan. In the latest episode of Byte-Sized Insight, Cointelegraph spoke with two leaders analyzing China's potential move into stablecoins: Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Patrick Tan, CEO of blockchain intelligence firm ChainArgos. According to Chorzempa, the dominance of Alipay and WeChat Pay in everyday transactions has left little room for China's CBDC experiment. ‚ÄúI tend to think that probably the most interesting applications of a renminbi [yuan] stablecoin is going to be cross-border payments,‚Äù Chorzempa said. Related: China Merchants Bank subsidiary launches crypto exchange in Hong Kong ‚ÄúAnd if the answer is yes,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit's probably not going to be that attractive in comparison to something in USD, which is really freely usable.‚Äù From a market perspective, the hurdles are just as steep. ‚ÄúNinety-eight percent of all stablecoins and stablecoin transactions are dollar-based,‚Äù said Tan. Whether China's stablecoin push succeeds or stalls, it signals one thing clearly: Stablecoins are no longer just crypto plumbing; they've become tools in a larger geopolitical contest over the future of money.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When US President Donald Trump took office in January, he brought with him an ambitious set of campaign-trail promises made to the crypto industry. One of the few ‚Äî and one of his earliest pledges ‚Äî still on the table is his vow to block a US central bank digital currency. ‚ÄúSuch a currency would give the federal government absolute control over your money,‚Äù Trump warned last year. ‚ÄúThey could take your money, and you wouldn't even know it was gone.‚Äù Those efforts took a step forward this week when the House of Representatives passed the annual National Defense Authorization Act, which includes a provision to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar. The language, closely resembling Representative Tom Emmer's CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, would bar the Fed from offering accounts or digital tokens directly to individuals or through intermediaries. While the measure marks progress toward a campaign pledge that resonated strongly with Trump's crypto supporters, no US CBDC has ever been issued, and the provision must still clear the Senate before it becomes law. Trump has already checked off several of his campaign vows to the crypto industry. Just two days after his inauguration, he pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road marketplace, following through on a promise that had become a cause c√©l√®bre among libertarians and Bitcoiners. Gensler announced his resignation ahead of Inauguration Day, ending a tenure defined by aggressive enforcement actions against the industry. Though in its current iteration, the reserve consists only of coins seized by federal authorities rather than taxpayer-funded purchases. Treasury officials recently confirmed no additional buying is planned. In August, Trump signed an executive order aimed at curbing ‚Äúdebanking‚Äù by directing regulators to remove guidance seen as pressuring banks to avoid crypto companies, though experts question how much practical impact it will have. Trump moved quickly in January with an executive order on digital assets that affirmed Americans should be free to hold their own crypto in self-hosted wallets and transact peer to peer without interference. Lower interest rates, another key Trump campaign pledge, have so far remained out of reach. The Fed has kept its benchmark range pinned at 4.25% to 4.5% all year, leaving markets to look to central bank chair Jerome Powell's upcoming Jackson Hole remarks for clues on whether cuts are finally coming. Traders had put the odds of a September rate cut as high as 83% on Wednesday, but that has slipped to just above 71% on Friday. And then there is Trump's most far-fetched promise: to ensure that all remaining Bitcoin is mined in the United States. No serious policy effort has been made toward that goal, and even industry insiders saw this as more campaign rhetoric than an achievable target.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It also asserted that officials are mulling launching the digital euro on the public Ethereum or Solana blockchains, ‚Äúrather than a private one, which had previously been expected, due to privacy concerns.‚Äù While the first statement is undoubtedly accurate, the second one deserves examination as it potentially conflates several topics. As part of the ECB retail digital euro work, it is currently exploring potential innovations involving at least 70 organizations. A few of these are blockchain firms. This is likely the source of these ‚Äòdiscussions'. Potentially someone could lock digital euros with a custodian and issue permissionless blockchain tokens linked to the digital euro. Unlike the real thing, that involves counterparty risks. But there are other avenues to use blockchain. China's digital yuan does not use blockchain at the base layer, but supports the use of blockchain applications and smart contracts tied to its CBDC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump signs the GENIUS Act, a bill that regulates stablecoins, on July 18. Ori Freiman is a post-doctoral fellow at McMaster University's Digital Society Lab. Rafael Morales-Guzman is a doctoral candidate at the University of Saskatchewan and a fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation's Digital Policy Hub. As the U.S. Senate passed landmark legislation to regulate the digital American dollar, Canada's slow response is an economic neglect, practically surrendering our economic future. Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value. This is how stablecoins avoid the price volatility that characterizes cryptocurrencies, making them more suitable for everyday payments and transactions. The crypto irony: Trump's new laws for stablecoins will only reinforce U.S. dollar dominance Crypto industry pushing Canada to follow U.S. lead in embracing stablecoins The operational fees are expected to be much lower than those of traditional bank transfers. Stablecoins facilitate near-instant cross-border transfers with fees, often below 1 per cent. All one needs is a digital wallet app and sound regulations to protect them. Beyond these, stablecoins are also ‚Äúprogrammable money,‚Äù meaning they can be used to automate tasks like payroll or more complex payment workflows, leading to innovative financial products and services. First, it puts Canadian companies at a competitive disadvantage since they can't easily accept stablecoin payments like their global counterparts. Fourth, this is a threat to our economic independence: the inaction pushes Canadians toward U.S. dollar-based stablecoins, an unnecessary capital drain. This trend will likely accelerate because the Bank of Canada has no immediate plans to issue a public digital dollar. While a Bank of Canada-run digital currency comes with its own potential drawbacks, the policy vacuum leaves our market to foreign alternatives. Canada's top financial regulatory agencies are aware of this, collaborating on a framework for stablecoins. For this effort to succeed, our regulators should start by legally defining stablecoins as a payment tool, bringing them under the watch of an updated Retail Payment Activities Act. Under this plan, only registered Canadian financial institutions could issue a stablecoin, and they would be required to back every digital coin with 100-per-cent cash-equivalent reserves. To build public trust, these reserves must be regularly audited by reputable independent firms. Crucially, strong consumer protection rules would hold issuers legally and financially accountable for any funds lost to fraud, cyberthefts or operational failures. Such a framework would provide the clarity needed to adopt new payment technologies responsibly. It would boost innovation and competition, allowing a privately-issued digital Canadian dollar to become the trusted choice for Canadians. Ultimately, this approach will secure Canada's monetary sovereignty in the digital age. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kraken said it has fully deployed distributed validator technology (DVT) for its Ethereum staking service using SSV Network, becoming the first major crypto exchange to put the fault-tolerance setup into production at scale. DVT lets a single Ethereum validator key be split into secure ‚Äúshares‚Äù and run by several operators who must jointly sign duties. Meanwhile, SSV Network operates as an open protocol purpose-built for DVT. In that way, no single operator holds the whole key, and multiple independent nodes must participate to validate blocks. In a Thursday statement, Jonathan Marcus, Kraken's head of strategy, custody, and staking, said the rollout ‚Äúhas fundamentally improved the performance reliability of our ETH validators.‚Äù A major positive touted by the deployment is focused on reducing correlated slashing risk. Validator slashing penalties can occur if nodes go offline or behave inconsistently. Kraken's move is expected to encourage secure staking participation and harden Ethereum's network security, according to SSV Labs Founder Alon Muroch. His firm claims to secure over $18 billion in staked assets across more than 126,000 validators. The exchange is rolling out ‚ÄúxStocks,‚Äù tokenized representations of equities for select non-U.S. markets, and plans to support issuance on additional chains such as Tron, part of a broader industry push toward tokenized traditional assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TRON is outperforming other altcoins, mainly driven by user growth. Justin Sun's blockchain, TRON [TRX] is still making waves not only in terms of price performance but also in major partnerships around the crypto space. The altcoin has outperformed its peers when evaluating their ratio changes against Bitcoin [BTC]. This would let TRON remain competitive in as a layer for stablecoin issuance, DeFi activities and tokenization. It was closely followed by Solana [SOL] and Ethereum [ETH], which barely had 1%. Following this performance, some users were regretting not to have bought TRX in the previous bear market. This bull market has made TRX have the best returns since 2021. Since the 23rd of July, when it traded at $0.24, TRX has stayed above the trendline support with timely bounce of it. Still, the altcoin shows urge to reclaim $0.37 which was its previous peak as users continue to rise. User growth is the standout driver of TRON's price growth, driven by the surge in chain activity. Kraken users will now trade their xStocks on the TRON blockchain. Kraken's tokenized equities include Apple, Tesla, among others. Additionally, TXR is being integrated on MetaMask per CoinMarketCap. This will bring more than 100 million users on board. Also, institutions have been heavily relying on the blockchain in moving their USDT. Most of the USDT is transacted on TRON blockchain, with more than $860 million flowing into exchanges. This has been the case since 2022, with USDT accounting for 61% of total transactions on TRON. Bitfinex came second, but its volume, in reality, was about a fifth of what was moved on OKX.
