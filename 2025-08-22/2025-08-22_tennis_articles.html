                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The wait for a successful men's singles title defence at the US Open is up to 17 years, but Jannik Sinner will have every reason to believe he can snap it this fortnight in New York. You May Also Like: Jannik Sinner's pursuit of rare triple major season At his pre-tournament press conference Friday in New York, defending champion Sinner spoke assuredly when asked how he had recovered from the illness that caused him to retire from Monday's final against Carlos Alcaraz in Cincinnati. “I'm firstly very happy to be back here. I have recovered mostly, not 100% yet, but we are aiming to be there in couple of days. So should be all fine for the tournament.” 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner was asked his thoughts on why defending the title has been so tough in recent years at the US Open, where the last man to win consecutive crowns was Roger Federer (the Swiss won five in a row from 2004 to 2008). Many things can change,” said the 20-time tour-level titlist. I feel like here it changes a lot if you play night or if you play day. “For example, also obviously we are sleeping in the city, and it takes one hour to come [to Flushing Meadows}. But I feel if you don't handle them very well, then it's also very difficult to play the best possible tennis. I always say that the future is unpredictable. So I don't know what's going to happen this time. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

A campaign group has said it will seek to take its legal battle over plans to almost triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site to the Court of Appeal after losing a High Court challenge. Save Wimbledon Park (SWP) previously took legal action against the Greater London Authority (GLA) over its 2024 decision to grant planning permission for the expansion, but Mr Justice Saini dismissed the challenge last month. On Friday, SWP said that it had asked the Court of Appeal for the green light to challenge the High Court's ruling, a decision it said had “not been taken lightly”. “Unwanted development of public open spaces is proposed all over London: Wimbledon Park is just one example.” They claimed that Wimbledon Park – a Grade II*-listed heritage site partly designed by Lancelot “Capability” Brown – was covered by trusts and covenants governing how it could be used. In a ruling, Mr Justice Saini found that the decision to approve the plans was “a planning judgment rationally exercised and having regard to appropriate and relevant factors”. SWP said on Friday that it believed Mr Justice Saini “took insufficient account of the statutory trust and the restrictive covenants”. It continued that a decision on whether it could appeal against the ruling was expected later this year. Mr Hamilton said that the plans would come at “devastating cost to the local environment and community”, while Ms Ruby said that the plans would “desecrate a precious heritage landscape”. The expansion proposals would see seven maintenance buildings, access points, and an area of parkland with permissive public access constructed, in addition to the courts and associated infrastructure. They would also include work on Wimbledon Lake. Planning permission for the scheme was granted by Jules Pipe, London's deputy mayor for planning, who said that the proposals “would facilitate very significant benefits” which “clearly outweigh the harm”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thousands of fans will flock through the gates at Flushing Meadows to witness the entertaining action unfold. It remains to be seen which players will conquer New York and lift the coveted US Open title, and the tournament has drawn attention from stars in other sports. Sinner is the world number one and defending champion, while Alcaraz claimed the Cincinnati Open title on Monday. Furthermore, Novak Djokovic, who is aiming for a record 25th Grand Slam title and a fifth at the US Open, cannot be counted out. But Sky Sports asked Premier League footballers Rodri and Alexis Mac Allister who they would pick to lift the title, and they threw their support behind Alcaraz. “I will say Carlos,” Rodri answered, before MacAllister added: “Today Sinner and Alcaraz are up there, so I'm going to go with Alcaraz.” Sinner and Alcaraz are the world's top two players and they have contested the last four tournament finals they have entered, two each at Grand Slam and Masters 1000 level. They have firmly established themselves as the leading men of this era of men's tennis, and the French Open final illustrated how phenomenal their matches can be when both are at their best. Despite their intense and fierce rivalry on court, Alcaraz stressed the fact he has a good relationship with Sinner both in an outside of tennis. “But although tennis is an individual sport, we are with the same players every week, day in and day out … Jannik and I, who have had great battles on the court, see each other a lot off of it. We want to win and beat each other, but then off court, being good people and getting along is another matter.</p>

Well, things have not quite gone according to plan lately for Pegula, a 31-year-old who was born in New York and is based in Florida.

I'm kind of a perfectionist, so I don't like having to say that," said Pegula, whose parents own the NFL's Buffalo Bills and NHL's Buffalo Sabres. "I feel like I've gone through phases in my career—a few tournaments—where I feel like that, sometimes, and you have to figure out how to get out of it and not feel sorry for yourself or make excuses," she added. "I feel like I've gone through phases in my career—a few tournaments—where I feel like that, sometimes, and you have to figure out how to get out of it and not feel sorry for yourself or make excuses," she added. It had to, and not simply because that was the most successful run she had produced in 23 career appearances at major tournaments to that point.Remember (even if she might prefer not to): Pegula was 0-6 in Grand Slam quarterfinals until upsetting then-No. 1 Iga Swiatek in that round there in rather dominant fashion, winning 6-2, 6-4.Then Pegula reached her first title match at one of the sport's four most important events by eliminating 2023 French Open runner-up Karolina Muchova in three sets, before losing to current No. "There's a little bit more pressure," Pegula said of how her mindset is different this time around, "but at the same time, (there is) a little bit more confidence. Coming into this swing last year, there wasn't as much pressure, but I also was a little worried about how I would do."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The main draw for the 2025 men's singles tournament at the US Open has been announced, and some stars have been handed a much better path than others. Novak Djokovic's pursuit of a 25th major title at Flushing Meadows will begin with a favourable string of opening matchups, and the Serb can avoid the top two-ranked players until the semifinals. For defending champion Jannik Sinner, a potential fourth-round headache awaits in the form of Alexander Bublik, who is the only man to beat him this season outside of Carlos Alcaraz. Alcaraz's route to the final does not come without its difficulties either, as the Spaniard finds himself on a collision course with both Daniil Medvedev and Ben Shelton. As the full draw begins to take shape with the conclusion of qualifying, one former top 20 player has failed to reach the first round in New York. The dream is over, however, for former Wimbledon quarterfinalist Cristian Garin, who suffered defeat to 35-year-old Argentine Marco Trungelli in straight sets. Garin reached a career high of world number 17 in 2021, and earned his best result at a major in 2022, when he made the last eight at the All England Club. In SW19 that year, the Chilean secured a statement victory over now-world number eight Alex de Minaur in a thrilling five-setter. In 2023, Garin recorded a first-round finish at the Australian Open, but shortly before Roland Garros, he announced he would pull out of the event due to a broken rib. He failed to qualify for the US Open later that season, and since then, Garin has only featured in the main draw of a Grand Slam four times.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK — Tennis apparel sponsorship is a big business. But if one looks beyond that upper echelon and into the U.S. Open's qualifying tournament – where lower-ranked players compete for spots in the main draw – there's a world of local startups and small clothing businesses making their way into the booming tennis business. “It's key to sponsor and help our Swiss players,” said Laura Tolub, the chief operating officer of Fourteen Company. That country connection is often important on the player's side, too. Swiss player Marc-Andrea Hüsler, ranked 228th, won his second round qualifying match Thursday afternoon in Fourteen apparel. “It's a Swiss brand, so I wanted to do something with the Swiss if possible,” he said about his decision to join the brand two years ago. They've built into a tight-knit community, according to Tolub. “(Some players) want to have the feeling they are part of a family, which Fourteen is,” she said. She is sponsored by The Indian Maharadja, a Dutch company known for its hockey clothing and based out of Nieuwkuijk, a small town of about 5,000 people. “They were a very small startup, like three, four years ago,” Hartono said. “They approached me through social media, they just came at me and said, ‘Hey, we're a small company, we want to start coming into tennis. Other qualifiers look for the right fit beyond country lines. His match clothes are made by a small upstart in Mexico called Lega, an apparel brand that's run by “a friend of a friend,” who the Argentine said he has become quite close with through their time working together. His shirts have been getting attention from keen-eyed fans – at the French Open, his top had a large Eiffel Tower design, and now in the U.S. Open's qualifying rounds, it's a Statue of Liberty. “It's a complete new run,” he said of the New York City shirt, which was designed and manufactured by Lega specifically for his U.S. Open matches. “But this one was completely on (the Lega designer), and I loved it.” Privacy Policy | Terms of service | Subscription terms | Your ad choices | Cookie Settings | California Privacy Rights | About Us | Contact Newsday | Reprints & permissions | Advertise with Newsday | Help</p>

While her comeback has made headlines, it's Vickery's lucrative side hustle that has truly set the internet ablaze in recent days. The Florida native, who charges $12.99 a month for access to what she calls 'content too spicy for Instagram', has faced sharp criticism since joining the x-rated platform. Some fans claim she's tarnishing the sport but Vickery insists her OnlyFans success has helped keep her tennis career alive. 'When you're on tour you're not automatically making a ton of money,' Vickery told the New York Post from Flushing Meadows. 'Yes, I have done very well throughout my career. 'But at the same time, tennis players spend $100K plus a year on coaching, hotels, food, training, physio. Vickery has banked just over $2million throughout her 14-year career on the court. Outside of the sport, she demands a $1,000 deposit fee just to date her. 'It's an expensive sport, so I invest a lot of my money from there back into tennis, and I think that's one thing people don't understand. If I have the potential to make a lot of money on there, why am I not going to take it? 'I no longer date for free due to the behavior of men I now require a pre-date deposit send me 1,000 and we can make it happen my cashapp is $Sachiavick,' she told her 39,4000 followers during an Instagram Q&A session earlier this week. While Vickery's move may have sent ripples through the tennis world, she has no regrets. 'I've always pushed boundaries,' she said on the Black Spin Global podcast earlier this year. I'm very open about a lot of stuff. 'I'm still playing tennis, my career is still going but I also want to do things outside of tennis. I'm starting to explore more opportunities on social media.' 'Obviously there are levels to OnlyFans, you have athletes like Nick [Kyrgios] and Alex [Muller] who are going to be posting tennis content for the most part and then you have the other complete extreme, which I'm not. Being a tennis player definitely helped my marketing. 'Obviously, I'm going to get some negative feedback but that's just normal. Whatever you do in life there's always going to be some criticism. Yet as she stepped onto the Grand Slam stage in Flushing Meadows again this week, Vickery once again hit back at her critics. 'I'm very open-minded and I don't care what people think of me … it's also the easiest money I've ever made and I enjoy doing it,' said Vickery when asked about balancing the two entirely different worlds together in an Instagram Q&A session. 'I will never talk s*** about girls on OnlyFans ever again for the rest of my life. Vickery, whose father Rawle is a former soccer player and brother Dominque Mitchell played football at South Carolina State, turned professional in 2011 after training with USTA and Mouratoglou Academy in France. But her career peaked back in 2018, when she managed a career-high ranking of World No 73.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The top men's and women's tennis players are poised to go far at the 2025 US Open. Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are expected to face off in another major final in the men's singles draw. Women's top seed Aryna Sabalenka isn't the betting favorite, but she should be considered as the top choice to win given her track record on hard courts. Upsets will happen in the first few rounds, but there shouldn't be dreams of an unlikely winner in either bracket. The last seven men's singles major titles have been won by Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. The two stars of the men's game are on track to face each other in another final in New York. 1 overall seed and Alcaraz is the No. Marin Cilic, Juan Martin Del Potro and Dominic Thiem all snuck in major titles during the Djokovic-Nadal-Federer reign. Fritz and Shelton are the two best long-shot betting options. Fritz made the final in New York last year and Shelton was a semifinalist in 2023. The two Americans probably have to get through both of Djokovic and Alcaraz just to get to the final, but it's worth noting that Djokovic and Alcaraz were both out by the third round in New York last year. That statistic doesn't bode well for reigning champion Aryna Sabalenka. Sabalenka is a lock to go far in New York. She's advanced to four straight semifinals at the US Open and she's made to the semifinals in seven of her last nine hard-court majors. Iga Swiatek's had mixed results on the hard courts. She only has three semifinal appearances between Australia and New York and she's gotten past the fourth round just twice in six US Open appearances. Swiatek reached the semis in every major so far in 2025, but she's far more vulnerable to an upset than Sabalenka on the hard court, which is why it's safer to bet on Sabalenka to win. Australian Open winner Madison Keys and fellow American Coco Gauff will be tough to beat in Swiatek's portion of the draw. Keys is a three-time US Open semifinalist and she should play freer in front of the home crowd with a major now under her belt. Look for Keys to make a deep run, and if she plays well, we could see a rematch of the Australian Open final between her and Sabalenka.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK (AP) — There was a time, not all that long ago, when any conversation about the up-and-coming U.S. players in men's tennis included a reference to Sebastian Korda. 213 before losing to his idol, Rafael Nadal. And in 2023, Korda made it to the first Grand Slam quarterfinal of his career at the Australian Open. Injuries derailed Korda's progress, though, including surgery on his right elbow last year and a stress fracture in his right shin this year. “It was a long time,” the 25-year-old Korda, who reached the Winston-Salem Open semifinals but withdrew because of an illness Friday, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “But it's nice to be playing again.” He grew up in as sports-forward a family as there is: His parents were professional tennis players — Mom, Regina, was ranked in the top 30, and Dad, Petr, won the 1998 Australian Open and was the runner-up at the 1992 French Open — and his sisters, Nelly (ranked No. After the shin problem was confirmed by an MRI exam, Korda needed a bit of a break, and only was back to hitting balls at 100% about two weeks ago. “It's been a lot of fun being back out here and running around,” Korda said. “Something I won't ever take for granted again is being able to run pain-free.” Back then, there was little reason to believe he wasn't ready to keep on climbing, right alongside other Americans such as Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul. But Korda's body wouldn't let him. When the rankings points he earned in Washington and Montreal came off his record because he missed both events this year, Korda slid all the way down to No. “I definitely haven't been playing healthy. That's kind of the main goal right now,” Korda said. “I'm not comparing myself to anyone, but definitely, there's a lot of motivation from seeing your peers doing so well — Ben, Taylor, Frances, Tommy, (Alex) Michelsen, Learner (Tien). Howard Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Maria Sharapova and her father, Yuri, arrived in Florida in 1994 -- from the frigid outer reaches of Eastern Europe -- they only had a borrowed $700 and couldn't speak English. A year earlier, at a tennis clinic, 18-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratilova had recommended professional training at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida with coach Nick Bollettieri. Two years later, Sharapova was already so clearly talented that IMG underwrote her scholarship. What began as a scholarship soon became one of the most recognizable careers in modern tennis. On Saturday, the five-time major singles champion -- and one of only seven women in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam -- will be enshrined along with doubles champions Mike and Bob Bryan in the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island. It's a worthy honor, for Sharapova finished her career with 36 WTA Tour-level titles, more than $28 million in prize money and a record of 645-171 (.790). Two years later, she was a finalist at the Australian Open and Wimbledon junior tournaments. Sharapova turned professional on the day of her 14th birthday. A year later, she kicked it into another gear, winning Wimbledon at the age of 17. Sharapova loved the strawberries and cream, but most of all she enjoyed stunning two-time defending champion Serena Williams 6-1, 6-4 in the final. That win ended the numerous comparisons to countrywoman Anna Kournikova, a blazing talent who never quite panned out as a professional. Sharapova was the first player from her country to win Wimbledon and, overall, the third youngest ever. Years later, she was asked for a favorite memory from her playing days. “I'd say your first Grand Slam final is ultimately just the most memorable one,” Sharapova said. “In my career, it came at a very young age. I was playing against Serena Williams, and everything felt like I should have just been happy to be there, but I was so fearless. “It's always the memory that comes to mind because I least expected it to come then,” she said. Henin, who reached all four major finals that year, gave Sharapova her due. Two years later, at the 2008 Australian Open, Sharapova added a third different Grand Slam to her eclectic resume. After missing chunks of time the previous year with a serious shoulder injury, Sharapova -- in terms of ranking -- was actually the underdog against Ana Ivanovic after getting through, among others, Lindsay Davenport, Henin and Jelena Jankovic. “If someone had told me in the middle of last year I'd be standing here with the big one,” Sharapova said, “I'd have said, ‘Forget it. And, because of the stress involved, her greatest vulnerability. A few months after winning in Melbourne, Sharapova developed shoulder pain and eventually two tears were discovered in her rotator cuff. When rehabilitation didn't work, she elected to undergo surgery. And I didn't get many answers back, which was a little frightening, because you always want to look toward the positives.” After sitting out for 10 months, she returned to tennis in the spring of 2009. Adapting to that adversity, Sharapova redesigned her serve -- reinvented herself, actually -- to take pressure off the joint most responsible for her success. And while that leave of absence took her outside the Top 100, she returned to the No. 1 spot after an unexpected title run at Roland Garros in 2012. On the red clay that had once left her completely befuddled, Sharapova beat Sara Errani in the 2012 final and, with it, joined the short list of women to win all four majors. “It's the most incredible feeling,” Sharapova said after her win in Paris. “There are so many tough days where you feel like giving up, but you don't. And then she did it again two years later, defeating Simona Halep in a three-set match that ran more than three hours. “This is the toughest Grand Slam final I've ever played,” Sharapova told reporters. “If somebody had told me ... at some stage in my career, that I'd have more Roland Garros titles than any other Grand Slam, I'd probably go get drunk -- or tell them to get drunk.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Athletic's tennis writers, Matthew Futterman and Charlie Eccleshare, analyze an intriguing draw, as well as offering some of their picks for the best matches of the opening days. When those two have been as dominant as Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, who have shared the past seven majors, that's especially the case. Given their head-to-head record, he will surely be happier with Alcaraz — especially as he would not meet the Spaniard until the semifinals. Djokovic won on that occasion, as he did in last year's Olympic final. 1, by contrast, dispatched Djokovic in straight sets at Roland-Garros and Wimbledon, and seems a more reliable bet to reach the latter stages of the majors. Alcaraz has been slightly less consistent, falling in the second round at last year's U.S. Open against Botic van de Zandschulp. But he has also developed his serve into a pressure release valve, beaten Djokovic in two Wimbledon finals, and come through two potentially discomfiting matches against physically limited opponents to win the Cincinnati Open. After being thrashed by Sinner at Wimbledon, Djokovic spoke about not having enough gas left in the tank to beat one, let alone both, of the current Big Two in men's tennis. If someone took out Alcaraz earlier in the tournament, that would be an enormous boost for Djokovic. Defeating Sinner would be an almighty task, but doing so after overcoming Alcaraz looks borderline impossible this year. Others in the draw might have something to say about Djokovic's progress, especially Taylor Fritz, who would meet him in the quarters. But aside from a mid-match retirement against Alexander Zverev, the only player not named Sinner or Alcaraz to beat him at a Grand Slam since 2022 is Alexei Popyrin. Especially Sabalenka, who crumbled under the crush of a pro-Gauff New York crowd two years ago. Gauff can become a force in New York, and loves the atmosphere, especially at night. But right now, she is in a vulnerable moment. Gauff hasn't looked convincing since the French Open final, and now she is reconstructing her serve. She's brought in the biomechanist Gavin MacMillan, who helped Sabalenka fix her serve three years ago when she was about where Gauff is now, double-faulting 20 times every match. Gauff tapping MacMillan the week before a Grand Slam — arguably her most important tournament as the leading American — could be a sign she didn't think she had any shot of winning this thing, or maybe even winning matches, in her current state. She was ready to take the long view, trying to fix her serve so she can rely on it for 10 years instead of 10 minutes. That process starts now, even if a massive tournament is just days away. In her mind, getting it as soon as possible is more important than whether she can find a way to beat Świątek in one match in one of what will likely be 80 Grand Slams she plays during her career. Aside from Sinner and Alcaraz, does anyone have a better chance of winning the U.S. Open than Ben Shelton? Shelton has only lost to Sinner or Alcaraz at the Grand Slams this year. He had good chances to take early leads in all three matches. Then he won the Canadian Open, which Sinner and Alcaraz skipped, making something of a statement. As for Fritz, he may have to go through Djokovic to make the semis and the world No. The percentages would suggest all of this is moot. Sinner and Alcaraz are levels above everyone else — but things happen in New York. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal never faced each other here. Sinner and Alcaraz are probably going to meet in the final but Shelton might fancy his chances on a hard court in front of a frothy Ashe crowd against Alcaraz — at least, more than against Sinner, who is 21-0 in the last three hard court majors. Novak Djokovic (7) vs. Learner Tien: The 24-time Grand Slam champion, who hasn't played a singles match since Wimbledon, likely under the lights on Ashe, against a promising young American lefty with a knack for top-10 upsets on his favorite surface. There are an estimated 500,000 Brazilians in the New York area. Tomljanović ended Serena Williams' career on Ashe three years ago. She won't be afraid of facing Gauff and 24,000 fans The women's draw looks bottom-heavy, with all three of this year's Grand Slam winners in that half. Gauff and Madison Keys are slated to meet in one of the quarterfinals, with Amanda Anisimova due for a rematch of the Wimbledon final that Świątek won 6-0, 6-0 a month ago. Świątek, full of confidence after winning at the Cincinnati Open, doesn't have too many banana skins until that point. In the top half, Sabalenka will be pretty pleased with the three other high seeds being Jasmine Paolini, Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva — players she has a lot less baggage against than the quartet above, three of whom have beaten her at the slams this year. Sabalenka will want to avoid Elena Rybakina, a possible quarterfinal opponent. Rybakina thrashed Sabalenka 6-1, 6-4 in Cincinnati last week and is not afraid of the world No. In the fourth round, Sabalenka is slated to meet the big-hitting Clara Tauson, another player who has beaten her this year. Leylah Fernandez might also be waiting in the third round but if Sabalenka can get through that tricky mid-section, she would look a strong favourite to reach the final. For Świątek, she might relish the prospect of facing all these top players and acquiring the match-toughness that Sabalenka might get less of from her later rounds. Lois Boisson and Victoria Mboko have made good on the wild cards they received from their national tennis federations this year. Mboko took hers to the Canadian Open title. Those achievements earned them the ranking points required to enter directly into the main draws without any charity. Mboko's triumph in Montreal has earned her the No. Krejcikova has not been in Grand Slam-winning form for a while and has battled injuries the past year, but she won three matches in Cincinnati. This might be a tough ask for Mboko, who could feel the pressure of expectation for the first time. As for Boisson, can her game transfer to a hard court? She has drawn Viktorija Golubic of Switzerland in the first round. 5 seed Jack Draper are theoretically the most likely to have a deep run — not just because of their ranking, but their pedigree, too. Fritz reached the final here last year, while Draper was a semifinalist. Both look entirely at home on this surface and in these conditions. He could also face the similarly out-of-form No. 21 seed Tomáš Macháč or Fonseca in the fourth round. 31 seed Gabriel Diallo is his slated third-round opponent, while one of the Italians, Lorenzo Musetti or Flavio Cobolli, could await in the last 16. Draper could also play the huge-serving Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard at that stage. He opens up against a qualifier or lucky loser. 3 seed but has been unconvincing since reaching the Australian Open final in January. He has Alex de Minaur, Karen Khachanov, and Andrey Rublev as the highest-ranked players in his quarter. Were it not for his ropey form this year, he would be a big favourite to work his way through that and set up a likely semifinal against Sinner. But at present there are few certainties for a player who knows he needs to be more aggressive but fighting his more conservative instincts. The most exciting wild card in the draw by a distance, up against a player with a throwback game that wouldn't have looked out of place when Williams made her tour debut 31 years ago. After her thrilling run to the Canadian Open title, Mboko is looking to back that up with her first run to the second week of a Grand Slam. I know recommending someone with as big a serve as Opelka's might sound like a wind-up, but he's also the classic “on his day” opponent. Even a five-time Grand Slam champion might struggle — or at the very least, be forced to produce some magical defense.

Thousands of players took part in the qualifying stages this year, leading to county and regional finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on Wimbledon's Aorangi Courts last week. Grover, who won the world championship doubles and singles title in 2024, was part of a para standing tennis exhibition match during the tournament and noted just how important it is to shine a light on the sport. He said: "Wimbledon is such an historic venue and so to be able to be in Play Your Way To Wimbledon just helps us show people who don't necessarily think that tennis is for them that they can play on these courts. "It's a fantastic experience to see all the age groups and disability formats. For us as para standings tennis players, to show our sport on the same courts that so many pros have been on is brilliant. This year's tournament delivered over 10,000 playing opportunities with thousands of singles and doubles players taking part at 800 venues, leading to county and area finals in June and July, with the winners progressing to the national finals on the All England Club's Aorangi Courts from 3 – 9 August 2025. Reid added: “We want tennis to be available and accessible to everybody and get as many people as possible enjoying the sport. “This event encapsulates that perfectly and we're proud to be a part of it.” Play Your Way to Wimbledon, powered by Vodafone, is the UK's largest individual mass participation tennis competition.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite the fact she's already earned millions in prize money Pro tennis player, Sachia Vickery has clapped back at criticism over her OnlyFans account whilst she's playing in the US Open, describing it as the “easiest money” she's “ever made.” Despite Sachia earning over $2 million in prize money throughout her career, she explained that the platform has massively helped her finically when she's not playing matches. I will never talk s**t about girls on OnlyFans ever again for the rest of my life. Sachia Vickery currently charges $12.99 per month for her OnlyFans, with a representative for the tennis playing confirming that her content is more suggestive than explicit. They stated that her content shouldn't be seen as “sex work” and clarified that there are “no full nudity or sexual acts performed” on her account. The representative also went into further detail about why the tennis pro decided to start her account in the first place, saying: “Vickery was off [for] six months due to a major injury and in that time, OnlyFans was pursued, tennis was not stopped to go into OnlyFans.” After her match at the US Open on Thursday, Sachia opened up more about her account, explaining that the adult site is “a great moneymaker.” “Yes, I have done very well throughout my career. “It's an expensive sport, so you know I invest a lot of my money from there back into tennis, and I think that's one thing people don't understand.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With four players remaining it's anybody's guess who will take the trophy home. Both players are having very disappointing seasons but can turn them around for a title here. While Mpetshi Perricard is young and expected to have a long career as at least a solid ATP level player, for van de Zandschulp winning this event would arguably be the biggest achievement of his career so far. He has reached two finals, both in Munich, but is yet to actually win an ATP level event. Last year at the US Open he beat Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets in what was undoubtedly the biggest win of his career, and he seems once again to be playing quite well at this time of the year. That said, this match is very likely to be closed by tiebreaks, and whoever can keep their composure and execute better in the biggest points will have the edge. Editor's Note: This article was accidentally published early. Marton Fucsovics had not yet won his quarterfinal match at the time of publishing. While it's clear that his injury issues haven't helped, Korda hasn't really been able to deliver on the expectations many had of him. So far he has peaked at #15 in the rankings with only two titles, which is a disappointing resumé for someone with his level of talent and who has shown the ability to beat the likes of Alcaraz, Zverev, and Medvedev.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's plenty to look at during a tennis spectacle like the U.S. Open, where a night match in Arthur Ashe Stadium might hold 23,000 fans, hundreds of sponsor activations, dozens of celebrities and who knows how many Honey Deuces. But everyone watching, whether in-person or on TV at home, looks at one thing more than any other during a match: the tennis ball. With each tournament free to negotiate with any brand it chooses, Forbes estimates the biggest events on the calendar can fetch $200,000 to $500,000 annually, in addition to a supply of the 70,000 or so balls used during play. This sponsorship free-for-all has become a hot-button issue for professional players since different brands make balls with slightly different weights, densities and felt—all of which affect how it feels to hit for hours each day. “A lot of players are adamant about the effects that changing balls week in and week out have had on their body,” says Chris Eubanks, a former Wimbledon semifinalist and the ATP's 160th-ranked singles player, who will serve as an analyst for ESPN at the U.S. Open next week. Andy Roddick, an American tennis legend who won the 2003 U.S. Open, put it another way on his Served podcast earlier this year. The ATP, which organizes the men's tour, had been hearing these complaints for years but felt powerless to address them until 2023, when it passed a moratorium on tournaments signing new contracts with ball manufacturers and secured the rights to negotiate future deals on behalf of all of its tournaments. After another quiet two years, the tour unveiled its grand plan in June, finally taking action to create some tour-wide consistency. Historically, tennis balls were too important a sponsorship category to disrupt. During the pandemic, however, differences between ball brands became more of a focus as worker shortages at rubber and felt companies and strained supply chains led to inconsistent quality. At certain tournaments, players reported low ball pressure and overly fluffy balls that were leading to more stress on the arm. Nick Kyrgios, a player never afraid to wade into controversy, later posted, “The people who think balls aren't a big enough factor to result in an athlete being hurt are potatoes.” By that point, the relative weight of tennis balls as a sponsorship category had decreased dramatically. At big events like Masters 1000s and Grand Slams, airline, banking and car brands today might pay ten times as much as ball manufacturers for their partnerships, and the tour also distributes more money from media rights and data collection deals, making ball sponsorships a less significant slice of the revenue pie. That new financial reality allowed the ATP to step in. “Clearly it wouldn't have happened even 10 years ago,” says Geoffroy Bourbon, the ATP's executive vice president for Europe. “Now, it's become much easier to go to tournament directors and say, ‘Relinquish your grip on the category, and let's do what's right from a sporting standpoint. "By creating swings, we've created a scarcity of opportunities to be present on tour, so that's the commercial leverage we have over manufacturers,” Bourbon says. About 25% of tour events were forced to change their ball sponsor, but “as long as the money stayed the same, we're happy,” one tournament organizer told Forbes. Instead of partnering with an individual marquee event or one that arrives at a strategic point on the calendar—for instance, one Masters 1000 tournament in the spring and one in the fall, for a six-figure combined sum—a brand might need to make a seven-figure offer to sponsor a swing of Masters 1000-, 500- and 250-level events. “It wasn't ideal for them from a marketing standpoint, for sure, but at the same time they recognize what we're trying to do,” Bourbon says. The ultimate goal, Bourbon says, is to provide manufacturers with objective, data-based player feedback they can use to improve the quality of balls, which in turn should raise the quality of play and limit injuries. “When you end up not having your best talent show up at your most important tournaments because they've switched balls three times in three weeks and they've got a wrist ache, that is more important to us than $5,000 more here or there.” In the short term, ball centralization remains an imperfect system. For players like Eubanks, continuity can't come soon enough. “When we're having two weeks on, three weeks off, back to Ball A for another week and then using Ball C for this week, it just continues to drive us crazy,” he says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Born in Cordoba, Argentina, he moved to Buenos Aires as a teenager to pursue tennis professionally, inspired by countryman Guillermo Vilas. As a junior, his biggest achievement was reaching the Roland Garros boys' final in 1995 against Mariano Zabaleta, though he fell short of the title. By 1998, he broke through on the ATP Tour, capturing his first career title in Palermo, Italy, against fellow Argentine Franco Squillari. He was second only to Guga Kuerten in clay-court victories, winning the Bogota Open and reaching finals in Mexico City, Santiago, Gstaad, and Umag. But Puerta's rise was derailed by a serious wrist injury while training with coach Hernan Gumy. The setback shook him both physically and mentally. First ball, he hit it softly, I set up my forehand, swung, and felt a tremendous pain. That year I ended up playing with injections. That's when instability in my career began, along with mental struggles,” Puerta told La Nacion. Mariano Puerta celebrates a match point against Nikolay Davydenko during the 2005 Roland Garros. Puerta later admitted it took him time to realize he needed psychological help. I felt 100 percent responsible for the failure of my comeback after surgery. I was so aware of it that during many tournaments I was hurting myself on purpose—sometimes hitting balls out deliberately, not being humble, not chasing certain shots. It takes a lot of humility to succeed. Having so much success at a young age can make you arrogant. I couldn't go on like that,'” Puerta recalled. He was World No.1, won Roland Garros before Nadal, and now plays a pivotal role in Alcaraz's career But at the ATP tournament in Viña del Mar, after losing to fellow Argentine Agustin Calleri, he tested positive for clenbuterol, a banned substance. “After that match in Chile, I had a doping test—everything seemed normal. Months later they told me it was positive. Cleared to compete again in mid-2004, Puerta mounted an impressive comeback. He reached the Buenos Aires final in 2005, then won his third ATP title in Casablanca by defeating Juan “Pico” Monaco. Puerta advanced to the final, where he faced a young Rafael Nadal, who was seeking his first Grand Slam title. Rafael Nadal and Mariano Puerta pose with Zinedine Zidane after the 2005 Roland Garros final. A drug test from Roland Garros came back positive, this time for epinephrine. Puerta argued the trace amount found in his body came from accidentally drinking from his wife's water bottle, which contained medication. The penalty was severe: an eight-year suspension, effectively a career-ending sanction. Despite the controversies, Puerta still left his mark on Argentine tennis. He reached a career-high ranking of World No. 9 in August 2005 and played a crucial role in Argentina's Davis Cup win over Australia that same year, teaming with David Nalbandian to defeat Wayne Arthurs and Lleyton Hewitt in doubles on grass.
