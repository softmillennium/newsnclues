                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Visitors at Disney World's Epcot are reporting an out-of-this-world experience. While waiting for the nightly fireworks show with her boyfriend, Morgan Huelsman, digital director of “The Bobby Bones Show”, said she saw a sudden bright light overhead — one that apparently had nothing to do with the planned pyrotechnics. A video of the episode posted to the official “Bobby Bones Show” X account on Aug. 21 was widely circulated online — sparking discussion over what Huelsman could have seen. “[Morgan] saw this hovering over EPCOT at Disney World for several minutes before it just blipped away,” the post said. One person noted that there had been a rocket launch from Cape Canaveral earlier in the week which could explain the sighting, but show staff reported that the object “was never moving.” It's unknown exactly when the video was taken, though SpaceX did launch a batch of satellites for Starlink out of Cape Canaveral on Aug. 14 and Aug. 18 — just about 60 miles away from Walt Disney World. @webgirlmorgan saw this hovering over EPCOT at Disney World for several minutes before it just blipped away. Epcot's proximity to NASA launch sites has sparked scores of UFO reports from parkgoers. Experts have noted that the combination of clear skies in Florida, rocket launches and highly populated tourist areas make it a hotspot for misidentified aerial phenomena. Disney has yet to comment on the mysterious episode.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If companies like Boeing or Lockheed Martin really are sitting on non-human intelligence tech (NHI), the U.S. government would have a huge problem: how do you keep something that valuable secret when it's technically inside publicly traded corporations? Shareholders, analysts, quarterly reports waaay too many eyes. Just buy them out. Privatize the whole thing. Turn them into black-budget R&D labs under direct government control, with total security over the workforce. And it wouldn't even be insanely expensive compared to other things the goverment waists money on. A few hundred billion dollars is basically pocket change in Washingtn  Boeing and Lockheed at 2x market value are still very cheap compared next to overinflated tech companies. If nhi tech was on the table, that would probably be the best deal in history. The Trump administration already has a lot of connections in the private equity and investments & business intelligence defence branche ie Palantir and Anduril.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ComingSoon can exclusively reveal a preview of High Strangeness: Book One. High Strangeness is a new double-sized, prestige-format, five-part experiment in comics that is influenced by real cases of paranormal phenomena. Check out the exclusive High Strangeness: Book One preview below (watch more trailers and clips): You can also check out some cover art for the book here: Magazine writer Harry Kean has been dispatched to rural Indiana to investigate the sudden disappearance of Becky Plume, a local teenager who stepped into the national spotlight with staggering photographic evidence of a recent UFO sighting. Frustrated to leave his developing stories in Chicago—and the wife he's hoping to win back—Harry sets off to expose a hoax but instead finds himself in a labyrinth of high strangeness involving a missing girl, her boyfriend, a UFO, and some mysterious black-clad “visitors circling at the perimeter of a mystery more vast than Harry could possibly imagine. Jim Perry also provides a feature-length essay regarding “the historical facts and documentary evidence underpinning the phenomena detailed” in each book. Future issues will be written by Zac Thompson, Christopher Cantwell, Cecil Castellucci, and Christian Ward, while art comes from Noah Bailey, Valeria Burzo, Chloe Stawski, and Ward. High Strangeness: Book One will be released on October 8, 2025, from One Press and SpectreVision, the latter of which is a production company co-founded by Noah, Elijah Wood, and Lawrence Inglee.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The B-2 bomber flying wing design was shaped by decades of engineering, not alien craft. Is it really just stealth science or something more? The B-2 bomber flying wing shape is not from a crashed UFO. As per reports it evolved from 1940s American aircraft designs like the Northrop XB-35 and YB-49. Instead, it's all wing this shape reduces drag and radar visibility. Engineers first experimented with it in the 1930s-40s, aiming for better fuel efficiency and stealth. Its crescent shape results from decades of research into reducing radar detection and improving flight. It uses advanced materials and computer modelling, but the shape's roots are purely terrestrial. Some believe the B-2 bomber design was copied from a UFO from the Roswell incident or that whistleblower Bob Lazar revealed secret files. As per reports these claims have no solid evidence and remain in the realm of conspiracy theories. This is just because both designs aim for the same things: invisibility to radar and efficient flight. While rumours suggest alien tech involvement, the reality is human-made advances after years of research and testing. Though some stories claim secret UFO files influenced the B-2 bomber, official records show it was human engineering.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Confirmed by the scientific community—an extraterrestrial mineral found in a meteorite breaks known laws by expanding in an unusual way when heated There is something that has the entire scientific community on edge because there is absolutely nothing like it on Earth. It is called silica tridymite, a very rare form of silicon dioxide that has nothing similar on our planet, and the most curious thing about this element is that it has the ability to maintain a constant thermal conductivity!! And now they believe new ways of working with this material could open up in industries where high temperatures are needed (such as steel production). This mineral cannot be classified as crystal or as glass, it is something that intrigues the entire community, what is it?! But now it could help reduce carbon emissions on Earth, and seeing how fast the greenhouse effect is advancing, maybe it is our last bullet, don't you think? Tridymite was found in a meteorite and, surprisingly, it has also been detected on Mars (everything takes us to Mars, why is that!!). What most puzzles experts is that it breaks the normal rules of heat conduction. While crystals tend to lose thermal conductivity when heated and glasses tend to increase it, this material maintains a constant level, and that is what makes it the perfect candidate for other applications, and the metallurgical industry is already thinking about how to include it! That is, it does not fit entirely into any category, and that is exactly what gives it such peculiar properties. The most interesting thing is that, unintentionally, a piece of rock that fell from the sky centuries ago could help us build a more sustainable future on Earth. And although there is still much to investigate, this shows that looking at the universe not only serves to understand what is out there, but also to improve what we have here inside. Mars, get ready because soon we are coming for more!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elizabeth Klarer wtih a bust of her intergalactic lover, Akon. As scientists try to make sense of 3I/Atlas - the mysterious object hurtling towards Earth - it's unleashed fears of an alien invasion and brought back to the surface numerous supposed alien abduction cases that have never been disproved. Closer to home, Elizabeth Klarer of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands even wrote a book about her intergalactic romance with a starship commander who got her pregnant in 1959. These two alien abduction stories are among dozens that have resurfaced as people ponder whether there could be any truth behind their extraordinary experiences, now that 3I/Atlas - bigger than Mount Everest - hurtles toward Earth in a way scientists describe as "not natural". This image from NASA shows the fast-moving interstellar object that has got many to wonder about alien encounters that have been reported over the years. It was first picked up by a telescope in Chile and then photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope a few weeks ago. Professor Avi Loeb of Harvard University thinks the visitor is unlikely to be a natural object and believes governments around the world should formulate a treaty so they know how to handle a possible hostile alien invasion. For her, it was all about peace, love and understanding - things she tried to convey from her lover from the planet Meton in the Alpha Centauri System, according to earlier reports by "Independent Media". Klarer, who was a meteorologist, claimed to have had the most intimate encounter with extraterrestrials, writing in her book "Beyond the Light Barrier", published in 1980, that she bore a son with her alien lover, Akon. This time, Akon took her aboard his scout ship, a craft some 18 m in diameter, before transporting her to the cigar-shaped mother ship. He also claimed that several Venusians were living among us. In 1959, Klarer claimed she visited Meton with Akon, orbiting Proxima Centauri, where she gave birth to their son, Ayling, before returning to Earth because the planet's vibrations played havoc with her heart. Klarer's main thrust throughout her life, and in the pages of her book, she strived to convey a message of peace, love, understanding and environmentalism, which she credited to the superior wisdom of an advanced and immaculately utopian Venusian civilisation. Klarer often commemorated the April 7 anniversary of her union with Akon by returning to Flying Saucer Hill, sometimes aided by others as she grew frail. When this reporter covered Klarer's funeral in Pietermaritzburg in February 1994, her sisters expressed profound loss, but were also at peace now that her battle against scepticism had come to an end. Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted by aliens in 1961 while returning home from a visit to Niagara Falls. They were on their way home from a trip to Niagara Falls when they saw a string of bright lights in the sky. The couple claimed that they were rendered unconscious by a group of humanoids who approached them when Barney got out of the family car, armed with his pistol, soon after a craft, measuring 12 meters across, blocked their path. What they did recall was waking up not far from the car. After the troubling incident, Betty drew a star map which closely resembles actual star placements which were only discovered by astronomers a decade later, indicating that their alleged abductors had come from Zeta Reticuli. Media coverage turned the Hills into celebrities, spawning a 1975 made-for-television film starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons. Betty's subsequent dreams showed a strong correlation with details Barney shared under hypnosis. However, in both cases, there was never enough evidence to conclusively prove their abduction story, nor to disprove it as a mere fiction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The telescope, high in the Atacama Desert, is tasked with searching for objects that might collide with Earth. So at 1.15am local time on July 1, the discovery was announced. “Observers around the world quickly gathered their telescopes,” Veres said. Soon, astronomers concluded that the object had come from interstellar space, that it would not come within 170 million miles of Earth and that it was, in all likelihood, a sort of cosmic iceberg billions of years old, ejected from the frosty outer limits of another star system and now zipping along at 118,000 miles an hour, the fastest object ever sighted in our solar system. But there was also another theory that was soon being advanced by the Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb: that this object could be an alien probe, sent on a reconnaissance mission through our solar system on a course that kept it, deliberately, out of reach of our fastest rockets. It has been named 3I/Atlas, the 3I standing for “3 Interstellar”. Loeb is recognised by fellow astronomers for his work on the evolution of the first stars, but he gained a global following in 2018 when he and a colleague published a paper suggesting that Oumuamua was a solar sail created by an alien civilisation, floating like driftwood through interstellar space, or perhaps even an alien probe dispatched on a scouting mission to our solar system. On July 2, 24 hours after Harvard's Minor Planets Center announced the sighting of 3I/Atlas, Loeb woke at 2am to appear on a late-night radio show called Coast to Coast. After he got off air, “one of the listeners wrote to me and said: ‘There is a potential new object,'” he said. “There is no trail of dust,” he said. “The chance of it being on that plane is one in 500.” Its timing meant that it would come close to three planets: Jupiter, Mars and Venus. But he recently posted an essay on the Medium platform, asking what humanity should do “if the new interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a spacecraft, guided to send mini-probes that will arrive at Earth and other planets in the coming months”. One of his followers is already trading against the stock market, believing it will crash if the probe theory proves true, he said. Markets would crash “because of the uncertainty”, he said, adding: “We might feel like the Iranian air-defence system, when the B2 bombers were flying overhead and we can't do anything about it.” Other astronomers think that the object is a comet: a fascinating thing to see but not proof, at last, that mankind is not alone in the universe. Loeb is “a super bright guy”, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He noted that Loeb had led Breakthrough Starshot, a project to send a probe to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri. “Then when Oumuamua came in, he asked the very reasonable question: if one of my probes went through Alpha Centauri, wouldn't it look just like this? Veres, of the Minor Planets Center, said that it was “interesting because of its shape and its odd motion”. It did not have the fuzzy halo of gas and dust that comets usually give off as they near the sun and heat up, and it seemed to accelerate in a manner that could not be accounted for “purely by gravity”, Veres said. “That led to some, I would say speculative ideas by Professor Loeb … that it's a solar sail or probe.” • Scientists challenge theory that mystery object was alien ship The second interstellar object to be spotted, Borisov, behaved more like a comet, Veres said. Its size is still hotly debated, though it is thought to be somewhere between 200 and 5,000 metres across, he said. “The previous two objects were on totally random angles,” he said. Once 30 or 100 have been tracked, it will be easier to see what is ordinary for an interstellar comet, he said. “Now it's like, [260 million] miles from the sun. “There is still no tail.” This, he said, was “fuel for those speculative ideas by Professor Loeb”. Veres thinks that the lack of a halo of gas and dust might be because it has developed a hard crust as it crossed interstellar space and was “baked”, though not in a warming sense, by cosmic rays. Perhaps as it nears the sun, this crust “will peel off and suddenly we'll see a lot of activity”. John Forbes, a computational astronomer at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, believes that 3I/Atlas does have a halo but that it is hard to see, because the comet is still travelling in our general direction. “The tail is pointing a little away from us,” he said. It has come from nearer the centre of the Milky Way, where there are stars formed billions of years before our sun. These older stars are composed of lighter elements, and have fewer metals in them, “because metals themselves are produced by stars evolving and exploding”, said Forbes. As stars form, a flat disc of dust and gas swirls around them and resolves into planets as well as lumps of ice and dust that get ejected into interstellar space. McDowell described 3I/Atlas as an interstellar iceberg with a composition unlike any ice on Earth, “wandering the galaxy for yonks” and now, as it nears us, “barrelling along in a cloud of its own steam”. Loeb thinks that whatever it is, its passage through our solar system represents a huge opportunity to get the general public excited about science. “That was when humans started to document their history.</p>
