                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Multiple fatalities and injuries, including children, were reported Friday after a tour bus with about 50 passengers headed back to New York City from Niagara Falls crashed into a ditch, state police said. The bus rolled over after losing control for “unknown reasons,” New York State Police spokesperson James O'Callaghan said at a news conference. Several people were entrapped and others were ejected from the bus, O'Callaghan said. Authorities are actively responding to the crash scene and “a lot” of rescues are still ongoing, noting some people who are entrapped may still be alive. Translators are also coming to assist police as most of the people on the tour bus were Indian, Chinese and Filipino, O'Callaghan said. A list of the passengers provided by the bus company confirms there were 52 people on board, including the driver, police said in a statement. The accident took place along Interstate 90 eastbound near the town of Pembroke, east of Buffalo, New York, a state police spokesperson said in a statement. The state Thruway is currently closed in both directions near the crash site, state police say. Helicopters, ambulances and law enforcement swarmed the crash site, where the bus was seen on its side with many people gathered around it. The state's department of transportation is trying to help people get off the interstate as some remain stranded due to the incident, O'Callaghan said. Victims are being taken to the Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York, O'Callaghan said. Kathy Hochul described the crash as “tragic” and said first responders are “working to rescue and provide assistance to everyone involved” in a post on X. This is a developing story and will be updated. CNN's Nic F. Anderson contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Our public health system is weaker than ever before,” said the union representing CDC workers. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Hundreds of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) employees are losing their jobs after a federal judge ruled on August 12 that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was barred from terminating employees at only six CDC divisions. The court's prior ruling had protected all CDC staff. Kennedy, who has long peddled health disinformation to the public, has made numerous false claims about vaccines, COVID-19, chronic diseases, and autism. Shortly after the layoffs were announced, Kennedy said that some people were mistakenly terminated, like the team that worked on preventing lead poisoning, and would be asked back. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the union representing more than 2,000 CDC workers, said in a statement on Wednesday that, “Due to a staggering lack of transparency from HHS, AFGE Local 2883 has not received formal notice of which groups are being separated today so we can't even determine the full extent of everything being lost.” The layoffs come after a gunman shot hundreds of rounds of bullets on the grounds of the CDC campus in Atlanta on August 8, killing DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose before he took his own life. After the shooting, more than 750 former and current HHS staffers demanded that Kennedy stop spreading lies about vaccines. “The attack came amid growing mistrust in public institutions, driven by politicized rhetoric that has turned public health professionals from trusted experts into targets of villainization — and now, violence,” they wrote in a letter to Kennedy and members of Congress. “As former scientists and public health professionals in CDC's Division of Violence Prevention, our mission was to prevent this exact kind of harm,” they wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Residents of steel communities say fence-line monitoring for dangerous air pollution must be mandatory. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. Steelworkers and community activists say the Trump administration has put their health at risk by delaying and potentially scrapping pollution monitoring rules meant to protect nearby neighborhoods from dangerous toxins released into the air by the nation's steel and coke plants. On August 11, a massive explosion at U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works in Clairton, Pennsylvania, left two workers dead and sent at least 10 others to the hospital. The cause of the explosion is still under investigation, but officials suspect a faulty valve and a fatal buildup of gas. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works is considered the largest coke-producing operation in North America. Workers at the plant bake coal in massive ovens into coke, a hard, grey, porous, carbon-rich substance that is shipped on the river for use in the blast furnaces of plants that make iron and then steel. The facility has a long history of clean air violations and accidents, including an explosion in February that injured two workers, according to the Associated Press. Along with postponing the hazardous are toxin rules, President Donald Trump also recently approved the nearly $15 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel by the Japanese company Nippon Steel, raising hopes that new ownership could bring investments in new, cleaner steel-making technology that could reduce pollution in communities such as Clairton while preserving jobs residents have depended on for generations. However, the recent explosion is raising questions about whether Nippon Steel is willing to spend the money necessary to retrofit U.S. Steel's aging infrastructure. Clairton Coke Works and other coke and steel facilities have a long record of violating the Clean Air Act, according to a report released this week by the Environmental Integrity Project. At Clairton Coke Works, the highest six-month average concentration of benzene detected by a series of air monitors at the facility's fence line was nearly 26 micrograms per cubic meter — about eight times higher than is considered safe for public health. In 2023, the 20 steel mills and coke operations investigated in the report released as much carbon dioxide as 10.1 million cars driving for a year, along with nearly 2.4 million pounds of benzene, chromium, and other hazardous pollutants. “These emissions are often the results of leaks in valves and other equipment and flaring … that are impossible to detect all of the time and often go underreported,” Duggan said at a press conference on August 21. “There is a significant difference between reported and actual emissions that communities downwind are breathing in.” In 2024, the EPA under the Biden administration finalized regulations requiring coke facilities to install air monitors at the fence line to test for benzene blowing in the wind, and requiring steel mills to monitor for chromium, a toxic heavy metal linked to an array of health problems. Qiyam Ansari, executive director of Valley Clean Air Now in Pennsylvania, said people living in Clairton and the heavily industrialized Mon Valley already live with some of the worst air quality in the nation. “It is absolutely having an effect on people, and that's why the fence-line monitoring is a bare minimum, so it will at least tell us what is out there and what we are suffering from and how to take precautions,” Ansari told Truthout. Mandatory fence-line monitoring would also help environmental justice groups hold the industry and regulators accountable when aging facilities such as Clairton Coke Works consistently have problems. However, beyond rolling back environmental protections, the Trump administration is also slashing funding for government agencies that oversee polluting industries, including the EPA and U.S. Chemical Safety Board. “Our elders deserve to breathe without fear that every day it shortens their lives,” Ansari said. Duggan said similar requirements were successful in reducing toxic emissions from oil refineries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soldiers who had returned from Russia were honoured with a concert and relatives of troops killed in action were among those to attend a banquet Kim Jong-un has hailed North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia in the war in Ukraine as “heroes”, at a ceremony to honour soldiers who recently returned from the conflict, state media said on Friday. The North Korean leader said in a speech this week that his troops had displayed “fighting spirit of the heroes” during their operation to retake Russia's Kursk region from Ukrainian forces – which had established a foothold there last year – the state news agency KCNA said. Kim met officers of the army's overseas operation and paid tribute to North Korean soldiers killed in Ukraine. He said they had been assigned to carry out the “most important duty” and voiced “warm militant encouragement” to the commanders and troops, KCNA said. In a letter to Kim to mark the anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule in August 1945, Putin described North Korean troops as “heroic” and recalled how Soviet units and North Korean forces had also fought together to end Japan's occupation of the Korean peninsula. Russia and North Korea forged increasingly close military and diplomatic ties, triggering international concern that the North's troops are acquiring valuable combat experience that could one day be used against the country's neighbour, South Korea. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defence pact last year, and in April this year, North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had deployed a contingent of soldiers to the frontline in Ukraine to fight alongside Russian troops. Pyongyang sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia's Kursk region in 2024, according to South Korean and western intelligence agencies, along with artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket systems. This week's official tributes appeared to be intended to “justify the deployment and boost morale”, the South's Yonhap news agency quoted a unification ministry official as saying.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian President Zelensky is pushing a massive deal for U.S. weapons funded by Europe in what observers call a bid to buy the flighty U.S. President Donald Trump's dedication. Zelensky wants Europe to pay the U.S. $90 billion for weapons to Ukraine, "that we don't have ourselves: above all, planes and air defense, etc. for now," as he said in a briefing after the meeting earlier this week. There are specific pieces of American military kit that have no European analogs at the moment. The proposed deal's main purpose is "to entice Trump into political commitment," said John Foreman, a former defense attaché for the U.K. who served in both Moscow and Kyiv. "Now, fortunately or unfortunately, America still provides those more exquisite capabilities: fast jets — despite capacity issues — missiles, air defenses, sensors, radars, highly protected armored vehicles, those sort of things,” Foreman told the Kyiv Independent. Trump has gone back and forth in public rhetoric regarding Ukraine. His administration has periodically frozen weapons deliveries that had already been approved. Just in the past week of negotiations, he has floated and retracted the prospect of giving Russia more Ukrainian territory. "How can anybody possibly do diplomacy when the leader of the free world is changing his mind every time he gets out of bed?" "I'm sure if you got all those leaders and met them privately and they could say what they actually think, they would say 'we can't trust the Americans and we need to build our own autonomous defense capability,'" Ash told the Kyiv Independent. Massive arms deals are among Trump's favorite tools of foreign policy. Beyond political concerns, the top item on Ukraine's wishlist is Patriot air defense systems, said Fabian Hoffmann, a missile specialist at the Oslo Nuclear Program. "As a European, I'd rather keep that money in Europe, but there are just some products that are really difficult to get elsewhere," Hoffmann told the Kyiv Independent. "Patriot batteries and interceptors are probably the number-one product that they're looking to buy because that's just something where the SAMP/T is falling short and there's not really an alternative." Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted a massive glut in weapons buying. That has left the world's arms producers on backorder. "The waiting time for a newly produced Patriot Missile right now is something like 4-5 years,” said Hoffmann. Zelensky's newly proposed drone deal is an expanded version of an earlier "mega deal" to sell Ukrainian drones to the U.S. "It will bring engineering design to a level even higher than programming solutions from the IT sphere," Vitaliy Zaytsev, an aerospace engineer who runs unmanned aerial vehicle programs at three of Ukraine's top universities, told the Kyiv Independent. "It will make the country different, making us exporters of technology and not just raw materials." Despite EU leaders rallying around Zelensky at this White House appearance, none have publicly signed on to funding the prospective new weapons deals. "The question is whether Europe and Ukraine can trust the Americans to honor defense supply agreements when Trump has proved not particularly reliable." Based in Kyiv, he covers weapons production and defense tech. Originally from western Michigan, he speaks Russian and Ukrainian. His work has appeared in Radio Free Europe, Fortune, Breaking Defense, the Cipher Brief, the Foreign Policy Research Institute, FT's Sifted, and Science Magazine.</p>

After a childhood of never seeing anyone like me or my family in pop culture, I made up for lost time by becoming a boy-band fan in my 40s, falling for BTS, the reigning kings of K-pop.

Making matters worse, U.S. president Donald Trump has threatened tariffs on our $9.58-billion TV and film industry. This would be ruinous for the Canadian sector. About half the value of our industry is dependent on Hollywood productions coming here to film with our crews and locations. The implementation of the new Act presents opportunities, including improving how government money flows to our entertainment industries, but TV and film are hanging by a thread as the government bickers with streamers. The nineties was our last truly analog era, and since then, South Korea has learned that while government funding needs to be a part of the equation, the focus is on building infrastructure and a strong private sector, including boosting new technology, rather than providing support on a project-by-project basis for content. I'm also, frankly, jealous of how Koreans aren't afraid to be Korean. Maybe the whole “elbows up” vibe can be more than a passing moment of raised ire. Are we ready to be seen for who we are in our own entertainment, songs and stories, and sell it to the world? Canada and South Korea are comparable by several measures. As for differences, language is the most obvious one. Unlike English, Korean is the official language of no other place on Earth. You would think this would be an obstacle for exporting culture, but according to Canadian TV executive Michael MacMillan, CEO of Blue Ant Media, it's actually an advantage. Making Korean content for a Korean audience that reflects their own lives was South Korea's first step in a formula for global success. You need a surplus of domestic product in order to export. After building infrastructure for their cultural industries over decades, South Korea has grown a deep, competitive domestic pool of talent and saleable content. It's especially tough now because Canadian broadcasters are buying fewer programs, especially in the English-language market, having overspent on Canadian programming in an overcorrection after the pandemic. Two Hollywood strikes had an impact, with Canadian crews waiting for work that never arrived. The net of it is a Canadian TV and film industry that shrank by 18.5 per cent from April, 2023 to March, 2024. Responsive policies have allowed their industries to flourish – and Netflix took notice. Fans take photos of Young-hee, a giant animatronic doll and “Squid Game” fixture, in Seoul. Squid Game is Netflix's most-watched show of all time.JUN MICHAEL PARK/The New York Times News Service Serving local audiences is a strategy that suits South Korea well, as they are highly invested in learning about their own history and culture. Shin Dong Kim, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University, says that a Korean obsession with education has refined their taste. Education was the last resort of social mobility,” says Prof. Kim. As I did, I learned more and more about Koreans at work, on dates and at home with their families. In Canada, instead of reflecting our own culture back to us, about half of our TV and film industry caters to American productions. American producers love our cheaper dollar, tax credit incentives and world-class crews. For us, the arrangement has been out of necessity. Americans money has kept our production industry competitive and alive. But while our audience may be tiny compared with the U.S., compared with South Korea, whose population is 51 million, 40 million Canadians isn't so small, especially not in a market that has been made global by streamers and YouTube. North of North is a Canadian-made success story: It became a global Top 10 hit for Netflix, part of their local-to-global hitmaker pipeline.jasper savage/CBC/APTN/Netflix Canada has already shown in small ways that it can be like Korea when it comes to selling its unique culture. Inuit make up 0.2 per cent of the Canadian population, but geographically-based audiences matter less in a streamer world looking for great shows with universal themes (in this case, motherhood and community). In the past, our mode was to sell shows by hiding that they're Canadian. This, about a show starring some of our biggest household names and produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Film and TV productions, for example, earn points by employing Canadian citizens in key positions and paying at least 75 per cent of costs to Canadian companies, among other criteria. Ticking enough boxes doesn't necessarily get you the money, it just puts you in the running for a panel to decide. The promise of tax credits from the Canadian Audio-Visual Certification Office (CAVCO) will form another piece of that budget spreadsheet, with yet another checklist. In the past, Canada's mode was to sell shows by hiding that they're Canadian. Cancon rules aren't just about funding; they dictate quotas for Canadian broadcasters. Songs score points when music, lyrics and recording are entirely done by Canadian citizens – and then performed principally by a Canadian. “This seemed to be the opportunity to say we are doing something new here,” says Patrick Rogers of Music Canada, which represents major music labels in Canada. One of the first actions the CRTC took under the Act, in 2024, was to require global streamers to pay a 5-per-cent levy to operate in Canada, with revenues being used to support the Canadian broadcasting system, including local news on radio and television, French-language content, Indigenous content and content by and for equity-deserving communities. Netflix stopped funding talent-generating incubators for Canadian creatives. South Korea's cultural industries are supported by government, too, but they do it differently. The South Korean government, with a few exceptions, puts the money into infrastructure and sector support rather than funneling it into specific projects. When I ask Yoori Kwon, a Seoul-based TV executive, how much government money goes into the dozens of TV shows her studio produces per year, she seems puzzled. Besides infrastructure, Kim says the South Korean government supports cultural industries by encouraging private investment. For example, the K-Content Strategic Fund – announced last year and worth $400-million – is a pool of investments by private companies, including studios and banks, backed by the government. In this way, the South Korean government leverages capital markets to fuel their ambitious global export plans, merging private and public dollars to do it. This content fund is about growing money as much as it is about funneling it back into their industries, building in financial sustainability. Clive Kenny, a British economist who has studied K-culture industries, says that private sector business acumen has been integral to the growth of hallyu. “Korea had the chaebols, these family-run conglomerates, who were able to bring their expertise from producing appliances and cars into the entertainment sector.” An early example is CJ Group, a South Korean food company, which became a founding investor in Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks SKG in the 1990s. Besides holding a stake, they got distribution rights for Asian countries – but the whole point was to get into the biz. “It's very risky to produce high-end content,” Kenny says. Government incentives, like grants, are designed to mitigate some of the risk. Kenny says the South Korean government provides incentives but they're not big relative to other markets like Europe, U.S. or Canada. “The structure of the way we do things in Canada is really broken,” says Jennifer Podemski, co-creator and showrunner of mini-series drama Little Bird (above).CRAVE/Supplied He says government incentives done well can create a virtuous circle, encouraging many players to invest in the local ecosystem, as South Korea has done. Incentives done poorly, however, can go sideways, creating inefficient obstacle courses, a drain of time and effort. It's also counterproductive, Kenny says, when you have a small group of judges applying their points of view to assess what's worth funding. That's when a process, meant to be an incentive, actually adds risk to the business, by making it more subjective. Kenny may as well be describing the Canadian grant system. Without jumping through hoops to scrape together budgets, no Canadian producer can pay a crew to arrive on-set, and no Canadian audience gets a show like Sort Of, Kim's Convenience, Letterkenny or Little Bird, last year's biggest winner at the Canadian Screen Awards. “The structure of the way we do things in Canada is really broken,” says Jennifer Podemski, co-creator and showrunner of Little Bird, a drama about the 1960s scoop that was a partnership between APTN and Crave. Working with low budgets, and wearing many hats, requires a very entrepreneurial frame of mind, Podemski says. Her production company has a small core team and, until five years ago, she ran it without a physical office space. Another driver of South Korea's success is their intense work culture. You can clearly see it in K-pop, which has endured plenty of scrutiny from fans and detractors for its hard-driving trainee system. “There's a thing we could call the success theory of K-pop,” says Son Sungdeuk, Executive Creator at Hybe America. K-pop groups are assembled by record labels through a long process of training and tryouts. Son began working with BTS as a choreographer during their audition phase, long before they amassed 80 million subscribers on YouTube. They were still a ragtag group of students, assembled by a scrappy, no-profile company called Big Hit, now one of several labels under Hybe. South Korea's K-pop trainee system is intense, taking years of training and tryouts. The bandmates lived in a dorm, training daily for years, posting dance practice videos and livestreams (which they still diligently do) before debuting in 2013. After the show, the team headed home to Seoul while Son stayed in California, where he is working to build Hybe's U.S. endeavour. Son's contributions to the K-pop trainee system are on display in Netflix's Pop Star Academy, a documentary series on the making of a K-pop group over a year of training and tryouts. There was no reference for what could be done.” This method is not a blueprint for what the Canadian system needs. The lesson, instead, is to double down on your culture's strengths. Joni Mitchell (pictured here in Toronto in 1966) is a top example of Canada's ability to produce acclaimed solo artists.Fred Ross/The Globe and Mail Our most famous exports are musicians with a strong point of view (think Drake, The Weeknd, Mustafa, Feist, Nelly Furtado, and, going back in time, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Leonard Cohen and Gordon Lightfoot). Perhaps storytelling is what's in our cultural DNA. Without quotas for streamers yet in place, Canadians choose Canadian music 10 per cent of the time, which is substantial given they are competing with every song of all time and around the world. “Canadian music is made by Canadians and it's designed to be shared with the world,” Rogers says. “Some of the top songs in India are made by Canadians. We're net benefiters of this global phenomenon in so many ways.” Sharing a perspective is exactly what content creators do – and according to YouTube, Canadian creators on that platform see 90 per cent of their watch time come from outside Canada. It's an eye-popping ratio that shows Canadians are already exporting our pop culture to the world. During the pandemic, in an attempt to understand the creator economy, the Canadian government ran a survey that found that content creators have low and volatile incomes, prone to fluctuation and reliant on supplementation from live performances and physical sales. It would future-proof our cultural economy if we could provide more stability for creators through accessible infrastructure (studios, gear, mentorship, business administration education and fair artist management, for example). In 2023, the YouTube creator economy generated over $1.82-billion to Canada's GDP. The company began with two friends making travel videos for tourism boards. When the pandemic shut down travel, they spent time levelling up on virtual production technology and started their business. “Because we're based in Manitoba, we can't compete at the same level of people in markets like Los Angeles, Vancouver, New York. We decided to Hail Mary it and start a YouTube channel,” says Reid Valmestad, CoPilot's director of business development and operations. An enthusiastic South Korean client of theirs is LG (yes, the brand best known for making your washer and dryer), who are also in the business of content. CoPilot have benefited from several initiatives of the Canadian government, including a trade mission to South Korea and business mentorship through a matching program. This type of support sounds practically South Korean, building the muscle of innovation for a Canadian company while also building infrastructure. In Canada, that means true expressions of our diversity – not as a catchphrase or checklist, but in a way that supports every musician, writer, director, content creator to have as strong and richly unique of a voice as they can. Canada's diversity is an obvious advantage that still remains largely untapped by gatekeepers. It's occurring to the powers-that-be too slowly, if at all, that diversity and diaspora connect us directly with audiences around the world. Keep boosting the signal on music with singular, iconoclastic points of view. Undoubtedly, Canada is set up incredibly well there. In a more perfect world, the CRTC wouldn't seem like it's surprised by cord-cutting media habits that are at least a decade old. Folks in government media regulation would be well-versed in TikTok and Spotify and YouTube, so they can inherently understand what the rest of us are doing. It's easy to look with envy and oversimplify problems they're working through themselves. But they did a few key things right, by making bold investments, encouraging private sector business acumen, changing restrictive policies and funneling money into infrastructure. They're also laser-focused on figuring out the future of intellectual property. We can do all of this, too, if there is the political will. We need government support with a light touch, more trade mission-type connections and incentives that are straightforward, not obstacle courses. It's an investment that will pay itself back many times over. “Once a fandom is formed, it doesn't easily go away,” says Prof. Kim. He's talking about K-pop (and Elvis and Star Wars) but he could very well be talking about our national identity, too. Check your horoscope to learn how the stars align for you today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A transgender woman has been found guilty of sexually assaulting a male partner by failing to disclose her gender status to him, meaning he could not consent to the sexual activity, British prosecutors said on Friday. Ciara Watkin, 21, performed sex acts on the man, also 21, who she had met on social media site Snapchat in June 2022, but did not disclose her transgender status to him. The Crown Prosecution Service said Watkin had told the man that she was on her period and meaning he could not touch her below the waist. A few days later the pair met again, after which Watkin blocked all contact with the man until she eventually got back in touch and told him during an exchange of text messages that she was transgender and had male genitalia, the CPS said. “It is clear from the evidence in this case that, prior to engaging in sexual activity with the victim, Watkin had made no attempt to inform him of her transgender status,” said Senior Crown Prosecutor Sarah Nelson. “The victim has made clear in police interview that he would not have engaged in sexual activity had he known that Watkin was transgender and, consequently, these events have had a significant impact on his mental wellbeing.” Watkin, from Stockton-on-Tees in northeast England, had admitted lying but her lawyers told her trial that it would have been “blindingly obvious” to the man that she was not biologically female, the BBC said. She was convicted of two charges of sexual assault and one charge of assault by penetration following a trial at Teesside Crown Court and will be sentenced on October 10. © 2025 Cable News Network.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We are getting some news lines from Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, via Reuters, quoting a report from the Russian news agency Ria. He is quoted as saying that no meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is planned, but insisting that the Russian president remains ready to meet when there's a ready agenda for their meeting. Speaking to NBC TV's “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” programme, Lavrov also said Russia had agreed to be flexible on a number of points raised by US president Donald Trump, Reuters reported. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said there were no plans for Vladimir Putin to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the agenda for the meeting was “not ready at all.” “There is no meeting planned,” he said (13:40). Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said there were active discussions “at many levels” to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, as he insisted that they would offer greater protection than in previous, failed agreements in Minsk and Budapest (14:20, 14:23). Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that guarantees should be structured in a similar way to Nato's core principle in Article 5 that an attack on one member is an attack on all (14:09). Hungary and Slovakia urged the European Commission to guarantee security of supplies after they said that oil deliveries through the Druzbha pipeline could be suspended for at least five days following a Ukrainian attack on a linked facility in Russia (10:26). This hot and dry year has already emerged as the EU's worst on record for wildfires – and there's still one month of the fire season left to go (16:05). If you have any tips, comments or suggestions, email me at jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. In other news, this hot and dry year has already emerged as the EU's worst on record for wildfires – and there's still one month of the fire season left to go. New data from the European Forest Fire Information System (Effis) shows 1,015,024 hectares have burned so far this year, breaking the previous full-year record of 988,544 hectares that was set in 2017. Meanwhile, a Russian state-backed messenger application called Max, a rival to WhatsApp that critics say could be used to track users, must be pre-installed on all mobile phones and tablets bought in the country starting next month, the Russian government said on Thursday. The Kremlin said in a statement that Max, which will be integrated with government services, would be on a list of mandatory pre-installed apps on all “gadgets”, including mobile phones and tablets, sold in Russia from 1 September. The firm behind Max said this week that 18 million users had downloaded its app, parts of which are still in a testing phase. State media says accusations from Kremlin critics that Max is a spying app are false and that it has fewer permissions to access user data than rivals WhatsApp and Telegram. “Russia has stepped up drone and missile attacks on Ukraine in recent days as a US-led mediation effort to end the three-and-a-half-year war has appeared to falter.” Rutte was also asked about whether these new security guarantees would include any troops on the ground in Ukraine. Clearly we want, do not want, to repeat of the Budapest Memorandum or the Minsk agreement, these security guarantees should be holding.” “Robust security guarantees will be essential, and this is what we are now working to define, so that when the time comes you for you to enter that bilateral meeting, you have the unmistakable force of Ukraine's friends behind you, ensuring that Russia will uphold any deal, and will never ever again, attempt to take one square kilometre of Ukraine.” Rutte insisted that Europe's and the US's active role will make them different this time. “The Budapest Memorandum and Minsk did not provide those security guarantees. So we clearly know what it should not be, and we are now working together – Ukraine, the Europeans, the United States – to make sure that the security guarantees are of such a level that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, sitting in Moscow, will never, ever try to attack Ukraine again.” We are just getting some lines from his joint appearance at a press briefing with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy said the pair discussed possible security guarantees for Ukraine, insisting they should be structured in a similar way to Nato's core principle in Article 5 that an attack on one member is an attack on all. We are getting some news lines from Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, via Reuters, quoting a report from the Russian news agency Ria. He is quoted as saying that no meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy is planned, but insisting that the Russian president remains ready to meet when there's a ready agenda for their meeting. Speaking to NBC TV's “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” programme, Lavrov also said Russia had agreed to be flexible on a number of points raised by US president Donald Trump, Reuters reported. A bilateral meeting between President Zelenskyy and Putin is viewed as unlikely and Ukrainians are sure that Putin will do everything possible to avoid one. But, if we try to imagine how a bilateral meeting might go, logically an easy issue should be dealt with first – a minor question on which agreement could be achieved, paving the way for more difficult topics. But today, between Ukraine and Russia there are no easy issues. All other points for discussion are extremely difficult; for example, a mutual ceasefire or a mutual cessation of shelling with missiles and drones, or the status of captured territories and territories that Russia is still planning to capture. A three-person meeting with President Trump as a moderator could be more productive, but surely Trump will only agree to this if he is confident that at least something will be achieved. Otherwise, again, as after the Alaska meeting, his reputation will take a beating. Kim Jong-un has hailed North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia in the war in Ukraine as “heroes”, at a ceremony to honour soldiers who recently returned from the conflict, state media said on Friday. The North Korean leader said in a speech this week that his troops had displayed “fighting spirit of the heroes” during their operation to retake Russia's Kursk region from Ukrainian forces – which had established a foothold there last year – the state news agency KCNA said. Kim met officers of the army's overseas operation and paid tribute to North Korean soldiers killed in Ukraine. He said they had been assigned to carry out the “most important duty” and voiced “warm militant encouragement” to the commanders and troops, KCNA said. Pyongyang sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia's Kursk region in 2024, according to South Korean and western intelligence agencies, along with artillery shells, missiles and long-range rocket systems. About 600 North Korean troops have been killed out of a total deployment of 15,000, South Korean lawmakers said in April, citing the South's intelligence agency. As a consequence of the latest missile attack, deliveries seem to be suspended for at least five days. Let's see if we get a response from Ukraine this morning. French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk will visit Moldova next week to celebrate Moldova's independence day, the French president's office said on Friday. “The leaders will reaffirm their full support for Moldova's security, sovereignty and European path,” the Élysée Palace said in a statement, reported by Reuters. Moldovan officials have repeatedly accused Russia of meddling in its domestic politics by stoking pro-Moscow sentiment in an effort to topple the government as it aims to strengthen ties with the West, claims Russia denies, Reuters said. Elsewhere, Hungary and Slovakia urged the European Commission to guarantee security of supplies after they said that oil deliveries through the Druzbha pipeline could be suspended for at least five days following a Ukrainian attack on a linked facility in Russia, Reuters reported. “The physical and geographical reality is that without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries is simply not possible,” foreign ministers Péter Szijjártó and Juraj Blanár said in a joint letter. Earlier this week, Szijjártó publicly clashed on this issue with Ukraine's foreign minister Andrii Sybiha, who told him to “send your complaints – and threats – to your friends in Moscow” (Europe live on Tuesday). She asserted that “Russia does not want peace,” as she accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of not keeping any promises and “just laughing – not stopping the killing, but increase the killing, … the bombings on Ukraine.” “You see Europeans, Ukrainians, Americans wanting peace, and doing all the diplomatic efforts to achieve that, whereas Russia is just dragging feet, it's clear that Russia does not want peace.” Kallas also argued that Putin got “what he wanted” from the Alaska summit with Trump, getting not just the picture with the US president, but “so much more, such a welcome in America, and … then he also wanted the sanctions not to be put in place, which he also achieved.” She also rejected speculations about Ukraine giving up parts of its territory, saying “this is exactly the trap that Russia wants us to walk into.” “[They want] the discussion [to be] all about what Ukraine should give up, what is the concessions that Ukraine is willing to do, whereas we are forgetting that Russia hasn't made one single concession. And also, what kind of negotiation concessions are the Russians making right now? Zelenskyy pointed to continuing Russian strikes on Ukraine, including on an American company's facilities in Mukachevo, and a growing number of alleged provocations against Nato countries, including Lithuania and Poland. “We expect our partners to respond in a principled manner. Pressure must be exerted on Russia to end the war. He was also quick to pick up on US president Donald Trump's suggestion of more offensive actions. Trump on Thursday appeared to vent his frustration at Russia's obstruction. In a post on Truth Social, the US president blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for not allowing Ukraine to “fight back” against Russia. “It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invaders country. Crooked and grossly incompetent Joe Biden would not let Ukraine FIGHT BACK, only DEFEND. Of course, we will continue doing everything to protect our country and people. President Trump is absolutely right—this must be done not only in defense. Meanwhile, we do not slow down in diplomacy, so that negotiations to bring peace closer can finally take place.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte arrived in Kyiv for a surprise visit on Aug. 22 and met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukrainian Presidential Office Head Andriy Yermak said. Rutte's visit comes days after a high-level meeting in Washington between Zelensky, U.S. President Donald Trump, and European partners aimed at securing security guarantees for Ukraine. "We are now working together — Ukraine, the Europeans, the United States — to make sure that these security guarantees are of such a level that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin sitting in Moscow will never try to attack Ukraine again," Rutte said at a press conference. Bloomberg reported on Aug. 19 that the package of security guarantees for Ukraine might be finalized this week. European officials have reportedly discussed sending British and French troops to Ukraine, along with contingents from roughly 10 other countries. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Aug. 18 that guarantees would not involve NATO membership but instead rely on a strong Ukrainian army backed by commitments from the Coalition of the Willing, which includes over 30 countries. Trump told Fox News on Aug. 19 that Washington could provide air support as part of the guarantees but ruled out deploying U.S. ground troops. Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that security guarantees for Ukraine can't be discussed without Russia's participation. These are guarantees of security against an aggressor," Zelensky said at a press conference in response to Lavrov's remarks. "When Russia raises the issue of security guarantees, to be honest, I don't know who exactly is threatening them. Kateryna Denisova works as a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a news editor at the NV media outlet for four years, covering mainly Ukrainian and international politics. Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany. Ukrainian anti-aircraft gunners shot down a Russian Orlan drone carrying two first-person-view (FPV) drones under its wings, the 118th Separate Mechanized Brigade reported. The Kyiv Independent's Kate Tsurkan sits down with Oscar-winning director of "20 Days in Mariupol," Mstyslav Chernov, to discuss his new documentary, "2000 Meters to Andriivka" and why he strives to tell universal stories of resilience, bravery and hope against the backdrop of Russia's war on Ukraine. Tell Slovakia you are my great friend," Trump wrote in response to a complaint about the strikes from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. "We are now working together — Ukraine, the Europeans, the United States — to make sure that these security guarantees are of such a level that Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin sitting in Moscow will never try to attack Ukraine again," NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said. "Unlike Russia, Belarus is less restricted by sanctions in the military-technical sphere and could become a channel for restoring Iran's defense capabilities," Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service reported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The wide-scale operation in Gaza City could start within days.Abdel Kareem Hana/The Associated Press Israel's defence minister warned Friday that Gaza's largest city could be destroyed unless Hamas yields to his country's terms, as the world's leading authority on food crises declared that the city is gripped by famine from fighting and an Israeli blockade. A day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would authorize the military to mount a major operation to seize Gaza City, Defence Minister Israel Katz warned that it could “turn into Rafah and Beit Hanoun,” areas largely reduced to rubble earlier in the war. He restated Israel's ceasefire demands: the release of all hostages and Hamas' complete disarmament. Hamas has said it would release captives in exchange for ending the war, but rejects disarmament without the creation of a Palestinian state. Famine grips Gaza City, driven by war and aid restrictions, food crises authority says Netanyahu on Thursday said he had instructed officials “to begin immediate negotiations” to release hostages and end the war on Israel's terms. Israeli leaders have resisted such terms since abandoning a similar agreement earlier this year under pressure from Netanyahu's far-right coalition allies. Many Israelis fear an assault could doom the roughly 20 hostages who have survived captivity since Hamas-led militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack. Aid groups and international leaders warn it would worsen Gaza's humanitarian crisis. Displaced Palestinians travel on a cart loaded with belongings as they flee amid an Israeli military operation in Gaza City.Mahmoud Issa/Reuters The logistics of evacuating civilians are expected to be daunting. “These two things – defeating Hamas and releasing all our hostages – go hand in hand,” Netanyahu said Thursday while touring a command centre near in southern Israel. Israel has only managed to rescue eight hostages alive and retrieved the bodies of 49 others. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza, about 20 of whom Israel believes to be alive. The world's leading authority on food crises declared Friday that Gaza City is gripped by famine that is likely to spread if fighting and restrictions on humanitarian aid continue. A report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification says nearly half a million people in Gaza, about one-fourth of the population, face catastrophic hunger that leaves many at risk of dying. Netanyahu's office denounced the IPC report as “an outright lie.” Israel says it has allowed enough aid to enter during the war, and it eased its blockade in recent weeks after images of emaciated children sparked international outrage. But U.N. agencies say it's not nearly enough, especially after Israel imposed a complete ban on food imports from early March to mid-May. Gaza City's Shifa Hospital said at least 17 Palestinians were killed Friday as Israel escalates its activity in the area in the lead-up to its broader planned offensive. It killed at least seven people, according to an eyewitness and hospital records. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said famine is occurring in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. Amal Aboul Aas, who is now sheltering in Gaza City after being displaced four times, said the explosions were so intense he couldn't sleep, yet she couldn't leave either. Eventually one of these missiles will hit me,” she told The Associated Press. Another two people have died from malnutrition-related causes, bringing the total number of such deaths to 271, including 112 children, the Health Ministry said. It does not say whether those killed by Israeli fire are civilians or combatants, but it says around half were women and children. Hamas-led militants started the war when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking hostages. Also on Friday, foreign ministers from European countries, Australia and Britain on Friday jointly condemned Israel's plans to construct a settlement east of Jerusalem, calling it a breach of international law. It was announced last week by far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and received the final go-ahead from a Defence Ministry planning commission on Wednesday. “We condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms,” said ministers from Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. At no point in history has there ever been a Palestinian state, and any attempt to argue otherwise has no legal, factual, or historical basis,” Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hungary and Slovakia are calling on the European Commission (EC) to force Ukraine to stop attacks on the Druzhba oil pipeline, which carries oil from Russia to Europe, according to a letter from foreign ministers of the two countries, Peter Szijjarto and Juraj Blanar, to Brussels in connection with another attack by the Ukrainian army on the infrastructure of the oil pipeline on Russian territory. "Without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries [with oil] is simply not possible," the ministers said. Oil supplies to Hungary and Slovakia from Russia may be suspended for at least five days as a result of a new attack by the Ukrainian army on the Druzhba infrastructure that occurred on the night of August 22, they added. Szijjarto and Blanar called on the European Commission to guarantee security of supplies, Reuters reported after seeing the letter received in Brussels. Szijjarto said earlier on Friday that the Druzhba oil pipeline had been attacked again by the Ukrainian armed forces, after which oil supplies from Russia to Hungary were suspended. There were also reports from Slovakia about the halt in supplies of raw materials. Earlier this week, Ukraine launched drone strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline, causing damage that required repairs by Russian specialists. Oil supplies to Hungary were interrupted for two days. Szijjarto was in contact with Russia's First Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin on the issue. Hungary described Ukraine's actions as outrageous and unacceptable, making it clear that it could stop exporting electricity to that country.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Druzhba oil pipeline was attacked again by Ukrainian armed forces, suspending oil supplies from Russia to Hungary, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto reported. "Last night, we received news of a new attack on the Druzhba oil pipeline on the Russian-Belarusian border — the third in a short period of time. Oil supplies to Hungary have been suspended again," the top diplomat wrote on his Facebook (a social media site banned in Russia since it is owned by Meta corporation classified as extremist by the Russian authorities). "This is yet another attack on our country's energy security. It's another attempt to drag us into war. We will continue to support peaceful efforts and defend our national interests!" Earlier this week, Ukraine launched drone strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline, causing damage that required repairs by Russian specialists. Oil supplies to Hungary were interrupted for two days. Szijjarto was in contact with Russia's First Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin on this issue.

TALATAN, China (AP) — Chinese government officials last month showed off what they say will be the world's largest solar farm when completed high on a Tibetan plateau. China has been installing solar panels far faster than anywhere else in the world, and the investment is starting to pay off. A study released Thursday found that the country's carbon emissions edged down 1% in the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier, extending a trend that began in March 2024. The good news is China's carbon emissions may have peaked well ahead of a government target of doing so before 2030. But China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will need to bring them down much more sharply to play its part in slowing global climate change. For China to reach its declared goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, emissions would need to fall 3% on average over the next 35 years, said Lauri Myllyvirta, the Finland-based author of the study and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. China's emissions have fallen before during economic slowdowns. What's different this time is electricity demand is growing — up 3.7% in the first half of this year — but the increase in power from solar, wind and nuclear has easily outpaced that, according to Myllyvirta, who analyzes the most recent data in a study published on the U.K.-based Carbon Brief website. “We're talking really for the first time about a structural declining trend in China's emissions,” he said. Electricity from solar has overtaken hydropower in China and is poised to surpass wind this year to become the country's largest source of clean energy. Some 51 gigawatts of wind power was added from January to June. “This is a moment of global significance, offering a rare glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak climate landscape,” he wrote in an email response. It also shows that a country can cut emissions while still growing economically, he said. “There's still a long road ahead,” he said. White two-story buildings rise above them at regular intervals. Wang Anwei, the energy administration chief of Hainan Prefecture, called it a “win-win” situation on multiple levels. “In terms of production, enterprises generate electricity on the top level, and in terms of ecology, grass grows at the bottom under the solar panels, and villagers can herd sheep in between,” he said. Solar panels have been installed on about two-thirds of the land, with power already flowing from completed phases. When fully complete, the project will have more than 7 million panels and be capable of generating enough power for 5 million households. Like many of China's solar and wind farms, it was built in the relatively sparsely populated west. A major challenge is getting electricity to the population centers and factories in China's east. “The distribution of green energy resources is perfectly misaligned with the current industrial distribution of our country,” Zhang Jinming, the vice governor of Qinghai province, told journalists on a government-organized tour. Making full use of the power is hindered by the relatively inflexible way that China's electricity grid is managed, tailored to the steady output of coal plants rather than more variable and less predictable wind and solar, Myllyvirta said.
