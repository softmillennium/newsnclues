                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Gilpatrick and Jackie Appel discuss how the James Webb Telescope picked up a strange chemical on a distant world—one that only living things make. It's not just a hunch—there's hard data to back up the claim that we may not be alone in the universe after all, thanks to what's being beamed across space by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). One of the most mind-blowing recent scientific developments is the repeated detection of something called dimethyl sulfide (DMS) on a faraway exoplanet called K2-18b. In 2023, JWST's instruments picked up hints of DMS alongside methane and carbon dioxide. Then, earlier this year, JWST's follow-up observations provided updated evidence for DMS and/or its cousin, DMDS. When we reported on the finding, we literally said, “This Is Not a Drill,” because even though no one is using the “aliens” word just yet, this biosignature might be our first solid clue that something—something!—is alive on another world. Ever since that news broke, we haven't been able to stop thinking about what it could mean. John and Jackie discuss how Webb was able to detect such faint traces of gas across billions of miles, and why scientists are proceeding with cautious excitement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a string of fiery failures, SpaceX's biggest rocket faces another test flight with sky-high stakes for U.S. space ambitions The last three flights of Starship, a two-stage, 400-foot tall behemoth, ended in fiery disaster—what Musk has sometimes jokingly called a “rapid unplanned disassembly.” In January and again in March the launch vehicle's Super Heavy booster stage made it back to a massive, pincer-equipped gantry, but Starship's upper stage didn't. In May the booster exploded just before splashdown, and Starship broke up spectacularly in the atmosphere, raining debris that commercial aircraft had to dodge. As a bonus, in June the upper stage detonated on the launchpad while Starship was getting fueled for a test firing of its engines. The tally for 2025 thus far is: explosions, four; SpaceX, zero. Today Starship's Super Heavy booster and upper stage are on the launchpad yet again. The 10th test flight is scheduled for liftoff on Sunday, circa 7:30 P.M. EDT, from SpaceX's Starbase launch site in South Texas. Meanwhile Starship's upper stage should be firing its rockets to reach orbit, where it will deploy some cargo before flying itself back down through the atmosphere to its own splashdown about an hour and 15 minutes after launch.

It's, for sure, the biggest rocket that has attempted reuse,” says Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, who tracks space launches in his spare time. “Developing a vehicle this big and launching it repeatedly ain't easy.” And it represents the kind of gleaming, hardware-forward future that Silicon Valley's techno-optimists are always promising. Over the past few months, SpaceX has acknowledged which pieces of the ship broke with each flight but hasn't gone into any great detail about why. The company didn't return requests for comment from Scientific American. But SpaceX's very online rocket-spotting fans—and the half-dozen aerospace engineers I talked to—have been willing to speculate what the problems might be. Mostly, they believe the company has some brilliant people who stand every chance of solving them. But they also wonder what will happen if SpaceX can't figure out what's wrong—or, even worse, if some fundamental engineering issue means the idea of a reusable, reliable, workhorse spaceship stays confined to science fiction. A Starship Super Heavy booster returns to the launchpad during a test flight from SpaceX's Starbase facility in South Texas on January 16, 2025. On flight seven, there was a flash and then a fire in the unpressurized “attic” below the bottom of Starship's liquid oxygen tank. On flight eight, that happened near one of the rocket engines. On flight nine, fuel leaked into the nose cone. Going back and forth from supercold to hot is called thermal cycling; without careful design and maintenance, almost anything under those conditions will break. In a Muskian science-fiction future, that's all worth it. Cryogenic fuel is a pain in the asteroid, but it has more oomph per pound as go juice—what engineers call “specific impulse.” And fuels like methane offer the tantalizing possibility that they could be harvested “in situ” on another world—that they could be synthesized from carbon dioxide and frozen water in Martian regolith or, say, slurped up from the roiling methane seas of Titan. That makes “living off the land” in space seem feasible, even though nobody really knows how to do it yet. The fact that they've had leaks, the fact that they've had overheating, doesn't really surprise me,” McDowell says. “It's a different-sized molecule, bigger than liquid hydrogen but smaller than kerosene, so it leaks differently in different circumstances. But the cryogenic chemistry here might be less relevant than cold mathematics. That's why rockets often have stages or external boosters: when they run out of fuel, you drop those components so that the rockets will have less mass to lift. Musk's ambitious goal is for Starship to carry between 110 and 165 tons of payload to orbit—five times what a NASA space shuttle could handle, by way of comparison. But to make that work, the vehicle itself—the “dry mass,” without propellant, rocket engines and all the plumbing—has to be extraordinarily light. “Most typical rocket designs, that ratio is around 0.1,” says John Dec, an aerospace engineer at the Georgia Institute of Technology. In other words, Starship is on a pretty extreme weight-loss regime. Some observers and engineers speculate that diet might be the problem. After the failure on flight seven, SpaceX's official blog reported that the cause of the leaks and fire was a “harmonic response several times stronger than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system.” That is, some of Starship's hardware shook itself apart. For one thing, the atmosphere gets thicker as you get closer to a planet's surface. Vibrate all that complicated cryogenic plumbing too much, and very bad things happen. After flight eight, SpaceX insisted that the problems that Starship faced were completely different—but bloggers and Redditors passed around a purported leak from an insider saying that the root issue hadn't changed. Starship's two stages have to structurally support nearly 11 million pounds of fuel; the upper stage is meant to carry as much as 330,000 pounds of payload. So the vessel itself has to be as light as possible—yet still withstand the buffeting forces of launch and reentry. “They've designed their structure light enough to perform when the rocket ignites and wants to fly, but maybe—and this is speculation—when they're loading the fuel, that's causing cracking,” Dec says. If it's rigid and can't move, that's going to cause a stress, and it's going to break.” A couple other pieces of evidence fit this theory. Starship's upper stage goes all the way to orbit and reaches 17,500 mph. We have to manage this energy being generated through heating.” Now the vehicle uses its control surfaces and rockets to slow its descent and relies on heat-resistant tiles (which, of course, add weight). One persistent critic of SpaceX, Will Lockett, has argued that Starship simply must use more propellant than its builders expected for its return flights, adding even more weight. “This puts incredible pressure on SpaceX to save weight anywhere they possibly can,” Lockett wrote in his newsletter in March. “SpaceX is having to make the rockets too light, resulting in them being fragile, meaning that just the vibrations from operation with a fraction of its expected payload would be enough to destroy the rocket.” Maybe this build-test-destroy-rebuild cycle is what you'd expect from a cutting-edge company like SpaceX, which owes much of its astonishing success to iterating like a software start-up. The version of Super Heavy that's set to launch on Sunday has some major design changes, increasing the size and strength of the winglets called “grid fins” but reducing their number from four to three and aiming for a more controlled, higher angle-of-attack descent. In practice, though, this Silicon Valley–style approach forces SpaceX to play a very expensive game of Whac-A-Mole. “The way I read what Elon's trying to do, wow, is it complicated. “With a rocket, that almost always results in detonation.” “They're facing challenges, but I don't see any showstoppers,” McDowell says. “I don't want to minimize the problems they're having. But even if SpaceX and its customers can absorb the higher price, not all of Starship's planned missions can necessarily wait for a more reliable spacecraft. Plus, even if you didn't already think that ionizing radiation and toxic regolith make Musk's dreams for Mars settlement about as likely as finding canals there, a reduction in Starship's cargo capacity and rapid reusability would seem to doom the plan. One model for making the trip in three months instead of the usual six or nine requires four cargo Starships and two crew Starships and assumes a total of 45 launches—a mere fraction of the 1,000 Starship launches per year SpaceX foresees. “Every time you add a widget to fix something, you increase the mass and decrease the payload capacity,” he says. “That's the key question we don't know in the public domain: To what extent are the fixes causing performance losses?” Musk and SpaceX share a reputation for bold technological wins—they blew up a lot of Falcon 9 rockets before that vehicle became the ultrareliable, game-changing satellite launcher it is today. But investors and customers won't wait for Starship forever. Adam Rogers is a journalist covering science, technology and culture. If you enjoyed this article, I'd like to ask for your support.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Omega fatty acids could protect against Alzheimer's disease in women, new research has found. Analysis of lipids - fat molecules that perform many essential functions in the body - in the blood found there was a noticeable loss of unsaturated fats, such as those that contain omega fatty acids, in the blood of women with Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy women. Scientists found no significant difference in the same lipid molecule composition in men with Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy men, which suggests that those lipids have a different role in the disease according to sex. Fats perform important roles in maintaining a healthy brain, so this study could indicate why more women are diagnosed with the disease. Senior author Dr Cristina Legido-Quigley, from King's College London, said: "Women are disproportionately impacted by Alzheimer's Disease and are more often diagnosed with the disease than men after the age of 80. One of the most surprising things we saw when looking at the different sexes was that there was no difference in these lipids in healthy and cognitively impaired men, but for women this picture was completely different. But a clinical trial is necessary to confirm the link. Dr Legido-Quigley added: "Our study suggests that women should make sure they are getting omega fatty acids in their diet - through fatty fish or via supplements. Dr Asger Wretlind, first author of the study from King's College London, said: "Scientists have known for some time that more women than men are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Although this still warrants further research, we were able to detect biological differences in lipids between the sexes in a large cohort, and show the importance of lipids containing omegas in the blood, which has not been done before. Dr Julia Dudley, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK says: "In the UK, two in three people living with dementia are women. This could be linked to living longer, or other risk factors like social isolation, education, or hormonal changes from the menopause being at play. Future research should also be carried out in a more ethnically diverse population to see if the same effect is seen. "Understanding how the disease works differently in women could help doctors tailor future treatments and health advice. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The newly-discovered ecosystem surrounding a hydrothermal vent could give scientists clues as to how life began on Earth. So, it isn't surprising that scientists are frequently making new discoveries deep beneath the waves. Published in the journal Science Advances, their recent study details just how extraordinary the newly-discovered deep sea network really is. It sits roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of the Mussau Trench on the Caroline Plate, located just north of New Guinea. In the ocean, hydrothermal systems occur when seawater seeps down through cracks in oceanic crust and rapidly heats as it nears Earth's mantle. And while they are often associated with the briny depths of our oceans, hydrothermal vents aren't exclusive to the sea. So, why should we care about nature's jacuzzis jets? The conditions surrounding hydrothermal systems give scientists the perfect natural laboratory to research what that precise recipe for life was when it began millions of years ago. Not only is the Kunlun hydrothermal field exciting because it's newly-discovered, but it also isn't your average hydrothermal system—according to Sun Weidong, corresponding author on the study, the field has several abnormal characteristics. “The Kunlun system stands out for its exceptionally high hydrogen flux, scale, and unique geological setting,” he explained in a press release. Researchers say that the location of the field in particular is “challenging long-held assumptions,” as it shows that hydrogen generation—and extremely rich generation, at that—can occur far from mid-ocean ridges. While the Lost City hydrothermal field is no lost city of Atlantis, it's still remarkable—in fact, it may be the longest-lived venting environment in history. Scientists spend a lot of time researching what life must have looked like around hydrothermal vents in their earliest days, but that doesn't mean the deep sea systems are devoid of residents now. “What's particularly intriguing is its ecological potential,” Sun said in the press release. “We observed diverse deep-sea life thriving here—shrimp, squat lobsters, anemones, and tubeworms—species that may depend on hydrogen-fueled chemosynthesis.” Her work appears in several publications including Biography.com and Popular Mechanics.

One of his favorite areas was a large stretch of seafloor he nicknamed the “Beet Field” because it was covered in spidery red octocorals. Many viewers thought this seastar resembled the SpongeBob SquarePants character, Patrick Star. They found hints of unique ecosystems and identified new species at that time. The area, situated about 190 miles off Argentina's northeastern coast, is shaped by two converging currents: one is salty and flowing down from the tropics, and the other is cold, full of nutrients and swelling up from Antarctica. Deep-sea canyons such as Mar del Plata act like funnels, channeling and concentrating the waters. “This confluence creates one of the most energetic oceanic regions in the world, fueling high productivity and supporting remarkable biodiversity,” says Jonathan Flores, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina. A siphonophore documented at 1,250 meters deep in the Mar del Plata Canyon. Some creatures found there might not exist anywhere else in the world. “Deep-sea canyons are biodiversity hotspots and play key roles in ecosystem functioning, yet we still know very little about them,” Flores says. A brooding mother octopus shelters her eggs behind two different types of corals. The expedition set out to establish a baseline of what life inhabits Mar del Plata. Peachy corals of a potentially new species clung to the canyon wall. Though the area looks like a deep-sea Barbie wonderland to human eyes, these creatures are actually clad in stealthy camouflage. Red light doesn't travel far in the deep sea, which means reddish animals can more easily avoid predators. A helmet jellyfish undulates in Mar Del Plata Submarine Canyon. Brenda Doti, an associate researcher at CONICET, works with a specimen of a crustacean in the main lab of research vessel Falkor (too). “One way to confirm is by bar coding—sequencing a piece of mitochondrial DNA,” says Mike Vecchione, a research zoologist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who was not involved in the expedition. Vecchione has cataloged many new species over the course of several decades. “But for some deep-sea organisms, this can take years,” he says.

Stay connected to The Universe: Get email alerts for this weekly column by Phil Plait For a brief few weeks in early 2025, astronomers were worried about the asteroid 2024 YR4. Discovered in late 2024 by an automated telescope in Chile as part of the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) sky survey, it's a not only a near-Earth asteroid but one that astronomers feared could get too close for comfort to our fair planet and pose a potential impact risk. At 60 or so meters in diameter, 2024 YR4 wouldn't cause global damage if it fell to Earth, but it would explode upon impact with the energy of an eight-megaton bomb, so local damage would be considerable. Thus, astronomers were right: it was something to worry about. Initial observations indicated the asteroid might hit Earth on December 22, 2032. By mid-February 2025, astronomers had refined that Earth-impact probability to around 3 percent, which wasn't high but was still somewhat concerning.

Amazingly, a chance remains that 2024 YR4 will hit the moon! If 2024 YR4 does whack into our lone natural satellite, what will happen? Is Earth (or, more to the point, those of us who live on it) in any danger? If so, Earth-based observers could see a brief flash as 2024 YR4's immense kinetic energy—its energy of motion—would convert into light and heat, though it's difficult to predict just how bright this would be. That flash was bright enough to be seen by eye, reaching about magnitude 4.2, and came from an object estimated to be less than half a meter across. The asteroid 2024 YR4 is more than 100 times wider, so its volume is well more than a million times larger, which means the energy of its impact would be that much more powerful. But it would be concentrated in a single point on the surface, so it would be exceedingly bright as seen from Earth. The astronomers calculated that 2024 YR4's impact would carve out a crater approximately one kilometer in diameter—small for a lunar crater but big enough that the material excavated and ejected would total about 100 million metric tons. Given the uncertainties in the researchers' calculation, however, this still means that some 10,000 to 100,000 metric tons of lunar rock would be ejected, and a lot of it could be headed our way. It's possible that all the ejected debris could be flung into deep space, missing Earth entirely. But for other scenarios, it's possible that approximately 10 percent of the material could be thrown into an Earth-impacting trajectory. In the latter case, that material would hit us within three to five days of the lunar impact, so around December 25 to 27, 2032. But this potential blow could be softened considerably if most of the ejecta were small particles rather than bigger chunks. The paper's authors caution that their calculations are rough and only yield an order-of-magnitude estimation, meaning it could be too high or low by a factor of 10. Happily, at these size ranges, they would all burn up safely in our atmosphere, dozens of kilometers above the surface. Something that size would make for a pretty bright meteor, and thousands of them might be visible from a given location over the course of several days. The smaller sand-grain pieces would streak through Earth's atmosphere in much larger numbers—10 to 1,000 times the usual background level of meteors that we see—which means an observer might witness as many as one per second. They would fall to Earth far slower than normal meteors coming in from interplanetary space, however, so they wouldn't be nearly as bright. And the smallest particles wouldn't be visible at all. For comparison, our planet typically sops up about 50 to 100 metric tons of space debris each day. The bottom line, though, is that we'll be safe because our air protects us. What are the chances that a satellite will be hit? There are more than 12,000 working satellites in orbit right now. By 2032, that number will increase ferociously because SpaceX and other companies plan to launch tens of thousands of additional satellites into orbit. Looking at the standard sizes of satellites and the number of meteoroids raining down, the paper's co-authors estimate that if 2024 YR4 were to make lunar impact, hundreds to thousands of sand-grain-size impact fragments could strike satellites within a few days. The probability that any satellite would get hit by the bigger, centimeter-size pieces is only about 10 percent (taken, of course, with a sand-size grain of salt due because of the various uncertainties). During its next close approach to our planet in 2028, more observations will likely nail down the impact probability even better. This shows us that while we rightly are concerned about mitigating Earth impacts from larger asteroids, even smaller ones hitting the moon are a cause for concern and may be worth trying to prevent as well. The good news is that such 2024 YR4–size lunar impacts are extremely rare, and the chance of one in 2032 is still slim. It would make for a spectacular event, but we'd be far better off if the asteroid missed. Phil Plait is a professional astronomer and science communicator in Virginia.

Scientists are still searching for answers—and new ways to treat them. By Rachel Feltman, Jeffery DelViscio, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura An estimated one out of every 10 people in the U.S. has some kind of food allergy, which adds up to more than 33 million Americans. But peanut allergies weren't always so prevalent. Just over a decade later that number had more than tripled. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Scientists still aren't completely sure what led to this big uptick, but it could stem in part from parental anxiety over peanut allergies—and misguided advice about how to keep kids safe. Here to tell us more about the latest research on peanut allergies, including new avenues for treatment and prevention, is Maryn McKenna, the author of a recent article on the subject for Scientific American. Maryn is a journalist who covers food policy and public health. Thank you so much for coming on to chat with us today. Feltman: So what do we know about the origins of peanut allergies? McKenna: This is a really interesting mystery still. McKenna: We know the biological mechanisms of what makes an allergy happen, but why peanut allergy in particular came on the scene 20, 30 years ago or so and why it blew up to such a major public health problem—people are still working that out. McKenna: I think most people are familiar with the concept of our having an immune system that, through a variety of mechanisms, defends our bodies against the outside world, broadly speaking—against things that are not us. The immune system recognizes proteins in these foods as being sort of not self, not part of us, and mounts an extraordinary reaction that expresses itself in the kind of symptoms that, if you're allergic, you've experienced or that you may be familiar with from hearing about them from other people: hives, itchiness, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing; in the worst presentations depressed blood pressure, inability to breathe and sometimes, in, in the worst case, a heart attack. Feltman: And what are the actual rates of nut allergy? McKenna: This can be a frustrating question to try to answer because what we know about people being allergic depends on their telling researchers that they're allergic ... There are biological markers for allergy, but we don't apply tests for those biological markers to the entire population, so all of the data relies on people telling researchers who have asked that an allergy is present in themselves or in their kids, if they're parents answering for children. All of that said the numbers are really big. It's estimated that one out of every 10 individuals just in the United States has some kind of food allergy ... And one of the folks I spoke to for this story said: “If you think of the average size of a classroom in elementary school, for instance, that means in every classroom two to three kids are going to have food allergy ...” McKenna: And peanut is one of the most common food allergies. It's actually probably not the most common, but it tends to be the one that we hear about the most: if we have kids in school and they're aware that in, in the lunchroom there's a peanut-free table, or if you get on an airplane and realize that you can't have peanuts on the airplane because there might be an allergic person on the plane with you that day. McKenna: And it affects, in the most recent data, more than eight million people, whereas peanut and milk allergies, which are two and three, affect a little bit more than six million. But most people don't stroll around their lives eating shrimp, right? McKenna: This is not a thing that, for most of us, that we munch walking down the street or eat in a protein bar. But peanuts are incredibly portable, they're a favorite food for kids—peanut butter is pretty much ubiquitous, and so peanuts are just present in our lives a lot. But why peanuts cause such reactions is one of those enduring unanswered questions. There are a lot of hypotheses advanced for why that is, ranging from the way that allergy happens in general; that there are things in the environment that are more present than they used to be or that the environments that we grow up in are cleaner and so we tend to overreact to them; to the ubiquity of ultraprocessing in food, which might be distributing these proteins more broadly so that kids are exposed to them when they aren't aware that they're exposed to them; or it could just be that we like peanuts [laughs]. McKenna: But as a result, for all of those reasons and probably others as well, peanut allergy is very present in the lives of families, and it can be very serious. McKenna: So the “big eight,” that's an actual legal term, and it indicates the allergens, the proteins, that are present in food that, when it's a processed food, have to be declared ... Up to 90 percent of food allergies are caused by these eight things; that's why they were made the subject of legislation back in 2004. So peanuts, milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts—so things like almonds, for instance—wheat and soybeans, and there's actually a ninth, a sort of footnote to the “big eight” that was added just a few years ago, which is sesame. So those nine allergens are responsible for an enormous amount of food allergy in the United States, and sometimes they're linked allergies, like someone who has an allergy to peanut might also be allergic to egg or to milk, but as a category they cause a great deal of distress. Feltman: And I know you touched on this a bit a minute ago, but how much do scientists know about how we got to the point we are now with food allergies? McKenna: The question of why food allergies, and peanut allergy within that, is so common and seems to be getting more common, at the base—like, why this starts—is still really an unanswered question. You can go by some sort of qualitative measures, like if you are an adult who's been flying on airplanes for 30 years, 30 years ago you might have been able to have a peanut snack inside an airplane, and you would not have heard a member of the cabin crew saying, “If you brought peanut snacks on board, please do not eat them because there's an allergic person sitting somewhere near you.” The first was done in 1997; these were all done by researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. So that's a threefold increase across just 11 years, starting in the late 1990s. You know, even with all the remaining uncertainty around peanut allergies, what did you find out about where science is making the most progress and how they're doing that? McKenna: Reporting this story was really a journey because I went into it being interested in one particular therapy that had been advanced just a [few] years ago. It was the first [Food and Drug Administration]-approved therapy ... McKenna: For peanut allergy, not a cure—a method of desensitization. McKenna: That's given to kids in very precisely measured doses by mouth over a period of time, and it's meant to desensitize them. I was interested in it because I felt that it hadn't done very well in the marketplace, and I wasn't sure if that was because of the dosing regime or because it happened to be introduced to the market at the start of COVID, but I wondered, “If this [allergy] was such a big problem, why hadn't this [medication] taken off?” So I started to look at this, and it turns out that there was a bunch more science that I was not aware of. And this one particular FDA-approved therapy, Palforzia, was only a small part of the story. McKenna: So that they can go from being in danger of anaphylactic shock to actually being safe to eat a small amount of peanut or peanut protein or peanut butter. And exactly how small that small amount is depends in part on how allergic they were to begin with. Some people have been made relatively safe from accidental exposures ... McKenna: Now, some researchers in this field will say, “Well, you still aren't getting all that far. We are making people safe in their lives, but they still have to be careful about what they're eating; they can't go face first into a jar of peanut butter.” And therefore, I found as I was working on this story, there are other really interesting efforts going on to try to keep the allergy from developing and to effectively nullify the allergy once it has developed. Feltman: Yeah, what's your sense of where things are going in the next few years? McKenna: So right at this moment a clinical trial is starting that is really unusual, and it's extremely early days; they are getting to just a phase 1 at this point—only one patient has actually been reported out. But what it does is it uses a combination of drugs made by a company called Regeneron, to essentially reset or rewrite the body's understanding of what it's supposed to react to. And researchers gave this drug and then tested people with their allergy, with the food they were allergic to, which was peanuts, and discovered that though it seemed promising it didn't actually have a long-term effect. And then they decided to try adding in a second drug, which has just been approved for a particular cancer, a cancer of the cells that make the antibodies that cause the body to overreact in an allergic situation. The other thing that's really interesting and that's beginning to get traction is that there is a school of thought based on a set of studies that were done in England that asks: Well, maybe food allergy, especially peanut allergy, maybe it's kind of our fault because maybe we, as a society, are not introducing children ... McKenna: When their immune systems are developing to peanuts at a time when their immune systems could handle them and not overreact to them. And where this came from was an accidental finding by a British pediatrician who was speaking to a group of pediatricians in Israel and asked them how many of them were treating food-allergic kids, expecting every hand to shoot up ... McKenna: And in fact, almost no one did. Very few people in the audience were actually treating allergic kids. And through a set of very clever experiments they discovered that the difference was that there's a ubiquitous snack in Israel called Bamba. Feltman: Yeah, it's also ubiquitous in Germany [laughs] ... McKenna: So they, they—there's—here in the United States, in Trader Joe's, they make a Bamba equivalent; I saw it the other day. They're a puffy, extruded product, but instead of cheese on the outside they have peanut butter on the outside. And Israeli kids, it turned out, get them quite early in life, and so they were getting an exposure to peanuts at a time when the British kids were being held strictly away from peanuts ... McKenna: Because that was the dominant advice at the time—this is just a few years ago—for any child in a family with a history of allergy was: keep them away from allergenic foods. And now the public health establishment and pediatrics and pediatric nutrition are struggling with this conundrum of the excellent advice that seemed to keep kids safe for so long may actually have set some kids up for allergy instead ... McKenna: And how do we implement the new findings now that they exist? McKenna: Everyone is extremely careful around the word “cure” in this situation, and I respect that. They're careful about it for a couple of reasons. First, even the most optimistic researchers to whom I spoke are clear in saying that when they do these various new modalities of desensitization, that's all they're doing; they are not curing the allergy, but they are making it safer for people to live everyday lives. And the second is: these other avenues in which the allergy might actually be remodeled, those are such early days that whether it's actually going to work in broad populations, either the very early feeding or this drug administration, it's way too early to make confident statements about them. But I think, also, the reason that they're so careful about this word “cure” is because there are so many families out there—you know, families of millions of kids in the U.S. have had their lives disrupted by food allergy, especially peanut allergy. Even though they believe they see real hope coming over the horizon it's too early for them to say with confidence that it will really change the game.

(2025)Cite this article COVID-19 and long COVID are characterized by a dysregulated immune response. However, the role of macrophages during viral infection is poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in increased macrophage numbers and extensive formation of enlarged lipid-laden macrophages or foam cells using humanized mice, rhesus macaques and post-mortem human lung tissue. Notably, infection by other coronaviruses tested, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and two bat coronaviruses (SHC014-CoV or WIV1-CoV), did not result in macrophage proliferation or foam cell formation. Foam cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung tissue display a pro-fibrotic and pro-thrombotic phenotype as they are enriched for genes associated with platelet activation and aggregation, as well as extracellular matrix organization and collagen synthesis. After viral clearance, macrophage numbers remain elevated, and lung fibrosis and thrombi persist. Importantly, we show that pre-exposure prophylaxis or early treatment with a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, EIDD-2801, prevents increases in macrophage cell numbers and foam cell formation, and reduces fibrosis markers. These observations highlight the contribution of macrophages to lung inflammation and tissue injury leading to the pulmonary fibrosis observed in COVID-19 patients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're often told it is "unscientific" or "meaningless" to ask what happened before the Big Bang. But a new paper by FQxI cosmologist Eugene Lim, of King's College London, UK, and astrophysicists Katy Clough, of Queen Mary University of London, UK, and Josu Aurrekoetxea, at Oxford University, UK, published in Living Reviews in Relativity, in June 2025, proposes a way forward: using complex computer simulations to numerically (rather than exactly) solve Einstein's equations for gravity in extreme situations. The team argues that numerical relativity should be applied increasingly in cosmology to probe some of the universe's biggest questions-including what happened before the Big Bang, whether we live in a multiverse, if our universe has collided with a neighboring cosmos, or whether our universe cycled through a series of bangs and crunches. But wind the clock back far enough and you'll typically encounter a singularity-a state of infinite density and temperature-where the laws of physics collapse. Cosmologists simply cannot solve Einstein's equations in such extreme environments-their normal simplifying assumptions no longer hold. And the same impasse applies to objects involving singularities or extreme gravity, such as black holes. This is a very good approximation for the universe we see around us, and one that makes it possible to easily solve Einstein's equations in most cosmic scenarios. "You can search around the lamppost, but you can't go far beyond the lamppost, where it's dark-you just can't solve those equations," explains Lim. "Numerical relativity allows you to explore regions away from the lamppost." Numerical relativity was first suggested in the 1960s and 1970s to try to work out what kinds of gravitational waves (ripples in the fabric of spacetime) would be emitted if black holes collided and merged. This is an extreme scenario for which it is impossible to solve Einstein's equations with paper and pen alone-sophisticated computer code and numerical approximations are required. "You can search around the lamppost, but you can't go far beyond the lamppost, where it's dark-you just can't solve those equations. Numerical relativity allows you to explore regions away from the lamppost," says Eugene Lim. "If you don't have inflation, a lot of things fall apart," explains Lim. If you instead assume it started out in another state, then "you don't have the symmetry to write down your equations easily," explains Lim. But numerical relativity could help us get around this problem-allowing radically different starting conditions. It isn't a simple puzzle to solve, though, as there's an infinite number of ways spacetime could have been before inflation. They might also be able to predict signatures, or "bruises," on the sky from our universe colliding with neighboring universes (if they even exist), which could help us verify the multiverse theory. Excitingly, numerical relativity could also help reveal whether there was a universe before the Big Bang. "Bouncing universes are an excellent example, because they reach strong gravity where you can't rely on your symmetries," says Lim. "Several groups are already working on them-it used to be that nobody was." Numerical relativity simulations are so complex that they require supercomputers to run. Lim is hoping the team's new paper, which outlines the methods and benefits of numerical relativity, can ultimately help get researchers across different areas up to speed. "We hope to actually develop that overlap between cosmology and numerical relativity so that numerical relativists who are interested in using their techniques to explore cosmological problems can go ahead and do it," Lim says, adding, "and cosmologists who are interested in solving some of the questions they cannot solve, can use numerical relativity."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world will warm more than expected due to future changes in ozone, which protects Earth from harmful sun rays but also traps heat as it is a greenhouse gas. A new study led by the University of Reading found that from 2015 to 2050, ozone is expected to cause 0.27 watts per square meter (Wm⁻²) of extra warming. This figure -- which measures how much extra energy gets trapped per square metre of Earth's surface -- would make ozone the second largest contributor to future warming by 2050 after carbon dioxide (1.75 Wm⁻² of extra warming). However, while this helps repair the protective ozone layer, we have found that this recovery in ozone will warm the planet more than we originally thought. The models followed a scenario with low implementation of air pollution controls, but with CFCs and HCFCs being phased out as mandated by the Montreal Protocol (1987). Countries banned them to save the ozone layer, expecting this would also help fight climate change. Countries that reduce air pollution will limit some ozone formation near the ground. However, the ozone layer will continue repairing itself for decades regardless of air quality policies, creating unavoidable warming. Protecting the ozone layer remains crucial for human health and preventing skin cancer. The ozone layer shields Earth from dangerous ultraviolet radiation that can harm people, animals and plants. However, the research suggests climate policies need updating to account for ozone's larger warming effect.

Kennedy Jr wants a study about vaccines retracted.Credit: Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Sipa US via Alamy US health secretary and vaccine sceptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr has called for the retraction of a Danish study that found no link between aluminium in vaccines and chronic diseases in children — a rare move for a US public official. But some people claim the ingredient is linked to rising rates of childhood disorders such as autism. Public-health officials in Kennedy's position rarely request that studies be retracted, says Ivan Oransky, a specialist in academic publishing and co-founder of the media organization Retraction Watch. The authors reported that no significant risk of developing autoimmune, allergic or neurodevelopmental disorders was associated with exposure to aluminium compounds in vaccines. Since his appointment as head of the US Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has bypassed normal scientific review processes to change vaccine recommendations and terminated grants for projects on mRNA vaccines. Christine Laine, editor in chief for the journal, wrote in a comment on the study's web page on 11 August that “retraction is warranted only when serious errors invalidate findings or there is documented scientific misconduct, neither of which occurred here”. The Department of Health and Human Services said that Kennedy's article spoke for itself, and that the department did not have any further comment in response to Nature's questions about Kennedy's request for a retraction. Aluminium, in the form of salts, such as potassium aluminium sulfate, have been administered in vaccines — for diseases ranging from whooping cough to pneumonia — to millions of people worldwide, and the vaccines have been widely studied for safety issues2,3. Gary Grohmann, an independent virologist in Canberra, says there is no evidence of significant side effects caused by the small amount of aluminium in vaccines. In 2012, the World Health Organization's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety said the study and another by the same authors were “seriously flawed” because they used inappropriate study designs, incorrect assumptions and questionable data. “If there was a mechanism of action where a particular vaccine caused autism, we'd see it in 80, 90, 100% of people receiving the vaccine, and we don't,” he says. Any association between autism and vaccines is probably a coincidence of timing, he says. “In other words, vaccines might be given at the age of two, and autism genetically might also kick in at the age of two,” he adds. Allen Cheng, an epidemiologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, says the Danish study adds to the evidence that vaccines containing aluminium are safe. Kennedy also criticized the fact that the authors did not compare vaccinated and unvaccinated children to determine whether any aluminium exposure causes harm, even though they had some data on unvaccinated children.
