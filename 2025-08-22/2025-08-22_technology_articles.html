                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As consumers grow more impatient, Apple is considering using another company's tech instead of developing its own. Apple is now exploring a partnership with Google, its most direct competitor in the smartphone business, according to Bloomberg editor and Apple insider Mark Gurman. The company previously approached OpenAI and Anthropic for similar discussions about using their technology to power Siri, and reportedly, Google has begun training a model that could run on Apple's servers. Apple is not expected to make a decision about whether to bring on a partner for the Siri revamp for another several weeks. Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft and protesters offered sharply conflicting accounts of a demonstration that led to 20 arrests on the company's Redmond campus Wednesday, with organizers alleging police brutality, and the company saying the vast majority of those arrested were not employees. “We want to be clear that the destructive and aggressive protest that took place on our campus on August 20 does not represent our workforce,” the company said in a statement Thursday afternoon. At a press conference Thursday, members of the group No Azure for Apartheid described what they called “unnecessary and unjustifiable violence” by police. The dueling statements followed two days of escalating protests over Microsoft's technology contracts with Israel. After disbanding on Tuesday, demonstrators returned Wednesday to again take over a portion of the plaza at Microsoft's East Campus. They poured red paint on a company sign to symbolize blood, and blocked a bridge, leading to arrests on charges including trespassing, malicious mischief, and resisting arrest. Microsoft has pledged to continue upholding human rights standards in its tech contracts. No Azure for Apartheid held a press conference Thursday evening at a public transit station near the Microsoft campus, calling again on the company to cut ties with Israel. Jill Green, public information officer for the Redmond Police Department, said via email that the police haven't received any claims from protesters. An initial version of that post on Wednesday by the Redmond Police included a photograph of four officers arresting a protester on the ground. Microsoft released surveillance video that shows protesters taking over the space in front of the Microsoft sign on their bikes; attempting to corral a police officer inside a portable fence; confronting a DJ who was there for a local farmers' market for employees; and ultimately causing the market to be shut down. 20 arrested at Microsoft headquarters in latest protest over Israel tech contracts Protesters set up temporary encampment at Microsoft to pressure company on Israel contracts Google and Amazon workers protest tech giants' contract with Israel as war in Gaza continues</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This could be the reason why Noctua has never made a flagship graphics card (yet). When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Such a design would logically have been perfect for an RTX 5090 model, and according to Kitguru, Noctua thinks so as well. However, it turns out Nvidia is the bottleneck preventing an RTX 5090 Noctua Edition from existing. KitGuru talked with Noctua's Jakob Dellinger, who divulged that Nvidia does not have enough GB202 chip production "at the moment" to build an RTX 5090 Noctua Edition graphics card. This problem is likely why Noctua has never built an xx90-series RTX graphics card so far. However, Dellinger did discuss what an RTX 5090 Noctua Edition could look like if events ever change. The RTX 5080 Noctua Edition model's 11 heatpipes could also potentially be switched to 8mm heatpipes entirely for this theoretical RTX 5090 version. Nvidia's difficulty producing GB202 dies is something it has been struggling with since Blackwell debuted, thanks to the RTX 5090's insane market demand since its release earlier this year. Even to this day, RTX 5090 AIB partner cards are regularly priced hundreds of dollars above MSRP. This problem has been compounded by Nvidia releasing more GB202-powered GPUs recently, including the Nvidia RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell workstation and server edition graphics cards. It's a real shame we probably won't see an RTX 5090 Noctua Edition graphics card for the foreseeable future. The RTX 5090's sky-high 575W TDP makes it the perfect candidate for Noctua to put its cooling experience to good use. As a result, combined with the aforementioned NF-A12x25 G2 fans, Noctua's RTX 5080 variant allegedly produces some of the most competitive cooling and acoustical performance behavior out of any RTX 5080 to date. Cooling performance is so good on the RTX 5080 Noctua Edition, that Noctua benchmarked its card at just 500RPM, achieving 74.6C GPU temperatures, which is more than acceptable temperatures for modern Nvidia GPUs.

And I have am Anker dock at the office so I can plug my laptop into my 4K monitor and peripherals with just one cable. But I also use my laptop at home at my standing desk, where it's also handy to have a dock so I can plug into my TV and any peripherals I might be testing. That's where something like Baseus' Joystar 9-in-1 docking station could come in handy. It doesn't have all the ports or the built-in power of a more traditional, more expensive docking station. It would make a great minimal or secondary dock for laptop users who only have USB-C ports. And the inclusion of an Ethernet port makes it dead-simple to get on your home or corporate network without having to deal with Wi-Fi if you don't need or don't want to. The main limitation with this hub is that it only has a single USB-C port. For those who need more, the company also sells a 10-in-1 hub that's also on sale for $47 at Amazon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been over two months since Trump Mobile announced the T1 Phone was being “Made in the USA” designed “with American values in mind,” and it seems that anyone deciding to preorder it still can't be sure exactly what phone they might receive. It instead looks rather suspiciously like the rear side of a Samsung Galaxy S25. Not just that, it actually appears to be the back of a third-party S25 phone case from Spigen that has been photoshopped gold and stamped with the T1 logo and trademark American flag. Spigen's social media account commented under the post on X with an apt “??? bro what” before writing on its own page that it had a “lawsuit incoming.” WIRED has reached out to Spigen for comment. There's also 256 GB of internal storage, an in-screen fingerprint sensor, and “AI face unlock.” It's priced at $499, which includes a $100 deposit that apparently covers shipping and handling as well as your first month of Trump Mobile service. This suggests buyers will be required to use Trump Mobile with their T1 Phone, with no clear details before you authorize payment of any ongoing commitment to the service. All of which isn't helping to curb suspicions that, right now, the T1 Phone—initially pegged to arrive in August—probably doesn't exist in any shape or form.

Plus, get a look at what's coming on Peacemaker. During a recent interview with People, Kirsten Dunst jokingly pitched her participation in the upcoming sequel to Minecraft, adding, “maybe I can just make a movie where I don't lose money?“ According to Deadline, Casper Van Dien, Bill Moseley, Michael Berryman, Kane Hodder, and Trina Parks are attached to star in no less than two movies from director Ani Kyd Wolf, Spawn of the Living Dead and Organism 46-B: The Unseen. Based on a script by Night of the Living Dead‘s John A. Russo, Spawn is said to be set at the end of the “1968 zombie plague” and concern Dr. Harold Ormsby and his team “collecting zombie specimens” in hopes of “finding out what caused the plague and how it can be cured.” Meanwhile, Organism 46-B: The Unseen will concern a group of scientists “trapped beneath four kilometers of Antarctic ice” who accidentally awaken “an ancient predator, a shape-shifting horror who mimics its prey and controls the mind.” Deadline also reports Victorian Psycho, starring Maika Monroe, Jason Isaacs, and Thomasin McKenzie, is scheduled to begin filming in Ireland next week for a planned nationwide theatrical release through Bleecker Street next year. A ten-year-old time traveler from 3,000 years in the future visits 2075 via rainbow in the trailer for Arco, starring the voices of Will Ferrell, America Ferrera, Flea (of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame), Natalie Portman, Mark Ruffalo, and Andy Samberg.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. In a market that is becoming increasingly more crowded (for the better, as getting more people on bikes is good for all of us), Seattle-based Rad Power Bikes has planted its flag as a brand that offers the fun and utility of an ebike at a lower cost than its competitors, thanks in large part to its direct-to-consumer model. What started as a single-product brand quickly grew into what it is today: North America's largest ebike manufacturer, with a line that includes off-road bikes, cargo bikes, folding bikes, and even a trike. The RadRunner Max takes one of the brand's cornerstone models and jacks it up with plenty of upgrades, new styling, and cutting-edge battery technology aimed at keeping its owners safe. Armed with my portable bike shop (a fishing tackle box full of small bike tools and parts), my trusty torque wrench, and a rag or two, I cut open the box and emptied everything onto my garage floor and discovered that a Rad bike is no different than a piece of Ikea furniture. All I needed to build the bike was a trio of Allen keys and a small adjustable wrench, all of which were included in the packaging. Of course, a torque wrench wouldn't hurt, as the bike's assembly guide offers helpful torque recommendations for anything a user needs to tighten. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Going from a sealed box to a rideable bike took about 25 minutes, since all that required assembly was mounting the handlebars, front wheel, kickstand, front fender, and 450-lumen headlight. Everything else was ready to go straight out of the box. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The only knock I had during assembly is how, in an effort to protect the bike's paint while in transit, much of its frame was covered in masking tape. While the tape did its job perfectly, it did leave plenty of residue on the RadRunner's stunning hunter green finish (unfortunately the bike's only color option). That left me reaching for my bottle of Goo Gone to scrub away all those would-be magnets for dirt and grime once out on the road. I thought what's what led to the overly cushy ride feel, but then I realized that the bike came loaded with a front suspension unit that boasts 80 millimeters of travel. The first thing I did on realizing this was lean over and click the suspension setting to rigid. A major concern for ebike owners (current and prospective alike) is the notion of thermal runaway, which is the official terminology for “lithium-ion batteries catching fire.” It's been a concern for some time. Rad Power Bikes has been at the center of at least a few of these incidences over the years, but the RadRunner Max has the brand's Safe Shield batteries, which debuted last year and which remedy any potential for thermal runaway. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Safe Shield earns the batteries a UL-2271 certification. It encapsulates the batteries' cells in a heat-absorbing resin so that any fire remains localized and will (hopefully) extinguish itself. The bike's Dutch-style step-through design, combined with its telescoping seat post, makes it an easy family vehicle, as both my wife (5'6”) and I (6'4”) can easily adjust and climb on the RadRunner Max. That said, when I adjust the RadRunner Max to my riding specs, it requires pulling the seat tube to its maximum height setting. Even then, my legs felt a bit jammed in during rides. Still, I was able to cover plenty of miles with no pain or discomfort. Still, I would not recommend the RadRunner Max to anyone taller than me. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Where it might fall short in height accomodation, however, the 750-watt, 90 newton-meter motor housed in the bike's rear hub—which can power the bike to a maximum 28 miles per hour—provided plenty of juice to get me and all of my 260 pounds easily up and over any of Chapel Hill, North Carolina's endlessly undulating bumps. With a combination of pedal assist and hand-grip throttle, an eight-speed rear derailleur covering a wide-enough 11- to 34-tooth cassette, the RadRunner Max handled riding around with aplomb over the few weeks I spent testing it. The pedal assist features five modes that range from completely off to full power, but there were definitely times where I cranked the throttle and treated the RadRunner more like a moped than anything else. Though it's scientifically impossible to prove, this is probably when the smile on my face was at its biggest. Hoping to get anywhere near the bike's claimed 60 miles of range, I did my best to keep the motor set between 1 or 2 on flats and completely off on descents. Thanks to the bike's manageable thumb buttons, switching between settings became second nature within seconds. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. And, as stopping is equally important as riding, the RadRunner's massive 180-mm rotors, which boast 2.3 mm of thickness and are operated by hydraulic brakes, gave me plenty of stopping power, even as I was rolling down a 12-percent hill one rainy afternoon. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. On the safety and security front, the RadRunner Max features two major upgrades beyond its new battery. First, its rear light not only boasts turn signals but also radar, which alerts riders to traffic coming up on them within 100 meters, even displaying the vehicle's speed. Second, the RadRunner Max is loaded with redundant safekeeping measures which include a key fob, Bluetooth connectivity to your phone, an option for passcode unlock (and the ability to assign multiple passcodes for multiple users), and even a built-in Apple Find My feature, which will help you track down your bike if anyone lifts it. I'm old-school, so I simply wound my U-lock and cable through the bike's rear rack, which not only boasts a reported 120-pound capacity but also has an additional battery mount, where a second unit can double the bike's claimed 60-mile range. Then again, no bike is (other than, of course, a hand-painted Dario Pegoretti, but I still can't convince WIRED to let me test one of those. While it may fall a bit short in height (no pun intended), ride feel (at least for me), and color options (though the hunter green finish with Rad's signature orange badging certainly pops), the RadRunner Max more than compensates in utility, ease of use, cool new safety features, and, perhaps most importantly, fun factor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Companies all over the world are currently racing to shrink their workforces and replace them with AI. Often, it seems, this isn't working out for the firms involved. Case in point: A bank in Australia recently did so, but then had to ask its workers to come back after it turned out that the chatbot that it had launched to replace them couldn't cut the mustard. Last month, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced that it would be laying off 45 customer service workers as it rolled out a new AI-powered ‘voice bot' that could supposedly do their job, Bloomberg reports. Australia's Finance Sector Union, which represents workers in the banking industry, called BS on the bank's claims and engaged CBA in a workplace relations tribunal. Now, it appears that the bank has admitted it made a grievous mistake, telling Bloomberg that its initial assessment that the customer service reps were no longer needed “did not adequately consider all relevant business considerations and this error meant the roles were not redundant.” FSU put out a statement on Thursday, sharing details about the situation. “CBA last month announced the jobs would be made redundant due to the introduction of a new AI-powered ‘voice bot', which they claimed had led to a reduction in call volumes. “Call volumes were in fact increasing and CBA was scrambling to manage the situation by offering staff overtime and directing Team Leaders to answer calls.” Ultimately, AI is still an experimental technology, and its results are hit or miss. A much-publicized MIT study recently claimed that 95 percent of AI pilot programs at companies have, so far, been failures. With numbers like that, companies would be wise to keep their headcount high for the time being. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>James Zou used virtual AI ‘scientists' to find novel covid-19 treatments. Now, he's having AI review and present all of the research at a controversial new conference. In October, a new academic conference will debut that's unlike any other. Agents4Science is a one-day online event that will encompass all areas of science, from physics to medicine. Artificial intelligence has already provided many useful tools for scientists, like DeepMind's AlphaFold, which helps simulate proteins that are difficult to make physically. More recently, though, progress in large language models and reasoning-enabled AI has advanced the idea that AI can work more or less as autonomously as scientists themselves—proposing hypotheses, running simulations, and designing experiments on their own. Among other issues, many feel AI is not capable of the creative thought needed in research, makes too many mistakes and hallucinations, and may limit opportunities for young researchers. The US government's AI Action Plan describes the need to “invest in automated cloud-enabled labs for a range of scientific fields.” Some researchers think AI scientists could unlock scientific discoveries that humans could never find alone. For Zou, the proposition is simple: “AI agents are not limited in time. Last month, Zou published an article in Nature with results obtained from his own group of autonomous AI workers. Spurred on by his success, he now wants to see what other AI scientists (that is, scientists that are AI) can accomplish. Large language models, he believes, are better than people at deciphering and translating between subject-specific jargon. This idea inspired Zou to dream up what he calls the “Virtual Lab.” At a high level, the Virtual Lab would be a team of AI agents designed to mimic an actual university lab group. These agents would have various fields of expertise and could interact with different programs, like AlphaFold. Researchers could give one or more of these agents an agenda to work on, then open up the model to play back how the agents communicated to each other and determine which experiments people should pursue in a real-world trial. The next big thing is AI tools that can do more complex tasks. Zou needed a (human) collaborator to help put this idea into action and tackle an actual research problem. Last year, he met John E. Pak, a research scientist at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. Pak, who shares Zou's interest in using AI for science, agreed to make the Virtual Lab with him. Pak would help set the topic, but both he and Zou wanted to see what approaches the Virtual Lab could come up with on its own. As a first project, they decided to focus on designing therapies for new covid-19 strains. With this goal in mind, Zou set off training five AI scientists (including ones trained to act like an immunologist, a computational biologist, and a principal investigator) with different objectives and programs at their disposal. Building these models took a few months, but Pak says they were very quick at designing candidates for therapies once the setup was complete: “I think it was a day or half a day, something like that.” Zou says the agents decided to study anti-covid nanobodies, a cousin of antibodies that are much smaller in size and less common in the wild. Nature accepted the article and fast-tracked it for publication preview—Zou knew leveraging AI agents for science was a hot area, and he wanted to be one of the first to test it. When he was submitting his paper, Zou was dismayed to see that he couldn't properly credit AI for its role in the research. Most conferences and journals don't allow AI to be listed as coauthors on papers, and many explicitly prohibit researchers from using AI to write papers or reviews. Other bots then will attempt to evaluate the work and determine its scientific merits. But people won't be left out of the loop entirely: A team of human experts, including a Nobel laureate in economics, will review the top papers. Zou isn't sure what will come of the conference, but he hopes there will be some gems among the hundreds of submissions he expects to receive across all domains. “There could be AI submissions that make interesting discoveries,” he says. “There could also be AI submissions that have a lot of interesting mistakes.” And what happens if a leap of insight comes onto the reviewer's desk?” She doubts the conference will be able to give satisfying answers. Last year, Messeri and her collaborator Molly Crockett investigated obstacles to using AI for science in another Nature article. They remain unconvinced of its ability to produce novel results, including those shared in Zou's nanobodies paper. “I'm the kind of scientist who is the target audience for these kinds of tools because I'm not a computer scientist … but I am doing computationally oriented work,” says Crockett, a cognitive scientist at Princeton University. “But I am at the same time very skeptical of the broader claims, especially with regard to how [AI scientists] might be able to simulate certain aspects of human thinking.” Instead, they advocate for involving experts from a wider range of disciplines to design more thoughtful experiments before trusting AI to perform and review science. “We need to be talking to epistemologists, philosophers of science, anthropologists of science, scholars who are thinking really hard about what knowledge is,” says Crockett. When it comes to AI-generated science, he says, “there's a lot of hype and a lot of anecdotes, but there's really no systematic data.” Whether Agents4Science can provide that kind of data is an open question, but in October, the bots will at least try to show the world what they've got.
